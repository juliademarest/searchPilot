BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 I don\u2019t have my watch.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Take it on faith.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re on \u2013 as always, on the same time.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 On the same time, always.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So Vivian, Foreign Minister, it\u2019s wonderful to have you here at the State Department.\u00a0 We have actually worked closely together since the last time I was in government, and I value the conversations we\u2019ve had over many years.\u00a0 And one of the things that I can say very clearly is that every time I have an opportunity to spend time with the foreign minister I learn something, and I am grateful for that.\nSingapore is for the United States a true partner.\u00a0 And having the opportunity today to discuss so many issues that bring us together regionally \u2013 bilaterally in the first instance, regionally, but also globally was very, very beneficial.\u00a0 But if I could, Vivian, let me just begin with a few words about my upcoming visit to the People\u2019s Republic of China since we\u2019re leaving tonight on that trip.\nWe look forward to having a series of meetings with senior officials in Beijing, building on the engagements that we\u2019ve had with the PRC since President Biden and President Xi met in Bali late last year.\u00a0 And to summarize it, the trip has three objectives.\u00a0 First, to establish open and empowered communications so that our two countries responsibly manage our relationship, including by discussing challenges, by addressing misperceptions, and avoiding miscalculations.\nSecond, to advance U.S. interests and values and those we share with allies and partners around the world, including speaking directly and candidly about our very real concerns on a range of issues.\u00a0 And third, to explore the potential for cooperation on transnational challenges \u2013 global economic stability, illicit synthetic drugs, climate, global health \u2013 where our countries\u2019 interests intersect and the rest of the world expects us to cooperate.\nIntense competition requires sustained diplomacy to ensure that competition does not veer into confrontation or conflict.\u00a0 And again, that is what the world expects of both the United States and China.\nNow, our friends in Singapore and Southeast Asia more broadly are essential to realizing what is a shared vision for a free and open, a prosperous, a secure, connected, a resilient Indo-Pacific, where people, where goods, where ideas can travel freely, where rules are applied fairly and transparently.\u00a0 And indeed, for six decades now the Strategic Partnership between the United States and Singapore, rooted in respect for the rules-based international order, has helped strengthen peace and stability in the region and around the world.\nI reaffirmed to the foreign minister that ASEAN is at the heart of our Indo-Pacific Strategy.\u00a0 The United States supports ASEAN\u2019s centrality, and we see a considerable convergence between our own Indo-Pacific Strategy and ASEAN\u2019s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, epitomized by a shared belief in inclusive economic growth, transparency, and the rule of law.\u00a0 Vivian and I discussed Russian and the ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 Singapore has consistently stood up in enacting sanctions that are taking a toll on Russia\u2019s war machine.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to support Ukraine as we work toward a just and lasting peace, one based on the principles that I laid out recently in Helsinki.\nRespect for human rights and self-determination are also being challenged in Burma, where the military\u2019s coup and the brutal crackdown continues to harm civilians, to deprive them of their right to choose their own path, and threatens regional stability.\u00a0 We appreciate Singapore and ASEAN\u2019s critical role in seeking a peaceful solution.\u00a0 The United States will continue to impose strong sanctions against those perpetrating atrocities.\u00a0 We welcome Singapore\u2019s partnership in maintaining the necessary economic pressure.\nOur two countries are also seizing new opportunities to work together from space and cyber to supply chain resiliency to clean energy.\u00a0 We spent some time talking about that.\u00a0 As part of the Green Shipping Challenge launched at COP27 last year, Singapore recently announced an MOU with the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to upgrade digital infrastructure and to reduce emissions.\u00a0 We\u2019re partnering to advance our clean energy across ASEAN, including the ASEAN power grid, which will facilitate renewable energy development and deployment throughout the region and help Singapore transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.\u00a0 And as part of our expanded U.S.-Singapore climate change partnership, we\u2019re announcing today new and enhanced areas of cooperation from reducing deforestation to encouraging energy-efficient buildings.\nAll this collaboration is rooted in one of our strongest bilateral relationships in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 American companies \u2013 we talked about this as well \u2013 are the largest source of foreign direct investment in Singapore.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to grow our economies even faster and even fairer through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, of which Singapore was an early and enthusiastic supporter.\u00a0 Singapore is also a critical security partner, hosting American ships and aircraft, sending pilots to train in the skies above Arizona and Idaho.\nAnd for evidence of our robust people-to-people ties, one need look only for example at Singapore\u2019s cabinet, where over half the ministers, including Prime Minister Lee, have studied in the United States.\u00a0 President Yacob is also a distinguished alum of the State Department\u2019s International Visitors Leadership Program, proving that we have a pretty good eye for talent. (Laughter.)\u00a0 Recently, the Prime Minister urged the people of Singapore, and I quote, \u201cTo think boldly, to aim high, to seek far.\u201d\u00a0 Those are wise and powerful words, and I look forward to that spirit continuing to guide the close partnership between Singapore and the United States.\nVivian.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Tony.\u00a0 It\u2019s always special to meet you here.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve been meeting regularly for about seven years, including in different incarnations.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s right.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0But \u2013 and so I will confess to being biased, but I think the United States is very blessed to have the ultimate, consummate diplomat in you, and more so at these very testing, trying, and challenging times.\u00a0 So it\u2019s an honor to be here, and thank you for the opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues just now.\nWe first reaffirmed the excellent, longstanding, close, stable relationship between the United States and Singapore, and I should add our shared commitment to a rules-based international order, and the fact that it was the United States seven, eight decades ago which in fact envisioned, underwrote, and supported this rules-based international order. \u00a0And even now as we go through challenging times, I think we need to reaffirm the importance of such a system.\nWe also covered a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues.\u00a0 I think on the bilateral front everyone knows that we\u2019ve got a very robust, economic relationship.\u00a0 And of course, we are in that special category which is defined as a major security cooperation partner of the United States.\u00a0 But we haven\u2019t stood still.\u00a0 We\u2019re also expanding into new frontiers.\u00a0 You\u2019ve just mentioned the updated United States-Singapore Climate Partnership, and this will focus on collaboration in five areas, including regional energy transition in Southeast Asia and also low and zero emission solutions.\u00a0 So watch this space.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot happening.\nWe are also working in other areas like cybersecurity, all the more pertinent now with the challenges that we are facing.\u00a0 And also we \u2013 we also signed the Artemis Accords last year, so that\u2019s another whole new frontier for collaboration.\nI mentioned just now that in fact for 33 years we\u2019ve had the Memorandum of Understanding regarding the United States use of our facilities, both naval and aviation.\u00a0 Again, that has been a symbol of our belief that the United States strategic presence and contribution to our part of the world has provided stability, has provided opportunity, and helped to underwrite the peace which we should never take for granted.\nSingapore is home today to over 5,700 United States companies, and I also made the point that the United States investments in Singapore exceed what the United States has invested in Japan, China, and ROK combined.\u00a0 If you consider how small Singapore is, that statistic becomes all the more remarkable.\nOn the other side of that same equation, Singapore\u2019s investments into the United States and U.S. exports to Singapore in fact support more than 2,000 \u2013 250,000 jobs in America itself.\u00a0 So I know it\u2019s not just about trade for its own sake but also in terms of jobs and opportunities for people on both sides.\nI also wanted to commend the very active regional engagement under President Biden\u2019s administration and with your shepherding the efforts in our part of the world.\u00a0 The fact that President Biden attended the ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh last year and the President also hosted the ASEAN-U.S. Special Summit in Washington in May last year, that sent a very strong signal of engagement.\u00a0 And we also elevated the ASEAN-U.S. relations to a comprehensive Strategic Partnership last year; and it\u2019s not just a formal words but the real substance, the real deal.\nWe also look forward to working with you \u2013 and you mentioned it just now \u2013 to align the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And we hope that there will be further discussions, hopefully when the President and you can visit our part of the world for the ASEAN meetings, the EAS Summit, the ASEAN-U.S. Summit as well, either here or in our part of the world in the near future.\nSo I think the point is we do want to reaffirm the importance, the critical importance, of the U.S. anchoring your strategic engagement in our part of the world.\u00a0 And I made the point that there is in fact a deep reservoir of goodwill and trust, and you have many partners in the Asia Pacific.\u00a0 Maybe others may not be as explicit as we are in saying how welcome you are, but I give you the assurance that everyone wants to see you engaged in our part of the world.\nThe IPEF, which we also discussed, is another strong reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to the economic agenda in Southeast Asia and \u2013 no, in fact the Asia Pacific.\u00a0 We welcome the substantial conclusion of the negotiations on the second pillar of the IPEF, and this focuses on supply chains.\u00a0 And we hope that the remaining pillars of the IPEF will include meaningful provisions that will lead to concrete benefits and even greater regional integration.\nFinally, I know you\u2019ve got a big visit coming up; I believe you\u2019re leaving tonight.\u00a0 And I wanted to say that we commend your efforts.\u00a0 This is a very important and critical moment, not just for the United States and China but, indeed, the rest of the world will be watching.\u00a0 So we hope and believe that you will be able to manage the differences, but more important, establish open channels of communication, build mutual trust and understanding, and I wish you smooth sailing and a successful visit ahead.\nSo thank you again for hosting me.\u00a0 Thank you for this chance to, as always, have very open, candid, sincere discussions, and I wish you all the very best.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First one goes to Simon Lewis with Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, to the foreign minister, Dr. Balakrishnan, the Secretary mentioned that Myanmar came up in your discussions.\u00a0 I wondered if I could ask you for Singapore\u2019s position on an initiative by the caretaker government in Thailand to re-engage with Myanmar\u2019s military junta and reportedly inviting the junta back into ASEAN meetings.\u00a0 Is that something that Singapore would support?\u00a0 And I\u2019d also be interested in your response to the recent report by the UN special rapporteur on Myanmar, on human rights in Myanmar, who identified $254 million worth of goods that have come through Singaporean entities to the Myanmar military.\u00a0 So interested in your response to that.\nAnd for the Secretary, I would also be interested in your view on whether ASEAN nations, including Singapore \u2013 also Thailand \u2013 should be doing more to stop the violence in Myanmar.\u00a0 And then specifically on Thailand, I wondered if we could get your view on efforts to form a new government there.\u00a0 Are you concerned about the Thai military trying to cling onto power despite the clear \u2013 pretty clear results of the election?\nAnd just an additional one because it\u2019s breaking news.\u00a0 President Putin has said that tactical nuclear weapons have been deployed to Belarus.\u00a0 Secretary, what\u2019s the U.S. response to that, and are there consequences for Russia and Belarus?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 Well, thank you.\u00a0 I think I counted at least three questions.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Let me get back to first principles.\u00a0 We condemn the coup in Myanmar and the ongoing violence against civilians, the instability in the country, the setback to national reconciliation, and the enormous impact on the economy.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it\u2019s now more than two years.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t seen any signs of improvement.\u00a0 From an ASEAN perspective, we have the Five-Point Consensus, and we haven\u2019t seen any significant progress in fulfilling the Five-Point Consensus.\nSo we believe it would be premature to re-engage with the junta at a summit level or even at a foreign minister level and, in fact, our leaders at the recent ASEAN summit reaffirmed this position.\u00a0 Having said that, the ASEAN chair, Indonesia, is engaging across a wide spectrum of stakeholders, and the key point is this.\u00a0 You do need everyone ultimately to sit down and negotiate.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how long it will take.\u00a0 The last time, it took 25 years for some form of democratic transition to occur in Myanmar; I hope it won\u2019t take that long.\nBut it\u2019s very important for the rest of us, whilst we are in favor of reconciliation, we\u2019re in favor of more dialogue, we obviously want to make sure that the level of violence goes down.\u00a0 And certainly from Singapore\u2019s perspective, our policy is that we should all do our best to make sure arms, or even dual-use items which can be used to inflict harm and injury on civilians, should be proscribed.\nI noted Tom Andrews\u2019 report, and one line in it is worth quoting.\u00a0 And he said that, \u201cThere are no indications that the Government of Singapore has approved, or is involved in, the shipment of arms and associated materials to the Myanmar military,\u201d unquote.\u00a0 But more important, we\u2019re also engaging Tom Andrews, because any specific information which he has access to and which we can use for investigations or, if need be, to prosecute companies or entities which are breaching our laws and our policies and arms and dual use \u2013 rest assured, we will get to the bottom of it.\nBut the bigger question is when will peace come back \u2013 Tony, I\u2019m afraid I remain pessimistic.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 You can sign my name onto every word of what the foreign minister just said, including, unfortunately, the pessimism that he expressed at the end, which we share.\u00a0 But everything that the minister said I ascribe to as well.\u00a0 We are very focused in supporting ASEAN efforts to move forward toward a resolution that ends the violence, that frees people in jail, that puts Burma back on a democratic path.\u00a0 The Five-Point Consensus that the junta signed onto has not been, to say \u2013 to state the obvious, advanced, much less met.\nAnd it\u2019s very important that we continue, all of us, to sustain the appropriate pressure on the junta and look for ways, of course, to engage the opposition in Burma and find every possible avenue to advance Burma\u2019s return to their democratic path, to an end to the violence, the freedom of people who\u2019ve been unjustly imprisoned.\u00a0 And in all of these efforts, we are working \u2013 the United States and Singapore \u2013 very closely together, both through ASEAN but also on a bilateral basis.\nWith regard to Thailand, I\u2019d simply say that our full expectation is that the government will be formed pursuant to the laws of Thailand.\u00a0 That is our expectation.\u00a0 That\u2019s the expectation of people in Thailand as well.\nWith regard to the reports about Belarus, we\u2019ve seen comments that were made in the last few hours.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation very closely and very carefully.\u00a0 We have no reason to adjust our own nuclear posture.\u00a0 We don\u2019t see any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 The President said again this week that we remain committed to the defense of NATO \u2013 every inch of its territory \u2013 so that is our north star and we\u2019re very focused on that.\nI would just note that one of President Putin\u2019s claims for starting his brutal invasion of Ukraine \u2013 one of the many rationales he gave at various points \u2013 was, ostensibly, to prevent the threat of Ukraine reacquiring the nuclear weapons that it gave up when the Soviet Union dissolved and Ukraine voluntarily gave up the weapons it inherited, along with Belarus and Kazakhstan.\u00a0 So it would be rather ironic, among many other things, for President Putin to now be talking about putting nuclear weapons on the territory of a neighboring state \u2013 again, including a state that gave up the nuclear weapons that it inherited when the Soviet Union dissolved.\nAnd as for Belarus itself, this is just another example of Lukashenka making irresponsible, provocative choices to cede control of Belarus\u2019s sovereignty against the will of the Belarusian people.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Next question goes to Nirmal Ghosh with\u00a0The Straits Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Minister, you have spoken about the new frontiers in the relationship with the United States.\u00a0 Could you elaborate a bit on that?\u00a0 You mentioned the climate partnership, cyber security, and so forth \u2013 a few more specifics, if you could share.\nAnd secondly, as has been mentioned, a lot of the world is watching the Secretary\u2019s forthcoming visit to China.\u00a0 I wonder if you could give us a Singapore and/or Southeast Asian view of U.S.-China relations.\u00a0 And Mr. Secretary, if you could also speak to that latter part about\u00a0\u2013 again, about ASEAN centrality and how it all fits into the Indo-Pacific Strategy with China.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 Well, thank you, Nirmal.\u00a0 I used to be the minister of environment before this incarnation, so I was heavily involved with the final negotiations for the Paris Agreement.\u00a0 One observation which I will make is that we would not have arrived at the agreement in Paris if it hadn\u2019t been for the confluence of strategic and environmental interests of the United States and China, and I can tell you that from direct experience.\u00a0 And in a\u00a0sense, that\u2019s why tonight\u2019s trip is so important, because there are many global, planetary issues\u00a0\u2013 climate, pandemics, even cyber security \u2013 which require the United States and China to work off the same page and be key pillars for a global system which will help increase resilience to threats to welfare, health, and prosperity for people all over the world.\nSo you go with our full support.\u00a0 But having said that, speaking now, as a diplomat, I want to make this plea:\u00a0 Please don\u2019t put too much weight on poor Tony\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The fact is diplomats need time and space and sometimes just some quiet time to engage in some honest-to-goodness conversations without having to put out a tweet every hour or two.\u00a0 The trip is essential, but not sufficient.\u00a0 There are fundamental differences in outlook, in values.\u00a0 And it takes time for mutual respect and strategic trust to be built in.\u00a0 So it\u2019s important, but I\u2019m also making clear I hope people don\u2019t have excessive expectations on that front.\nOn your question about the new frontiers, I already mentioned the climate partnership.\u00a0 And there are five focal areas under that partnership, which include the regional energy transition; second, low- and zero-emission technologies and solutions, the \u2013 nature-based solutions and carbon markets; and fifth, urban decarbonization, resilience, and capacity-building.\u00a0 And even in all these areas, you can see that there\u2019s obvious opportunities for synergy and cooperation between the United States and Singapore, not just for our own sake but in our region as well.\u00a0 I mentioned the Artemis Accords, so outer space is certainly another frontier.\u00a0 And of course we\u2019ve been working very closely, especially in the last couple of years, on cyber security, because that is a clear and present frontier where there\u2019s both risk and opportunity.\u00a0 So watch this space.\u00a0 Tony?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m, as always, tempted to say, \u201cWhat he said,\u201d \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 because once again, I think the foreign minister has captured it very, very well on all fronts.\u00a0 Look, with regard to ASEAN, I simply want to note and emphasize something I noted before.\u00a0 If you look at our own Indo-Pacific Strategy, and you then look at the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, the coincidence of these approaches, these strategies, these visions is very, very strong, very, very high.\nAnd that speaks to why we do put a premium on ASEAN centrality and why, as Vivian pointed out, starting with President Biden, we have had significant engagement, re-engagement with ASEAN over the last two and a half years.\u00a0 Economic growth \u2013 inclusive economic growth \u2013 transparency, the rule of law, but also work on discrete issues and areas that have a real impact on the lives of people in the region as well as in the United States, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s global health.\u00a0 All of these are front and center in what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 And one of the things that we talked about today is \u2013 we just spent some time talking about Burma.\u00a0 And of course that tends, in ASEAN meetings and U.S.-ASEAN engagement, maybe that tends to get the headlines, and it\u2019s hugely important.\nBut if you look at the agenda that we\u2019re actually pursuing, both at the meetings that we have and then day-in, day-out, it\u2019s a very broad universe of issues, of subjects, all of which really go to the needs, the aspirations, the hopes of people in the ASEAN region and in the United States.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Next question \u2014\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0So watch what we do, not just what we say, and you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s a full range of activities for the United States and its engagement with ASEAN.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Next question goes to Jennifer Hansler with CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, on Iran, how would you characterize the ongoing indirect talks with Tehran? \u00a0Would you say that you\u2019re optimistic that an understanding can be reached between the two sides on constraining Iran\u2019s growing nuclear program?\u00a0 And then the Omani foreign minister said earlier this week that he believes the two sides are close on a deal for the detainees.\u00a0 Do you agree with that characterization?\nAnd then moving on to the China detainee issue, are you committed to raising the case of Kai Li, Mark Swidan, and David Lin in your meetings in Beijing?\u00a0 And more broadly, to both you, Mr.\u00a0Secretary and Mr. Foreign Minister, are you optimistic \u2013 given what you said about this not being sufficient, are you optimistic that this will lead the way to continued meetings, continued dialogues between the U.S. and China, including on the military-to-military front?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Great.\u00a0 Thanks, Jennifer.\u00a0 With regard to Iran, some of the reports that we\u2019ve seen about an agreement on nuclear matters or, for that matter, on detainees are simply not accurate and not true.\nOn the nuclear side of the equation, we are determined to ensure that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 We remain convinced that the best way to do that is through diplomacy.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t taken any option off the table.\u00a0 You\u2019ve heard that clearly from the President.\u00a0 But we continue to believe that diplomacy would be the most effective path forward, but there is no agreement, and reports to the contrary or simply inaccurate.\nWhen it comes to our detained citizens in Iran, nothing would please me more than to be able to say that we have an agreement that secures their release.\u00a0 But that, too, would not be accurate.\u00a0 It\u2019s something we continue to work on intensely on a regular basis, and that\u2019s separate and apart from any conversations we have on nuclear matters.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not in a position to say that we have an agreement.\nWith regard to the visit, two things.\u00a0 One, yes, I will be raising the detainees.\u00a0 This has been an ongoing conversation with the PRC and something that, for me, is always at the top of my list \u2013 that is, looking out for the security and well-being of Americans around the world, including those who are being detained in one way or another, including arbitrarily.\nMore broadly, what we\u2019re working to do on this trip is to really carry forward what President Biden and President Xi agreed to in Bali at the end of last year, which was to establish sustained, regular lines of communication at senior levels across our governments precisely so that we can make sure that we are communicating as clearly as possible to avoid, as best possible, misunderstandings and miscommunications.\u00a0 Because if we want to make sure, as we do, that the competition that we have with China doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, the place you start is with communicating.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ll see what comes from this visit, but this is directly in response to what the two presidents agreed in Bali last November.\nAnd as to what comes next, let\u2019s see how the visit goes.\u00a0 I think Vivian said it very well.\u00a0 This is an important but, in a sense, insufficient step because there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u00a0 I\u2019d note as well that even as we\u2019re trying to make sure, through better communications, that the competition doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, we\u2019re also looking at areas where we might cooperate in the interests of the American people, in the interests of China and its people, but also in the interests of people around the world.\u00a0 One of the clear demand signals that that we get, including from our close friends and partners, is that both the United States and the PRC will responsibly manage this relationship and look for areas where our cooperation might produce results that benefit not only our own people but people around the world, including in the region.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll be looking at that as well.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, the only thing I can add there is perhaps a perspective from Southeast Asia.\u00a0 First, if you look 100 years down the road, we see both China and the United States being a clear presence for the century and beyond.\u00a0 Second, we see the United States remaining a Pacific partner and power and stakeholder.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want you to go away.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And we\u2019re not.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0Good.\u00a0 Third, if you look at the challenges confronting the world right now \u2013 and we\u2019ve enumerated climate, pandemics, cyber, opportunities in outer space \u2013 now more than ever, we will need \u2013 even as the world transits into a multipolar world, now more than ever, we need a rules-based multilateral system with institutions and processes fit for purpose, updated where necessary.\u00a0 And again, this requires the United States and China to achieve a modus vivendi.\nSo this trip is important, it\u2019s essential, but it doesn\u2019t stop there.\u00a0 And I think Tony knows the views of all of us in Southeast Asia: the more you travel and engage, the better.\u00a0 And as I said, I am biased because I \u2013 he\u2019s a friend, and I can think of no better diplomat at this point in time, in his cool, rational, emollient way, to deal with some very fundamental differences.\u00a0 Because the two societies \u2013 and here we speak from experience.\u00a0 China and the U.S. are not going to converge and become one identical entity.\u00a0 And the challenge for all of us, both mentally, emotionally, and diplomatically, is to hold sometimes contrarian thoughts in one mind.\nAnd this is the challenge of the century.\u00a0 Fifty years ago when Henry Kissinger went to Beijing, it completely reordered the strategic furniture in the globe.\u00a0 We are coming close to a point when this will be necessary again.\u00a0 So we all watch with interest and concern and some optimism \u2013 because as diplomats we all have to be optimistic, otherwise you will not keep trying.\u00a0 So let\u2019s support these efforts and let\u2019s see where you \u2013 where you\u2019ll take it.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0For the final question, Benji Hyer with Feature Story News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you both.\u00a0 Here on behalf of Channel NewsAsia today, CNA.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard Washington and Singapore\u2019s position on U.S.-China relations.\u00a0 I wanted to ask your perspective on ties between Russia and China.\u00a0 How much is the \u2013 what they call the friendship with no limits between Moscow and Beijing a concern for the U.S. Secretary of State and foreign minister for the Indo-Pacific and ASEAN?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ve heard us speak to this on a number of occasions in recent months, and it entirely depends on the practical manifestations of that partnership or that friendship.\u00a0 I\u2019ll let China and Russia address how they view their partnership, but we\u2019ve been very clear, for example, about the importance of countries not providing Russia with the kind of assistance that it can use to advance its aggression in Ukraine.\nEqually we\u2019ve been open and welcoming of efforts, initiatives of countries \u2013 including, for example, China \u2013 to try to play a positive role in diplomacy that can advance a just and durable peace in Ukraine.\u00a0 As it happens right now, there are, I think, representatives from six or seven African countries who are in Ukraine also trying to advance that proposition.\u00a0 I would note the terrible irony of the fact that while they\u2019re in Kyiv, more missiles from Russian rain down on the Ukrainian capital, but I\u2019ll leave that to others to underscore that particular irony.\nBut as with \u2013 again, as with many countries, we want to ensure that no one is adding fuel to this fire Russia is making.\u00a0 And if countries by the same token can play a positive, productive role, including China, in trying to find a path to a just and durable peace, that\u2019s something we welcome as well.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 Well, Singapore is a tiny city-state.\u00a0 We\u2019ve only been independent for almost 58 years, so I hope you understand from our perspective the UN Charter, international law, and the precepts of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity are sacrosanct for us.\u00a0 We have no other alternative.\u00a0 And therefore, for us this invasion is something which we had to take a stand on, and we have.\u00a0 And we \u2013 that\u2019s expressed in our votes in the General Assembly and also in some specific sanctions that we have taken against Russia.\u00a0 And I \u2013 it\u2019s something which we don\u2019t do routinely or lightly, but it\u2019s an expression of how strongly we feel on this matter.\nI can\u2019t speak for China, but I would say that at least in their interactions with us \u2013 and also in their public statements \u2013 China also has affirmed the importance of territorial integrity, independence, and sovereignty.\u00a0 And like Tony, I also hope that their efforts will bear fruit.\u00a0 And we really have to pray for peace because we know that at the end of the day you will end up at the negotiating table.\u00a0 But right now, blood is being shed and lives are being lost for perhaps marginal leverage on the negotiating table.\u00a0 And as humanitarians, all of us must feel the pain and the tragedy of this situation.\u00a0 And I think we all want peace.\u00a0 When it\u2019ll be achieved, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But we all want peace.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\n\n",

Trafficking in Persons here at the Department of State.\u00a0 And I have the honor of kicking off today\u2019s ceremony.\u00a0 Thank you all so much for joining us.\nI know it has been a few years since we could gather such a crowd in person for this ceremony, and it is such a pleasure to see so many friends and colleagues.\u00a0 I\u2019m especially excited that three of my predecessors are here, Ambassadors Luis CdeBaca, Susan Coppedge, and John Richmond.\nToday\u2019s program will consist of the following.\u00a0 First, Secretary Blinken will offer remarks on this year\u2019s report.\u00a0 Then we will honor eight outstanding Trafficking In Persons Report Heroes for their extraordinary dedication to combatting human trafficking.\u00a0 We will also hear briefly from one of the heroes who will speak on behalf of this year\u2019s honorees.\u00a0 Finally, I will offer my own closing remarks.\u00a0 After the ceremony, we hope you will find some time to visit state.gov to access this year\u2019s report online.\nWe are so grateful to you, Secretary Blinken, for joining us today to release the 2023 Trafficking in Persons Report.\u00a0 Thank you for your continuous work elevating the issue of human trafficking in your meetings around the world and here at home, as well as chairing the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.\u00a0 We are proud to serve under your leadership as we all work together to advance efforts to combat human trafficking.\nLadies and gentlemen, the Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 And just to reiterate what Cindy said, it is so wonderful to see you all here at the State Department.\nToday, the State Department is releasing the 2023 Trafficking in Persons Report.\u00a0 This report provides a comprehensive, objective assessment of 188 countries and territories \u2013 including the United States.\u00a0 Its purpose is to showcase successful efforts to prevent trafficking, to identify areas where countries are falling short and have more work to do, and ultimately \u2013 ultimately \u2013 to eliminate trafficking altogether.\nThe United States is committed to combatting human trafficking because it represents an attack on human rights and freedoms.\u00a0 It violates the universal right of every person to have autonomy over their own life and actions.\u00a0 Today, more than 27 million people around the world are denied that right.\nTrafficking harms our societies: weakening the rule of law, corrupting supply chains, exploiting workers, fueling violence.\u00a0 And it disproportionately impacts traditionally marginalized groups: women, LGBTQI+ individuals, persons with disabilities, ethnic and religious minorities.\nIn his first year in office, President Biden released an updated National Action Plan to ensure that our policy response is keeping pace with what is an evolving challenge.\u00a0 Earlier this year, as the ambassador noted, I chaired a meeting of the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, where we reviewed steps that we\u2019ve taken to implement the plan: prohibiting the importation of goods made with forced labor; imposing financial sanctions on those that knowingly profit from that labor; integrating racial equity into our antitrafficking work; strengthening our efforts to counter online sexual exploitation and abuse of children.\nThe TIP Report is a central part of the United States Government\u2019s antitrafficking work, and it reflects the efforts of so many people in this room today \u2013 and countless others both in Washington and around the world.\nAnd that starts with the leadership of Ambassador Dyer and her team at the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, as well as colleagues that we have in our embassies around the world, whose work to interview survivors, to gather information, to conduct factchecking is at the very foundation of the report.\u00a0 Bipartisan efforts in Congress, where there is an ironclad commitment and strong partnership to end trafficking \u2013 including Representative Chris Smith, who\u2019s been a longtime champion and who\u2019s here with us today, and I thank you for your presence and thank you for your leadership over so many years.\u00a0 And members of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking and the Human Trafficking Expert Consultant Network \u2013 their insights, their ideas are indispensable to shaping and evaluating our policy and programs.\nAnd maybe most significantly, most importantly, we\u2019re grateful to the survivors whose courage, whose resilience, and whose perspectives inspire and inform all of our work.\nFinally, a very warm welcome to our eight TIP Report Heroes who are with us today \u2013 you\u2019ll hear a little bit more about them shortly \u2013 journalists, activists, prosecutors, lawmakers, each of whom shares a commitment to stopping trafficking in all of its forms.\nThis year\u2019s report shows a picture of steady progress around the world, with dozens of countries making significant strides in preventing trafficking, in protecting survivors, in prosecuting those who carry out this crime.\nIn Seychelles, the national government offered enhanced training to airport staff and police officers to better spot trafficking.\u00a0 The government also instituted new policies to screen vulnerable populations, like migrants at transit points, for trafficking indicators.\u00a0 That\u2019s helped them identify more victims than ever before and convict a record number of traffickers.\nHong Kong launched a new hotline to help trafficking victims report fraudulent overseas employment scams and to get help.\u00a0 In its first month, that hotline received hundreds of calls, leading to several investigations.\nIn Denmark, authorities led a renewed focus on \u2013 and committed additional resources to \u2013 combatting human trafficking, identifying more victims, prosecuting and convicting more traffickers.\nSo that\u2019s the good news, and these are just examples of it.\u00a0 The report also highlights a number of concerning trends.\nThe first is the continued expansion of forced labor.\u00a0 As the pandemic disrupted supply chains around the world and spiked demand in certain industries, like PPE production, exploitative employers used a host of tactics to take advantage of lower-paid and more vulnerable workers.\nThe second is the rise in labor trafficking using online scams, which have proliferated as more of the world gains access to the internet.\u00a0 The pandemic supercharged this trend.\u00a0 Traffickers capitalized on widespread unemployment to recruit victims with fake job listings and then forced them to run international scams.\nThird, the report exposes the risks facing an often-overlooked segment of trafficking victims: boys and young men.\u00a0 According to a recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2004 and 2020 the percentage of boys identified as victims of human trafficking rose five-fold.\nNow for years, there\u2019s been a widely held \u2013 but incorrect \u2013 belief that trafficking affects exclusively female victims.\u00a0 This false perception has had some, quite frankly, devastating and tangible consequences, with far few support services typically allocated to male victims of trafficking.\nThe reality is that any person, regardless of sex, regardless of gender identity, can be targeted by human traffickers.\u00a0 And so governments, civil society, the private sector \u2013 all of us have to develop resources for all populations, including male victims.\nWhen President Biden released his National Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, he said, and I quote, \u201cWe can accomplish far more working in partnership than we [can] working alone.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s true for the work between governments, between the federal and local officials, and with and between civil society and the private sector.\nWe see that in North Macedonia, where the government partnered with social workers, with NGO staff, with psychologists, with law enforcement to launch mobile teams that identify the majority of trafficking victims in the country.\u00a0 This program has been so effective that several other countries in the Balkans either plan to, or already have, implemented the very same model.\nWe see it in the work of the Issara Institute.\u00a0 That\u2019s an NGO that\u2019s worked hand-in-hand with private sector to help hundreds of thousands of workers learn about their rights and seek remediation when labor abuses occur.\nWe see it in Argentina, where leaders from the federal government regularly meet with representatives from across the country\u2019s 24 jurisdictions, to coordinate their efforts and raise one another\u2019s ambition, including by committing to offer long-term housing to survivors of trafficking.\nFor an issue that\u2019s as complex and as constantly evolving as this one, we simply need all hands on deck.\u00a0 We need law enforcement working to prosecute traffickers.\u00a0 We need social workers providing trauma-informed care to the victims.\u00a0 We need advocates holding governments accountable.\u00a0 We need communities coming together to support the survivors.\u00a0 In many ways, this room reflects that need and reflects that community.\nWe are so grateful to you for the partnership that you\u2019ve shown, sharing expertise, sharing ideas, building and strengthening networks with us.\u00a0 And what I want to share with you today is simply this: the United States is committed to standing with you, and once and for all, ending human trafficking.\nThank you all very much.\u00a0\u00a0 Cindy, back to you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR DYER:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, for those inspiring words.\u00a0 I am now delighted to turn our attention to celebrating the 2023 TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Please join me as we recognize and honor this year\u2019s eight TIP Report Heroes:\nFirst, Pureza Lopes Loyola from\u00a0Brazil \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of her unwavering advocacy on behalf of herself, her son, and others who have experienced forced labor, including through firsthand documentation of evidence and testimony to illustrate the severity and proliferation of exploitative conditions in rural Brazil, which spurred a national movement and prompted the Brazilian Government to establish mobile labor inspection units to increase identification of victims.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd second, Mech Dara from Cambodia in recognition \u2013 (applause) \u2013 of his courageous reporting on human trafficking for the purpose of forced criminality in Cambodia, which led to greater public awareness of and improvement in the Cambodian Government\u2019s anti-trafficking response.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMrs. Iman Al-Sailawi and Mr. Basim Abdulrazzaq Jebur from Iraq \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of their leadership and innovation in establishing FATE, Iraq\u2019s first NGO dedicated to ending human trafficking, which has helped release and support hundreds of individuals, including children and foreign nationals, from dangerous work conditions, forced labor, and sexual exploitation.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEvon Benson-Idahosa from Nigeria \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of her continued commitment to empower and elevate the voices of survivors of sex trafficking through her organization\u2019s transformative programs that address root causes of human trafficking, and her advocacy work with various levels of the Nigerian Government to improve anti-trafficking policy and legislation. (Applause.)\nZaheer Ahmed from Pakistan \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of his pivotal leadership in the application and modernization of anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling laws in Pakistan, the formulation and implementation of a national action plan to combat these crimes, and the improvement of coordination and cooperation efforts between law enforcement and civil society organizations.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPaola Hittscher from Peru \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of her powerful use of innovative partnerships with the Peruvian navy, national police, and civil society to advance the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking cases in the Loreto region of Peru despite a challenging environment of limited funding, security concerns, and limited state presence.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEumelis Moya Goitte from Venezuela \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of her courageous work to investigate and document human trafficking crimes affecting marginalized indigenous communities that are hard to reach and frequently living under the control of illegal armed groups, drawing international attention to human trafficking crimes in Venezuela\u2019s mining sector, and providing support for international recommendations to prevent human trafficking of vulnerable populations.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you.\u00a0 And now we will hear from one of the 2023 TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Please join me in welcoming R. Evon Benson-Idahosa from Nigeria.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS BENSON-IDAHOSA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Dyer. \u00a0I\u2019m honored to stand before you as a representative of so many who do this work of justice, of reconciliation, most without recognition but with the same tenacity and compassion that each of us being recognized today do.\nEach of these heroes \u2013 Pureza, Mech, Iman and Basim, Zaheer, Paola, and Eumelis \u2013 exemplify courage in the moment in history where more than 27 million people are victimized by the evil that is human trafficking.\u00a0 Thank you to each of you, and to all of you who fortify our arms, for leading the change.\nI also stand before you on behalf of millions of African women whose bodies have been legislated upon, weaponized, but especially on behalf of Faith, a young Nigerian woman whose last words to me in September of 2016 were, \u201cAuntie, I\u2019m dying.\u201d\u00a0 Those three words still echo in my mind and serve as the impetus for why we at Pathfinders, the NGO I founded to protect survivors and prevent the sex trafficking of Nigerian women at home and abroad, continue to do this work.\u00a0 You see, Faith was trafficked from our hometown in Benin City to Libya, and then to Europe, where she involuntarily serviced the underbelly of the European sex industry until her body was literally consumed to death.\u00a0 No one should ever be utilized as a product for consumption.\nFaith\u2019s story represents the reality of thousands of victims annually who are waiting for those of us with access and power and privilege to muster the social and economic courage to do for others what we do for ourselves.\u00a0 As visionaries who see the world as it should be, not as it is, the new face of our response requires a fundamental shift in consciousness that prioritizes reconciliation and promotes an integrated, intersectional, and interdependent methodology.\nYou see, I\u2019m not naive to ignore the geopolitical factors \u2013 the self-interest, the economic realities \u2013 that have culminated in global divides that separate developing from the developed, that use the word \u201cglobal\u201d to demarcate North from South, and both in love and in war other them and hypocritically center us.\u00a0 Nor do I profess to have all the answers to the hard, inconvenient truths that allow for the proliferation of trafficking, that destabilize governments in the pursuit of national interest, that strongarm countries into a legacy of imperialism.\nBut what I do know is that we can all bear witness to the import of human trafficking on our collective suffering and the erosion of our conscience, universal aspirations, and inherent rights and dignity.\u00a0 And so today I offer considerations that are visible in plain sight, considerations that reframe these complex narratives and underscore the reality that one\u2019s interests, rights, and dignities are best preserved when those of others are equally preserved.\u00a0 Both postures are not diametrically opposed.\nTo world leaders who have the power to disrupt trafficking, systemic failures of national and international governments that prioritize profit over people, arbitrary rules over good conscience, can no longer be countenanced.\u00a0 We cannot in good conscience foster a world where vulnerabilities are abused and \u2013 or systemically condoned and exploited.\u00a0 World leaders must consistently reach across the borders and political divides, not to embrace those for whom seats at the table have been intentionally curated, but to invite and make room for those who have consistently been missing from it.\nThose who are the most impacted by the problems that human trafficking and its related geopolitical underbelly have created \u2013 i.e. survivors and local communities \u2013 are whose voices must now be consistently centered.\u00a0 The new face of this movement must democratize and shift power, reconcile, if you will, that power back to those who are seemingly powerless so that they too can take responsibility to birth innovative solutions.\u00a0 World leaders must envisage partnerships that are laced with compassion and empathy, with the understanding that structural transformation demands a tenacious commitment to our collective long-term vision.\nTo survivors and stakeholders who work tirelessly to restore dignity to those from whom it has been violently obliterated, we must enlarge our work from speaking truth to power to also speaking truth to the seemingly powerless \u2013 our local communities.\u00a0 We must unapologetically take up our space as global leaders who, because of our lived experience and expertise, not only deserve a seat at the table but understand that we can create additional, more inclusive tables that diversify and center our voices.\nAnd finally, on a micro level \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and finally, on a micro level, we must each commit to doing the small daily actions that exemplify love \u2013 offering a cup of water to the thirsty, taking only that which you need, abandoning intellectual dishonesty that denies our own complicity in injustice, choosing kindness over indifference and the collective good over individual advancement.\u00a0 That is how we reconcile the world.\u00a0 It is how we choose a world that extols the values that we contend guard our collective conscience and, as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \u201cembody an audacious faith in the future of mankind.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0E se.\u00a0 Thank you for listening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR DYER:\u00a0 Now that\u2019s a hard act to follow.\u00a0 Next year, I\u2019m going to speak first.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you, Evon, for sharing that important message on behalf of all of this year\u2019s heroes.\u00a0 Let\u2019s give this amazing group of leaders another round of applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt is such an honor to celebrate your important work.\u00a0 We are thrilled to be partnering again with our colleagues in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to provide an International Visitors Leadership Program, an IVLP for short, for several of our TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Through the IVLP, our TIP Report Heroes will have the opportunity to meaningfully engage with Americans here in Washington, D.C., Boston, and Miami, who are also working to eliminate human trafficking and support survivors.\u00a0 So we are excited to not just honor you today, but to work together to share best practices and engage.\nToday we are releasing the 2023 Trafficking in Persons Report.\u00a0 The TIP Report is an essential tool in the world\u2019s fight against human trafficking.\u00a0 It not only serves as a central reference point for the status of anti-trafficking efforts in each country, including the United States, but it also highlights the best practices and helps disseminate them.\nThis year we chose to highlight the importance of partnerships in addressing human trafficking.\u00a0 I know firsthand the power of partnerships.\u00a0 Starting out as a local prosecutor in Dallas, Texas, I could see how our response to trafficking situations would be immensely improved if we all had relevant actors \u2013 all the relevant actors together in the same room, preferably with chips and hot sauce.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I joined Dallas County\u2019s very first interagency task force on human trafficking.\u00a0 I have carried that lesson throughout my career, partnering with NGOs to provide guidance as grassroots activists around the world worked to implement or strengthen anti-trafficking legislation in their various communities.\nOver the last 30 years, I have seen the immense benefits of elevating the voices and perspectives of survivors.\u00a0 Survivors can play an important role in shaping policies and programs to ensure that they are survivor-centered and responsive to the needs and experience of survivors.\u00a0 By partnering with survivors, we can promote anti-trafficking efforts grounded in the realities of those who have been most directly impacted by this issue.\nThe need for partnerships starts within our own governments.\u00a0 We need all our various agencies to collaborate to make our work more effective and impactful.\u00a0 This year\u2019s report highlights the progress made in one country, the Comoros, when they established a national committee to enhance interministerial coordination on anti-trafficking efforts.\u00a0 Through this interagency cooperation, they were able to identify more victims, investigate more trafficking crimes, and refer all victims to services.\nStrong partnerships between countries can also address the vulnerability of migrants, refugees, and international job seekers to human traffickers.\u00a0 We saw this in Europe when EU governments banded together to proactively protect Ukrainian refugees to prevent trafficking among them as they fled from Russia\u2019s illegal, full-scale invasion.\u00a0 And in Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines have worked together to assist trafficking victims lured by cybercrime syndicates into cyber-scam operations.\nPartnerships are also critical because they allow us to harness the diverse expertise of different organizations to tackle trafficking in novel ways.\u00a0 At its core, human trafficking is a financially motivated crime.\u00a0 This report highlights how one partnership between PayPal and Polaris in the United States interrupts traffickers\u2019 cash flows and enables parallel prosecutions for financial crimes.\u00a0 Deeper partnerships between financial institutions and law enforcement can better identify the financial trail of human traffickers, allowing law enforcement to collect more evidence to aid prosecutions and lessen the burden on survivors having to testify.\nFinance Against Slavery And Trafficking, or FAST, developed by UN University and financed by Australia, is another great partnership.\u00a0 FAST is leveraging the use of technology to provide a free e-learning training tool for Southeast Asian government officials working on financial regulation, intelligence, and investigation to understand human trafficking, how it is connected to the financial sector, and what they can do to identify and interrupt it.\nAnd we know traffickers are always looking to exploit new vulnerabilities, from conflicts to climate change to the digital world, so we need to continually be building partnerships with new stakeholders.\u00a0 New partnerships between NGOs, governments, law enforcement, survivors, and technology companies can help counter some of these new vulnerabilities.\u00a0 The OSCE and Thomson Reuters used social media and Uber for their Be Safe campaign, reaching hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees about the warning signs of human trafficking.\nAnother great partnership, the Tech Against Trafficking initiative harnesses the expertise of companies and other stakeholders to accelerate technology solutions to combat human trafficking.\u00a0 Through the Accelerator program, tech companies provide mentorship, education, and greater network access to assist anti-trafficking NGOs to pilot or scale up initiatives, such as generating synthetic data to better share and analyze case information responsibly while protecting victim privacy.\nSurvivors are some of our most important partners.\u00a0 Their lived experience can inform our programs and policies, ensuring we maintain a trauma-informed and victim-centered approach.\u00a0 More countries than ever are seeing the benefits of partnering with survivors to enhance their anti-trafficking work.\u00a0 Israel last year established an advisory committee, including two survivors, to help address forced labor issues, while Australia and Canada committed to survivor engagement in their national action plans.\nHere at home, the U.S. Government continues to pursue partnerships to advance our anti-trafficking work.\u00a0 We are enhancing intergovernmental cooperation with the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, regularly bringing together 20 agencies to review and refine our federal anti-trafficking strategies.\u00a0 We are incorporating recommendations of survivors into our policymaking and programs at the highest levels, and working further to integrate survivors into all that we do, including through the work of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking.\u00a0 We are partnering with neighboring countries to reduce the risk of migrants falling prey to human traffickers, and we are championing partnerships with technology companies and financial institutions to better prosecute traffickers, protect victims, and prevent trafficking in the first place.\nAs we close, I want to draw our attention back to the individuals.\u00a0 Behind these pages of statistics and trends and tier rankings are millions of adults and children who are in trafficking situations and depend on our collective efforts.\u00a0 We owe it to them to work together to hold perpetrators accountable, to partner with survivors, to make sure our responses are trauma-informed and victim-centered, and ultimately, to address the underlying factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking.\u00a0 The report offers many recommendations and best practices that are critical steps our government and governments around the world can take to build a world free of human trafficking.\nI\u2019m going to take a page out of a Evon\u2019s book, who quoted the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, who also once said, \u201cThe ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people, but the silence over that by the good people.\u201d\u00a0 It is so humbling and inspiring to be in a room full to the brim with good people who refuse to be silent.\nThank you so much for your steadfast service to others and for joining us today.\u00a0 Please remember to go to state.gov to check out this year\u2019s full report online.\u00a0 The cards and bookmarks you have received at today\u2019s event have a QR code you can scan to reach the website.\u00a0 Thank you for coming.\u00a0 Thank you all.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\n\n\n",

better systems have been put in place for assisting individuals through our platforms in less time, a change which will also benefit other refugee populations around the world; and a pathway for the reunification of separated families, with the creation of the famous DS-4317.\n#AfghanEvac had a hand in all of those successes and so many more, and lives have been changed as a result.\u00a0 We are grateful for your continued partnership.\u00a0 CARE is so proud not just to be working to relocate Afghans, but also to be working with so many talented Afghans whose presence on our team makes us stronger \u2013 like Yalda Rezayee, whose hard work and organization over the last weeks helped make this very event possible; and Farid Afghanzai, whose thoughtful analysis enables us to have a more thorough understanding of crucial issues on the ground.\u00a0 There are many other Afghans who have joined CARE and help keep us on track and moving forward.\u00a0 Thank you all, and thank you as well to the entire CARE team, who bring their diligence, talent, and heart every day to assist our Afghan allies.\nWinston Churchill said that where there is resolute purpose, great strides are made.\u00a0 I am so glad all of you could be here, both present and watching at home, on a day we honor our shared solidarity, pride, and resolute purpose.\u00a0 Together we have made great strides and are poised for even more.\nNow I\u2019d like to invite the kinetic Shawn VanDiver \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 to say a few words. \u00a0(Applause.)\nMR VANDIVER:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKinetic\u201d is quite a descriptor.\u00a0 Thank you, Mara.\u00a0 It has been an incredible honor to work with you and the entire team at CARE.\u00a0 Under your leadership, we have accomplished so much more than I think people would have said was even possible; some would have said it\u2019s impossible.\u00a0 Thank you also to my friends and colleagues from #AfghanEvac and all of our coalition members who traveled here today from all over the country to celebrate this work that we\u2019ve been doing together for so long.\u00a0 Thank you to everyone within government who took the time to be here and recognize the importance of this work and this collaboration.\nEveryone here looks pretty great considering we\u2019ve been on Kabul time for two years, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Look, the State Department impacts lives all over the world every day, changing the course of history with its work.\u00a0 And we\u2019re standing in a place where many of those amazing achievements are featured and honored through museum displays.\u00a0 One day, I believe that this work that we\u2019re doing together will be remembered for time immemorial in rooms just like this, but not yet.\u00a0 There is still so much more to be done, and I am grateful to be here today to reaffirm that we will continue to do this vital work together.\n#AfghanEvac was born when my buddy Lucky texted me from a mountaintop in Urgun, eight hours outside of Kabul.\u00a0 He told me that he was out of ammunition and believed he wasn\u2019t going to make it.\u00a0 He asked me to fulfill his final request and to get his wife and children out of Afghanistan and back to San Diego.\u00a0 I promised him that I would try, just as so many volunteers in this room and in this space were making similar promises at that same time.\u00a0 This effort continues nearly two years later because an unprecedented, diverse cross section of America stood up to help thousands of others.\nWe\u2019ve got everyone from veterans and frontline civilians to a children\u2019s book author, corporate executives, a member of Congress, and former senior U.S. government officials among our ranks.\u00a0 This is a shared experience of folks putting their lives on hold and pushing themselves to the limit for people half a world away.\u00a0 This is the story of America, of immigration and diversity and people of different beliefs and backgrounds coming together with a common purpose and bridging divides, closing the gaps that exist between citizens and their government, between the U.S. and Afghanistan, closing the gap between an Afghan family escaping persecution and that family finding a safe home here in the U.S. or anywhere else in the world.\nLike Lucky, who against all odds made it out of Kabul \u2013 and with just a little bit of help he and his family made it out.\u00a0 He\u2019s here with us today, and he exemplifies the story of the Afghan allies that we\u2019re working so hard to assist.\u00a0 Lucky lives in Texas now and is the owner of Afghan markets there and in Oklahoma.\u00a0 He has applied for U.S. citizenship, and when he takes the oath to become a citizen, our country will be stronger and better for it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd so this is also the story of creating new Americans, of creating generational change.\u00a0 Lucky may have been the inspiration for #AfghanEvac, but this effort has continued because of the determination of the hundreds and likely thousands of everyday Americans \u2013 like all of you\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in and out of government and civil society who believe in the promise of America.\u00a0 This partnership that we are recognizing today is an amazing feat of civic engagement.\u00a0 It is the very definition of democracy.\nAnd that idea, the idea of collaborating with the private sector on this, began in a small room right here in this building back in September 2021 with JP Feldmayer and now-Ambassador Timmy Davis, enabled by State Department Chief of Staff Suzy George and Under Secretary John Bass.\u00a0 They recognized government could not take on this daunting challenge alone.\u00a0 And their expeditionary approach allowed us to chart a new path forward.\u00a0 People from all walks of life have joined together with our State Department to live our values, and the result has shaped the course of world events.\nI want to recognize our #AfghanEvac team who represent all 50 states and several countries working together to help honor our allies.\u00a0 There are folks who break down barriers.\u00a0 We have people who started as #AfghanEvac volunteers and now work at State.\u00a0 March Bishop, Chuck Rush, and more recently Jessica Bradley Rushing \u2014 like many of you, their lives can be broken down into two distinct eras: before and after the fall of Kabul.\u00a0 They came into the bureaucracy of federal government and blazed trails, finding new and creative ways to solve longstanding problems.\u00a0 And look, I know that many in this room would agree with me when I say that they are nothing short of American heroes.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMany of the people in this room have been with #AfghanEvac since day one, like Joe Saboe from Team America, whose team led intel briefs back in August of 2021; and Maggie Feldman-Piltch from Operation Eagle, who I met because a member of Congress sent me a text after the airport fell with her phone number, and that\u2019s it.\u00a0 I dropped into yet another chat, bringing the number to about 15 separate, disconnected groups that I was involved in, like so many of you, all working in silos on the same issue, which inspired us to establish the coordination calls and led to the coalition that we have today.\nWe have folks in our team that represent the most vulnerable among us with their expertise and their ideas as well as their own identities.\u00a0 People from the Hazara community like Mahnaz Akbari who commanded the first female tactical platoon with Afghan Special Forces and has been working to help relocate her sisters-in-arms still in Afghanistan all while getting support for those she helped get here to the U.S.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nOur team also includes other Afghan women like Naheed Farid, who served as a member of parliament from Herat and has been fighting tooth and nail for Afghan women since she arrived.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe have people who keep us as a coalition focused on the challenges at hand, like Angela and Jordan, who are all over P-1 and P-2 issues.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We have folks that help the helpers like Kate Kay, who created our Resilience Duty Officer Program.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we have a lot of noisy people.\u00a0 I mean not me, but definitely others.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But we have so many quiet operators getting things done behind the scenes, like Judy and Leannne.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThis is a team of doers.\u00a0 Very few coalition members get paid for this.\u00a0 Everyone has sacrificed for this and all of our lives have been changed by this.\u00a0 There are so many who couldn\u2019t be with here with us today and are just as worthy of recognition as anyone else here.\u00a0 There are space constraints.\u00a0 Some couldn\u2019t make it due to day jobs, finances, or the circumstances of life.\nWe\u2019ve also \u2013 we\u2019ve lost allies with whom we\u2019ve worked during this effort as well as some of our volunteers.\u00a0 Those losses have impacted each of us.\u00a0 And I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the great sacrifice that our loved ones have made.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve thrown ourselves into this work, our friends and families have given up precious time with us, and they certainly deserve our gratitude.\nI am blown away by the tenacity, the determination, and the patriotism of folks here, and not just our volunteers.\u00a0 Our government partners here at State and across the interagency, the allies that we are trying to help, and certainly the incredible coalition of folks here in this room. \u00a0This is a group made to build bridges and break down walls.\nI want to recognize the partnership that we\u2019re renewing today, which is a testament to this department and its leadership.\u00a0 To Secretary Blinken and Under Secretary Bass, to your willingness to do things differently, to your willingness to bridge the gap between the government and the people \u2013 it has been a whole-of-government collaboration, and we would never have seen such success without the efforts of folks like Curtis Ried and Jacqui Pilch and so many others on the NSC team, as well as Adam, Emily, Jason, Becky, and Lisa, and so many others from across the various departments and agencies that we work with.\nThe progress that we have made together is real.\u00a0 We have seen extraordinary successes, and that feeling we get every time we get a get a text or a call from someone we\u2019ve worked with getting on a flight is unmatched.\nUSRAP case processing has been revolutionized at CAS, going from 18 months or more down to 30 or 60 days.\u00a0 This has since expanded to 12 locations around the world.\u00a0 The SIV process has been streamlined, and we\u2019re working on more changes to further decrease those processing times.\u00a0 We are collaborating across the interagency to align communications, increase the frequency of messaging, and ensure we are reducing uncertainty at every opportunity.\nThere is no doubt that this work is historic.\u00a0 But before we call it history, we have to finish the job.\u00a0 So here\u2019s my message to the decision makers in the room:\u00a0 There remain places in the world, including here in the U.S., where Afghans are languishing awaiting permanence.\u00a0 Throughput and capacity for relocations continue to improve, but we have not yet hit our goals. We must move faster and process more people.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe must further streamline the SIV process, and the efficiencies in USRAP case processing must be implemented globally.\u00a0 Afghans in the refugee track need more attention, and at-risk populations must be prioritized.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWell, but sir, we\u2019ve got a laundry list.\u00a0 It\u2019s my only opportunity.\nWe must continue to work with allies and partner nations to find solutions to these issues in a way that emphasizes the dignity and humanity of those in need.\u00a0 Resettlement agencies need additional resources.\u00a0 Time and again, our colleagues are bridging the gap between what resettlement agencies can provide and what our new neighbors actually need for a warm welcome.\nAnd while there will always be a need for civil society to bridge the gap between government and people, for our democracy to deliver we need government to help us shrink the gap.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here today.\u00a0 We are demonstrating the American promise in action and renewing our commitment to the work ahead.\u00a0 We are building bridges and solidifying this partnership, and we are saying to our Afghan friends you are not forgotten, we are here and we are working together today and into the future to bridge the gaps, close the divides, and keep the promise.\nThe war in Afghanistan began in the wake of 9/11, a tragedy which unified the nation.\u00a0 And this work started just eight months after January 6th, when the bitter divides present in our country were more prevalent than ever and threatened our democracy.\u00a0 This team \u2013 both volunteers and government partners alike \u2013 and the work that we continue to accomplish together represents the kind of incredible outcomes that we can achieve when we shed our differences and unify toward a common goal.\nThank you for having us all here, thank you for recognizing these incredible volunteers, and thank you for renewing this partnership.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI think you\u2019re up.\nMS TEKACH:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Shawn.\u00a0 Now, I would like to invite to the stage a leader who has put the strength of the entire State Department behind this humanitarian effort, Secretary Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, thank you, everyone, and good afternoon.\u00a0 First, it seems apparent that there\u2019s been a name change today, and Shawn\u2019s new first name is \u201cKinetic.\u201d (Laughter). We\u2019ll try to formalize that with the appropriate authorities in the days ahead.\u00a0 But Mara, first of all, thank you for kicking us off.\u00a0 Thank you for sharing so much of the remarkable work that\u2019s been done, but especially thank you for helping to lead this effort, to fulfill the commitment that President Biden and I have made to Afghans who stood with us over so many years.\nShawn \u201cKinetic,\u201d \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 thank you for bringing us together today, but especially for your extraordinary leadership of the #AfghanEvac Coalition.\u00a0 Now, virtually every one of us in this room in some fashion or another has been on the receiving end of Shawn\u2019s tenacious advocacy.\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s another possible first name: Tenacious.\u00a0 But I can say this:\u00a0 Our Afghan partners are deeply, deeply fortunate to have you in their corner, and we\u2019re grateful to have Shawn as a partner.\nTo everyone else who is here \u2013 Members of Congress, including Representative Nunn \u2013 leaders from across this department who\u2019ve been playing key roles in this relocation effort, including our Ambassador to Qatar Timmy Davis (applause), to the entire CARE team, to our Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena Bitter, who has done remarkable work, to John Bass, who has his heart and soul in this effort, and so many other colleagues \u2013 and especially, especially to our #AfghanEvac Coalition volunteers joining us from around the country \u2013 some in this room today, some virtually.\nNow, as you heard from Shawn, it\u2019s actually very fitting that we\u2019re meeting in this particular place, the National Museum of American Diplomacy.\u00a0 It honors the contributions of generations of diplomats and aid workers, locally employed staff, civil society partners throughout our history, including in Afghanistan.\u00a0 There\u2019s actually a Great Seal emblem from the U.S. Consulate in Herat \u2013 a plaque remembering Anne Smedinghoff, an extraordinary Foreign Service officer who gave her life while delivering books to a school in Zabul Province \u2013 and a collection of the very books that she and her colleagues were delivering on that day.\nThese items are a reminder not only of the contributions of our diplomats, but also \u2013 also of the courage and sacrifice of our servicemembers over two decades in Afghanistan.\u00a0 Their professionalism was on extraordinary display during the evacuation, when they put their lives on the line to help bring more than 120,000 people to safety \u2013 American citizens, Afghan partners, citizens of partner countries.\u00a0 Thirteen American heroes gave their lives in that operation.\u00a0 We honor them and all who served in Afghanistan for their truly extraordinary service.\nWhen President Biden brought an end to America\u2019s longest conflict, he made a commitment that the United States would continue to relocate and resettle our Afghan partners.\u00a0 We are determined \u2013 I am determined \u2013 to fulfill that pledge, just as this group is.\u00a0 And together that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 What began as a 6:30 a.m. call between seven groups in August of 2021 has now evolved into a coalition of more than 200 groups \u2013 thousands of volunteers.\nMany of you are veterans.\u00a0 Catalina Gasper was deployed to Afghanistan from 2018 to 2019.\u00a0 She worked closely with Shams, a facility manager on her compound.\u00a0 And after Kabul fell, Catalina helped evacuate Shams and other SIV applicants.\u00a0 Shams, his wife, his two young children are now here with us in Virginia.\u00a0 He and Catalina still get together regularly to share a meal.\nOthers in this coalition are Afghans drawn to serve their fellow Afghans.\u00a0 Samad served in Embassy Kabul from 2012 to 2014, where he helped coordinate development programs for USAID.\u00a0 He came to Arlington, Virginia as an SIV in 2014.\u00a0 In August 2021, he volunteered his Dari and Pashto skills to help guide our Afghan partners to rendezvous sites in Kabul.\u00a0 Now, as a volunteer at the #AfghanEvac Coalition, he helps newly arrived Afghans by sharing his own experience and answering their questions about resettling in the United States.\nAnd many in the coalition are Americans who had never even set foot in Afghanistan\u00a0\u2013 teachers, humanitarian workers, firefighters, other citizens, who wanted to help their fellow human beings in a time of need.\u00a0 Danielle Cosgrove, a former protection officer for the UN Refugee Agency, remotely helped eligible Afghans safely pass through the gates at Hamid Karzai International Airport and get onto planes that were heading to safety.\nFor Catalina, for Samad, for Danielle, who are here with us today \u2013 for so many of you in this room \u2013 this wasn\u2019t a question of whether you would help, but how.\u00a0 You\u2019ve risen to the challenge with incredible integrity and persistence at every step along the way.\nAnd quite honestly, it\u2019s your expertise, it\u2019s your ideas, it\u2019s your local networks that have made all the difference, that have been invaluable in this effort \u2013 and we\u2019ve relied on this partnership for every step of the process.\u00a0 And we heard a little bit about what has been such an effective public-private partnership in this instance, maybe the most effective that I\u2019ve seen, and a big part of that is our partners pushing us, prodding us, trying to not only break down institutional barriers, but to just break down walls in our own thinking to make sure that we were testing every idea, every option to make this move better, move faster, move forward more effectively.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nOur diplomats worked around the clock with you to coordinate the initial evacuation, and our CARE team \u2013 strengthened by the #AfghanEvac Coalition members who chose to contribute their talents to the State Department full-time \u2013 Chuck, March, Jessica \u2013 has continued to partner with you to relocate and resettle our partners in the United States.\nAnd what this comes down to is to the extent that we\u2019ve been effective \u2013 and I believe, as Shawn does, that we have \u2013 it\u2019s because we worked together in common cause, in common enterprise, with community of purpose and community of action.\u00a0 And that really is a model for what public-private partnerships can be.\nSo thanks to the leadership that we\u2019ve seen, thanks to our state and local partners, thanks to the generosity of our fellow citizens, we\u2019ve relocated more than 24,000 Afghans to the United States and third countries since September 2021.\u00a0 Overall \u2013 (applause) \u2013 overall, we have relocated more than 97,000 Afghans to the United States \u2013 Afghans who are going to school, who are starting new jobs, who are settling into their communities.\u00a0 And as Shawn so rightly put it, the next generation of Americans, of our renewal, of our country, of our future \u2013 most of us in this room are Americans by accident of birth; they are Americans by choice and they will be our future as well.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nFinally, because this is so important:\u00a0 For all the success that we\u2019ve had, as you\u2019ve heard both of my colleagues say, this job is not yet done.\u00a0 The Memorandum of Understanding that we will shortly sign will allow us to keep sharing information with one another, to coordinate our outreach to additional civil society partners, to guide our ongoing efforts to find more, and better, ways to serve our Afghan partners \u2013 both those already here, and those yet to come \u2013 and keep pace with their evolving needs.\nI think what inspires all of us is we talked about some of the numbers just a minute ago.\u00a0 They\u2019re impressive.\u00a0 But we know that behind each and every one of those numbers is a real person, a real life, a real story.\u00a0 A mother, a father, a sister, a brother.\u00a0 A son, a daughter.\u00a0 And because of what you\u2019ve done, because of what you\u2019re doing, those stories will continue.\u00a0 They won\u2019t be interrupted.\u00a0 And I hope at the very least that each and every one of you who\u2019s been involved will take that with you.\u00a0 Of all the things that one has the opportunity to do in life, few things are more meaningful, more powerful, than the opportunity that we have to come to the assistance of our fellow human beings and to make a real difference in making sure that their stories continue, that their contributions continue.\u00a0 That\u2019s what you\u2019ve done.\u00a0 That\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re determined to keep doing until we finish the job.\nShawn, you\u2019ve described the #AfghanEvac Coalition as, and I quote, \u201cthe most American thing [that] I\u2019ve been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 And looking out at all of you, I know exactly what you mean.\u00a0 You all show what America is when we\u2019re at our best: a compassionate country, full of big-hearted people from different backgrounds, different beliefs \u2013 but all ready to drop everything and work together, work as one team, to help other people.\u00a0 A country that honors its tradition of providing refuge to those who need it.\nAs Secretary of State, but mostly as a fellow American: thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your service.\nMara, over to you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS TEKACH:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Now we have the privilege of presenting six letters of thanks to individual volunteers whose dedication and ongoing efforts have made such a difference for so many.\u00a0 But to all the #AfghanEvac volunteers here and to those who couldn\u2019t join us here today, we say thank you.\u00a0 While a few volunteers are receiving their letters

Minister, we\u2019re thinking of you, we\u2019re thinking of the Italian people at this time.\nI am so glad to be able to welcome my friend Antonio to the State Department for the first time as foreign minister.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen each other repeatedly around the world, including just a couple of weeks ago in Oslo for the NATO ministerial, and today we picked up where we left off in an ongoing conversation, building on the close alliance that we share and the longstanding ties between our nations.\nWe, of course, discussed Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 We admire Prime Minister Meloni\u2019s strong, principled leadership.\u00a0 Earlier this year in Irpin, the prime minister signed a Ukrainian flag with the words \u201cat your side,\u201d and that\u2019s a very powerful description of the solidarity that all of us are showing for Ukraine.\nItaly has stepped up in powerful ways, not only with military assistance, but supplying generators, electrical equipment to keep Ukraine\u2019s power grid up in the face of Russian attacks on that grid; millions of dollars \u2013 tens of millions of dollars in humanitarian assistance from medicine to blankets.\u00a0 And, of course, Italy has welcomed more than 170,000 Ukrainian refugees into what is already the largest Ukrainian community in Western Europe.\u00a0 Our two countries will continue to support efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.\nOur Italian allies are, of course, vital to the stability to NATO\u2019s southern flank, and I thanked the minister for Italy\u2019s leadership in supporting peace and security in North Africa.\u00a0 In Tunisia, Italy has played an invaluable role in urging the Tunisian Government to implement durable solutions to the country\u2019s political and economic challenges.\u00a0 In Libya, we\u2019ve worked very closely together to support the UN-led process to find a path toward free and fair elections.\u00a0 Italy is making major investments in Libya\u2019s oil and gas industry that will deliver economic benefits to both shores of the Mediterranean.\nItaly\u2019s actions have also embodied the growing strategic convergence across the Atlantic with the European Union, within NATO, and among the G7.\u00a0 Italy is a source of stability not only in the Mediterranean but also in Sub-Saharan Africa, and we greatly value Italy\u2019s growing strategic partnership with countries like Japan and India as we work to promote a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific.\nAs Italy prepares to assume the presidency of the G7 next year, we look forward to Italy\u2019s continued leadership on issues of global consequence where we\u2019ve been spending a lot of our time together \u2013 tackling the climate crisis, combating terrorism, safeguarding democracy, building food security, building global health security.\u00a0 All of these issues are front and center in our common agenda.\nWhat makes our close partnership so productive across these many issues are, of course, the remarkable, enduring bonds between our people: ties of shared history, shared values; some 18 million Americans who claim Italian ancestry, including our First Lady Jill Biden \u2013 all of which helps explain why American visitors are returning to Italy in record numbers after the pandemic.\nSo on behalf of the United States, let me just say to our good friends, our close partners, our close allies, thank you.\u00a0 We are so grateful for the work that we\u2019re doing together around the world.\u00a0 In many ways, it\u2019s more meaningful than ever.\u00a0 The challenges are tremendous, the opportunities are real, and because of that partnership \u2013 notably the partnership between our countries is more important than it\u2019s ever been.\nThank you, my friend, and over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Tony.\u00a0 Allow me to speak in my mother tongue, in Italian.\u00a0 (Via interpreter) First of all, I\u2019d like to thank Antony Blinken for the flexibility he showed today at a time that is very challenging for me, for Italy.\u00a0 He accepted to modify our program and to move up this meeting so that I could be allowed to go back to Italy.\u00a0 I am deeply grateful for that.\u00a0 I see this as one more gesture of friendship towards Italy, and I also want to thank him for the condolences that he expressed for our loss of Silvio Berlusconi.\u00a0 And being here today for me is a way to honor his memory because he considered the United States to be Italy\u2019s best friend and he never missed an opportunity to thank all of the young American soldiers who have fallen to defend freedom and democracy in Italy and in Europe.\u00a0 And when before Congress, he said, \u201cWhen I look at the flag of the United States, I don\u2019t see just the flag of a country who\u2019s a friend, but I see a message of democracy and freedom all over the world.\u201d\nThat\u2019s \u2013 these are in the foundations upon which the friendship between Italy and the U.S. are based.\u00a0 I\u2019m here to restate today our strategic solidarity, which is not connected just to what is happening at the time.\u00a0 This is a longstanding relationship based on the many Italians that have come to America and who are today the children and grandchildren of other Italians.\u00a0 This bond is very strong and very solid.\u00a0 It is political, it is strategic, and it is based on a joint vision about freedom and democracy.\nOver the course of our meeting, we agreed on all of the big issues, starting from the most dramatic ones, such as the war in the Ukraine.\u00a0 We all want peace but peace must be a just peace.\u00a0 It must be a peace that restates international rule of law and allows freedom to a people that were the victim of invasion.\u00a0 We agreed on the kind of work that can be performed in the Balkans, where we are part of the Quint format, and we can restore these and we can favor the entrance of countries that are candidates to become part of the European Union.\u00a0 We want the Ukraine to be a future member of the European Union.\nWe agreed on the action to be implemented to support peace and stability in the area of the Mediterranean, including Tunisia, which for us in Italy is a priority.\u00a0 I have explained to my friend Antony what the Italian Government is doing to achieve stability.\u00a0 We found agreement on the actions to be taken in the Middle East and North Africa, in the Indo-Pacific area.\u00a0 Italy is in favor of maintaining the status quo in that region.\u00a0 I also stated once again to Antony that Italy, with this government, intends to keep its positions.\u00a0 It will be a stable country.\u00a0 It will be a loyal country, serious, credible, and reliable.\nAnd soon there will be the visit of the Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, who will meet President Biden in order to strengthen even more the relationship between Italy and the United States, which are two countries that are brothers for us.\u00a0 This transatlantic relationship, based on a common vision of NATO and trade exchanges that are very solid, this will allow us to solve any issue that might happen, and we will do so as friends.\u00a0 And under an economic point of view, we are in total agreement.\u00a0 We are two industrialized countries.\u00a0 We know what the issues with raw materials are.\u00a0 And in Africa we can work in this direction as well together in order to make sure that the market, especially for raw materials, is not dominated by others.\nTherefore, there is perfect agreement.\u00a0 There is an action towards common purposes.\u00a0 And I am very satisfied of my meeting with the Secretary of State of the United States.\u00a0 I want to thank him for the showing of affection that he had towards me and towards the Berlusconi family and towards Italy.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Four questions.\u00a0 The first one goes to Shannon Crawford with ABC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 As Ukraine begins its counteroffensive, its military reports that it\u2019s up against a massive uptick of drones on the battlefield, and more and more reports suggest that some of these drones, or at least some of their key parts, are coming from China.\u00a0 Now, my question to you both is: Do you assess that China is ramping up its material support for Russia?\u00a0 And Mr. Secretary, will you bring this up when you are in Beijing, and also will you raise China\u2019s efforts to spy on the U.S. from Cuba while you\u2019re there?\nAnd second, Mr. Secretary, we saw another American arrested in Moscow over the weekend.\u00a0 Do you have any updates on those case \u2013 on that case, rather \u2013 that you can share?\u00a0 And more broadly, does this administration\u2019s willingness to engage in negotiations over detentions encourage these type of provocative arrests?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Let me \u2013 let me start with the second question first.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been seeking to learn more about the apparent detention of Travis Leake, and we are working to be not only in touch with him, to have consular access, but also with his family.\u00a0 My number one priority as Secretary of State is the safety and security of Americans abroad, and this is \u2013 this is no exception.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working to gather information to understand exactly what happened, and of course we will be very focused on this.\nLook, generally speaking, there is always a balance to be found in working to secure the release of Americans who are being arbitrarily detained, which we\u2019ve done very successfully over the last couple of years, bringing Americans home from many different places with, of course, concerns about whether any actions we take might further incentivize countries to engage in this practice.\u00a0 But that\u2019s why, even as we\u2019ve been doing this, we\u2019ve been imposing penalties, imposing sanctions, including under the Robert Levinson Act, to disincentivize countries from engaging in this practice.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re working more and more closely together with other countries that unfortunately are similarly situated to us and having been the victims of the arbitrary detention of their citizens to make it clear to countries that do this that there will be a price to be paid.\nBut it is a balance.\u00a0 I believe we can do both things at the same time.\u00a0 At the same time, the countries that engage in this practice ultimately are simply going to further isolate themselves as people from around the world will have to really think twice, think three times, about whether they want to travel to any of these countries when there\u2019s a risk that they will be arbitrarily detained and used as a pawn in some kind of political issue that that country may have with us or with many other countries around the world.\nAnd that ultimately is going to be very self-defeating for countries that have an interest in maintaining contacts, remaining \u2013 maintaining relations, having economic connectivity with the world.\u00a0 They will be isolating themselves.\u00a0 But we work on this virtually every single day and we work to make sure that we get the balance right.\nWith regard to drones in Ukraine that are being used by Russia, we\u2019ve been very focused on this, particularly the concern that drones coming from Iran are being used in Ukraine.\u00a0 We have seen that over many months, both to attack civilians, to attack civilian infrastructure.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been very focused on trying to disrupt those efforts and the provision of those drones.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been on this for some time.\nWe\u2019ve shared concerns in the past with counterparts in China about the possibility that the provision of weapons to Russia for Ukraine is something that they might be considering.\u00a0 To date, we\u2019ve not seen that line crossed.\u00a0 At the same time, we have concerns about private companies engaged in the provision of technologies, including dual-use technologies.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that\u2019s of much \u2013 an issue.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve brought up in the past, and I know we\u2019ll continue to bring up going forward if that remains a concern.\nWith regard to Cuba, when this administration took office in January 2021, we were briefed on a number of sensitive efforts by Beijing around the world to expand their overseas logistics, basing, collection infrastructure, to allow them to project and sustain military power at the greater distance.\u00a0 They were considering a number of sites around the world for that expansion, including intelligence collection facilities for intelligence collection in Cuba.\u00a0 In fact, based on the information we have, the PRC conducted an upgrade of its intelligence collection facilities in Cuba in 2019.\nIt was our assessment that despite awareness of the basing efforts and some attempts to address the challenge in the past administration, we weren\u2019t making enough progress on this issue and we needed a more direct approach.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what President Biden instructed his team to do to address the challenge.\u00a0 And within months of getting that instruction from the President, that\u2019s exactly what we did.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been executing on that approach quietly, carefully, but in our judgment, with results ever since.\u00a0 I can\u2019t get into every step that we\u2019ve taken, but the strategy begins with diplomacy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve engaged governments that are considering hosting PRC bases at high levels.\u00a0 We\u2019ve exchanged information with them.\u00a0 Our experts assess that our diplomatic efforts have slowed down this effort by the PRC.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very carefully monitoring and, as I said, taking steps to counter.\u00a0 We remain confident that we are able to meet all of our security commitments both at home and in the region.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0(Via interpreter) As far as China is concerned, I believe that a country that submitted a number of points to build peace cannot and should not provide any kind of support to a country such as Russia that violated international law.\u00a0 Therefore, I believe that China\u2019s commitment should be aimed not at strengthening Russia but, on the other hand, to favor peace.\u00a0 Therefore, I hope that it will go in that direction.\nRegarding Cuba, Cuba is a fundamental area, or country in a strategic area.\u00a0 This is an appeal that I launch to the Cuban regime, and that is to free many political prisoners.\u00a0 And in that case as well we must defend, first and foremost, human rights, especially also about Iran.\u00a0 Sending drones to the Russian Federation must be stopped.\u00a0 Those who want peace cannot contribute to support those who violated international law and invaded a free and democratic country.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Massimo Gaggi with Corriere della Sera.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you for having us.\u00a0 And to both of you, Tunisia is the top of an iceberg of a deep crisis in Africa.\u00a0 Given that a plan to stabilize this continent is essential for Europe and, frankly, for our democracies, do you see room for a pragmatic approach to avoid the default of Tunisia given that \u2013 the reservations of IMF, as far as I understand, are more based on market economy issues more than on human rights issues.\nAnd if I may, specifically to you, Mr. Secretary:\u00a0 Do you have any memories specifically on Silvio Berlusconi that was recently criticized for his position on Ukraine, but that I remember that long ago he was a bridge to keep Putin very close to NATO and also to allow Mr. Erdogan to be as integrated as possible in the European Union?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m\u00a0 happy to start, Antonio, if there\u2019s anything you want to add of course.\u00a0 On Tunisia, we very much share the concern that Italy has and that other partners have about the economic situation in Tunisia, as well as \u2013 as well as political challenges.\u00a0 And very much appreciate the work that\u2019s being done, including by the delegation led by Prime Minister Meloni and also the President of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen to visit and to see if there\u2019s a way forward.\nWe very much would welcome the Tunisian Government presenting a revised reform plan to the IMF and for the IMF to be able to act on the plan presented.\u00a0 But these are sovereign decisions.\u00a0 This is a sovereign decision for Tunisia; it\u2019s not a decision for us or anyone else to make.\u00a0 But it\u2019s clear that Tunisia needs additional assistance if it is going to avoid falling off the proverbial economic cliff.\u00a0 And what the EU and Italy have done, I think, is an important step, but something more comprehensive \u2013 that in our judgment the IMF can best provide \u2013 would be important to actually helping Tunisia get on a sustainable and positive path.\u00a0 But the decisions that are involved really are decisions for Tunisia to make, but we would very much support finding some way forward because it\u2019s important for Tunisia, but it\u2019s also, I think, important for the region.\u00a0 It\u2019s important \u2013 it\u2019s important for Europe, and we have a stake as well in Tunisia\u2019s success.\nAfter the Arab Spring, Tunisia was one of the most important bright spots in its trajectory \u2013 something that I had the opportunity to be involved in when I was last in government.\u00a0 And so we want to see Tunisia succeed, and we want to find ways to provide the support necessary for its success.\u00a0 But fundamentally, the government in Tunisia has to make decisions about how it wants to proceed, and we would hope that there\u2019s a practical way forward that we can find with, as necessary, appropriate flexibility.\u00a0 And of course we\u2019re in very close contact, coordination with the Government of Italy as well as with other partners in Europe on this.\u00a0 We have the same objective.\nAnd then finally, with regard to Prime Minister Berlusconi, I must say I never had the opportunity to meet him or to work with him.\u00a0 He was obviously a tremendously significant figure in the life of Italy \u2013 in the political life, in the public life of the country.\u00a0 Many American administrations worked with him over the years.\u00a0 And for me, not having known him, I simply want to extend my condolences to his family, because let\u2019s not \u2013 never forget in these situations, the people who are affected first and foremost is the family \u2013 but also to the Italian people for their loss.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 On Tunisia, I informed the secretary-general on a trip of Prime Minister Meloni to Tunisia we want to achieve good solutions.\u00a0 We want to pave the way for an agreement.\u00a0 Of course, for us, we need to be pragmatic \u2013 to talk, to talk, to talk with the Tunisians for achieving an agreement between Tunisia, the European Union, Italy, also Monetary Fund, and for this also the position of the United States is very, very important.\u00a0 But we need to work step by step.\u00a0 The idea of the Italian is to put money \u2013 the first step of money, then reforms; without reforms, not the second step.\nBut we need to talk, we need to achieve good solution for the stability, because the stability of Tunisia, as the stability of Libya, is crucial for the stability of the Mediterranean region.\u00a0 Italy is strongly engaged on this.\u00a0 We will work in contact with our European friends but also our American friends for achieving good results for \u2013 in favor of the stability, peace, against illegal immigration, against terrorism.\u00a0 All together, this is a priority for everybody.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Next question, Zeba Warsi with PBS NewsHour.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 First to you both on Sweden\u2019s bid to join NATO, Mr. Secretary, you called T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s newly appointed foreign minister and emphasized the need for Sweden to be a part of NATO.\u00a0 Sweden has announced that it will extradite self \u2013 a self-proclaimed PKK supporter.\u00a0 Do you believe that will satisfy President Erdogan, or rather\u00a0T\u00fcrkiye, to clear the path for Sweden to join NATO ahead of the NATO Summit?\nAnd secondly, on the Dnieper dam disaster, do you have an update to share with us based on intelligence reports?\u00a0 Can you say with absolute certainty that the Russians were behind it?\u00a0 And more broadly, what kind of an impact has that had on the ongoing counteroffensive?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 On Sweden and NATO, a few things.\u00a0 First, as we\u2019ve said all along, if you look in the context of history, if you look at this historically, the process for both Finland and Sweden has been very rapid, and appropriately so given the fact that both countries have been longtime partners of NATO, among the strongest democracies in the world, members of the European Union.\u00a0 And of course, the challenge posed to European security by Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine makes the matter even more urgent.\nAs I also said, it\u2019s a process, and it\u2019s appropriate that during that process every member of the Alliance be able to raise any concerns or issues that it might have.\u00a0 That\u2019s especially true because a big part of being a member of NATO is the Article 5 commitment for each member to come to the defense of any other member if they are the subject of aggression.\nSo that process has worked, and in the course of it T\u00fcrkiye was able to raise some concerns that it had.\u00a0 Finland and Sweden have both addressed those concerns, and in our judgment, addressed them appropriately and effectively.\u00a0 There is I think scheduled for later this week another meeting between T\u00fcrkiye, Sweden, NATO to look at where things are.\u00a0 But in our judgment and, as important, in the judgment of virtually every other Ally in NATO \u2013 and Antonio and I were just at a meeting with our colleagues a couple of weeks ago \u2013 each and every one expressed the conviction that now is the time for Sweden to formally join the Alliance, for the accession process to be complete.\u00a0 And that\u2019s certainly the judgment of the United States.\u00a0 So our expectation is that this will happen by the time of the Vilnius Summit in July, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to see take place over the coming weeks.\nOn the dam, we don\u2019t have any further information on exactly what happened.\u00a0 We do know that it\u2019s having catastrophic effects on Ukrainians, and that\u2019s in and of itself a terrible thing, magnified, of course, by the fact that this is happening in the midst of Russia\u2019s broader aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t have any further information on exactly what caused the dam to collapse.\u00a0 Of course, Russia started this war.\u00a0 Russia is \u2013 was actually in control of the dam, and we\u2019ve seen the results affecting so many Ukrainians.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0 Italy is strongly in favor NATO for membership for Sweden.\u00a0 We would work for achieving this goal with other NATO members.\u00a0 I want to have Sweden full member during the Vilnius meeting.\u00a0 We will work for achieving this goal.\nOn the other point, we don\u2019t have clear information for this.\u00a0 It\u2019s much better to stay in silence, of course.\u00a0 We want to protect the civil population.\u00a0 We need to help the civil population.\u00a0 Also, Zaporizhzhia region is very dangerous for the same proposal during the meeting of the United Nation assembly to have a free zone around Zaporizhzhia, supporting the action of Mr. Grossi, general director of atomic agency of the United Nations.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Final question goes to Andrea Gerli with RAI TG1 TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank.\u00a0 For both of you, Minister Tajani and Secretary Blinken, how do you evaluate what\u2019s happening on the ground in Ukraine with a counteroffensive, and where would \u2013 where could it lead eventually?\nAnd another question:\u00a0 What are the next steps of the cooperation between Ukraine and NATO?\u00a0 I\u2019m thinking about the next summit.\u00a0 And is it possible that Ukraine joins NATO \u2013 well, a de facto joint partnership, not the (inaudible)?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I believe that we must follow a process that had been started a few years ago in order to have the Ukraine become an operational member of NATO.\u00a0 I believe that a substantial first step that can lead into this direction would be that of establishing a sort of NATO council with Ukraine that can see the involvement of\u00a0Ukraine also in terms of information sharing and political information at NATO level.\u00a0 And this could be a first step towards entering NATO by the Ukraine.\nRegarding the counteroffensive, I hope that it can help to make steps towards peace, because we all want peace.\u00a0 We are helping Ukraine because we want peace.\u00a0 Because if we did not help the Ukraine, Ukraine would be invaded and we would have a threat that is much greater towards Europe, and Georgia, Moldova, and many other countries would be at great risk.\u00a0 Therefore, we\u2019re doing this to defend freedom and democracy.\u00a0 But we do want peace.\u00a0 So if this counteroffensive is useful to have the Russians retreat back from the Ukraine, well, this will give freedom back to Ukraine.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0On the counteroffensive, these are, of course, early days, so much too soon to say exactly where this is going.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s important to note that, as a result of more than 50 countries coming together in support of Ukraine, and particularly the courage and tenacity of Ukraine\u2019s military and its people, we\u2019re confident that they will continue to have success in what they\u2019re trying to achieve, which is to take back the land that\u2019s been seized from them by Russia.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important to note that, in terms of what President Putin was trying to achieve in Ukraine, it\u2019s already been a strategic failure, because the objective that Putin had \u2013 that he stated himself \u2013 was to erase Ukraine from the map, to eliminate its independence, and to absorb Ukraine, in one fashion or another, into Russia.\u00a0 That has failed and it cannot succeed.\nBut it remains the case that Russia has illegally seized almost 20 percent of Ukraine\u2019s territory.\u00a0 And we both want \u2013 Italy, the United States \u2013 in fact, the Ukrainian people more than anyone \u2013 want peace, but it needs to be a just and durable peace.\u00a0 And by just, we mean a peace that basically reflects the principles of the United Nations Charter, including on territorial integrity and sovereignty.\u00a0 And by durable, we mean a peace that doesn\u2019t simply leave things in a place where Russia can rest, rearm, and re-attack six months later, a year later, two years later.\u00a0 So this is what we\u2019re working toward.\nUkraine\u2019s success in the counter offensive would do two things.\u00a0 It would strengthen its position at any negotiating table that emerges, and it may have the effect as well of actually causing Putin to finally focus on negotiating an end to the war that he started.\u00a0 And in that sense, it can actually bring peace closer, not put it further away.\u00a0 So we will continue to do two things \u2013 and we\u2019re determined in this \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to maximize our support to Ukraine now so that it can have success on the battlefield, but also our enduring support is critical, support for Ukraine so that it can build up over time a strong deterrent and defense capacity for its military so that in the future, if Russia tries to pursue another aggression, it has the chance to deter that and, if necessary, effectively defend against it; but also to support its economy, to support its integration with the European Union where Italy is a leading voice; and of course, the ongoing process of democratic reform.\nThese two things \u2013 its military strength and its economic and democratic strength \u2013 these are the critical things that Ukraine needs to succeed not only to survive, but to thrive going forward.\u00a0 And it also sends a very strong message to President Putin that, to the extent he believes that he will outlast Ukraine, that he will outlast our countries, he\u2019s wrong; and that we\u2019re committed to Ukraine not just in the moment, but for the long term as well.\u00a0 And that gets me to the NATO Summit.\u00a0 I think \u2013 without getting ahead of ourselves, I think what you can expect to see at the NATO Summit is a robust package of both political and practical support for Ukraine going forward.\nAnd this too, I think, will send a very strong message to President Putin that he can\u2019t simply try to outlast any of us, that we\u2019re all here to stay, we\u2019re determined.\u00a0 The Ukrainian people, we, all want peace, but again, it has to be just, it has to be durable.\u00a0 And if and when Russia is prepared to engage on that basis, we\u2019ll all be prepared to do that.\u00a0 But what we\u2019ve seen to date is that it\u2019s not prepared to do that.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\n\n",

foreign affairs from the USA.\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) In the name of God, we shall start.\u00a0 Hello, everyone.\u00a0 Greetings to you.\u00a0 First of all, I would like to welcome His Excellency Mr. Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State of the U.S.\u00a0 I would like also to welcome all of the observers and our distinguished guests today.\u00a0 I would like also to welcome Togo as our newest member amongst the 86 members of the global coalition, which is the biggest of its kind against terrorism.\nIn our meeting, we spoke about the liberated areas in Iraq and Syria, and we reiterated the priorities and the continuity of our efforts and endeavors in that direction, and to prevent further spread of the \u2013 of ISIS and prevent financing from reaching ISIS.\u00a0 And we have capitalized all of the efforts made by countries against ISIS.\u00a0 We spoke about the fight against armed militias and terrorist groups in west of Africa and the African region in general, which are spreading panic in Africa.\u00a0 And we have also focused on the importance of the role played by the global coalition against terrorism (inaudible) the Sahel countries but (inaudible) reiterate again as the threat of terrorism against Africa and that we are working on further cooperation in the face of this challenge.\nWe would like also to reiterate that we need to focus our work more in Afghanistan so that Afghanistan cannot be a safe haven again for terrorist groups.\u00a0 We need to work together on common challenges and provide the right environment for the \u00a0\u2013 the repatriation of IDPs to Iraq and Syria, and to also recover the citizens or the diaspora in other countries.\nAnd we have been working with countries that rejected to retrieve their nationals and are keeping this burden on the affected countries and areas and did not delve into rehabilitation.\u00a0 However, it \u2013 we recommended is that the relevant countries should work on retrieving those nationals and working on their rehabilitation instead of leaving them in the affected areas and affected countries where the burden of handling them will be on them.\nWe are also \u2013 were also focused on the different manners of multilateral collaboration within the framework of the global coalition, and we are going to continue, of course, in enriching the collaboration between us and the U.S.\nAnd in the end, I would like to say that terrorism in all of its forms should never be associated with a specific religion or a specific race or ethnicity and should not result in any segregation or discrimination against any racial group.\u00a0 And Muslims should not be harassed because of their religion, for instance.\u00a0 And this is, of course, relevant and true for all other ethnicities.\nNow, I give the floor to His Excellency the secretary general, Mr. Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first of all, Foreign Minister Faisal, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your hospitality, thank you for bringing all of our regional and global partners together here in Riyadh.\nWhen President Biden traveled to Jeddah last summer, he affirmed the importance of the Middle East to the long-term security and economic interests of the United States.\u00a0 And he made clear that we\u2019re committed to continuing and deepening our partnerships in the region.\u00a0 Together, we can drive real progress for all our people, not only to address the challenges or crises of the moment, but to chart an affirmative vision for our shared future.\nOver the last few days, we have advanced that progress on several fronts, working with our Saudi partners, working with the Gulf Cooperation Council, working today with the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\nThe foreign minister and I just finished a productive meeting of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS.\u00a0 The United States very much appreciates the leadership of Saudi Arabia not only in hosting this meeting, but for its contributions \u2013 constant contributions and crucial contributions \u2013 day-in, day-out to our mission.\u00a0 While our coalition has taken back the territory that ISIS once controlled and inflicted severe losses on its leadership, ISIS nonetheless remains an active threat.\nThis ministerial that we just had focused on several key areas of need.\u00a0 Those include stabilizing areas liberated from ISIS so that the group can\u2019t exploit poor security, economic, or humanitarian conditions that leave people desperate; and also, as you heard from the foreign minister, repatriating foreign terrorist fighters and their families from al-Hol and other displaced persons camps.\u00a0 We\u2019re also working to keep pace with evolving threats, including ISIS\u2019s expanding efforts across sub-Saharan Africa and ISIS-Khorasan.\u00a0 Our 86-member coalition leaves this ministerial better focused and equipped to continue the mission to eradicate ISIS.\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia, both as bilateral partners and through the GCC, are working closely together to address several other challenges in the region.\nIn Yemen, when President Biden took office, war was raging.\u00a0 The country was experiencing the arguably the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.\u00a0 Now we\u2019re working intensively with Saudi Arabia and other partners to further consolidate what has been a 14-month long truce that we helped to achieve.\u00a0 This was a central issue in my discussions with the Saudi crown prince and the foreign minister, and today I had an opportunity as well to meet with Yemen\u2019s President al-Alimi to discuss the path forward.\nOur objectives are a durable ceasefire and an inclusive, Yemeni-led process mediated by the UN \u2013 one that meets Yemenis\u2019 calls for justice, for accountability, for redress for abuses, and ultimately leads to a political resolution of differences in Yemen.\u00a0 Our Special Envoy Tim Lenderking will continue to work with the parties and partners in the region in the days and weeks ahead to resolve issues standing in the way of a lasting peace.\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia, together with the GCC, are also focused on Iran\u2019s destabilizing influence in the region, including its support for terrorism and violent militia groups, the seizure of tankers transiting international waters, and nuclear escalation.\u00a0 The United States continues to believe that diplomacy, backed by economic pressure, by deterrence, and by strong defense cooperation, is the best way to avoid counter these dangerous actions.\u00a0 We support efforts by Saudi Arabia to de-escalate tension and stabilize relations.\nThe United States and our Gulf partners are working closely on the crisis in Sudan.\u00a0 Our two countries \u2013 the United States and Saudi Arabia \u2013 have been leading an intensive diplomatic campaign to get the two sides to agree to and comply with a ceasefire and to allow humanitarian assistance to reach the people of Sudan.\u00a0 We will keep working toward a durable cessation of hostilities and the swift formation of a civilian-led transitional government together with our partners in the Gulf and Africa and with the United Nations.\nI also discussed with GCC partners increasing our joint efforts to combat illicit synthetic drugs like Captagon, which is having a devastating impact on young people throughout this region, just as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are doing the same in the United States.\u00a0 This partnership will be an important part of our diplomacy to strengthen global cooperation on the growing challenge posed by illicit synthetic drugs.\nAlongside my GCC and D-ISIS engagements, I also met with the Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister Mekonnen to review the ongoing implementation of the November 2 Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.\u00a0 That agreement ended the horrific crisis in Tigray.\u00a0 For peace to endure, the parties must acknowledge the atrocities committed and pursue accountability together with reconciliation.\u00a0 The United States will continue to partner with Ethiopia as it builds a credible transitional justice process to break the cycle of ethnic and political violence that has gripped Ethiopia and prevented it from reaching its potential for far too long.\nThe U.S. partnership with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf extends far beyond addressing challenges and crises in the region.\u00a0 It is critical for expanding opportunity and driving progress for our people and for people around the world.\nThrough the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, the United States and Saudi Arabia are working together to deliver quality, sustainable infrastructure to benefit people in low and middle-income countries.\nWe\u2019re expanding digital connectivity, including by using new mobile telecommunications technology like open, cloud-based radio access networks that are both secure and affordable.\nWe\u2019re combating the climate crisis and accelerating the region\u2019s clean energy transition through our bilateral Partnership Framework for Advancing Clean Energy that we signed last summer and that can unlock new solar, green hydrogen, and other renewable energy investments.\nA key part of our strategy to advance a more prosperous, stable, and secure region is regional integration and de-escalation.\u00a0 The Gulf is more connected then ever \u2013 both as a region and with countries in the broader Middle East, including Israel.\u00a0 The United States will continue to play an integral role in deepening and expanding normalization.\nAs President Biden said in Jeddah, universal rights and freedoms \u2013 and the protections they bring \u2013 are a core priority for the United States.\u00a0 And the U.S.-Saudi partnership can be deepened by progress on human rights.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we strongly welcome and support historic steps to increase women\u2019s participation in public life in the workforce, to expand interfaith tolerance, among other reforms in the country\u2019s ambitious modernization agenda.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll continue to keep human rights firmly fixed on our bilateral agenda \u2013 a point I made clear in our meetings this week.\nLast week, U.S. and Saudi astronauts returned to Earth after spending ten days together on a mission to the International Space Station.\u00a0 That mission included Rayyanah Barnawi, the first female Arab astronaut to ever go to space.\u00a0 In her first message from space, Rayyanah predicted that \u201cthe future is very bright.\u201d\u00a0 To that, I say: let\u2019s make it so, together.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: \u00a0(In Arabic.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0(Via Interpreter) (Inaudible) these challenges or \u2013 that are represented by the actions of Daesh brought the Kingdom to chair the particular group under the state minister of \u2013 Secretary of State of (inaudible) the United States.\u00a0 And I have already qualified the meeting as a meeting that lasts for hours, where we discuss many files.\u00a0 Actually, we reviewed these files in detail, and we shall continue to do so along with our brothers, the Americans.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nThe Kingdom actually joined the group in its firm belief in our partnership with the African continent, which we consider as a source \u2013 a particular source of particular importance of cooperation and coordination with the various African states, which all have links with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nWe are copartners in development, and we feel our responsibility to preserve the achievements of those countries and particularly our common action in the face of the challenges for the stability of the continent.\u00a0 And this will reflect on the stability and security of the Kingdom itself and its neighbors.\u00a0 We feel the shared responsibility towards the African states that need capacities and (inaudible) in this area.\u00a0 And we have always stood up against Daesh in Syria and Iraq as a collective international community with the full cooperation and coordination.\u00a0 We shall continue to do so in supporting all international efforts in this sphere.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Really, I can only reiterate what the foreign minister has said.\u00a0 And, again, just as a reminder, this coalition \u2013 that is now 86 countries and organization strong, by our count is the largest coalition in the world \u2013 has had remarkable success since 2014 in taking back the territory that Daesh had seized in Iraq and Syria, in eliminating its senior leadership, and in minimizing the threat.\u00a0 But the threat remains.\u00a0 And beyond that, it is moving to other places, notably to parts of Africa, which is why we\u2019ve had to focus today and in our coalition on some of the challenges being faced by African partners, notably in the Sahel and in West Africa.\nSo what\u2019s notable about the coalition is the fact that it adapts.\u00a0 It\u2019s flexible.\u00a0 And even as we keep the focus on Iraq and Syria to make sure that the Daesh threat doesn\u2019t re-emerge in a meaningful way, we also have to make sure that we\u2019re focused on areas where it may be more active.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve noted, right now that\u2019s in Africa, and that\u2019s why we have the focus of this coalition on Africa, in full partnership with African countries.\nLast thing to mention.\u00a0 What is very notable from our discussions, today and in the all the work that we\u2019ve been doing on this, is the imperative of having a comprehensive approach.\u00a0 Security is a necessary but insufficient element of dealing with the challenge posed by Daesh.\u00a0 And we heard, from partner after partner, the imperative of dealing with the concerns, the needs of marginalized communities, bringing economic opportunities, making sure that there is good governance and a transparent political approach.\u00a0 All of these things are critical to having success against Daesh, preventing it from recruiting and expanding in other places.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 The second question for Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, gentlemen.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, Your Highness, is Saudi Arabia seeking U.S. support to develop its own civil nuclear program in exchange for normalizing ties with Israel, like it\u2019s been reported?\u00a0 And would you say that that is a nonnegotiable condition for you to normalize?\nAnd then separately, Saudi Arabia in recent years has carried out many reforms, but rights groups also report increased repression.\u00a0 What is your response to that?\u00a0 And how big of a pressure do you face from your American counterparts on this issue?\nMr. Secretary, you discussed with Saudi Crown Prince the normalization issue.\u00a0 What progress can you report?\u00a0 How feasible is such a deal, given concerns that it might accelerate an arms deal, arms race with Iran?\u00a0 And on human rights issues, I\u2019m wondering if you were able to receive any assurances from the Crown Prince towards the release of political prisoners and any U.S. citizens who are subject to travel bans.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, on the issue of nuclear cooperation, it\u2019s no secret that we are developing our domestic, civilian nuclear program.\u00a0 We would very much prefer to be able to have the U.S. as one of the bidders for that program.\u00a0 There are others that are bidding, and obviously we would like to build our program with the best technology in the world, and that will require a certain agreement to be in place.\u00a0 We have differences of opinion, so we\u2019re working on finding a mechanism for us to be able to work together on civilian nuclear technology.\u00a0 But we intend to move forward on that program.\nNormalization, I have said before and it\u2019s quite clear that we believe that normalization is in the interest of the region, that it would bring significant benefits to all.\u00a0 But without finding a pathway to peace for the Palestinian people, without addressing that challenge, any normalization will have limited benefits.\u00a0 And therefore, I think we should continue to focus on finding a pathway towards a two-state solution, on finding a pathway towards giving the Palestinians dignity and justice.\u00a0 And I think the U.S. has a similar view, that it\u2019s important to continue on those efforts.\nYou asked about human rights.\u00a0 You asked about reform.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s well known that we have gone through significant reform progress in the Kingdom.\u00a0 What we do in the Kingdom, we do based on our assessment of what\u2019s in the best interest of our country, and it\u2019s driven really by the needs and desires of the Saudi people.\nYou have had a few days here.\u00a0 I hope you have been able to see the significant changes happening in the Kingdom.\u00a0 However, we are always open to having a dialogue with our friends, but we don\u2019t respond to pressure.\u00a0 When we do anything, we do it in our own interests.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t think that anybody believes that pressure is useful or helpful, and therefore that\u2019s not something that we are going to even consider.\nBut the priority, as I said, is achieving the goals that we have for our country.\u00a0 We are very focused on building a pathway towards a sustainable prosperity for the Saudi people.\u00a0 And I encourage you and anyone who has an interest and has a curiosity about it to spend some time in the Kingdom, to interact with the people of the Kingdom, and make your own judgment and your own assessment.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Humeyra.\u00a0 On the normalization question, first \u2013 as you know \u2013 we fully support Israel\u2019s integration into the Middle East.\u00a0 And from day one, we have been working, both to deepen some of the existing agreements and also expand them to other countries.\u00a0 That includes Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 I think this would be a very important step forward, and it would certainly be a priority \u2013 and is a priority \u2013 for us.\u00a0 Integration is good for the region, for all concerned, and we will continue to pursue it.\u00a0 We discussed it here, and we will continue to work at it, to advance it in the days, weeks, and months ahead.\nOn the question of U.S. citizens and human rights more broadly, let me just say this.\u00a0 First, human rights are always on the agenda for the United States.\u00a0 It\u2019s who we are.\u00a0 And indeed, I discussed human rights in our meetings with our Saudi counterparts over the past few days, and also made clear that progress on human rights strengthens our relationship.\u00a0 We will continue to underscore, both publicly and privately, the importance that we place on human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThere\u2019s something else that\u2019s very important, and the foreign minister alluded to it.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia has embarked on a major effort, a historic effort to modernize its economy, to modernize its society.\u00a0 And part of that is going to be attracting to Saudi Arabia the best talent from around the world to visit, to pursue education, to invest, to partner, to work alongside Saudis.\u00a0 In our judgment, Vision 2030, as this initiative is called, will be a much more successful effort if Saudi Arabia is the most attractive place possible for people around the world to come to.\u00a0 And so I think it\u2019s on its own merits and in Saudi Arabia\u2019s interests to continue to pursue this modernization, including the expansion of human rights.\nWith regard to American citizens, as you know, and as you\u2019ve heard me say many times, the welfare, the security of American citizens everywhere around the world is my number-one priority and responsibility.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the focus of the Department of State as well.\u00a0 We continue to advocate on behalf of individuals to the greatest extent possible.\u00a0 I had the opportunity to raise specific cases.\u00a0 And beyond that, I won\u2019t go into details \nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Sky News, (inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) First question may be addressed to His Highness, His Royal Highness Prince.\u00a0 With all the efforts carried out, undertaken by Saudi Arabia \u2013 the efforts to conclude all these agreements regarding this \u2013 the Saudi territories.\nMr. Blinken, you said this morning that you do not want Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists.\u00a0 So how can you reconcile this and with the withdrawal of America from Afghanistan, which has opened the floor for terrorists, likes of which took place this morning in Afghanistan with many victims?\u00a0 So how can you reconcile?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) With regard to Afghanistan, I would like to express our heartfelt thanks for the good care and attention that we have had from the American side.\nIn dealing with the situation in Sudan, we have achieved a certain success.\u00a0 It has not been a complete success because the parties did not commit fully to the agreement.\u00a0 We shall do everything possible to alleviate the situation in Sudan and to reach agreements between the concerned parties.\u00a0 There are various legal issues that are underway; we may reach additional mechanism that would help us resolve the situation and to penalize any party that may deviate.\nAnd we address our talk once again to our brother in Sudan, all of them, to spare the blood of the Sudanese and that we may work together to address this crisis through dialogue, away from armament, for that will not lead to any positive results.\u00a0 It will only result in further victims.\u00a0 Let\u2019s therefore move towards dialogue and towards dealing with the situation in peaceful manners such as to spare the citizens the dangers of such crises.\u00a0 I am fully confident that our brothers in Sudan will rise up to the responsibility and respond positively to spare the citizens further demolitions and further hardships.\u00a0 We shall rely on our brothers in America and all other partners to move towards that solution.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to Afghanistan, we\u2019ve made clear and we\u2019ve demonstrated since ending America\u2019s longest war that we would continue to be focused on our core national security interest in preventing the resurgence of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, and if necessary, taking action to deal with it.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve demonstrated quite clearly in recent months our ability to do just that, including eliminating a senior leader of al-Qaida, who was resident in Afghanistan.\u00a0 In addition, we\u2019re working with partners, with neighbors to strengthen the capacity to deal with any terrorism that may be located in Afghanistan and emanating from there.\nAt the same time, of course, the Taliban is an implacable enemy of ISIS-Khorasan and is itself taking action against that group.\u00a0 But regardless of that, we\u2019ve been very clear, and as I said, we\u2019ve demonstrated our ongoing enduring capacity to take necessary actions to protect our security against any terrorism that may be emanating from Afghanistan.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) the last question.\u00a0 Yes, you have the floor.\n(In English) Al-Monitor, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Foreign Minister, has America\u2019s reduced military footprint in the region created opportunities for China to forge deeper relationships with Saudi Arabia and others?\u00a0 And second, critics of Syria\u2019s regional reintegration say Bashar al-Assad has done nothing to merit it.\u00a0 Does Saudi Arabia \u2013 sorry, did Saudi Arabia set any conditions in exchange for a serious return to the Arab fold?\u00a0 And Mr. Secretary, do you fear that China is seen as a more reliable partner in the region than the U.S.?\u00a0 And on Syria, the U.S. has asked countries who normalize to get something in exchange from Assad for their re-engagement.\u00a0 Do you have any evidence that normalization has yet resulted in any meaningful concessions?\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0 So China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u00a0 China is our largest trading partner.\u00a0 So naturally, there is a lot of interaction and intersection with China.\u00a0 China is an important partner for the kingdom and most countries in the region, and I think that partnership has given us and China significant benefits.\u00a0 And that cooperation is likely to grow just because of China\u2019s economic impact in the region and beyond is likely to grow as its economy continues to grow.\nBut we still have a robust security partnership with the U.S.\u00a0 That security partnership is refreshed on an almost daily basis.\u00a0 We have military exercises that are almost constantly going on, so we have cooperation, intelligence-sharing, et cetera, as we see in the effort in Sudan, as we see in what we\u2019re doing together in Yemen.\u00a0 The partnership with the U.S. remains robust and strong, especially in those areas.\nSo I don\u2019t ascribe to this zero-sum game.\u00a0 I think we are all capable of having multiple partnerships and multiple engagements, and the U.S. does the same in many instances. \u00a0So I am not caught up in this really negative view of this.\u00a0 I think we can \u2013 we can actually build a partnership that crosses these borders.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ve heard statements also from the U.S. about a desire to find pathways to better cooperation, even with China.\u00a0 So I think the \u2013 we can only encourage that, because we see the future in cooperation, we see the future in collaboration, and that means between everybody.\nOn Syria, it\u2019s very important that we understand the context.\u00a0 The context is that the status quo was not working and was generating an ever-increasing burden on countries of the region and on the people of Syria.\u00a0 Regardless of what one thinks about Bashar al-Assad, we \u2013 the only pathway to resolving the humanitarian challenges that we face in the aftermath of the Syrian crisis is to find a pathway to addressing the main issues, and for our perspective, the humanitarian are the main concern.\u00a0 How do we ensure that there is a safe pathway for refugees to return?\u00a0 How do we ensure that there is some political reconciliation?\u00a0 How do we address the issue of drugs?\u00a0 All of these things require a dialogue with Damascus.\nAnd you will have seen the statement issued after our meeting in Amman, which we held before the return to the Arab League, in which Syria made very clear commitments on all of those fronts to work with us to address them in a way that meets the expectations not just of us in the region, but of the international community.\u00a0 And we are now going to pursue those commitments made by Damascus.\nIn the end, we have to think about the humanitarian issue.\u00a0 We have to think about the people of Syria and how do we alleviate the situation that they\u2019re living in.\u00a0 And we believe that this is the best pathway forward.\u00a0 The other efforts that had been ongoing have shown no progress for many years and only increased the difficulty of the situation.\u00a0 I mean, if you look at Lebanon, which is already in a very, very difficult economic situation, they cannot carry this burden of two million Syrian refugees for much longer.\u00a0 And in order to avoid a situation where they are at risk, we need to find a way for them to return safely.\nSo we believe that this path can deliver results where others have not, and we will work very closely with the U.S. and others to ensure that that is within the expectations of the international community, including in line with the United Nations Security Council resolutions that are relevant to the situation.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So with regard to China, I would give almost the identical answer to the foreign minister.\nFirst, our engagement in the region, our partnerships in the region, our work in the region is not about any other country.\u00a0 It\u2019s about these partnerships and the benefits that we can bring by working together \u2013 benefits we can bring to our people, benefits in many cases that we can bring to people around the world \u2013 and I described some of those earlier.\nAt the same time and more specifically, with regard to China, we\u2019ve also been very clear we\u2019re not asking anyone to choose between the United States and China.\u00a0 We are simply trying to demonstrate the benefits of our partnership and the affirmative agenda that we bring in what we\u2019re trying to do.\u00a0 In everything that I\u2019ve heard over the last two-and-a-half years and over the last three days from partners throughout the region \u2013 again, many of whom were here in Riyadh \u2013 the United States remains the number one partner of choice for, I think, most countries in the region.\nWith regard to Syria, again, no secret that we did not think that Syria merited readmission to the Arab League, but at the same time, we also see that we have the same goals when it comes to what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u00a0 Now, our position has been very clear:\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to be in the business of normalizing relations with Assad, with that regime.\u00a0 It has not earned that step toward recognition, toward acceptance.\u00a0 But because the goals are very much the same, I think moving forward, and, as the foreign minister described, we\u2019ll see if we can achieve some progress.\nWe all want to reach a solution in Syria that\u2019s consistent with the key United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254.\u00a0 We want to expand humanitarian access for the people of Syria.\u00a0 We want to ensure, of course, that ISIS can\u2019t re-emerge.\u00a0 We want safe conditions for the eventual return of refugees.\u00a0 We want to counter Captagon trafficking, which is doing so much damage in the region.\u00a0 We want to reduce Iranian influence.\nSo what we\u2019ve heard and what you just heard again from the foreign minister is the intent of our partners to use direct engagement with the Assad regime to further demand progress in these areas and other areas over the coming months.\u00a0 Now, I have to admit we are skeptical of Assad\u2019s willingness to take the necessary steps, but we\u2019re aligned with our partners here on what those steps are and on the ultimate objectives.\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n(Via interpreter) This will conclude this press conference, so thank you, Your Highnesses, and all the participants.\n(In English) Thank you so much for joining us here in Riyadh.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD: (Via translation) At the beginning, it is a great pleasure to welcome you to Riyadh, the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. \u00a0And I am confident that our meetings will be crowned with success by building on what we have achieved together in our alliance against ISIS and continuing our concerted, integrated and coordinated efforts in the coming days.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always believed that the best path to security, stability, development, and prosperity requires the continuation of our collective efforts in combating terrorism and its criminal groups and confronting extremist ideology that contradicts all religious, human, and moral values.\nMy country will continue to make every possible effort in cooperation with all of you to support the efforts of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, to eliminate all its criminal activities and extensions wherever they are, and to confront its satanic attempts to exploit and recruit children and youth, and to dry up its sources of funding and support.\nThe Kingdom is also very keen on the independence of the countries whose territories has been exploited by ISIS to implement its destructive plans, including Syria and Iraq.\nWe commend the decisive efforts made by Iraq and the continuous coordination with the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. In appreciation of the efforts of our brothers in Iraq, the Kingdom has contributed to financing reconstruction projects in Iraq.\nWe also extend our thanks and appreciation to the working groups of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS terrorist organization for their efforts in combating ISIS and preventing its spread.\nI am pleased to announce that the Kingdom has joined the presidency of the Coalition\u2019s Africa Focus Group, to confront the dangers of ISIS, joining the United States, Morocco, Italy, and Niger. I also welcome the establishment of a focus group concerned with combating ISIS in Khorasan Province in Afghanistan, as this group will constitute a focus for limiting the presence and spread of the terrorist organization in those areas.\nYour Highnesses, and Excellencies.\u00a0 As the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes fighting ideology through ideas, uprooting the scourge of terrorism from its roots, and rejecting hatred and extremism, the Kingdom has established several centers to combat terrorism and extremist ideas. The most important of which is the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, Etidal, which aims to combat extremist ideology and its messages, spread the principles of tolerance, promote a culture of moderation, combat activities and limit their effects, and provide media campaigns to mitigate the media influence of ISIS, in cooperation with our partners at the regional and international levels.\nDear attendees, we must all work to block any opportunity that this organization can exploit to co-opt and recruit new followers. Therefore, I call on the Defeat ISIS Action Group to focus, during its campaigns, on combating everything that would insult religious symbols and sanctities, deliberate provocative actions, and all practices that destabilize security and stability that ISIS and extremist groups may exploit to implement their propaganda, at a time when the world needs to work together to reject extremism, while spreading the values of dialogue and tolerance.\nOur battle against extremism and terrorism requires additional efforts to win minds and hearts, not only through media, cultural and educational tools with their supreme importance, but also by presenting a live practical model for a better future based on tolerance, openness, sustainable development, and prosperity, which is embodied in the vision of the Kingdom, vision 2030, where our sons and daughters create the future and celebrate life. They are the goals of the vision, and they are also the pillars of achieving it.\nIn conclusion, thank you all for coming and participating in this meeting, through which we hope to contribute to achieving security, stability, and prosperity to build a great future for our future generations. Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Faisal, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you for hosting us today and thank you \u2013 and thanks to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its significant contributions to our shared work to defeat ISIS as a founding member of this coalition and through its leadership today.\u00a0 And it\u2019s so good to see so many colleagues here with us in Riyadh.\nSince we came together in 2014, our coalition has grown into an 86-member force, bringing together countries and organizations from every part of the world.\nTogether, we have achieved the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. \u00a0We\u2019ve taken out or captured its leadership. \u00a0We\u2019ve prevented large-scale attacks. \u00a0And we\u2019ve invested billions in stabilizing liberated areas and rebuilding the region.\nOur progress is a testament to the strength of this coalition \u2013 and the courage of our partners on the ground.\nBut for all our progress, the fight is not yet done. \u00a0So today, I\u2019d like to briefly focus on what we see as the most urgent areas for focus to achieve the enduring defeat of ISIS.\nFirst: stabilization assistance across Iraq and Syria. \u00a0Poor security and humanitarian conditions, lack of economic opportunity \u2013 these are the fuel for the kind of desperation on which ISIS feeds and recruits. \u00a0So we have to stay as committed to our stabilization goals as we\u2019ve been to our military campaign that resulted in the victory on the battlefield.\nToday, we\u2019re announcing a funding goal for the Stabilization Pledge Drive of just over $601 million \u2013 and I\u2019m announcing that the United States is committing $148.7 million to that fund. \u00a0This support will meet critical needs that Syrians and Iraqis themselves have identified, addressing vulnerabilities previously exploited by ISIS, closing gaps in local needs, including for essential services, education, community reintegration, accountability for crimes.\nSecond: repatriations of foreign terrorist fighters and their family members. \u00a0Repatriation is critical to reducing the populations of both displaced persons camps, like al-Hol, and detention centers holding nearly 10,000 ISIS fighters, 2,000 of whom are from countries other than Syria and Iraq.\nFailure to repatriate foreign terrorist fighters risks the possibility that they could again take up arms and attempt to restore ISIS\u2019s so-called \u201ccaliphate,\u201d terrorize communities that we\u2019re working to stabilize and rebuild, and potentially threaten our homelands.\nAl-Hol currently hosts 50,000 displaced persons, most of whom are women and children, half of whom are under the age of 12. \u00a0Some of these children know nothing other than life in al-Hol. \u00a0Leaving these children in camps condemns them to lives marked by danger, the denial of basic health care, the denial of education \u2013 the denial of hope. \u00a0So even as we prioritize addressing the serious security and humanitarian needs at al-Hol and other camps, we know that repatriation is the only durable solution.\nWe are, fortunately, making some progress. \u00a0Last year, more foreign nationals were repatriated from northeast Syria than in the previous two years combined. \u00a0So far in 2023, 14 countries have repatriated over 2,000 of their nationals \u2013 including hundreds of children who are now able to have a new chance at life.\nWe\u2019re grateful to the many countries who have stepped up: the Iraqi Government, which since 2021 has led the way, bringing home nearly 5,000 of its nationals from northeast Syria, including hundreds of fighters; countries, including in Central Asia, which have brought home many of their nationals; Kuwait, which serves as a critical transit hub for these repatriations.\nThe United States stands ready to assist with repatriation, providing diplomatic and logistical assistance, as well as aiding with rehabilitation, reintegration, and, where applicable, investigation and efforts to ensure accountability through prosecution.\nOur third area of focus as a coalition must be keeping pace with the evolving threat. \u00a0The security situation throughout the Sahel and much of West Africa has deteriorated significantly over the past several years. \u00a0(Inaudible) farmers ambushed in North Kivu province. \u00a0Today, Africa is home to nearly half of global terrorism deaths.\nOur Africa Focus Group \u2013 joined today by the newest member of the coalition, Togo \u2013 is helping crystalize our focus on the terrorist threat in the region. \u00a0That was very much on display in Niamey, where 38 coalition members and observers recently came together to boost regional collaboration, including by endorsing the Focus Group Action Plan.\u00a0 That will strengthen border security, collect biometrics of terrorists, counter ISIS propaganda and financing, and more. \u00a0The United States is supporting these efforts \u2013 and has just pledged $130 million to enhance civilian counterterrorism capacity in sub-Saharan Africa, including over $22 million for partnerships with Coastal West Africa.\nAt the same time, we remain vigilant against the evolving threat posed by ISIS-Khorasan. \u00a0All of us are determined to see to it that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists. \u00a0I\u2019m grateful to the United Kingdom for its work on this front. \u00a0The United States is bolstering our collective efforts with over $30 million in new counterterrorism programming for Central Asia, coming on top of $50 million we\u2019ve invested in capacity building for the region.\nFinally, we remain focused on cutting off ISIS\u2019s ability to raise and move funds across multiple jurisdictions, including the General Directorate of Provinces. \u00a0Today, I\u2019m announcing the designation of two ISIS GDP leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists \u2013 the Iraq-based Bilad al-Rafidayn Office emir and a Sahel-based al-Furqan Office senior leader.\nThe global community \u2013 so much of it represented here today \u2013 faces no shortage of security challenges. \u00a0Recent years have demonstrated the progress that we can achieve with steadfast determination. \u00a0I\u2019m confident that today will advance the collective commitment to defeat ISIS and finally eliminate the scourge of terrorism around the world.\nThank you very much.\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 So let me first say what a pleasure it is to be in Oslo for the first time in my capacity as Secretary of State and also wonderful to be in this absolutely magnificent museum.\u00a0 The only regret is that we don\u2019t have a little bit more time to spend here.\u00a0\nI very much want to thank Norway for the incredibly warm welcome and for hosting this informal NATO ministerial meeting.\u00a0 As a founding member of NATO and the eyes and ears of the Alliance on the northern flank, Norway is a critical partner and critical to transatlantic security.\u00a0 And we just saw that again last week when the USS\u00a0Gerald Ford,\u00a0the world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier, arrived in Oslo for training exercises.\nHere in Secretary General Stoltenberg\u2019s hometown, let me also say how grateful I am to Jens for his remarkable leadership of our Alliance these past few years \u2013 truly a crucial moment for the Alliance.\u00a0 Jens has brought a remarkably strong and steady hand to NATO, and as a result \u2013 no small measure, thanks to his leadership \u2013 NATO is facing the future stronger, bigger, and more united than ever.\nWe had a very productive discussion today to prepare for the NATO Summit in Vilnius that will take place next month.\u00a0 We focused on advancing our unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s brutal aggression.\u00a0 As we look to Vilnius, we remain dedicated to the principles underpinning our Alliance, including, of course, Article 5 and our shared commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory.\u00a0\nWe continue to strengthen and modernize the Alliance as we head to Vilnius.\u00a0 On April 4th, of course, we welcome Finland as our 31st Ally, adding another first-rate military and enhancing our presence in the High North and the Black Sea[1].\u00a0 We\u2019re continuing to work to complete the accession process for Sweden, another very strong and capable partner, and we fully anticipate doing so by the time the leaders meet in Vilnius.\u00a0 These additions will make both Finland and Sweden safer and make NATO stronger.\u00a0 And our defensive Alliance is and always will keep its door open to new members.\nWe appreciate the efforts of Allies, like Norway, who\u2019ve made concrete plans to meet the Wales Pledge and spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense.\u00a0 And we look forward to coming out of Vilnius with a strengthened pledge to provide the resources necessary to improve the readiness of our militaries, increase our resilience, and keep pace with emerging challenges like cyber defense and climate security.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re also deepening our coordination with key partners in the Indo-Pacific, building on our shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0\nAs the people of Ukraine demonstrate incredible courage and sacrifice, the United States, the European Union, and countries around the world continue to support their fight to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity and the right to choose their own path.\u00a0 Together, we have committed billions of dollars in security assistance, including our recent pledge to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 aircraft, which Norway is also considering.\u00a0 We\u2019ve imposed severe sanctions on Russia\u2019s economy and war machine.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing vital humanitarian, economic, and energy assistance.\u00a0\nNorway has been an essential partner in this effort from day one.\u00a0 Going back to February of 2022, Norway has provided more than $2.3 billion in support of Ukraine \u2013 including air defenses and other weapons \u2013 and has pledged now $7.5 billion in aid over the next five years.\u00a0 As Europe\u2019s leading supplier of natural gas, Norway has been instrumental in helping Europe transition away from Russian energy, which the United States remains committed to supporting.\u00a0 And the people of Norway have welcomed some 43,000 Ukrainian refugees, who are finding new homes and even learning Norwegian.\u00a0\nIn today\u2019s discussion, many Allies also expressed concern about increased tensions in northern Kosovo and strongly condemned the recent attacks on KFOR troops, and we\u2019re thinking today of our Italian and Hungarian colleagues who were injured in that attack.\u00a0 We call on the Governments of Kosovo and Serbia to take immediate steps to de-escalate tensions and renew efforts to implement the EU-led normalization agreements.\u00a0 We support the process of Euro-Atlantic integration for Kosovo and for Serbia, but the current escalation hinders \u2013 rather than helps \u2013 the efforts to move in that direction.\u00a0\nIn addition to our informal NATO ministerial, I appreciated very much the chance to meet with Prime Minister St\u00f8re yesterday evening, and I\u2019ll be meeting shortly with my friend and colleague, the foreign minister, to discuss the very robust bilateral relationship between our countries, which is growing from strength.\u00a0\nLast year, a new supplementary Defense Cooperation Agreement entered into force, modernizing how our militaries collaborate.\u00a0\nNorway is leading the world in advancing clean energy technologies, with electric vehicles now making up 80 percent of new cars sold here over the last year.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue partnering with Norway to combat the climate crisis, from reducing deforestation to making shipping greener.\nAnd of course, our countries are Arctic allies.\u00a0 I look forward to discussing with the foreign minister Norway\u2019s assumption of the chair of the Arctic Council.\u00a0 We\u2019re eager to work with likeminded allies to advance our vision of a peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative Arctic.\u00a0\nTo deepen our own engagement in the High North, I\u2019m announcing today that the United States will be opening an American Presence Post in Troms\u00f8 \u2013 our northernmost diplomatic mission and only such facility above the Arctic Circle.\u00a0\nSo I very much appreciated the opportunity to discuss these efforts with both our Norwegian and NATO Allies.\u00a0 We covered a lot of ground today in preparation for Vilnius.\u00a0 And I think based on the discussions today, we can anticipate a very productive summit when our leaders meet in July.\u00a0 With that, happy to take some questions.\u00a0\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 First question is for Shaun Tandon with AFP.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Can I follow up on a couple of things you just said?\u00a0 You said that the door remains open to Ukraine.\u00a0 Here in the talks leading up to the Vilnius Summit, what political commitments do you think NATO should give to Ukraine, if any, at this point, in addition to the military aid?\u00a0 Excuse me.\u00a0\nAnd on the issue of Kosovo, you mentioned the call to de-escalate tensions.\u00a0 You\u2019ve criticized the leaders in Pristina for the actions that they\u2019ve taken.\u00a0 How much leverage does the United States or do other NATO members have over those decisions?\u00a0 And how do you assess the role of Belgrade and Moscow in this?\u00a0\nAnd with your indulgence, can I just briefly ask about the situation in Sudan?\u00a0 You have the breakdown of the talks there, the army withdrawing.\u00a0 Are you optimistic at all of talks restarting or a peace process restarting at some point?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thanks very much, Shaun.\u00a0 So with regard to Ukraine, I think, based on the discussions today, the first thing I\u2019d say is that at Vilnius, when the leaders meet for the summit, we and our friends in Ukraine can anticipate a very robust package of both political and practical support.\u00a0 Everyone here stands behind the Bucharest commitment.\u00a0 That hasn\u2019t changed.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused intensely on what we can do to strengthen even more the relationship between Ukraine and NATO and to continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards, interoperability.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019ll see that be a feature of the Summit in Vilnius, as well as strengthening the political relationship between NATO and Ukraine.\u00a0 So again, I\u2019d anticipate, based on discussions today, that there will be a strong package of support.\nNow, what we were doing today is not decisional.\u00a0 This was really an opportunity on the eve \u2013 almost the eve \u2013 of the summit to compare notes and to make sure that when we get to the summit we do so in a way that\u2019s characterized our entire approach to the crisis in Ukraine and to Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, and that is united together and moving forward.\u00a0 So you\u2019ll see that both in terms of support for Ukraine; you\u2019ll see that in terms of our ongoing commitment to strengthen our own Alliance to make sure that it is properly postured for any Russian aggression; and I think you\u2019ll also see that in NATO looking at a whole series of other challenges, many of which we\u2019ve focused on addressing, including with our new Strategic Concept.\u00a0\nWith regard to Kosovo, the escalation there and the actions taken there move both Kosovo and Serbia in the wrong direction, because the answer that we\u2019re looking for is de-escalation, avoiding any unilateral actions, and returning to this normalization process and the EU-led effort that is what promises both of them a future of integration in the Euro-Atlantic community.\u00a0 And in a sense, when we\u2019re talking about leverage, that\u2019s it.\u00a0 That, I think, meets clearly the aspirations of people in both countries. \u00a0If either country is taking steps that actually make that a more distant prospect, that\u2019s actually not going to serve the interests of their people.\nWe\u2019ve been very clear in our concerns about some of the recent actions that were taken.\u00a0 We\u2019ve said that directly to the leaders involved, including Prime Minister Kurti.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking for both to act responsibly going forward.\nSudan, we have been very much engaged \u2013 and I\u2019ve been very much engaged \u2013 in trying to get a ceasefire.\u00a0 We did \u2013 very imperfect.\u00a0 We got it extended a few times.\u00a0 We did see the provision of humanitarian assistance moving forward.\u00a0 But it has been incredibly imperfect and incredibly fragile, and now we\u2019re seeing actions \u2013 again, by both sides \u2013 in clear violation of the commitments they\u2019ve made in terms of the ceasefire.\u00a0 So that also is not the right direction to be heading, and it\u2019s certainly not what\u2019s in the interests of the people of Sudan.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll continue to be engaged.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re also looking at steps that we can take to make clear our views on any leaders who are moving Sudan in the wrong direction, including by perpetuating the violence and by violating the ceasefires that they\u2019ve actually committed to.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now.\nMR MILLER: \u00a0Mattia Bagnoli with ANSA.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr.\u00a0 Secretary, for the opportunity.\u00a0 I want to go back to Kosovo for a second, please.\u00a0 Regarding the rising tensions that we are seeing over there, NATO has already announced an increase in its presence.\u00a0 And is the U.S. also ready to deploy more troops at Bondsteel base?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So the United States already has forces there as part of the existing -mission.\u00a0 The plus-up \u2013 we have several hundred forces as part of the KFOR mission.\u00a0 The plus-up that was announced by NATO I don\u2019t think will involve additional U.S. forces.\u00a0 But as I said, there are already U.S. forces as part of the KFOR mission.\u00a0 There are now an additional roughly 700 troops who will be added to the approximately, I think, 4,000 or so who are already there.\u00a0\nBut again, the most important thing is for the parties themselves to de-escalate, to stop engaging in unilateral actions, and to return to the EU-led dialogue.\u00a0 That is the path forward.\u00a0 That is what we are strongly urging both parties to do.\u00a0 That\u2019s very much our expectation for what we\u2019ll see in the in the days and weeks ahead.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0The next question is from Will Mauldin with\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I wanted to follow up on Shaun\u2019s question and ask, based on the conversations that you heard at the informal meeting \u2013 a group of \u2013 the majority of NATO countries, their foreign affairs committee chairman wrote today saying that there should be a clear path toward membership for Ukraine and a strong security guarantee.\u00a0 Is that something that\u2019s consistent with what you heard in the room or is there still a deep divide between those who want NATO membership for Ukraine and those who don\u2019t?\u00a0\nAnd then following up on where you said practical support for Ukraine, would that be some kind of scheduled weapons delivery or assistance long term, something like the U.S. provides for Israel or were you referring to something else?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well first, I think it\u2019s, again, very clear from today\u2019s discussion that every Ally stands by Bucharest.\u00a0 There is no division on that proposition.\u00a0 NATO is a consensus-driven organization, so any steps that we take have to be taken by consensus of all 31 countries who are currently members of the Alliance.\u00a0 As I said, when we\u2019re \u2013 when we\u2019re looking at Vilnius, our focus is twofold.\u00a0 First, we have an immediate focus, both through NATO but also on a individual basis, with the now more than 50 countries that have been supporting Ukraine, an immediate focus on maximizing our support in Ukraine \u2013 for Ukraine as it engages in a counteroffensive to take back its territory seized from it by Russia over the last year and a quarter.\u00a0\nAt the same time, we\u2019re also focused on helping Ukraine build up its medium\u2011 to long-term deterrence and defense capacity so that if and when the current aggression settles, Ukraine has the full capacity to deter and, if necessary, defend against future aggression.\u00a0 And NATO has a role in that in terms of the work that it can do to help bring Ukraine up to NATO standards in its planning, in its interoperability with NATO.\u00a0 And then individual countries are playing a role in that and will be playing a role in that, including by providing not only the immediate support to Ukraine, but also longer-term support so that, again, over time, Ukraine can fully build up its deterrent and defense capacity.\u00a0 We talked about all of that today.\u00a0 We of course have been engaged in that \u2013 in those discussions directly with Ukraine, other countries have as well, and I think you\u2019ll see a lot of that coming together in the weeks ahead.\u00a0\nBut the NATO piece of this is, as I said, strengthening the political relationship between Ukraine and NATO.\u00a0 I think the secretary general talked about some of the elements of that.\u00a0 But again, I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of the summit itself because, ultimately, these are decisions that the leaders have to make and finalize \u2013 but also, as I said, very practical support, including the work that NATO will do to help bring Ukraine fully up to NATO standards.\u00a0\nSo all of that will be coming forward in the next weeks.\u00a0 And as I said, my full expectation is there\u2019ll be a very strong package of support on both the political side and the practical side when the leaders get together in Vilnius.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0And the path towards NATO accession that the chairman mentioned, is that something that that was on the table today or that you could agreement on?\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0This was part of our discussion today, and I think we\u2019ll now have an opportunity, everyone will have an opportunity to discuss that back home with our respective leaders.\u00a0 And I fully anticipate that will be part of the conversation at Vilnius.\u00a0 But again, I\u2019m also confident the result in Vilnius will be a robust package of political and practical support for Ukraine.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Final question goes to Vilde Wikan with\u00a0Aftenposten.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, with increased tensions with Russia and Sweden and Finland joining NATO, has the Nordic region become more important for the United States?\u00a0 And can you elaborate a little bit on what the American Presence Post in Troms\u00f8 will entail?\u00a0 And can we also expect more American military presence in our area and in the High North?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, when it comes to Norway, when it comes to Finland, when it comes to Sweden, we of course have longstanding relationships, bilateral relationships, with all three countries that we very, very much appreciate.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019ve seen over the years we\u2019ve been working in a variety of ways with all three countries when it comes not just to security but to trying to deal with challenges both in Europe and in the region, but also well beyond, to include the Arctic but also to include global challenges \u2013 food security, energy security, global health, et cetera.\u00a0\nSo those partnerships have been vital for a long time.\u00a0 But now we have the development that Finland has joined Norway as a NATO Ally and Sweden will soon do the same thing.\u00a0 So that only enhances and strengthens the incredibly strong foundation that we\u2019ve had.\u00a0 For us, the Presence Post in Troms\u00f8 is really an ability to have a diplomatic footprint above the Arctic Circle, and as I said, it\u2019s the first one that we\u2019ve been able to have.\u00a0 Our entire approach is to make sure that the Arctic remains an area of peaceful cooperation.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the things that, especially in a world that is evermore challenged, that it\u2019s also evermore vital to preserve.\u00a0 And we\u2019re determined to do that.\nWe engage with indigenous peoples in the region.\u00a0 We\u2019re very focused, of course, with our partners on dealing with many of the challenges of climate change, natural resources, and, fundamentally, working together to make sure that the region remains peaceful.\u00a0 And I think having a diplomatic presence further north will only enable \u2013 further enable and enhance those efforts.\nBut again, when it comes to the three countries, we\u2019re building on a base of very strong bilateral partnerships and soon having all three as Allies in NATO.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks very much.\n\n\n[1]\u00a0Baltic Sea\n\n\n",

Johan.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to start off with asking each one of you to make a brief statement about the outcome of this meeting.\u00a0 And Mr. Secretary Blinken, could I have your comment on whether you find it troublesome that European Union and the U.S. have slightly different approaches in terms of trading with China?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, happy to start.\u00a0 Briefly, also picking up on that, first, this is now the fourth meeting of the Trade and Technology Council between the United States and the European Union.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve demonstrated throughout that we are focused on and actually making progress on addressing the most urgent challenges that our countries face, and doing it in a very collaborative and productive way.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been focused on building sustainable, resilient, diversified supply chains, something we know, after COVID, is particularly critical.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on collaborating \u2013 on making sure that critical minerals, which will be powering our economies going forward, are readily available and that we\u2019re collaborating on sharing information and working together to invest in them.\nWe have remarkable convergence, actually, when it comes to our approach on the major challenges we face, whether it\u2019s dealing with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, including some of the export controls that we\u2019ve collaborated on, including dealing with some of the challenges posed by China.\u00a0 And again, from our conversations and discussions, the word that comes to mind most is convergence.\u00a0 Together we\u2019ve been working on things like investment screening mechanisms, on coordinating, on export controls, on working, as I said, on diversifying supply chains, on dealing with some of nonmarket practices that we see.\nBut we start from exactly the same approach, which is that none of us are looking for confrontation, none of us are looking for a Cold War, and none of us are looking for decoupling.\u00a0 On the contrary, we all benefit from trade and investment with China.\u00a0 But, as opposed to decoupling, we are focused on de-risking.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve heard the same language coming from leaders on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 that is, being very clear-eyed about some of the challenges the relationship poses.\u00a0 And the TTC, in a very practical way, is focused on addressing them, and I think you\u2019ll see that in the conclusions of this meeting as well as the work that we\u2019re doing.\nFinally, I would say, and I\u2019ll let my colleagues address this as well, we\u2019re intensely focused on what we can do together to address both the opportunities and challenges posed by emerging technology.\u00a0 We had a very intensive and, I think, productive discussion on artificial intelligence today, including generative AI.\u00a0 I think we share a conviction that the TTC has an important role to play in helping establish voluntary codes of conduct that would be open to all likeminded countries, particularly because there\u2019s almost always a gap when new technologies emerge between the time at which those technologies emerge and have an impact on people and the time it takes for governments and institutions to figure out how to legislate or regulate about them.\nAnd we feel the fierce urgency of now, particularly when it comes to generative AI.\u00a0 And so \u2013 and I\u2019ll let my colleagues address this as well \u2013 one of the things we focused our conversation on today is how we can use the TTC to help advance, at least in the near term, voluntary codes of conduct that need to be open to a wide universe of countries so that we can mitigate some of the potential downsides and amplify the upsides of this extraordinary technology.\nMS VESTAGER:\u00a0 Maybe just to start off with a question of trades, in the European Union we\u2019re in the process of establishing an economic security strategy.\u00a0 The commission will table our approach mid-June for the European Council to discuss.\u00a0 And I think we see very much eye to eye on a number of these issues.\u00a0 For instance, when it comes to coercion, we have the anti-coercion instrument.\u00a0 This, of course, is part of the strategy, as well as export controls, so that we can, indeed, identify risks, deal with them, and then trade for the rest of it.\nImportant results: protecting children, minors, online \u2013 really important that we know that they are safe, but also that they are empowered.\u00a0 And I think we got a very good balance, because of course kids will be online, but they should be safe from harm.\u00a0 They should be safe from targeted advertising, and here we made a lot of progress.\nOn enabling researchers to get the necessary data to follow what is ongoing, we think that we can have the specifics already by Christmastime now we have the agreement in principle.\nAnd as of now, we need accountable artificial intelligence.\u00a0 Generative AI is a complete gamechanger.\u00a0 Of course we have had AI now for a very long time.\u00a0 It is used in many, many places.\u00a0 But generative AI is something new.\u00a0 You have had it at your fingertips.\u00a0 You\u2019ve seen colleagues using it for writing their articles.\u00a0 You have seen other colleagues using it for their research.\u00a0 Everyone knows that this is a powerful thing.\nSo within the next weeks we will advance a draft of an AI code of conduct, of course, also taking industry input, taking input from independents, and then, of course, invite colleagues to sign up for the drafting in order to have very, very soon a final proposal for a code of conduct for industry to commit to voluntarily.\u00a0 Because we have different legislative procedures, it will take two, three years at best before that would come into effect, and we\u2019re talking about a technological acceleration that is beyond belief.\u00a0 And here we think it\u2019s really important that citizens can see that democracies can deliver \u2013 of course, in legislation, but also in bridging the now and the legislative impact, and to do that in the broadest possible circle with our friends in Canada, in the UK, in Japan, in India, bringing as many on board as possible.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 The only thing that I would add, very briefly and in answer to your question about China, is to pick up on Secretary Blinken\u2019s comment of convergence.\u00a0 And the reason there\u2019s convergence is because our interests are aligned.\u00a0 Of course, the EU and the member-states will have to make their own decisions, as will the United States, as to what\u2019s in their best interest.\u00a0 But spending two days talking to our colleagues here, our interests are aligned as it relates to China, as it relates to having safeguards around AI, as it relates to promoting responsible innovation.\nAnd so I thought this was a very productive couple of days, one of the most \u2013 it\u2019s our fourth.\u00a0 Not surprisingly, as we all get to know each other a little bit better, develop even more trust, I think it\u2019s been among the most productive and some of the richest discussions.\u00a0 And I have no doubt that what will follow from this meeting will be some really concrete outcomes around responsible safeguards for artificial intelligence, better coordination around semiconductors and our semiconductor strategy, and just general convergence as we realize our interests are aligned and we continue to work together.\nMR DOMBROVSKIS:\u00a0 Well, on the trade side, I would emphasize our discussions on transatlantic initiatives on sustainable trade.\u00a0 And the concrete deliverable in this TTC is that we have agreed on a concrete work program to focus on and to really generally work towards this green transatlantic marketplace.\nWe just finished our stakeholders event, and it must be said that this message was coming also very clearly from the stakeholders, that they are expecting us to work together on the green transition.\u00a0 And we also agreed to instill new energy in our work on trade-facilitating measures, to look how we can advance in areas like conformity assessment, use of these tools for trade facilitation, and other steps in this area.\nThen we had extensive discussions on economic security.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken already mentioned our work on export controls, where our cooperation in TTC helped quite a bit, including to be able to quickly move on our export controls against Russia in context of its aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a broader question.\u00a0 We were also discussing economic coercion concerns coming from nonmarket economies and practices because we share many of those concerns.\u00a0 So obviously we need to discuss and coordinate our approaches, because then we are more efficient in our response.\u00a0 Thank you.\nAMBASSADOR TAI:\u00a0 And finally, I don\u2019t think I know you, so I suspect you\u2019re not a trade reporter.\u00a0 The only reason why I suspect you\u2019re not a trade reporter is because the way you put your question, I think, reveals that if you cover trade you will know that the U.S. and the EU have slightly \u2013 and more than slightly \u2013 different approaches to trade just across the board.\u00a0 And that is just an aspect of who we are, and it\u2019s always been true.\nBut that hasn\u2019t gotten in the way of our being powerfully influential partners in building the post-World War II economic world order.\u00a0 And at this point in time as well, this inflection point that President Biden identifies, it is not going to stop us.\u00a0 In fact, we will continue to build on that partnership to drive a new world economic order that drives a race to the top, that really takes our shared vision and values for the kind of world that we want our workers, our people, our children, our businesses to be able to thrive in.\u00a0 And I think that the TTC is a perfect manifestation of that vision at work.\nMS VESTAGER:\u00a0 Can I \u2013 just I\u2019m \u2013 because this is \u2013 we\u2019re all looking for proof of concept of the TTC.\u00a0 And the charger is proof of concept, because we now have a common standard for the mega-charging.\u00a0 So heavy-duty electrical vehicles \u2013 now we have the charging standards ready for infrastructure rollout here in Europe, over in the U.S.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very tangible, and we\u2019ve been addressing the question of standards from the very first TTC, and now you see that it\u2019s really working.\nAnd one of the reasons why it\u2019s really working is that we have the stakeholder community to support us, to challenge us, to ask us to be relevant for them and for their business on both sides of the Atlantic, and for the NGO community for the social partners, actually, to give us the necessary input.\u00a0 And I think that has been very, very true at this TTC as well.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 That was a long question, so we don\u2019t have much time left.\u00a0 If you allow, one last question.\u00a0 Yes, okay.\u00a0 Missy, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Missy Ryan,\u00a0Washington Post.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I\u2019d like to ask you a question about U.S.-China relations.\u00a0 And Secretary Raimondo and Ambassador Tai, if you want to add anything from where you sit, too, that would be great.\u00a0 But Secretary Blinken, the Pentagon issued a statement yesterday about what it said was a dangerous interaction between a U.S. jet and Chinese military plane, the second in six months.\u00a0 China has also lashed out at the United States over reports that it had rebuffed requests for meetings with Secretary Austin.\u00a0 And there have been a series of mutual accusations regarding commercial and trade practices in the last week.\nHow do you see all of this in the context of the Biden administration\u2019s hope for getting the bilateral relationship back in a better place, potentially rescheduling your visit?\u00a0 And more generally, how do you do the cooperate piece of your compete, cooperate, contest strategy when these things keep happening?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Missy.\u00a0 First, with regard to the planes, our planes were flying in international airspace on a routine mission.\u00a0 The Chinese pilot took dangerous action in approaching the plane very, very closely.\u00a0 There have been a series of these actions directed not just at us but at other countries in recent months.\nBut I think it only underscores why it is so important that we have regular, open lines of communication, including \u2013 by the way \u2013 between our defense ministers.\u00a0 It\u2019s regrettable that the meeting that Secretary Austin sought did not go forward with his Chinese counterpart.\u00a0 But for us, for President Biden, this underscores why it\u2019s so important that across the government, at the most senior levels, we are regularly engaged.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what President Biden sought to do when he met with President Xi Jinping in Bali last year and what they agreed to do and what we hope that we can back to, because it\u2019s clearly in the interest of both countries.\nThe most dangerous thing is not to communicate and, as a result, to have a misunderstanding, a miscommunication.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve said repeatedly, while we have a real competition with China, we also want to make sure that doesn\u2019t veer into conflict.\u00a0 And the most important starting point for that are regular lines of communication.\u00a0 It\u2019s also, by the way, what I think the world is looking for us to do.\nWhat I hear around the world is countries looking to the United States, Europe, China to manage the relationship that we have responsibly, and we very much seek to do that.\u00a0 We hope our Chinese counterparts will want to do the same so that, at the very least, we can avoid any unnecessary problems and, yes, hopefully build areas of cooperation where it\u2019s in our mutual interest \u2013 and where there\u2019s a demand signal as well from the world \u2013 that we work together.\u00a0 Some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about through the TTC would require, as well, cooperation and collaboration with China as well as with other major countries.\u00a0 We look to do that, and we hope we\u2019ll be able to proceed.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I would just add to that point of opening a dialogue.\u00a0 I had a productive meeting Thursday of last week in person with Minister Wang, the commerce secretary, who came to D.C.\u00a0 And it was a candid, direct, productive exchange where we tackled head on some of our issues related to economic coercion and other irritants, but also where we agreed to keep the channel of communication open in the hope that increased dialogue would lead to de-escalation of tension and an ability to solve problems.\nAMBASSADOR TAI:\u00a0\u00a0And I\u2019d like to recenter the conversation here at the TTC on the U.S. and EU relationship, speaking of channels of communication and how important it is to a vibrant bilateral relationship.\u00a0 Valdis and I committed to each other at the beginning of this year that, to keep the global steel and aluminum arrangement negotiations on track, that we would meet every month this year to ensure that our teams are on track to produce.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve kept that promise.\u00a0 And in fact, I just wanted to preview for you, Valdis and I are not just seeing each other this week here in Sweden.\u00a0 We will be seeing each other next week as well in person.\u00a0 And I just want to underscore the ambition that underlies this relationship across all the areas that you see represented by the different principals on the stage right now.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Unfortunately, we have to conclude because there is no time left.\u00a0 Thank you everybody for being here, and thank you to the principals for a very successful meeting today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 At the risk of repetition, I think you\u2019ll hear me in violent agreement with my friends and colleagues.\u00a0 But the first thing I want to say is this: It is so critical to us that not only are we having this stakeholders meeting, but that everything we do is infused with the views, the perspectives, the experience of stakeholders.\u00a0 It\u2019s a critical part of the TTC.\nOne of the things I think we\u2019ve learned \u2013 those of us who have been in government for some time now, including myself \u2013 is that more than ever before if we do not have stakeholders with us on the takeoff of every big issue, they\u2019re probably not going to be there on the landing, and what we do is not going to be sustainable.\u00a0 So we place tremendous value on having all of you here \u2013 but not just today, every day \u2013 as we\u2019re working through these challenges.\u00a0 And whether you traveled here in person, whether you\u2019re actually with us virtually today in some fashion, or many who are sharing their views in writing, thank you, thank you, thank you.\u00a0 Because it\u2019s an integral part of this process that we\u2019ve established.\nAnd I also want to give a special shoutout to the students among us here today.\u00a0 It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to say that what we\u2019re doing, what we\u2019re working on, will shape the future that you inherit, but there\u2019s another part of that, which is you need \u2013 and we\u2019re counting on you \u2013 to help us do that shaping.\u00a0 This is not simply something that we\u2019re doing now but we\u2019re eventually going to hand off to you.\u00a0 It\u2019s vitally important that your voices, your views, your perspectives be included.\u00a0 By definition, every new generation has a new way at looking at the challenges that any \u2013 that we\u2019re facing at any particular time and none of us have the monopoly on ideas, never mind good ideas.\u00a0 So your engagement\u2019s critical.\u00a0 And again, it\u2019s not just thinking about the future; it\u2019s actual the present, the now, where we really want that engagement.\nWorking together I think we share the same objective and that is to build a clean infrastructure and develop clean technologies for the future.\u00a0 This has the obvious imperative of addressing the climate challenge.\u00a0 It also \u2013 I think we\u2019re convinced \u2013 has the tremendous benefit of actually building new economies for the future that are going to be, or certainly can be, powerfully beneficial to all of the constituent elements of those economies, whether it\u2019s our workforce, whether it\u2019s our companies, whether it\u2019s our societies as a whole.\u00a0 Now, none of this happens automatically, none of it\u2019s easy, and we know that there are huge challenges in getting from here to there.\u00a0 But we\u2019re equally convinced that if we are able to do this together, we actually can succeed and can do this effectively.\nSome of us just came from a G7 meeting a few weeks ago, where on one level the good news is that the G7 countries, if you look at them, have each made commitments that, if fulfilled \u2013 and that\u2019s a big if \u2013 would keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the sort of good news.\u00a0 The less good news is the same cannot be said of the G20 and the same cannot be said if you go out even beyond the G20.\u00a0 So even in just making sure that we have the appropriate ambitions, again, the G7 is in a pretty good place, but we need to build out from there and that was some of the work that we actually were doing at the G7.\nSo we have a shared goal.\u00a0 We need to make sure that everyone is adapting and adopting the plans necessary to reach it, but then of course that\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 We actually have to implement it, and that\u2019s really where we know the challenge lies.\u00a0 But again, I think if we\u2019re able to not only have the vision necessary but actually convince all of our constituents that we can \u2013 all of us \u2013 wind up in a better place, we can get there.\nThe governments and private sectors have an enormous challenge in actually advancing a fair and efficient clean energy transition at the scale and pace that\u2019s needed to achieve the goals.\u00a0 So it is bringing us up to scale and then, of course, it\u2019s moving quickly on.\u00a0 We all know that the decisions and the actions that we take over the next seven years, the remainder of this decade, are going to determine whether or not we\u2019re able to reach the goals that many of us have set for halfway through the century \u2013 2050.\nOne other thing I just wanted to emphasize \u2013 and it\u2019s something that Valdis and Katherine also touched on \u2013 when we\u2019re looking at this question of fairness, we want to ensure not only a level playing field\u00a0\u2013 as vital and as important as that is \u2013 we\u2019re also working through the TTC, including \u2013 for example, via the semiconductor early warning system that we\u2019ve established through the Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue that you\u2019ve heard alluded to \u2013 to try to build sustainable, resilient supply chains that are free, for example, from forced labor, and immune from economic coercion.\u00a0 Those are vital aspects of the future, too, and we have strong constituencies that are insisting that we move in that direction.\nWe also use the TTC to actually elevate environmental, social, and government standards as we build diverse, sustainable, and secure supply chains.\u00a0 Ultimately what we\u2019re about, if we do things right, is creating a race to the top, not a race to the bottom.\u00a0 And if it\u2019s a race to the top that everyone participates in, no matter where they\u2019re from, no matter which country they are, that\u2019s a good thing, and that\u2019s what we want to encourage.\nAs you heard Valdis say as well, it\u2019s so vitally important that we coordinate together through the TTC to make sure that, for example, some of the incentives that we\u2019re putting in place to create that race to the top are properly coordinated and don\u2019t actually inadvertently create some kind of zero sum game race to the bottom.\u00a0 On both sides of the Atlantic, we have now unleashed incredibly powerful incentives to try to drive innovation and complement and spur private sector investment, but we\u2019ve got to do it in a way, again, that is complementary.\u00a0 So the incentives dialogue that we\u2019ve established that was announced by President Biden and Commission President von der Leyen back in March not only ensures that the incentive programs are mutually reinforcing but it also facilitates sharing information and also joint action to address the non-market practices that some are engaged in, including China.\nFinally, all of this is very resource intensive, but money is not the only challenge that we face.\u00a0 There are other issues that are vitally important that we discussed, all of us together, that are obstacles in the way of faster deployment of clean technology at a scale, so that we can actually make a difference.\u00a0 Developing new clean technologies like solid-state batteries of the future, hydrogen and other clean fuels, carbon-capture technologies \u2013 all of these require a whole ecosystem of support beyond simply the financial resources or subsidies that may come along.\u00a0 Creating the technological industrial base on both sides of the Atlantic requires all of us to engage, to do more, and especially to listen to each other, to make the necessary adjustments.\u00a0 Because some of this, it\u2019s so new that there\u2019s trial and error involved.\u00a0 It\u2019s iterative, and we\u2019re going to make mistakes.\u00a0 We have to adjust it.\nAnd we\u2019re taking big bets on ultimately our most important asset, and that\u2019s the innovators and investors, some of whom are in the audience today, who are really fundamentally going to drive all of this progress.\u00a0 Governments, ultimately, I think have to be about facilitating, catalyzing, sometimes simply getting out of the way, as well as making sure that, to the best of our ability, the standards that we set for ourselves that society ultimately wants and demands, that we\u2019re safeguarding those as well.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a challenging balancing act.\nSo again, I\u2019m really grateful for the fact that we brought everyone here together.\u00a0 I want to thank you for kicking us off.\u00a0 And I think most of us are just eager to listen to our colleagues.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0\u00a0 Lule\u00e5 is the place.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0 Right now, we are, as we all know, at F 21, an air force wing in northern Sweden, and while we are here, the Arctic Challenge Exercise, the ACE, is taking place at F 21 as well.\u00a0 Both Swedish-made Gripen fighters and American-made F-16s can be seen operating in the air during the ACE.\nThe north of Sweden is geographically very important for the Swedish armed forces as it provides strategic depth for us and for our neighboring countries.\u00a0 The Russian border is actually a six-and-a-half-hour drive from here.\u00a0 Filling the territorial gap in the north will be one of Sweden\u2019s many security contributions to NATO when we join the Alliance.\nOn that note, let me express my deep appreciation for the United States support for Sweden\u2019s NATO accession.\u00a0 That means a lot to us.\u00a0 We have applied for NATO membership because we realize we need to defend freedom and democracy together, but also because we want to bring our own capabilities to common use.\u00a0 As a member, Sweden will be a security provider to the entire Alliance.\nDuring our meeting, the Secretary and I have, of course, discussed the most acute security threat to our part of the world, Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 For Sweden and for the Swedish EU presidency, supporting Ukraine is a top priority.\u00a0 I\u2019m very grateful for and impressed by the strong U.S. commitment and the U.S. leadership of this big operation.\u00a0 It really proves the importance of transatlantic cooperation.\nWe also discussed the challenges and opportunities from new technology, issues that also will be discussed between the EU and the U.S. in the Trade and Technology Council taking place in Lule\u00e5 today and tomorrow.\u00a0 Green transition, innovation, and the tech industry, including 6G, are areas where two nations like Sweden and the U.S. have very many common interests, and common concerns as well, and we should and we could work even closer together.\nIn northern Sweden, we show in practice how innovation and growth and green transition can go hand-in-hand.\u00a0 Here Sweden has unique natural resources, rare earth metals, and by tradition, cheap, reliable, and fossil-free electricity, not least thanks to hydro power.\nIn January this year, it was announced that Europe\u2019s largest deposit for rare earth metals is in Kiruna, just some 350 kilometers from here.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty close, if you ask the locals.\u00a0 And it shows that Sweden has a bright future as a mining nation \u2013 increasingly important, again, for the green transition.\nI\u2019m happy to conclude that the relations between Sweden and the United States are very strong, with plenty of potential for deepening cooperation both as bilateral partners and as future NATO Allies.\nOver to you, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, Prime Minister, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you for the very, very good meeting that we had.\u00a0 Thank you for your wonderful hospitality here.\u00a0 I am grateful to be here to be with you and also our colleagues from the European Union as we engage in the fourth round of the Trade and Technology Council meetings that will start, actually, tonight with dinner, but then in full force tomorrow.\nBut we\u2019re in Sweden, and then on to Norway and to Finland, at a critical time for our countries and our people \u2013 a time of historic strategic convergence between the United States and partners across Europe.\u00a0 And I think \u2013 without speaking for you, Prime Minister, I think we both have that shared assessment of this convergence on the most important issues of our time.\nThe United States and Sweden are working more closely together than ever on a wide variety of shared interests: Ukraine, Sweden\u2019s NATO accession, our bilateral security partnership, and indeed, here in Lule\u00e5, as you heard, Sweden just hosted the Arctic Challenge Exercise 23, joined by the United States and NATO; the climate crisis, where Sweden is a leading partner in the First Movers Coalition, something we saw firsthand today; and our efforts to ensure that the Arctic remains a region free from conflict, where nations act responsibly and in accordance with international law, and economic development and investment take place in a sustainable, secure, and transparent manner.\nTomorrow, as noted, we are going to build on the progress that we\u2019ve made as the Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, the U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, and I join our European Union counterparts for the fourth meeting of the U.S.-EU TTC, the Trade and Technology Council.\u00a0 It is very fitting that we meet here in Lule\u00e5.\u00a0 This city is a model for so much of the work that we\u2019ve been doing and we\u2019ve been focused on through the TTC, from eliminating emissions in carbon-intensive industries to reducing our dependencies on unreliable or autocratic countries for the minerals that are used for products essential to our prosperity and security.\nOver the past two years, the TTC has enabled the United States and the European Union, which together make up nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s GDP, to align and shape a collective, affirmative economic and technological future that advances the values that we share, that bolsters our competitiveness, and that delivers tangible results for the people that we represent on both sides of the Atlantic.\nAt tomorrow\u2019s meeting, we\u2019ll focus on how to ensure that new and emerging technologies \u2013 as you heard from the prime minister \u2013 like AI, like quantum, like 6G enhance our competitive edge, benefit our citizens, and uphold democratic principles. \u00a0We\u2019ll continue to work on our supply chains and on accelerating the green transition, a great example of which we saw earlier today.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also discuss our joint efforts to address economic coercion and non-market economic policies and practices.\nThe work that we\u2019ve done over the past two years, including on export controls, has been critical to our efforts to ensure that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine remains a strategic failure.\u00a0 Tomorrow, we\u2019ll announce new actions that build on the export controls on the technology that\u2019s found in Iranian drones used to target Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure, to counter Russian misinformation and disinformation, to protect human rights defenders online.\nThen Foreign Minister Billstr\u00f6m and I will both travel to Oslo for the NATO Foreign Ministers meeting.\u00a0 As we prepare for the Leaders\u2019 Summit in Vilnius, we\u2019re continuing to make sure that our Alliance is stronger, more united, and better positioned to navigate a changing environment \u2013 from Putin\u2019s aggression in Europe, to the PRC challenge, to risks in space and cyberspace.\nSweden again and again has proven its commitment to NATO \u2013 to its values, to its mission, to its members.\u00a0 A strong, vibrant democracy with highly capable forces that have been working shoulder-to-shoulder with NATO members for years, for decades, it is fully dedicated to upholding the commitments that underpin our Alliance, including Article 5.\nBy joining NATO, Sweden undertakes a commitment to the security of every other Ally.\u00a0 No one should doubt that commitment, and, of course, every other Ally will be committed to Sweden\u2019s security.\u00a0 We will continue to work to complete Sweden\u2019s accession by the time our leaders gather in Vilnius for the NATO Summit.\nJust days after President Putin invaded Ukraine, Sweden moved swiftly to provide assistance \u2013 the first time it\u2019s delivered lethal assistance since it came to Finland\u2019s aid in the Winter War going back to 1939.\u00a0 Sweden has provided approximately $2 billion in military, humanitarian, and economic support to Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s welcomed nearly 50,000 refugees from Ukraine, providing pathways not only to have access to public services but also to work, to study, which they want to do so they can contribute to their communities here and, ultimately, to their communities back home in Ukraine.\nAnd in its role as EU \u2013 president of the Council of the EU, Sweden has overseen the EU\u2019s 10th sanctions package, launched on the one-year anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion.\u00a0 It\u2019s also overseen a landmark agreement to jointly procure ammunition for Ukraine and has set up a process to investigate how frozen Russian assets can be used to rebuild the country.\nSo, Mr. Prime Minister, on so many fronts, as we were discussing, in challenging times, the most important thing is to have close allies, close partners, close friends.\u00a0 The United States could not ask for a closer partner and friend and, soon, closer Ally than Sweden.\nThank you.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you, and we\u2019ll open up for a few questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with the Swedish television, Johan Pisoni.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary Blinken, what do you make of the fact that there are still two countries blocking the Swedish NATO application?\u00a0 And is the U.S. willing to add more pressure to these countries in order to speed up the process?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So the accession process is just that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a process.\u00a0 And in fact, if you look at this in historic terms, it\u2019s removed \u2013 it\u2019s moved remarkably rapidly with Finland\u2019s accession and, very soon, Sweden\u2019s accession.\u00a0 Through that process, individual members of the Alliance can bring up issues of concern to them, and, of course, T\u00fcrkiye has done that over the last months.\u00a0 And I think it has rightly focused attention on some of its security concerns that both Sweden and Finland have taken remarkable steps to address, important ones.\nSo I think it\u2019s to T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s credit that it\u2019s been able to focus all of the Alliance on some of these concerns, but it\u2019s to Sweden\u2019s credit as well as Finland\u2019s credit that they\u2019ve taken concrete action to address those concerns.\u00a0 From the perspective of the United States, the time is now to finalize Sweden\u2019s accession.\u00a0 Again, it\u2019s taken very significant steps to address very legitimate concerns, and I think in terms of its own qualifications for membership, from day one it was qualified precisely because it\u2019s been such a long-time partner for NATO; of course, the European Union; and with values that are fundamentally the same.\nSo we look forward to this process being completed in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 We have no doubt that it can be, and it should be, and we expect it to be.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Okay, next question goes to Missy Ryan.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Okay, hi.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Missy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019d also like to ask about the Sweden NATO accession issue.\u00a0 First, for you, Mr.\u00a0 Prime Minister, have you or any of your advisers been in touch with the Turkish Government since \u2013 with Erdogan or his team since the \u2013 his re-election?\u00a0 And do you have any indications that T\u00fcrkiye is now ready to approve Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO, or are they asking you to take additional steps?\u00a0 And I know your government has spoken extensively about the benefits that NATO accession will bring to both Sweden and NATO, but what do you think it says about NATO and its ability to provide a strong deterrent that one or two members of NATO have the ability to hold up the enlargement for over a year?\nAnd then for you, Mr. Secretary, President Biden yesterday suggested that there could be some sort of arrangement linking Turkish approval of the Swedish accession bid to the provision of F\u201116s to T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 Do you have any indications that T\u00fcrkiye will now relent on Sweden\u2019s NATO accession now that the election is over, and do you have any indications that key lawmakers in the United States will now support supplying T\u00fcrkiye with F-16s.\u00a0 And then also on the Turkish election, forgive me, given the track record of Erdogan\u2019s government regarding rule of law, democracy, and inclusivity, are you concerned that conditions around those things might deteriorate further in T\u00fcrkiye following the election since arguably he might see that as a valid \u2013 see the results of the election as a validation of his approach? \u00a0Thanks.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first, of course, obviously, we have had several contacts also after the election runoff last Sunday, so we have \u2013 we are in constant contact with our Turkish counterpart on this specific issue, of course.\u00a0 So \u2013 and just to reiterate what I\u2019ve said before, I mean, we have always known that \u2013 two things.\u00a0 One is we have a memorandum, we are fulfilling it, and the very final part of that is actually being put into force June 1st \u2013 that is the day after tomorrow \u2013 when the new piece of legislation, actually, in counterterrorism \u2013 and that is an important step.\u00a0 And thereby, we have done what we told the \u2013 our Turkish friends and within the framework of the trilateral memorandum \u2013 very, very important.\u00a0 And we acknowledged the fact that they have good reasons to have had concerns on how other countries helped them to protect themselves.\nBut on the other side, or at the same time, we have always recognized the fact that every NATO Ally has to make its own decision, and only T\u00fcrkiye can make T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s decisions, and we fully respect that.\u00a0 So that\u2019s basically it.\u00a0 And now we wait for them to make their decision.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And Missy, to your question, first let me just say it is appropriate that every Ally have a clear say in the admission of new members or the accession of new members, because it comes down to Article 5.\u00a0 Each member is making a solemn commitment to every other member that it will join in coming to their defense if they are the victims of aggression.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s important that every member have its say in this process.\u00a0 And as I said earlier, by historic terms, this has moved remarkably rapidly, and we believe it needs to come to a conclusion now.\nWith regard to Sweden\u2019s accession and the F-16s, these are distinct issues.\u00a0 Both, though, are vital, in our judgment, to European security.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already been clear about why it\u2019s profoundly in the interest of the Alliance and the United States to have Sweden as a formal Ally in NATO.\u00a0 And as I said, we expect that process to be completed in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 But we know that our Alliance will be stronger and we will be better off when that process is finalized.\u00a0 And so we urge both T\u00fcrkiye and Hungary, which has also not yet ratified, to ratify the accession as quickly as possible.\u00a0 There is no reason for any further time; Sweden is ready now.\u00a0 That decision should be \u2013 should move forward now.\nWith regard to the F-16s, our administration has been very clear:\u00a0 We believe it\u2019s important that T\u00fcrkiye have the F-16s or the F-16 upgrades, as a critical member of the NATO Alliance, to make sure that they are operating at the highest standards of the Alliance, that they\u2019re fully interoperable with every other Ally.\u00a0 This, too, is in the interest of the United States, and it\u2019s why we brought this forward for consideration.\nIt\u2019s equally true that there are members of Congress who feel strongly, and while we are not linking the two issues \u2013 when I say we, I mean the Biden administration \u2013 some members of Congress are.\u00a0 They are linking Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO to the moving forward on the F\u201116s.\u00a0 Congress is a fully equal and independent branch of government.\u00a0 Their voice and their vote in any such decisions, of course, is critical.\u00a0 But from our perspective, we believe that both should go forward and should go forward as quickly as possible, that is to say, Sweden\u2019s accession and moving forward on the F-16 package.\u00a0 More broadly, as always, we\u2019re focused on the actions of any given government, of any given partner, not on hypotheticals about what they may or may not do in the future.\u00a0 We will remain focused on their actions.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 Next question goes to TT News Agency.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary, first of all, welcome to Sweden.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Just a follow-up on the NATO question.\u00a0 The NATO meeting in Vilnius is only six weeks away.\u00a0 What would you say the odds are, the chances are that you will see Sweden as a member of NATO before the meeting takes place?\u00a0 And sort of a follow-up on that, if the process will be further delayed, would that \u2013 what might \u2013 what might the consequences be for Sweden as well as for NATO?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a bet on this or are you thinking of putting something \u2013 (laughter) \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t have any inside information that I could or would share.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Look, as I said, we believe the time is now, and there is no reason for not moving forward and \u2013 as I said before.\u00a0 And as the prime minister has expressed very eloquently, T\u00fcrkiye has raised important and legitimate concerns.\u00a0 Sweden and Finland both addressed those concerns, and so the time to move forward is now.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to see that happen before the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 But again, I can\u2019t put and won\u2019t put odds on it.\nWhat I can say is this:\u00a0 We and our Allies are both committed to and well-positioned to help Sweden address its security needs irrespective of whether accession happens tomorrow or in two weeks or in a few weeks after that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been clear that we will not tolerate any aggression against Sweden no matter its actual status.\nSecretary of Defense Austin was here recently, and I think he very clearly reaffirmed that point.\u00a0 We have a deep existing partnership that is literally being exercised, as the prime minister said, right now through Arctic Challenge 23.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s further evidence of the fact that we are working extremely closely together and as partners and, soon, formal Allies.\u00a0 We\u2019re ready for any contingency.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Great.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do a final question from\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 Kim.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\u00a0 Kim Mackrael from\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 For Secretary Blinken, can you speak to how close you think the U.S. and European approaches to China are right now?\u00a0 What do you hope to see from Europe in addressing concerns about non-market practices and export controls?\u00a0 And also, how big do you think the gap is between what the EU talks about in terms of de-risking and what is often referred to with the U.S. about decoupling with China?\u00a0 And sorry, if I can also put a question to the prime minster?\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s just one question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Just \u2013 for the prime minister \u2013 it\u2019s on the same topic.\u00a0 It seems there\u2019s significant debate from member-states over how to redefine Europe\u2019s relationship with China.\u00a0 So what\u2019s your view on the commission\u2019s proposal for outbound investment screening, and how likely do you think it is that member-states will see some agreement on moving forward with that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 So I think \u2013 and the prime minister and I had an opportunity to discuss this at some length \u2013 for both the United States and Europe, and indeed for countries in all parts of the world, the relationship with China is among the most consequential, is one of the most \u2013 as well as one of the most complex that we have.\nAnd we\u2019ve been very clear about what we\u2019re for and also what we\u2019re not for, and we are not looking for a new cold war.\u00a0 We are not looking to contain China.\u00a0 We are looking to make sure that we are upholding our interests and our values in that relationship and that we\u2019re managing it responsibly.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s a demand signal from countries around the world that both China and the United States manage the relationship responsibly, that we take every reasonable step to make sure that the competition that we\u2019re in does not veer into conflict.\nAnd one of the reasons that President Biden and President Xi agreed when they met in Bali last year to strengthen our lines of communication was precisely to that end, as well as seeing if, when it\u2019s in our mutual interest and in the interest of others, there are areas where we can actually strengthen cooperation.\u00a0 In my 30 years or so of doing this, I have not seen a time, actually, when there is greater convergence between the United States and Europe, as well as with key partners in Asia, on the approach to China.\u00a0 I think you see that reflected in what key leaders in Europe are saying, including just today, the prime minister discussing this issue \u2013 but I\u2019ll let him speak for himself \u2013 the work that we\u2019re doing with the EU through the Trade and Technology Council \u2013 the recent speech by President von der Leyen, which I think could very much have been an expression of our own policy.\nAnd when you look at it, I think what you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is that increasing convergence.\u00a0 Both the United States and Europe, I think, believe that, again, this relationship is an important one, one that we seek to sustain, but with our eyes wide open.\u00a0 And so both the United States and Europe are not in favor of decoupling, but we are in favor of de-risking.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve heard that from the leadership on both sides of the Atlantic.\nBut not only have you heard that, you\u2019ve actually seen that in practice through the Trade and Technology Council, as well as other work that we\u2019re doing with the European Union.\u00a0 You\u2019re seeing country after country put in place investment screening mechanisms, not for the purpose of stopping Chinese investment, but for making sure that in discrete areas, industries, companies, geographic areas where that investment could pose a challenge or \u2013 to our security, we have the appropriate mechanisms in place.\u00a0 We\u2019re now talking about, as well in very discrete ways, looking at outward investment to make sure that it\u2019s not going to support developments in China that could pose a threat to our security.\nWe\u2019re working more closely together than ever on building supply chain diversification and resilience, with the EU putting in place early warning systems to disruptions in the supply chain, as well as diversifying them.\u00a0 Again, we\u2019re coming together to do that.\u00a0 You see it as well in the collaboration that we\u2019ve had on export controls, not for the purpose of cutting off trade with or supplies to China of technology, but, again, in very discrete areas, where that technology may go to, for example, help China develop what is an opaque nuclear weapons program or other things that could pose a threat to our security or challenges to our values like surveillance technology.\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re taking appropriate measures there.\nAnd when it comes to nonmarket economic practices, there, too, the United States and Europe are increasingly aligned.\u00a0 And that\u2019s important because individually, if we\u2019re trying to get China to change some of the unfair practices that it\u2019s engaged in, the United States is about 20 percent of the world\u2019s economy; Europe\u2019s about 20 percent of the world\u2019s economy.\u00a0 When we combine and address these issues together, all of a sudden we\u2019re almost 50 percent of the world\u2019s economy, and that\u2019s a little bit harder for China to ignore when it comes to trying to change some of the practices they\u2019re engaged in.\nSo I think we\u2019re seeing that it\u2019s profoundly in the mutual interest of both Europe and the United States to be aligned in our approach, as it is for key countries in Asia.\u00a0 We just came from a G7 meeting where Japan and Korea were both present.\u00a0 I think you\u2019ve seen a similar alignment, a similar convergence, in the approach that we\u2019re taking to China there as well.\u00a0 And again, I refer you to the words of key leaders in Europe, as well as some of the key documents and strategies that Europe has put out.\u00a0 They are almost entirely coincident with our own approach.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0 Well, basically I very much agree with Secretary Blinken\u2019s kind of basic approach and \u2013 to this matter, very much so.\u00a0 And as you might know, the very final European Council meeting during the Swedish presidency will be, of course, as always, about Ukraine \u2013 always \u2013 but also on the key issue of relation to China.\u00a0 So that\u2019s our kind of final part we are preparing.\nIt happens to be \u2013 I just came to here from the Stockholm China Forum, the German Marshall Fund\u2019s annual meeting on China, and I gave \u2013 I tried to outline how we see the principal approach to \u2013 perhaps just two remarks.\u00a0 One is Europe needs to unite and stick to the unity on how to have a common approach to China.\u00a0 It is simply the fact that 27 countries need to stick together to have the clout and to have the power and (inaudible).\nAnd second, transatlantic cooperation is key in this area as well, I would say.\u00a0 And that has sometimes been questioned, as you know.\u00a0 And I would say that those now saying that \u2013 or asking themselves, does Europe need to choose, as it goes, between the U.S. and China, they simply ask themselves the wrong question.\u00a0 We should instead unite in a principally anchored idea on how an open world should act, how we reduce dependency, how we de-risk, regardless if China want to be de-risked or not, and try to be as open as possible, taking our own security concerns into account.\nI think the U.S. has been a few years ahead of Europe, but I think very many countries now realize this is not the time for naivete.\u00a0 It\u2019s not the time to stop communicating and cooperating with China either.\u00a0 Decoupling is not the answer, but to have a serious common approach to this matter I think would be.\nSo my short answer:\u00a0 Yeah, I think there is a beginning convergence going on, which I would appreciate very, very much.\u00a0 And if Sweden can be helpful in that process, I would be very proud of that.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Great.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you so much for everyone for coming.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

You could have picked another place \u2013 another time and place for us to have this occasion, but you picked Port Moresby, you picked our nation\u2019s capital, and you picked Papua New Guinea \u2013 and we sincerely appreciate you very much for this kind gesture.\nToday, in our bilateral meeting, you were witness to the signing of our Defense Cooperation Agreement.\u00a0 That was a culmination of many years and months of engagement with Pentagon, engagement with Washington, engagement with U.S. officials and our team.\u00a0 I just want to stress this point: It wasn\u2019t shoved down our throat.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t forced upon us; it was a mutual agreement.\u00a0 A conversation was held expressly on the need for Papua New Guinea to have our defence force assisted, supported, stepped up.\nPapua New Guineans, you must know you have domestic security issue, as well as closer to home security issues.\u00a0 We cannot forever remain in (inaudible) in as far as our defence force is concerned.\u00a0 Our defence force needs to be stepped up and supported.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had similar defense cooperation agreement with Australia, Indonesia, and other nations we enjoy strong long-term partnerships with.\u00a0 We have every right also, in the same vein, to engage in a straight partnership with United States of America, where we have had no problem with similar defense force cooperation agreements \u2013 have been foundation of our relationship.\nAnd today, the defense force cooperation comes with a backdrop of elevating what was originally the umbrella status of force agreement that kept us together.\u00a0 We are now elevating that to a specific relationship exclusive for U.S.A.-PNG military cooperations and military engagements and partnership.\u00a0 There is nothing for us to be fearful about.\u00a0 I just want to needless repeat but for emphasis because of a lot of misconception and confusion out there in the public.\u00a0 This agreement is subsidiary to a treaty \u2013 it\u2019s below the treaty level.\u00a0 This agreement in no way breaks or encroaches into our country\u2019s legislations, (inaudible) the fundamental constitution of our country or every other (inaudible) legislations we have.\nThis agreement is congruent to the 1975 Visiting Forces Act, the 1975 Visiting Forces Act.\u00a0 James Marape was still a child in 1975, when the fathers of this nation saw it important to have an act called the Visiting Forces Act to ensure we\u2019re engaged in partnership with nations of similarities, nations where we have common bond, where exchanges can be made possible.\nAnd so, I just want to inform the educated out there, especially those of you who want to pick a political bone with me \u2013 let\u2019s not confuse everyone.\u00a0 We are a nation of rule of law.\u00a0 If you feel that this agreement encroaches into one iota of our constitutional law of the land, make reference to the supreme court.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure the court will find \u2013 I\u2019m sure the court will find that what we have done is within the gambit of the constitution of our country and all subsidiary legislations.\u00a0 It is meant to ensure that our country\u2019s domestic as well as sovereign security is secured, beefed up, bumped up, and prepared for any challenges \u2013 not just military challenges, but more importantly, challenges of disaster, challenges of social issues, and every other challenge we go through, including securing our country to be a country known to have secured the security issue and prepared for investments that we are trying to attract into our country.\nMy conversation with India is not just purely on politics; my conversation with U.S.A. is not purely on politics.\u00a0 But more importantly, deep inside \u2013 and Secretary Blinken knows this; those who worked with us on this one knows this \u2013 we want American-based investors to come to our country.\u00a0 We want Indian-based investors to come into our country.\u00a0 We are looking at diversifying our economic base, and growing it \u2013 and make it stronger so that government can in turn look after our citizens.\u00a0 That is foundationally not so today because of the weak security structure we have in our country.\u00a0 Strengthening our defense force, strengthening our police, strengthening our court system, ensuring that our democracy is secure is a key foundational interest of the state to make sure our country is secure.\nIt is in this vein that we are in partnership with the biggest democracy on the face of Planet Earth, and I just want to encourage our people, please don\u2019t be \u2013 don\u2019t think that something suspicious of funny is behind this.\u00a0 It was a work over many years that has culminated over \u2013 into a six month of robust conversation between Port Moresby and Washington, (inaudible) and Washington, our own military head official or former head official as well as Pentagon and Washington officials.\u00a0 Today is a result of many weeks, months, and years of work.\nAnd I will be making available to the public, as we complete due process of key documents to be made known to public in the very near future \u2013 possibly in days, this agreement will be made public to everyone for all of us to understand.\u00a0 The United States of America is always transparent about matters that is of importance to the public.\u00a0 They too, I would believe \u2013 and I don\u2019t like to speak for Secretary Blinken, but they too will make known to public, their own country, they will report \u2013 they have a duty to report back to their country the agreement that we\u2019ve signed.\u00a0 And for matters of transparency for the people and citizens of Papua New Guinea, people and citizens of U.S.A. will know exactly what we\u2019ve signed.\nI just want to conclude by saying what we\u2019ve signed does not encroach \u2013 or affect, rather \u2013 Papua New Guinea\u2019s own relationships we have with other nations we trade with, or we have relationships with, be it military or government-to-government relations.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 It does not affect \u2013 whether in China or Australia or United Kingdom or Japan or India or any other nation, for that matter \u2013 this agreement does not in one way, shape, and form stop Papua New Guinea from continuing on doing business with those we do business with.\u00a0 So, I just want to inform everyone to have a bit of understanding that your government is in the business of securing your future and your economic future as we (inaudible) on these matters.\nOther matters we discussed with Secretary Blinken on behalf of President Biden, (inaudible) ways continuing issue on the climate change, our energy and security, our (inaudible) greater regional security in the region.\u00a0 You would have been informed earlier that we did sign a subsequent agreement called a (inaudible) agreement that secures PNG\u2019s maritime borders and our resources found in our seas.\u00a0 That sort of conversation was also held in the Pacific Island Leaders Meeting, the concern of care for our resources and the security of our seas; all conversation made \u2013 Secretary Blinken was very generous with his time and ears.\u00a0 He sat through, listened to our conversations (inaudible), but a substantial part of Pacific Island and U.S.A. engagements were put to a work-in-progress mode.\u00a0 And we will arrive in Washington in September of this year, hopefully for substantial progress where United States is making a greater commitment to respond to some of the key development challenges we face in the region, including (inaudible) issues and the other insecurity issues that (inaudible).\nOn this note, Secretary Blinken, I have not stolen your time now.\u00a0 There is now space for you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I just have (inaudible) the discussions that we held and (inaudible).\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a few questions (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Prime Minister, thank you so much.\u00a0 And I fully endorse everything you said.\u00a0 And you can speak for me, because you do it so eloquently.\u00a0 And I can only fully agree with everything that you said.\u00a0 But thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the incredibly warm reception, and thank you for the incredibly productive day \u2013 both on a bilateral basis between the United States and Papua New Guinea, but also with all of our regional partners \u2013 discussing and making progress on issues that are critical to our shared future.\nThere is an old Hawaiian saying that translates loosely to \u201cunited to move forward.\u201d\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s the spirit in which we all came together today as Pacific nations.\u00a0 Our partnership is crucial to how we deliver for our people, how we meet their needs and aspirations, and advance our common vision for the region \u2013 one that is free and open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.\u00a0 Or, as your 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent puts it, a \u201cresilient Pacific region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity that ensures all Pacific peoples can lead free, healthy, and productive lives.\u201d\u00a0 It is a powerful, positive ambition that we share.\nAt this forum we\u2019ve built on momentum from the first U.S.-Pacific Island Summit last fall.\u00a0 There in Washington, President Biden pledged to open a new era in our partnership \u2013 one of mutual respect, trust, and benefit.\u00a0 As I had an opportunity to tell Pacific leaders at our meeting today, over the past year the United States has been listening to you, engaging with your governments, working to deliver on our summit announcements that align with your broader vision.\u00a0 And together, we\u2019ve made considerable, tangible progress on many of the commitments in a short period of time.\u00a0 Together, we are super-charging our climate action.\nToday, I announced that the United States will support the PIF in standing up the new Pacific Resilience Facility.\u00a0 This Pacific-owned, Pacific-led solution will drive investment into climate adaptation and resilience in front-line communities.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re boosting our bilateral security relationship to ensure that the Blue Pacific remains a place of peace and prosperity.\nThe prime minister and I just signed, as he mentioned, two agreements which will boost cooperation between Papua New Guinea Defence Forces and the U.S. Coast Guard to help build up the Defence Forces\u2019 capacity, and help combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\nTogether, we\u2019re driving progress to expand trade, investment, and business initiatives that can lift up all communities.\u00a0 In Papua New Guinea specifically, we\u2019re working with Congress to provide over $45 million in new programming on sustainable and inclusive development, public health, and energy security.\u00a0 And later this year the Department of Commerce will lead a first-ever U.S. business delegation to Pacific Island countries to explore opportunities in energy, in transportation, in health care, tourism, and telecommunications.\nTogether, we\u2019re modernizing and enhancing the Compacts of Free Association.\u00a0 These are the bedrock of U.S. engagement in the Pacific.\u00a0 We just signed our agreement with Palau today, in this room.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful to President Whipps for his partnership.\u00a0 Tomorrow, we\u2019ll sign our agreement with the Federated States of Micronesia.\u00a0 And I look forward to finishing negotiations with the Republic of the Marshall Islands soon, to ensure that this arrangement reflects the realities and the challenges of our time.\u00a0 As part of these agreements, the United States will commit $7.1 billion to the Freely Associated States over the next 20 years.\nTogether, we\u2019re also strengthening ties between our peoples.\u00a0 We are very excited to announce the return of the Peace Corps to the Pacific Islands, and that we\u2019re launching new educational exchanges to share skills and expertise, and forge enduring connections that will benefit our communities.\nSo, we\u2019ve got a lot to work on, a lot to accomplish together.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re expanding our diplomatic presence in the region, delivering on our commitments last year.\u00a0 We\u2019ve opened two new embassies, one on the Solomon Islands, the other just two weeks ago in Tonga.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working to do the same in Vanuatu and Kiribati by the end of this year.\nWe\u2019ve named our first ever envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, Ambassador Frankie Reed, who will continue to engage throughout the region to strengthen our partnerships.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to strive to meet the Pacific where it is, (inaudible) Pacific leaders and through the Pacific Islands Forum.\u00a0 We\u2019ll encourage other partners to do the same, including through the Partners in the Blue Pacific, to support the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\u00a0 And in that regard, we very much welcome India\u2019s engagement with countries in the region.\u00a0 That, too, is a very positive development for the future that we all want.\nSo Prime Minister, to you, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for this partnership at a critical time for the region that we share.\u00a0 And thank you for the work that we\u2019re doing every day to build it, to make it stronger, to deliver on our shared vision.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Any questions?\u00a0 We\u2019ll just take two or three questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We will first go to Gorethy Kenneth from\u00a0The\u00a0Post-Courier.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Prime Minister, (inaudible), the line credit \u2013 the line of credit program with India and Papua New Guinea (inaudible).\u00a0 Was it \u2013 will it be extended or was it extended?\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0The prime minister took note of this fact, and he is taking it back to his country.\u00a0 We \u2013 for us, as a country, it\u2019s important we also diversify our source of support.\u00a0 India has opened up that facility \u2013 those facilities.\u00a0 We\u2019ve asked them to go back and maintain the facility and expressed the (inaudible) invite to procure a source.\u00a0 So, he said he\u2019ll take back to his officials.\u00a0 We don\u2019t run other forms of government.\u00a0 We run democratic form of government (inaudible) our systems to go back to (inaudible) said he would look at (inaudible).\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Jack Moore from AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to speak to us.\u00a0 My question is for you, Secretary.\u00a0 Given the inroads that China has made in the Pacific in places such as the Solomon Islands, how important was it for Washington to secure the deals today with Papua New Guinea and renew with Palau to counter Beijing\u2019s rise and influence in the region?\u00a0 And how satisfied are you with the outcome?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, I\u2019d say a few things.\u00a0 First, the agreements that we reached, the work that we\u2019re doing, is not about any other country.\u00a0 It\u2019s about our relationship with the Pacific Islands and the shared vision that we have for this region.\nAnd as you heard the prime minister say, while we signed the Defense Cooperation Agreement today, the ship (inaudible) agreement \u2013 these are very important in helping to strengthen Papua New Guinea\u2019s capacity.\u00a0 We\u2019re working across the board on issues of direct concern to people of Papua New Guinea and throughout the region, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s investment, whether it\u2019s building up healthcare systems.\u00a0 But this is grounded in \u2013 I think what\u2019s fair to say is a shared vision that we have for a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nAnd we talk about that a lot.\u00a0 And I just want to be clear about what we mean by that when we\u2019re talking about a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We need a region where countries are free to choose their own path and their own partners, where problems will be dealt openly, transparently. \u00a0Goals will be reached in a transparent way, (inaudible) fairly, and goods, ideas, and people can float freely and lawfully across the land, the seas, the skies, and in cyberspace.\u00a0 That\u2019s the vision that we have, as well as making sure that the citizens in our countries have the opportunity to reach their full potential, providing the support necessary to do that.\nBut this vision doesn\u2019t exclude anyone.\u00a0 We welcome contributions by other countries, including the PRC \u2013 the regional development \u2013 so long as they adhere to the highest standards, including in areas like transparency and the rule of law.\u00a0 If all of us are going to be engaged in a region as partners \u2013 well, if there\u2019s going to be a race, let it be a race to the top.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re all about, and we want to simply see anyone who\u2019s engaged engage in a way that advances the shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nBut as I said, the focus that we have is on building and strengthening these partnerships on their own terms, not with regard to any other country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Take a final question from Tim Swanston from ABC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m happy just to talk loudly if you can hear me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I appreciate what you\u2019re saying that this isn\u2019t about any other countries, but ultimately, China has made very serious inroads with respect to the defense and security arrangement here in the Pacific.\u00a0 Now that the Defense Cooperation Agreement is being signed, under what kind of timeframe would you like to see U.S. military or U.S. assets placed in PNG?\u00a0 And what bases are you looking at of importance to the island states?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0What we\u2019re focused on is what our partners here are working and trying to achieve in strengthening their capacity.\u00a0 As you heard the prime minister say, there\u2019s a focus on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief.\u00a0 That\u2019s the main import of what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But the main point is that, as you heard the prime minister say, we\u2019ve had this basic arrangement going back to 1975.\u00a0 So, this is simply updating and modernizing what has been a longstanding agreement between our countries just to make sure that we can work together as effectively as possible.\nAnd as I said in the first instance, we want to make sure that we\u2019re being responsive to some of the challenges that the PNG faces.\u00a0 There are other challenges that I mentioned that \u2013 where these agreements will be very helpful \u2013 for example, the issue of illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing.\u00a0 This is something that is having a devasting impact on livelihoods in the Pacific Islands, as well as the ecosystem that is so vital to nourishing these economies.\u00a0 So, this could \u2013 I think the work that we\u2019re doing with PNG can be of a real assistance there.\nYou heard the prime minister talk about other concerns with regard, for example, to (inaudible), where again these agreements will help.\u00a0 But that\u2019s the immediate focus of what we\u2019re looking to do, but it\u2019s all on the basis of simply bringing up to date and modernizing agreements that have been there for a long, long time.\u00a0 And I would emphasize, again, something the prime minister said: these are being done in a fully transparent way, respectful of PNG\u2019s institutions, of its sovereignty.\u00a0 These are agreements that we reach together, not agreements that anyone is imposing on anyone else, and they take away no freedom of action from the PNG.\u00a0 And as the Prime Minister said, we\u2019ll be making these publicly available \u2013 as we always do, as we complete the process of finalizing the agreements in our respective countries.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary, if I could just add one or two more lines \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 the presence of China, let me inform everyone, China is (inaudible) and people have no interest whatsoever with what they do in other nations.\u00a0 We have a healthy relationship with Chinese Government, and they are important and big trading partner, but we are moving into finalizing this agreement.\u00a0 We did not need to tell anyone else what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But they have given assurance to us in our conversations that we have every right to engage with U.S.A. as much as we have with them.\nAnd so, I just want to inform Papua New Guineans in the first instance and the media, we\u2019re trying to play out from this issue of China versus U.S.A.\u00a0 The Secretary of State correctly has stated this has nothing to do with the bigger issues, the headline issues that keep on going off every now and then.\u00a0 Papua New Guinea invited U.S.A. to move beyond just an ordinary agreement to a specifically defense-focused agreement.\u00a0 In my view, that strengthens our Defence Force, and they will come in at the invitation of our Defence Force, and not at their own will.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that must be clear that everyone in the Pacific \u2013 upon our invitation, they come in.\nThat is subsequently a question on when that needs to be done that dwarfs other agreements and other processes.\u00a0 This is just a framework

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, everyone.\u00a0 And I have to say I\u2019m very tempted to say, \u201cWhat the prime minister said,\u201d and leave it at that because I could not and cannot say it more eloquently than he just has.\u00a0 But let me first say good afternoon to everyone.\u00a0 It is truly wonderful to be here in Papua New Guinea, to be joining the prime minister, to be joining the defense ministers, to be joining the entire team.\nMr. Prime Minister, we\u2019ve spent a good bit of time together, including a visit to the Oval Office with President Biden during the Pacific Island Summit last year.\u00a0 And you heard this from the President himself during your call a few days ago, but he asked me again to reiterate to you, to all of our friends in Papua New Guinea, his regrets for being unable to be here today.\u00a0 The President values deeply our nations\u2019 longstanding partnership and believes our cooperation is critical to addressing a series of shared challenges that are facing our people.\u00a0 And he\u2019s eager to welcome you, to welcome other Pacific Island Forum leaders, back to Washington for a second summit later this year.\nWe are deeply invested in the Indo-Pacific because our planet\u2019s future is being written here.\u00a0 Papua New Guinea is playing a critical role in shaping that future.\u00a0 That leadership is on display this week as you\u2019ve welcomed 16 delegations for the U.S.-Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting to make progress on priorities that we\u2019ve established together, from tackling the climate crisis to improving public health to enhancing disaster preparedness and response.\u00a0 And the United States is proud to partner with Papua New Guinea on these same priorities because they\u2019re our priorities too.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together as regional security partners.\u00a0 We\u2019re boosting our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific though the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.\nWe\u2019re driving economic opportunity through partnerships between our businesses, which are bringing tens of billions in new investment to Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 And we are teaming up to bring preventative, lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment to people here in Papua New Guinea so that they can continue to lead healthy and productive lives.\nSimply put, we are committed to growing all aspects of our relationship.\u00a0 And to that end, today, as you\u2019ve from the prime minister, we\u2019re signing two agreements on defense and on maritime cooperation.\nThe Defense Cooperation Agreement, drafted by Papua New Guinea and the United States as equal and sovereign partners, will enhance the PNG\u2019s Defence Force\u2019s capability to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, including through providing medical care and temporary shelter to those who are affected by crises.\u00a0 The agreement will also make it easy for PNG and U.S. forces to train together in new ways and in more places as part of our joint effort to uphold peace and security across the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We will be fully transparent of the details of the agreement, which contains elements from our previous agreement and updates to reflect our shared commitment to deepen cooperation on issues that matter most to people here as well as in the United States.\nAnd as you also heard from the prime minister, the Shiprider Agreement will allow the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and the U.S. Coast Guard to deepen cooperation to combat illicit maritime activities, including illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which we know is destroying livelihoods and threatening green ecosystems that nourish Pacific Island economies.\nAt more than 2.4 million square kilometers, the PNG\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone is one of the largest in the South Pacific.\u00a0 That poses a tremendous economic opportunity but also a serious challenge for monitoring, for controlling, for surveilling that vast expanse of maritime area.\u00a0 Under this agreement, our forces will be able to board one another\u2019s vessels, share technical expertise, and ultimately better patrol the seas together.\u00a0 This is vital to protecting livelihoods for generations to come.\nFor nearly 50 years, Papua New Guinea and the United States have worked together to deliver prosperity for our people and promote security and stability for the region.\u00a0 You heard the prime minister speak eloquently to that shared history.\u00a0 But I think what\u2019s so important is that shared history is also a living history, and together \u2013 even as we\u2019re inspired by so much that we\u2019ve done in the past \u2013 we are working together to shape the future.\u00a0 That\u2019s the task before us.\u00a0 And Mr. Prime Minister, we are very much looking forward to taking our partnership to the next level.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Prime Minister, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 And colleagues, it is a great honor to be with all of you, to be with our Pacific Island partners.\u00a0 Prime Minister, I\u2019m really grateful to you as our host for welcoming all of us to Papua New Guinea.\nPresident Biden was very much looking forward to being here and to addressing Pacific Island Forum leaders before events in Washington required him to be there.\u00a0 He felt it was important for me to represent him to underscore to you our commitment to the region.\u00a0 And in fact, I\u2019m carrying with me a formal invitation from the President for Pacific leaders to come back to Washington this fall for a second summit to continue conversations and develop new initiatives that are critical to our collective future.\u00a0 I know that the President is eager to welcome you in Washington again.\u00a0 The first summit was historic.\u00a0 Our second summit will help us really shape history together.\nThis is the second opportunity that I\u2019ve had to be with the Pacific Island Forum.\u00a0 I very much appreciated the discussion last year in Fiji.\u00a0 Vice President Harris also addressed that meeting virtually.\u00a0 And in between those events, senior officials from across our government have regularly traveled to the region.\nWhen President Biden launched the Pacific Island Summit last year, he pledged a new era of cooperation and partnership to deliver for our people. \u00a0An era of mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual benefit with the United States and the Pacific Islands working together to advance a shared vision for the region that\u2019s free, that\u2019s open, that\u2019s connected, that\u2019s prosperous, that\u2019s secure, that\u2019s resilient.\nSo we sometimes have formulas, phrases that we repeat to each other on a regular basis, and \u201cfree and open\u201d is one of them.\u00a0 What do we actually mean by that?\u00a0 Well, for our part \u2013 and I think this is a shared view among everyone at this table \u2013 when we talk about free and open we mean a region where countries are free to choose their own path and their own partners; where problems can be dealt with openly, rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly; and goods, ideas, and people will flow freely and lawfully across land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nOver the past year, the United States has been listening hard, listening to you, engaging with your governments, working to deliver on our summit announcements and align with your vision.\u00a0 Today, I think we can actually point to substantial progress on many of those commitments, acknowledging that more work needs to be done.\u00a0 And Prime Minister, I take very much to heart what you said about the need to have clear lines of visibility and accessibility so that we can continue to move forward on the agenda we set for each other.\nBut if you just look at what we\u2019ve managed to accomplish over the past year as well as where we\u2019re going.\u00a0 I think we do see tangible progress.\u00a0 We\u2019re enhancing our diplomatic engagements in the Pacific.\u00a0 Last year, we inaugurated our new embassy building here in Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 I had a chance to visit it this morning.\u00a0 It\u2019s an extraordinary facility, really a state-of-the-art building that I think reflects the value that place on our partnership.\nWe recently opened two new embassies in Solomon Islands and Tonga.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to do the same in Vanuatu in Kiribati.\u00a0 We sent our first ever U.S. envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, Ambassador Frankie Reed, who is here with us today and has been hard at work to deepen our relationships across the region.\u00a0 America\u2019s future is here in the Pacific.\nWe\u2019re strengthening our partnerships on public health, the climate crisis, economic growth, and other key regional priorities that respond to people\u2019s needs and expectations.\u00a0 By September, we\u2019ll open a new USAID mission here in the Pacific Islands based in Papua New Guinea to advance those efforts.\nWe\u2019ve also helped Pacific Island countries unlock more than half a billion dollars from international organizations to help communities manage the growing impacts of climate change, a challenge that we know President Biden feels strongly is existential for the Pacific Islands and on which the Pacific Islands have all led in the global community.\u00a0 Today, I am very pleased to announce the United States plans to be among the founding partners to support PIF in standing up the new Pacific Resilience Facility to support investments in adaptation and resilience.\nWe\u2019re updating and enhancing the Compacts of Free Association with our close partners in the Freely Associated States.\u00a0 A little later today, we\u2019re signing agreements with Palau, tomorrow with Federated States of Micronesia, and we\u2019re looking forward to entering negotiations with the Republic of the Marshall Islands very soon.\nAs part of these agreements, the United States will commit more than $7.1 billion to the Freely Associated States over the next 20 years.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also included an enhanced South Pacific Tuna Treaty.\u00a0 We just completed negotiations on a new 10-year economic assistance agreement which will support livelihoods across the region, boost our cooperation on priorities like combatting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\u00a0 We know how essential, how vital this is, to virtually all of our partners in the region.\u00a0 We know the damage that it does to livelihoods and the threat that it poses to ecosystems that are quite literally nourishing your economies.\nWe\u2019re advancing shared prosperity across our region by connecting American and Pacific companies and boosting trade and investment through new initiatives and new dialogue.\u00a0 We launched a new transportation partnership and strategic infrastructure initiatives aimed at unlocking over $450 million in financing for clean energy connectivity and for digital infrastructure.\u00a0 We held the first U.S.-PIF dialogue on trade and investment a little bit earlier this year and look forward to a ministerial level dialogue very soon.\nAnd today, I can announce that our Department of Commerce will lead a U.S. business delegation to the Pacific Island countries in the coming year to look at concrete opportunities in energy, in transportation, in health care, in tourism, in telecommunications.\u00a0 We\u2019re putting together a very strong delegation of leading American enterprises, and we very much look forward to doing that in a few months\u2019 time.\nAlso deepening the already incredibly vibrant ties between our people, we\u2019re partnering with Johns Hopkins University to welcome the first cohort of Pacific leaders at the U.S. Pacific Institute for Rising Leaders program this fall.\u00a0 That will (inaudible) the region\u2019s brightest minds on the key priorities that (inaudible) time.\nAnd we\u2019re returning the Peace Corps to the region with volunteers already on the ground in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, and preparing to arrive in Vanuatu (inaudible) later this year.\nWe\u2019re committed to building on all of this momentum generated in the last year, including by working through the Partners in the Blue Pacific to support 2050 strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\nSo in short, I think we\u2019re making demonstrable progress on the agenda we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\u00a0 There is more that we can do, more that we will do, more that we have to do.\u00a0 But it was very important for me to be here today to hear from all of you, our partners, on how we\u2019re doing, how we can do even better, and how we can deepen all of the work that we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\nSo thank you for the honor of joining you today.\u00a0 I\u2019m so grateful to all of our colleagues for being here.\u00a0 I\u2019m very much looking forward to this conversation, to listening to everyone\u2019s ideas to everyone\u2019s priorities to ensure that the United States is a strong, reliable, effective partner in the Pacific Islands in the future that we are building together.\nThank you very much, Prime Minister.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"location": "Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 This was a real privilege to be here at Lawes Road at this clinic, where quite literally our partners are saving lives, changing lives, every single day.\u00a0 The United States \u2013 we\u2019ve been a committed partner in helping to deal with HIV/AIDS for many years, particularly through the PEPFAR program, and we are powerfully committed going forward because here in Papua New Guinea, unfortunately, we\u2019ve actually seen HIV rates rising, not falling.\u00a0 It\u2019s hugely important to continue to work to get ahead of that.\u00a0 I had an opportunity to talk to some of the clinicians but also some remarkable people who have been living with HIV/AIDS but are now helping in their own communities to spread the word about the treatments available and encouraging people to come forward.\nOne of the biggest challenges that we know from our experience around the world, and we see here is that the antiretroviral treatments are incredibly effective, and people live full lives with HIV/AIDS if they\u2019re on an antiretroviral.\u00a0 But because of stigma that people impose upon themselves or that their communities may impose, they may be reluctant to come forward.\u00a0 It is so important to come forward to seek treatment.\u00a0 It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s easy, and it works.\u00a0 And now there is also a treatment that is prophylactic \u2013 in other words, that can actually prevent the transmission \u2013 that\u2019s 99 percent effective called PrEP.\u00a0 And for people who are particularly at high risk, this is a very, very effective means of preventing the transmission, and here at Lawes Road they are able to share that as well.\nSo part of my reason for coming here today is just to help in our own way to put a spotlight on this because it remains a real challenge in Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 We want to help.\u00a0 I am so grateful to my colleagues at USAID who are leading this effort with our partners here in Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 This support has made a huge difference, but it can make more of a difference if we can continue to get people to come forward, and particularly the communities themselves.\u00a0 This is the most effective way to share information, to educate people about what\u2019s available, and to have people come forward.\nThe other thing that\u2019s very powerful here is that this clinic is also dealing with gender-based violence and helping victims of gender-based violence get the psychosocial services they need, work through the legal system, get other support.\u00a0 And that too is hugely, hugely important for people to come forward, to get the support that you can get here.\nIn our own home country we\u2019ve had this challenge, and I can say that one of the things that President Biden is proudest of in his career in the United States Senate, as Vice President, now as President, in all that time the thing that he\u2019s probably the most proudest \u2013 proud of is the fact that he wrote the law, the Violence Against Women Act.\u00a0 That made violence against women a federal crime but also put in place a remarkable system for people to get help, national hotlines for people who were at risk or who had been victimized by gender-based violence.\u00a0 So this is something that he feels very strongly.\u00a0 It was inspiring to meet the clinician here, who\u2019s working every day to help people who are victimized by gender-based violence.\nThe United States is proud to be a partner with the government, with our local implementing partners.\u00a0 It\u2019s something we\u2019re deeply committed to.\u00a0 And I just wanted to put a little spotlight on that today because it remains a big challenge here, but one that we can overcome working together and especially with the remarkable people here at Lawes Road who every single day are saving lives and changing lives.\nThank you.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, State and Foreign Ops Chair Coons, Ranking Member Graham, distinguished members of the Appropriations Committee, thank you for this opportunity to testify before you today.\u00a0 Thank you for bringing us all together.\nI\u2019m very pleased as well to be here with Secretary Austin, Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 This administration is committed to leading a bipartisan, whole-of-government China strategy that advances U.S. interests and values and delivers for the American people.\nAnd to your point, Chair Murray, I think we do stand at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over.\u00a0 There is an intense competition underway to shape what comes next.\nChina represents the most consequential geopolitical challenge that we face today: a country with the intent and, increasingly, the capability to challenge our vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous international order.\nWe cannot dictate Beijing\u2019s path.\u00a0 We cannot wait for China to change its trajectory.\u00a0 But we can put ourselves in a position of strength to compete intensely to shape the broader strategic environment around China and to advance our vision.\nWe do not seek conflict with China or a new Cold War.\u00a0 We\u2019re not trying to contain China.\u00a0 And in fact, the United States continues to have a comprehensive trade and investment relationship with China, as do most of our allies and partners.\u00a0 We are, however, resolutely for de-risking and diversifying, not decoupling.\u00a0 That means investing in our own capacities and in a secure, resilient supply chain, pushing for a level playing field for our workers and companies, defending against harmful trade practices, and ensuring that the United States and allied technology is not used against us.\nWe\u2019re also committed to working with allies and partners to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific \u2013 one that is at peace and grounded in respect for a rules-based international order.\nWhen we talk about \u201cfree and open,\u201d what we mean is this:\u00a0 We mean countries being free to choose their own path and their own partners, and that problems will be dealt with openly, not coercively.\u00a0 Rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly.\u00a0 Goods, ideas, and people will flow lawfully and freely across the land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nThe world is watching how we \u2013 and Beijing \u2013 manage this relationship.\u00a0 And it\u2019s in our best strategic interest to do so responsibly, in a way that promotes security and prosperity and delivers solutions on shared challenges that matter to the American people and to people around the world.\nLast year, I had an opportunity to set out the administration\u2019s comprehensive PRC strategy to \u201cinvest, align, and compete.\u201d\nWe have made historic investments here at home \u2013 including the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 to strengthen our ability to compete.\nWe\u2019ve aligned our approach with key partners in Europe and Asia and beyond, working methodically to elevate our engagement around the world \u2013 and as a result, we have achieved greater convergence on how to deal with the challenges that China poses than ever before.\nAs we compete, we will work to maintain open lines of communication at all levels with the PRC to avoid miscalculation, to prevent competition from veering into conflict.\u00a0 Senior-level engagements over the past few weeks demonstrate that commitment.\nWe will purposefully engage China, not as a favor, or with engagement as an end in and of itself, but in ways that reflect our values and where we can find areas of cooperation that are in our mutual interest. That\u2019s what the world expects of responsible powers.\nSo we\u2019ll push for progress on priorities like the climate crisis, macroeconomic stability, public health.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to press the need to curb the flow of precursors that exacerbate fentanyl and synthetic opioids and the crisis that they pose.\u00a0 And I very much appreciate the leadership of this committee on this most urgent challenge for the United States.\nWe\u2019ve heard from members in both parties, on both sides of the Hill, that this unprecedented challenge requires an ambitious resource strategy.\u00a0 We very much agree.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the President\u2019s proposed FY2024 State Department budget aims to do: to give us the resources and the agility to advance our strategy.\nThis budget positions the United States to up our game in the Indo-Pacific: the frontline of our competition with China. \u00a0The Indo-Pacific is the most dynamic and fastest-growing region in the world \u2013 50 percent of the world\u2019s population, 60 percent of global GDP, eight of the top 15 U.S. export markets.\u00a0 It supports 3 million jobs here in the United States, provides about $900 billion in foreign direct investment to our country, and it\u2019s driven about 75 percent of global economic growth over the last five years.\u00a0 China, as it happens, invests a full 50 percent of its assistance and economic and diplomatic resources in the Indo-Pacific.\nOur budget proposal will allow us to further deepen our diplomatic footprint in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 from new missions in the Pacific Islands, to a surge of new positions in the region and beyond, including in the areas of greatest contestation with Beijing like technology, economics, and regional and international organizations.\nBeijing understands that diplomacy is a critical tool.\u00a0 It\u2019s why it\u2019s invested heavily in building up its own diplomatic capacity, its own diplomatic reach, and in fact it\u2019s increased its diplomatic budget last year at a faster rate than its military one.\u00a0 And today, it has more diplomatic posts around the world than the United States.\u00a0 If we\u2019re serious about this competition, we have to demonstrate the same diplomatic seriousness of purpose across the board.\nNow, we\u2019re not demanding that other countries \u201cchoose\u201d between us and China \u2013 but rather, we aim to offer a more attractive choice.\u00a0 If we can spark a race to the top, so much the better.\u00a0 That would be to everyone\u2019s benefit.\u00a0 Our budget sets us up to work with likeminded partners to strengthen our offer, and ensure it\u2019s relevant and responsive to the needs and aspirations of people around the world.\nThat\u2019s why the budget includes $2 billion in new investments in high-quality, sustainable infrastructure, rather than low-quality, opaque, extractive projects that leave countries mired in debt.\nIt would invest $2 billion to bolster Indo-Pacific economies and help the United States compete in areas where the PRC currently dominates and in key priorities for the region, including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean energy, digital technology, underseas communications cables, critical mineral mining.\nAnd it contains over $7 billion to extend our economic engagement with the Freely Associated States via the Compacts of Free Association.\u00a0 That\u2019s a critical component of our Indo-Pacific and National Security Strategy.\nAltogether, these funding streams ensure that we can meet a generational challenge and demonstrate our long-term commitment on issues that matter most to key countries in the region \u2013 so that the United States remains the partner of choice.\nDuring this decisive decade, our efforts and investments \u2013 together with our partners \u2013 will determine whether we succeed in advancing our shared affirmative vision for the international system, or whether the PRC can erode or replace the global rules and norms that guarantee peace, security, and stability in the world.\nI\u2019m grateful for this committee\u2019s partnership to sustain the resources and policies required by this challenge and very much look forward to taking your questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Twenty-five years ago, President Clinton signed the International Religious Freedom Act into law.\u00a0 And that gave us a range of new tools to give voice to the persecuted, to empower advocates, to promote religious freedom around the world.\nAt that time, President Clinton noted that freedom of religion was a bedrock American belief.\u00a0 And he said that, and I quote, \u201cWhen we promote religious freedom, we also promote freedom of expression, conscience, and association, and other human rights.\u201d\u00a0 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms this same interdependence.\nReligious freedom is also vital to stable, secure societies.\u00a0 When each person is respected for their beliefs, they are more empowered to reach their full potential, which in turn lifts entire communities and societies.\nToday the State Department is releasing the 2022 International Religious Freedom Report, which provides a fact-based, comprehensive view of the state of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world.\u00a0 This report wouldn\u2019t be possible without the contributions of our civil society partners around the globe who help to shine a spotlight on abuses and advocate for victims of religious persecution.\u00a0 We are grateful for their vital work.\nThis report assesses the actions of countries that are our partners and those with whom we have disagreements, evaluating all by the same standards.\u00a0 Its aim is to highlight areas where freedom of religion or belief is being repressed, to promote accountability, and ultimately drive progress toward a world where freedom of religion or belief is a reality for everyone everywhere.\nOver the past year we\u2019ve seen real progress in some parts of the world on expanding religious freedom as people demanded their rights.\u00a0 Civil society groups pushed for change and governments listened.\nBelgium formally recognized its Buddhist minority, which entitles Buddhist religious organizations to teach their faith in state schools and eventually to apply for federal funding to do so.\nLawmakers in Brazil codified religious freedom guarantees for Afro-Brazilian indigenous communities at the municipal and state levels across the country.\u00a0 They also passed legislation making it a crime carry out discriminatory acts against any religious practices.\nCanada and the European Union both created new offices to combat Islamophobia, while Croatia appointed its first special advisor for combatting anti-Semitism.\nIn the Central African Republic, the country\u2019s special criminal court continue to prosecute cases of religious-based violence and other human rights violations against civilians since the military coup in 2003.\nAnd more broadly, civil society and other concerned governments around the world have successfully secured the release of many who\u2019ve been detained, even imprisoned, for exercising their freedom of religion or belief.\nNow, that\u2019s the positive news.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the report also documents the continuation and, in some instances, the rise of very troubling trends.\u00a0 Governments in many parts of the world continue to target religious minorities using a host of methods, including torture, beatings, unlawful surveillance, and so-called re-education camps.\u00a0 They also continued to engage in other forms of discrimination on the basis of faith or lack of faith, like excluding religious minorities from certain professions or forcing them to work during times of religious observance.\nGovernments use anti-conversion, blasphemy, apostasy laws, which ban the act of leaving a faith, to justify harassment against those who don\u2019t follow their particular interpretation of a theology, often weaponizing those laws against humanists, atheists, and LGBTQI+ individuals.\nAround the world, citizens and civil society organizations stepped up to counter these acts, often at great personal risk.\u00a0 NGOs like Campaign for Uyghurs and Uyghur Human Rights Project are documenting the genocide and crimes against humanity against predominately Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China.\nHuman rights defenders are sounding the alarm on attacks on the Catholic Church by the Ortega-Murillo regime in Nicaragua.\u00a0 Lawyer Martha Patricia Molina Montenegro\u2019s reporting exposed more than 160 attacks against the church and its members since \u2013 in 2022, from desecrations to arbitrary arrests.\u00a0 One of those unjustly detained was Rolando Alvarez, a bishop who criticized the regime\u2019s crackdown on civil and religious liberties and was promptly labeled a \u201ctraitor to the homeland\u201d and sentenced to 26 years in jail.\nPeople across Iran, led by young women, continue peaceful protests demanding their human rights, including freedom of religion, galvanized by the killing of Masa Amini, who was arrested by the so-called morality police because her hijab did not fully cover her hair.\nAmidst the Burma military regime\u2019s ongoing repression of religious minorities, thousands of teachers from Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, and other religious backgrounds continue to teach the importance of human rights, including religious freedom and respect between religions.\nThe United States will continue to stand with and support these brave advocates for religious freedom.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep advocating for religious freedom in countries where the rights are under attack, both publicly and directly in our engagement with government officials.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep working to defend and promote religious freedom here at home, including through the interagency group that President Biden created in December to combat religious bias and discrimination.\nWe defend the right to believe or to not believe, not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because of the extraordinary good that people of faith can do in our societies and around the world to promote peace, to care for the sick, to protect our planet, to expand opportunity for underserved communities, and so much more.\nSo this is an enduring commitment of this administration.\u00a0 This report released today reflects the picture that we see \u2013 saw emerge in 2022, but we are acting on the findings and observations of the report every single day in our efforts around the world to advance freedom of religion and belief.\nThe person who is leading our efforts in that regard is Ambassador Rashad Hussain.\u00a0 It is my pleasure to turn the podium over to him now.\u00a0 Rashad.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR HUSSAIN:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to thank President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Secretary Blinken for their sincere commitments and strong leadership of our global efforts to advance freedom of religion or belief for all people.\u00a0 Let me also take a moment to express my gratitude to our dedicated colleagues at the office of international religious freedom and U.S. embassies and consulates around the world for their remarkable work.\u00a0 They assemble and draft this report after engaging directly with governments, with civil society, and faith actors of every background, and by conducting their own meticulous research.\u00a0 And they are motivated by their unshakable commitment to the idea that saving even one person or improving even one life is well worth their effort.\nThis historic year marks a quarter century since the passage of the International Religious Freedom Act.\u00a0 During these 25 years, the report has served as an invaluable tool for anyone seeking to understand and address religious freedom conditions in any country around the world.\u00a0 So if you ever wonder whether the religious persecution of any group in any part of the world escapes our attention, the answer is in the country-by-country analysis in this report.\nThe role of the International Religious Freedom Office is to work with governments and civil society to expose, counter, and prevent restrictions on religious freedom.\u00a0 The report helps us tailor our diplomatic strategies to the circumstances in particular countries and to inform our policy decisions, and it identifies positive actions as well and trends that we will seek to support.\nNone of this work, of course, is possible without the tenacious leadership of civil society, including the dedicated leaders who are joining us today.\u00a0 So thank you so much for your partnership.\nI\u2019d like to share some key findings from this year\u2019s report regarding religious discrimination and hatred at the governmental and societal levels and describe what we are doing to address it.\nFirst, far too many governments continue to freely target faith community members within their borders.\u00a0 Russia, a Country of Particular Concern for the second year in a row, continues to target faith communities within its borders and beyond.\u00a0 Brave people of faith in Russia who dare to speak against its brutal war against Ukraine are targeted for repression.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China seized, imprisoned, and banished predominantly Muslim Uyghurs to re-education camps.\u00a0 They continue the repression of Tibetan Buddhists, Chinese Christians, and Falun Gong practitioners \u2013 many of whom are fleeing the PRC\u2019s abuses.\nIn Afghanistan, members of communities that do not toe the Taliban\u2019s narrow theological line must hide their religious identity or flee for their lives.\u00a0 In Saudi Arabia, we recognize the important recent moves to increase interfaith dialogue and religious tolerance.\u00a0 Publicly practicing any faith other than Islam, however, remains illegal.\nIn India, legal advocates and faith leaders from across the country\u2019s diverse religious communities condemned a case of extreme hate speech against Muslims in the city of Haridwar, calling for the country to uphold its historical traditions of pluralism and tolerance.\u00a0 And the Burma military regime continues to repress the Rohingya population, causing many to flee their homes.\nOur report also describes our response.\u00a0 We address these concerns directly with governments.\u00a0 We meet with and listen to victims.\u00a0 We partner with civil society and we also urge other countries and multilateral organizations to speak up, to build coalitions, and decry violations and abuses of the freedom of religion or belief.\nAs we do this work of advocating for people all around the world, we are sometimes asked:\u00a0 Who are you as the United States to speak to other countries about their human rights conditions?\u00a0 Well, I believe that we are uniquely situated to stand up for religious freedom around the world for a number of reasons.\u00a0 First of all, we are ourselves a country founded on religious freedom, founded by individuals fleeing religious persecution themselves.\u00a0 They felt so strongly about this right that they enshrined it in the First Amendment in our Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights.\u00a0 And we are a country of immigrants.\u00a0 People come to the United States from all around the world and demand that their elected representatives and government official promote our values in their homelands.\u00a0 They would have it no other way.\u00a0 So who are we to stand up for religious freedom around the world?\u00a0 In many ways we are representatives of the rest of the world gathered here in the United States.\u00a0 And we also don\u2019t walk away from discussing our efforts to form a more perfect union here at home.\nA second theme and trend the report highlights is the increase of government restrictions on access to holy sites and places of worship.\u00a0 We have all seen the sad pictures of Ukraine\u2019s civilians sifting through the rubble of their beautiful and most historic churches destroyed by Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression.\u00a0 Uyghurs have witnessed the PRC Government destroy or repurpose their mosques or cemeteries.\u00a0 Authorities also destroy the monasteries of Tibetan Buddhists and expelled monks and nuns.\nOn my trip to Jerusalem and the West Bank last month, I joined services at al-Aqsa Mosque, attended the Holy Fire Ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and visited the Western Wall during the convergence of Ramadan, Orthodox Easter, and Passover.\u00a0 I sat down with government leaders as well as leaders of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities to discuss the importance of religious coexistence and protecting access to these religious sites.\nThird, many countries continue to legislate and enforce apostasy, blasphemy, and anti\u2011conversion laws and related polices.\u00a0 These laws are direct attacks on the right to freedom of religion or belief.\u00a0 They criminalize religious expression and justify discrimination and harassment against members of minority religious groups or others who do not conform with the dictates of the approved theology.\nFourth, the report shines a light on the need for governments to ensure equal access to primary services for all, including education.\u00a0 Despite the near universal consensus among Islamic scholars regarding the right to education for women and girls, the Taliban in the name of religion continues to rob women and girls of this fundamental right.\u00a0 In Nigeria, yesterday Leah Sharibu turned 20 years old but remains captive to the Islamic State in West Africa Province after being kidnapped six years ago.\nOn the sidelines of last year\u2019s UN General Assembly, I unveiled Pathways to Respect, an effort that highlights the importance of educational initiatives to prevent and combat hatred.\u00a0 Many of these efforts, such as the 2016 Marrakesh Declaration play a critical role in educating public broadly, not just in the formalistic classroom setting; on the rights of religious minorities.\u00a0 I would be remiss not to mention the countless young people who have been forced to flee their homes based on their beliefs regarding religion and find themselves locked out of any educational at all.\u00a0 I had the opportunity to visit some of them in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.\nFinally, in addition to discriminatory laws and policies, the report describes growing bigotry at the societal level in many places around the world.\u00a0 Let me note the ongoing and deeply disturbing proliferation of anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim hatred, and xenophobia that target religious and non-religious communities.\u00a0 We are seeing increasing links between these forms of hatred and between those who propagate them at home and abroad.\u00a0 Earlier this year, I traveled with Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt to the Holocaust sites on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.\u00a0 We continue to participate in the White House-led interagency effort to combat anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hatred.\u00a0 And on March 15th, the anniversary of the Christchurch massacre, the United States joined with countries around the world on the First International Day to Combat Islamophobia.\nDespite the challenges we face, and in many ways because of these shared challenges, defenders of human rights are building a global movement to respond.\u00a0 The 42 members of the International Religious Freedom of Belief \u2013 or belief \u2013 Freedom of Belief Alliance[i]\u00a0collaborate to call for the release of prisoners of conscience, advocate for laws promoting religious freedom, and partner with civil society to promote respect and tolerance around the world.\nThe International Contact Group and civil society coalitions of religious, non-religious, humanitarian, and development organizations cast light on religious freedom violations.\u00a0 They give voice to those who are locked away or forcibly disappeared.\u00a0 And in London last July, I had the honor to join thousands from countries around the world at the International Religious Freedom or Belief ministerial.\u00a0 The Czech Republic will serve as this year\u2019s host.\nReligion can be such a powerful force for good in the world.\u00a0 Societies who seek to restrict it or use it to harm others cannot achieve their full potential.\u00a0 We vow to redouble our efforts to ensure greater respect for freedom of religion or belief for everyone, everywhere.\u00a0 And we will continue to stand in solidarity every day with all of those are seeking to exercise their beliefs.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thanks to everyone for being here today.\u00a0 Thanks for your work every single day to advance religious freedom and freedom of belief around the world.\u00a0 Thank you all.\n(Applause.)\n",

it\u2019s the \u201chow\u201d through these global partnerships, and that\u2019s something that Norman Borlaug believed in very deeply.\nOn a personal note, as a native of Iowa City and fourth generation Iowan myself, it was rewarding to see the excitement of these young scholars and welcome them to my home state.\nSo with that, let\u2019s get down to it.\u00a0 Now, to introduce the new World Food Prize Foundation President and Former U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, I welcome World Food Prize Foundation COO Mashal Husain to the stage.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS HUSAIN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you Assistant Secretary Toloui for your very gracious introduction.\u00a0 To all our guests here this morning,\u00a0khushamdeed.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the manner in which friends are greeted in my country of heritage, Pakistan.\u00a0 Dr. Norman Borlaug often heard this phrase of welcome from farmers in the villages of Punjab, working to increase food production and prevent famine across South Asia.\u00a0\u00a0Khushamdeed\u00a0to all of you and welcome to the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMy own lifelong cross-cultural journey has taken me from my native Pakistan to living in Tanzania, the Philippines, and in Thailand and has ultimately brought me to the place from which Dr. Borlaug\u2019s \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d emanated, Iowa, where I found my purpose at the World Food Prize.\nSecretary Blinken, on behalf of our president, Ambassador Terry Branstad, Janis Ruan, and the entire Ruan family, as well as our board chair Paul Schickler, and our counsel of advisors, I want to thank you and your exceptional State Department staff for your invaluable collaboration.\nThis special gathering continues the tradition that began in 2004, when the first laureate announcement was held in partnership with the State Department.\u00a0 As a special surprise that year for Dr. Borlaug, who had just celebrated his 90th birthday, the State Department presented a cake with 90 candles.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He blew out the candles and made a wish.\u00a0 When asked what he wished for, he replied that this ceremony could take place with the State Department every year.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So Mr. Secretary, today, you are still making Dr. Borlaug\u2019s wish come true.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I know Julie Borlaug, his granddaughter who is here, is especially grateful to you and to Secretary Vilsack for your instrumental roles in carrying forward his legacy and this wonderful tradition.\nThe World Food Prize promotes Dr. Borlaug\u2019s legacy of global peace through agriculture and champions the values that drive us to create a better world.\u00a0 We do so by holding our annual Borlaug Dialogue addressing critical and cutting-edge conversations in food security.\u00a0 We do so by inspiring our next generation of agricultural innovators and by awarding our World Food Prize.\nSince 1987, 52 laureates from 21 countries and the United Nations have been recognized for their achievements in confronting hunger, poverty, and malnutrition.\u00a0 Now to reveal our 53rd World Food Prize laureate, it is my great honor to introduce the president of the World Food Prize, former U.S. ambassador to China, and the longest-serving governor in the history of the United States, Ambassador Terry Branstad.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR BRANSTAD:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mashal, for that very kind introduction.\u00a0 Thank you to Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack, for joining us for this very important celebration.\nWe are grateful to all of you for the strong partnership between the World Food Prize Foundation, the State Department, and the Department of Agriculture.\u00a0 This laureate announcement is a great legacy of collaboration which dates back nearly 20 years.\u00a0 Thank you also to all the members of the Iowa congressional delegation, many of which are here with us today, to support. Your support is also very much appreciated.\u00a0 I would especially like to thank the Greater Des Moines Partnership and Jay Byers, who\u2019s joined us today along with his team.\u00a0 This is the most Iowans that I\u2019ve seen in Washington, D.C. \u2013 (laughter and applause) \u2013 the most Iowans in Washington, D.C. since we dedicated the statue of Norman Borlaug in Statuary Hall in 2014 on his 100th birthday.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI am thrilled to be attending my first laureate announcement and I\u2019m honored to be here with all of you.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always been a strong supporter and advocate for the World Food Prize Foundation and served as governor when Dr. Borlaug partnered with Iowa businessman and philanthropist John Ruan, Sr. to move the World Food Prize to Des Moines.\u00a0 There wouldn\u2019t be a World Food Prize today if it were not for the ongoing commitment and vision of the Ruan family.\u00a0 We are very grateful for their dedication to this important work.\nAmbassador Quinn is also with us today in the front row.\u00a0 He is responsible for taking the World Food Prize Foundation to the very successful progress it\u2019s made over the last 25 years.\u00a0 Ambassador Quinn, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAll of us Iowans are proud of our native son, Norman Borlaug.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug and I are both of Norwegian heritage, and we share roots on farms in northern Iowa.\u00a0 In fact, Dr. Borlaug grew up on a farm in Howard County, and I grew up on a farm just two counties away in Winnebago County.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his lifetime of work to feed a hungry world.\u00a0 He is the guiding light behind the World Food Prize, which honors significant achievements in improving the world\u2019s food supply.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug\u2019s granddaughter, Julie, is here with us today.\u00a0 Julie, thank you for continuing your grandfather\u2019s legacy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI also want to thank Dr. Gebisa Ejeta, who is the 2009 laureate, for his service as chair of the independent group of experts who select the World Food Prize laureates.\nToday, I have the honor of announcing the 2023 World Food Prize laureate.\u00a0\u00a0 Our 53rd laureate has built a model of work directly with farmers to restore farmland and food security after devastating conflict.\u00a0 Through this work, she has shown more than a million people living in war-torn regions a way forward to restoring peace and prosperity through agriculture.\nHere\u2019s how it works.\u00a0 First she partners with demining organizations to clear land mines.\u00a0 Then she works with farmers to replant fields with modern agriculture practices.\u00a0 Our laureate has worked in nine countries to confront the daunting challenge of rebuilding food systems and livelihoods after conflict.\u00a0 She started by partnering with wineries in her home state of California to raise funds to remove land mines in Croatia and replant vineyards and orchards.\u00a0 Then she took this model to Afghanistan.\u00a0 After clearing land mines there, she helped farmers \u2013 including more than 5,000 women \u2013 produce high-quality crops.\u00a0 She built agriculture value chains and provided market support and development.\nHer organization is one of the few U.S. non-profits that\u2019s still operating in Afghanistan.\u00a0 In Vietnam, she partnered with the State Department and with others to clear unexploded bombs, making it possible to plant more than 1.6 million black pepper trees.\u00a0 Her work shows the world the vital role agriculture must have in the resilient recovery from conflict and restoration and peace.\nFor making her mission to turn mines to vines, I am so pleased to announce that the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate is Heidi K\u00fchn.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHeidi K\u00fchn is the founder and CEO of the non-profit Roots of Peace.\u00a0 We are pleased to have here with us her husband Gary and one of her four children, her son Tucker.\u00a0 Thank you to the K\u00fchn family.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYeah, stand up.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nToday, Heidi is actually in Azerbaijan.\u00a0 As we speak, she\u2019s working in Azerbaijan to remove land mines \u2013 which is her Mother\u2019s Day tradition.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI want to also welcome Ambassador Ibrahim from Azerbaijan, who I think is also here.\u00a0 Ambassador, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 An honor to have you and many other ambassadors here.\nIt will be our honor to present the World Food Prize at the beautiful Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines on October 26th.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 This will culminate the event of the 2023 International Borlaug Dialogue from October 24th through the 26th, which will be held in person as well as virtually.\u00a0 Our theme this year is \u201cHarnessing Change.\u201d\nAgain, I want to say thanks to all of you for coming today.\u00a0 I hope to see you all in Des Moines in October \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as we celebrate our 2023 laureate.\u00a0 Again, thank you for being here, and\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to Heidi K\u00fchn as our new laureate.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR FOWLER:\u00a0 Good morning.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Good morning.\nMR FOWLER:\u00a0 I\u2019m Cary Fowler.\u00a0 I\u2019m the Special Envoy for Global Food Security, and I feel like I should say I\u2019m not from Iowa.\u00a0 I think I\u2019m the first one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The office of secretary of state is not where you would expect to find a farmer sitting behind the desk.\u00a0 And indeed, I \u2013 not sure that there has been one sitting behind that desk since the first secretary of state, who was Thomas Jefferson.\u00a0 Jefferson famously said that the greatest service that can be rendered to any country is to add a new crop to its cultivation.\u00a0 Norman Borlaug, the inspiration for the World Food Prize, effectively did that by giving new life and added productivity to one of the world\u2019s oldest staple crops: wheat.\nSeveral weeks ago, our next speaker appeared before a Senate committee, and among other things \u2013 after all, it was, I think, a hearing that lasted several hours \u2013 mentioned the importance of adapting crops and the importance of soil fertility to food security.\u00a0 I can imagine that both Thomas Jefferson and Norman Borlaug would have approved.\nIn our community, Mr. Secretary, it\u2019s a high honor to be mentioned in the same sentence with Thomas Jefferson and Norman Borlaug, but that honor belongs to you.\u00a0 It belongs to you for the priority that you\u2019ve given to combatting food insecurity, the guiding spirit behind the World Food Prize.\nSo it\u2019s my privilege to introduce my boss and our Secretary of State, Antony Blinken to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Welcome to Iowa Day.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 This is a shameless promotion for the state.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I\u2019m glad that Cary mentioned that he\u2019s not from Iowa because I was going to ask: Is there anyone here who is not from Iowa?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And it turns out that apparently, Cary, you and I are probably the only people who are not, although maybe we should do a little bit of digging into the birth records to find out.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut thank you, my friend, for that truly lovely introduction, humbling introduction.\u00a0 To you, to Under Secretary Jose Fernandez, Assistant Secretary Toloui, to the entire team in our Office of Agricultural Policy, thank you for what you\u2019re doing every single day to fight global hunger.\nAnd it\u2019s particularly inspiring to be here with many of the people who are leading what is a whole-of-government mission to advance our commitment to food security.\u00a0 Agriculture Secretary Vilsack, USAID Assistant Administrator Dina Esposito, and many of members of Congress who are with us today, it\u2019s wonderful to have you here, wonderful to have your partnership in this absolutely essential \u2013 it\u2019s hard to think of a more essential \u2013 effort that we make around the world.\nAnd Ambassador Branstad \u2013 maybe I should say governor because once a governor, always a governor, especially if you happen to the longest-serving governor in the history of the United States.\u00a0 And Secretary Vilsack, Governor Vilsack, the longest-serving Democratic governor in the State of Iowa.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nBut Terry, thank you to you, to everyone at the World Food Prize Foundation for the absolutely vital work that you\u2019re doing to inspire action and support outstanding individuals who are improving global food security, including, of course, this year\u2019s remarkable laureate, Heidi K\u00fchn.\nIt\u2019s wonderful that members of her family are here.\u00a0 I thought how inspiring that someone who has just won one of the most significant awards any of us can give can\u2019t be here.\u00a0 Because what is she doing?\u00a0 She\u2019s actually doing her work in the field, helping to remove landmines in Azerbaijan.\u00a0 I think that in and of itself is an extraordinary tribute to Heidi and the work that she does.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo as you\u2019ve heard, for more than 25 years, Heidi has led a movement to remove landmines from former conflict zones and plant crops in their place \u2013 turning fields of death into gardens of life.\nIn total, by harnessing the collective power of governments, businesses, international organizations, Heidi\u2019s non-profit, Roots of Peace, has, as you\u2019ve heard, removed over 100,000 landmines.\u00a0\u00a0 And not just removed them \u2013 this is what\u2019s so extraordinarily powerful \u2013 restored the land that is now being used by over a million farmers across nine countries, helping to feed people and create economic opportunity for so many.\nNow, we know that today conflict remains the largest single driver of food insecurity.\u00a0 The ten worst food crises in the world have all been caused or worsened by conflict.\u00a0 Seventy percent of the hungriest people in the world live in regions that are affected by war and by violence.\u00a0 And, often, even when the violence ends, hunger remains.\nOver the last year, millions more have been affected by conflict beyond their borders, as the Kremlin has tried to leverage food as a weapon in its aggression against Ukraine.\nFood insecurity, of course, is also being worsened by other intersecting challenges \u2013 COVID\u201119 and its disruption of global food supply chains and the climate crisis that\u2019s killing crops around the world.\u00a0 Hundreds of millions of people face food insecurity across our planet.\nSo for me, for the State Department, this is of course first and foremost a human issue, but it\u2019s also a national security issue, as well as an economic issue.\u00a0 In the United States, we are deeply committed to addressing it on all of these fronts.\nWe\u2019ve long been the largest single donor of global food assistance, something that I\u2019m immensely proud of.\u00a0 Last year, we contributed $13.5 billion to these efforts \u2013 when we had the Russian aggression exacerbate the problem, we doubled down on what we were doing.\u00a0 We provide more than 40 percent of the World Food Programme\u2019s budget every year.\nWe\u2019re also working to sustain the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has facilitated the delivery of more than 29 million metric tons of food from Ukraine to the global market since July.\u00a0 Now, this initiative never should have been necessary in the first place.\u00a0 It never should have been necessary because Russia should not have invaded Ukraine.\u00a0 It never should have been necessary because once Russia invaded Ukraine, it shouldn\u2019t have gotten into the business of blockading Ukraine\u2019s ports and preventing food from going around the world to people who desperately need it.\u00a0 Nonetheless, it was necessary.\nThe United Nations, T\u00fcrkiye did an extraordinary job in helping to set it up.\u00a0 But the fact that it succeeded over the last months in getting so much grain to so many places around the world is a very powerful thing.\u00a0 This includes eight million tons of wheat.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of roughly 16 billion loaves of bread, most of which has gone to low-income countries, including under the auspices of the World Food Programme.\nJust as we\u2019re focused on the acute humanitarian challenge of hunger, we\u2019re also addressing long-term food insecurity \u2013 including by working closely with partners across the globe.\u00a0 Because none of us can solve this complex problem alone, and also because what I\u2019ve heard time and again, especially from engaging with my counterparts around the world \u2013 foreign ministers from Africa and other places \u2013 is again and again:\u00a0 Yes, we need, we\u2019re grateful for emergency assistance, but what we most want is the ability to sustain the production for ourselves.\u00a0 And so the more that we can contribute to that, the more that we can help countries build resilient, sustaining productive capacity, that really is the objective.\nWe\u2019ve heard from partners again and again:\u00a0 Emergency food aid cannot be the only solution. And so we are investing in sustainable, long-term food production.\nLast May, we helped launch the Roadmap for Global Food Security, which calls on countries to fight hunger for generations to come \u2013 not just next month, not just next year, but for generations to come.\u00a0 Today, more than 100 countries have signed on and pledged to take swift, concrete steps toward building stronger, more resilient food systems, from improving access to markets for farmers to boosting the productivity of crops.\nWe\u2019re putting a special focus on adapting agricultural to \u2013 agriculture to the changing environment that we\u2019re all experiencing.\u00a0 We\u2019re helping farmers learn techniques that make their crops more resilient.\u00a0 Dr. Fowler is doing extraordinary work, along with international organizations, researchers, and donors, to improve healthy soil and identify regional crops that can thrive in Africa despite climate change.\u00a0 This focus on soil and seeds is absolutely essential for the future.\nWe also expanded USAID\u2019s Feed the Future program last year, from 12 target countries to 20, which will help farmers produce more crops, raise healthier livestock, and grow their businesses.\u00a0 The work that USAID is doing every single day on the frontlines of this effort is absolutely central to our efforts.\nPartnerships \u2013 across governments, science, business \u2013 that\u2019s at the heart of so much of our work on food insecurity.\u00a0 It is critical to our success.\nAnd when it comes down to it, it\u2019s the pioneers and visionaries like Heidi K\u00fchn who are such a big part of this process.\u00a0 They bring a spirit of innovation to this work.\u00a0 They bring a spirit of determination to this work, and they are quite literally forging new paths toward progress.\nIt\u2019s of course a special honor to be in the long, extraordinary shadow of Norm Borlaug.\u00a0 Hard to think of a fellow citizen who\u2019s done more for the world over so many years.\u00a0 And Julie, a reference has been made to you.\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 Are you here with us today?\u00a0 And if so, stand up \u2013 if not, we send our greetings to you.\u00a0 We send our greetings to the entire family.\u00a0 The efforts that Norman made to make our planet a little bit more just, a little bit more stable, a little bit more peaceful.\nTo this year\u2019s winner of the prize, thank you for carrying on that extraordinary tradition.\u00a0 And thanks to all of you for being here today and for your efforts every single day to help feed our planet.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, thank you for those wonderful remarks.\u00a0 We now return to the Iowan portion of the programming.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And it\u2019s my honor to introduce another leader on food security here and abroad, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY VILSACK:\u00a0\u00a0When I ran for governor in 1998, I wore a sweatshirt that said: I wasn\u2019t born in Iowa, but I got here as fast as I could.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So Tony, Dr. Fowler, there\u2019s still hope.\u00a0\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIt\u2019s an honor to be here today to acknowledge the work of Heidi and Roots [of] Peace.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s somewhat of a framing device for the last month that I\u2019ve experienced as Secretary of Agriculture.\u00a0 Several weeks ago I was in Vietnam visiting with the prime minister about our relationship.\u00a0 And what a phenomenal experience it is to be in Vietnam, a person my age; to have the experience of being welcomed by a leader and have the conversation and discussion substantively talk about the important role of agriculture in building relationships and friendships between two countries who in a lifetime had been at war.\nIt was interesting to me because at the tail end of our conversation, after we\u2019d gotten through all of the trade issues and some of the substantive issues, the prime minister turned to me and he said, \u201cWe still need help.\u00a0 We still need help removing explosive devices from our fields.\u00a0 We still need the United States to work with us to allow our farmers the opportunity to farm.\u201d\u00a0 So Heidi\u2019s work obviously incredibly important and ongoing, tragically.\nI then traveled to Japan, another country at one point in time that we were at war, and had the opportunity to visit with the agricultural minister, whose first comment about the relationship between the United States and Japan was focused on the hog lift that Iowa farmers were engaged in when a tsunami hit Japan and wiped out their hog industry, and the importance and significance of that relationship that is still valued today.\u00a0 As Ambassador Branstad knows, we\u2019ve both been to Yamanashi, we both know how important that connection has been.\nAnd then I come back home, and this week we invited folks who are engaged in our AIM For Climate Initiative.\u00a0 Now, this is an initiative that is right down Norman Borlaug\u2019s sweet spot.\u00a0 It is about science, it\u2019s about innovation, it\u2019s about agriculture and the role of embracing and enabling farmers to continue to be productive, sustainable, and profitable.\u00a0 We welcomed the largest number of agricultural ministers that have ever assembled in Washington, D.C. \u2013 over 50 nations represented at our Aim For Climate Summit.\nAnd during the course of the conversations that we had with a number of noted guests, Norman Borlaug\u2019s name was mentioned, world food laureate prize \u2013 World Food Prize laureates\u2019 names were mentioned frequently, because there was a recognition and understanding that in order for us to deal with the existential challenge that we face in agriculture and in food security of continuing to be productive at a time when climate is changing and threatening our capacity to produce, it is science and innovation that is at the heart of how we\u2019re going to approach this issue.\nNorman had some great advice for policy makers, and that advice was take it to the farmer.\u00a0 If you provide farmers the information, if you provide them the resources, there isn\u2019t anything they can\u2019t do.\u00a0 There isn\u2019t any problem they can\u2019t solve when it comes to growing and raising food.\nIt\u2019s been an extraordinary journey, and the World Food Prize allows us every year in October to focus the world\u2019s attention on the importance of agriculture, on the importance of farmers, on the significant contribution they make not just to food security but to overall peace and security, as witnessed by the fact that we\u2019re now working with Vietnam, we\u2019ve always worked with Japan.\u00a0 And during the course of the G7 meeting that was in Japan, the minister from Ukraine came on by video and talked about the necessity and need that when this war ultimately is over \u2013 and we hope it is over as soon as possible \u2013 the expectation is that the United States of America will work collaboratively with Ukraine to rebuild their agricultural economy.\nSo in acknowledging Heidi\u2019s work, in acknowledging the work of the laureates in the past, we really live the opportunity to remind ourselves of the importance of vision; the importance of a man, Norman Borlaug, whose vision still today impacts our ability to produce; the vision of John Ruan and John Ruan\u2019s family in allowing this great opportunity to continue.\nSo I\u2019m pleased to be here today.\u00a0 I\u2019m pleased to acknowledge Heidi and her family for the work that they do.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known her for quite some time.\u00a0 The passion \u2013 the unfortunate thing was she\u2019s not here today, because if she were, you would understand and appreciate the passion that drives her.\u00a0 And that is the same passion that drove Norman Borlaug.\u00a0 It is the same passion that has driven every one of our laureates.\nSo this is a day of celebration, a day of acknowledgment of the work of one person to make a difference.\u00a0 But at the end of the day, it is ultimately a celebration of the power and significance of agriculture and of farmers everywhere in the world.\u00a0 And that is indeed a cause for great celebration.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Vilsack, for those remarks.\u00a0 It\u2019s now my honor to introduce Dina Esposito, assistant to the administrator for the International Development Bureau for Resilience and Food Security at the U.S. Agency for International Development and deputy coordinator of the Feed the Future program.\nDina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS ESPOSITO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Assistant Secretary Toloui, and good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be here with those of you in Washington, and welcome to those of you joining virtually online as well.\u00a0 I am thrilled to be here and to be adding my voice to those we\u2019ve heard today and celebrating the World Food Prize Laureate Heidi K\u00fchn.\u00a0 Heidi K\u00fchn\u2019s leadership of Roots [of] Peace has shown us how agriculture can be a peacebuilder in the wake of conflict, not only rebuilding food systems in economies but by restoring hope and helping survivors envision and move towards a brighter future.\u00a0 We don\u2019t actually always think about this connection, how agricultural development can spur peace.\u00a0 Roots of Peace has shown us that making this connection can lead to transformative results.\nFor 26 years, Heidi has been a thought leader, bridging peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance, and economic growth to show how agriculture can help people cope and sow the seeds of a positive future.\u00a0 In conflict zones there\u2019s a tendency to focus on the searing experience of the war itself, and we often forget that these zones are still places of possibility, where people live, work, raise their families; where smallholder farmers \u2013 many of them women \u2013 need to rebuild and sustain livelihoods despite cycles of conflict.\u00a0 We must keep this at the forefront of our efforts.\u00a0 More conflicts rage today than any time since the Cold War, and more people are displaced than ever before.\nAnd when conflict strikes, it severely disrupts agriculture and food systems.\u00a0 A farmer may not be able to plant or travel to markets.\u00a0 She may have to cope in dangerous ways \u2013 by eating less, feeding her children less, traveling farther afield for goods, or quickly selling off her assets.\u00a0 Wages, extension services, and inputs are adversely affected too.\u00a0 And all of this further damages farmers\u2019 ability to make the adjustment they need to adapt to a changing climate, further fueling vulnerability.\u00a0 The better we understand these connections, as Heidi K\u00fchn has, and the earlier we take action on them, the better we can achieve our shared goal of a more food-secure and peaceful world.\nConflict is the largest driver of global food insecurity worldwide.\u00a0 And as the world\u2019s provider \u2013 largest provider of humanitarian assistance, we at USAID often hear, as Secretary Blinken also said, this refrain in fragile and war-torn places:\u00a0 Thank you for the relief assistance, but please help us rebuild so we can take care of ourselves and our families.\u00a0 Because of visionary partners like Heidi and Roots of Peace, we are able to do just that, to integrate what are often siloed efforts of peacebuilding, conflict prevention, community resilience, and long-term development, bringing them together in a shared vision.\nAnd we\u2019re investing in lasting food security in communities around the world through the U.S. Government\u2019s Feed the Future global hunger initiative.\u00a0 USAID is proud to call Roots of Peace a partner in this work.\u00a0 In fact, this year marks 20 years since USAID and Roots [of] Peace first began working together.\u00a0 This was in Afghanistan, where decades of war left the country\u2019s farming infrastructure in ruins and its market linkages broken.\u00a0 Through Heidi and her team\u2019s efforts, smallholder farmers benefited from training, tools, and market support they needed to increase their harvests and their incomes.\nIt\u2019s just one among \u2013 one example among many of how Roots [of] Peace has shown us through their work that we can help sustain livelihoods, even in conflict-affected settings.\u00a0 It is this simple but powerful insight that Heidi K\u00fchn acted on so many years ago, and for which we and the world are profoundly grateful.\u00a0 Again, my thanks to Heidi for her groundbreaking work and well-deserved recognition as the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Dina.\u00a0 And to close our ceremony, I\u2019m pleased to welcome to the stage Jose Fernandez, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, to give closing remarks.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUNDER SECRETARY FERNANDEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Full disclosure:\u00a0 I\u2019m not from Iowa.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But two years ago, I participated in the race across Iowa, the RAGBRAI.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And for six days and nights in 100-plus degree weather, across 500 miles of soybeans and corn fields, I experienced the warmth and the hospitality of Iowans \u2013 hospitality and pork chops.\u00a0 (Laughter, applause.)\u00a0 And \u2013 I haven\u2019t had a pork chop since.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us today.\u00a0 Thank you to the World Food Prize Foundation for inviting us.\u00a0 And thank you to the National Academy of Sciences for allowing us to use this beautiful venue.\u00a0 I would like to add my congratulations to our winner, the 2022 [1] \u00a0prize laureate Heidi K\u00fchn for her amazing work, her courageous work in converting heavily mined war zones into healthy and productive agricultural lands.\u00a0 We at the State Department believe that we must make global food assistance more resilient in the face of armed conflicts such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while also responding to the critical threats that are posed by the climate crisis, climate crisis whose impact on global food security and global agriculture and fishery systems are increasingly severe.\u00a0 We\u2019re fortunate to have talented, far-seeing, innovative partners like Heidi K\u00fchn and the World Food Prize Foundation to help us tackle these twin challenges.\nAnd as we end today\u2019s ceremony, it should be clear to everyone who\u2019s here in person and also participating virtually how seriously the U.S. Government takes this issue \u2013 through pioneering\u00a0 climate-resilient and food security initiatives, what Cary Fowler is doing now at the State Department or working with government, with embassies, with companies, with researchers, with philanthropies around the world to drive investment and innovation towards our most pressing challenges.\u00a0 And we\u2019re grateful to the World Food Prize Foundation for this \u2013 for advancing these goals, as well as to everyone here in this room.\nLet me thank Secretary Blinken, Secretary Vilsack, my colleagues in EB, and Assistant Administrator Esposito for their personal engagement.\u00a0 I\u2019d also like to thank Ambassador Terry Branstad \u2013 thank you, sir \u2013 and the entire World Food Prize Foundation for their commitment to strengthening global food security and food systems.\nThe State Department and our government partners look forward to participating in the October Borlaug Dialogue in Des Moines \u2013 and I look forward to being there as well \u2013 and our efforts throughout the year to advance common objectives to build sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems.\nSo thank you again.\u00a0 Thank you again to everyone for joining us today, and once more,\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to the 2023 World Prize Laureate, Heidi K\u00fchn.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\u00a0\n[1] 2023\n\n",

Department.\u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Manuel, welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to have you.\nAs always, with such a close ally and friend, there is no shortage of important issues that we\u2019re tackling together.\u00a0 And the conversation that we had today, not surprisingly, reflected that.\u00a0 We covered a lot of territory together, and let me just share some of the important points.\nOne of the areas we discussed was deepening our cooperation in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 Spain has long invested in expanding economic opportunity for people across the region, and it\u2019s a key partner in supporting implementation of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which brings a regional approach to promoting safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.\u00a0 We are grateful for Spain\u2019s commitment to work with us on these Regional Processing Centers that we\u2019re establishing, which will expand access to people in the Americas who seek safe and legal migration options to come to the United States and potentially to Spain.\nThese innovative centers will allow people to stay in their own countries and determine their eligibility for lawful pathways to the United States, making them less likely to undertake the dangerous and costly journey to the border to seek asylum.\u00a0 And the centers will be a referral point for humanitarian refugee protections in other countries, including Spain.\u00a0 Spain has already received hundreds of thousands of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean.\u00a0 It\u2019s committed to increase the number of people that it accepts from the region.\u00a0 Madrid recently created an innovative new pathway itself that will work with the private sector to match the skills of people seeking protection with the needs of Spanish businesses.\nI also thanked Jos\u00e9 Manuel for Madrid\u2019s unwavering support and partnership with and for Ukraine as it defends its people and its territory against Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression.\u00a0 Spain\u2019s assistance has come in all forms: robust military aid, including the recent revision of Leopard 2 tanks; air defense systems; ammunition; humanitarian aid, including ambulances specially equipped to tend to the needs of women and girls; and of course, the generosity of the Spanish people, who have now welcomed more than 173,000 displaced Ukrainians into their communities.\nSpain has made clear that marshaling ongoing support for Ukraine \u2013 and for the principles at the heart of the United Nations Charter, including respect for a nation\u2019s sovereignty, territorial independence \u2013 will be a central focus of its upcoming presidency of the Council of the European Union.\u00a0 This is just one of the many ways that Spain is demonstrating leadership in rallying allies and partners around our shared interests and shared values.\nSpain has also played a key role in shaping the Strategic Concept that we and our allies adopted at the Madrid Summit of NATO that sets out a vision for strengthening transatlantic security in the face of unprecedented challenges.\u00a0 And Madrid has led by example in delivering on the commitments we made in deploying additional troops to bolster NATO\u2019s eastern flank, to strengthen the defenses of our Alliance.\nWe also discussed how to strengthen our longstanding efforts to defend and promote human rights.\u00a0 And to that end, we\u2019re very pleased, as we just did, to welcome Spain to the Global Equality Fund, a partnership between governments and the private sector to support those on the front lines of advancing the human rights of the LGBTQI community and people around the world.\nWith Jos\u00e9 Manuel\u2019s signature, Spain becomes now the 18th government to join this effort, which has dedicated over $100 million to civil society organizations and human rights defenders in more than 100 countries.\u00a0 Every year, that support takes the form of training and tools that make local advocates safer and more effective, and emergency assistance and legal aid to human rights defenders and LGBTQI+ persons who face violence and abuse because of who they are, who they love, or what they do.\u00a0 Our efforts are helping to change the views of individuals and communities, and chipping away at enduring prejudice and abuse.\u00a0 We will be even stronger with Spain as a partner.\nWe also touched upon a number of other important issues of mutual concern, including shared concern about the situation in the Sahel and the work we can do there together to help stabilize countries that are in very difficult situations.\u00a0 We engaged on a number of issues relating to Spain\u2019s upcoming presidency of the European Union.\u00a0 And of course, we discussed how we can build on our cooperation across all of these priorities and many others when President Biden hosts President S\u00e1nchez at the White House later this week.\nThis includes accelerating our joint efforts to cut carbon emissions and increase energy security, expanding inclusive economic opportunities, fostering entrepreneurship, and deepening our educational exchanges and scientific collaboration \u2013 something we spent some time discussing today \u2013 all priorities that will benefit the people of our nations and people around the world.\u00a0 With that, Jos\u00e9 Manuel, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) First of all, I would like to thank Tony Blinken for his hospitality and warmth during this trip to Washington.\u00a0 The Secretary of State is a good friend with whom I have had several meetings already, and these meetings have always been extremely fruitful for the relationship between our two countries.\u00a0 Spain and the U.S. share values and interests, such as the fight against climate change, preserving the environment, defending democracy and human rights.\u00a0 And on the international stage, we defend an international rule-based order and we work together on this within NATO, the G20, the UN, organizations in which we share the defense of these common values.\u00a0 These are the foundations upon which our relationship is based, and we would like to continue to build upon this to create stronger ties in the future.\nIn May, we signed the Madrid Declaration.\u00a0 This was the first U.S.-Spain declaration signed in two decades, which has strengthened our bilateral relationship even more in many areas.\u00a0 And one year later, the excellent state of our bilateral relationship is shown with the meeting that we just had and the meeting that our president of government will hold with President Biden this Friday.\nThis bilateral relationship is based on many ties: our businesses, which have a significant presence in both countries; our universities, who cooperate very closely; and we are also united by the strengths of our languages.\u00a0 We have talked about many of these issues, areas of cooperation today \u2013 our defense cooperation, our migration agreement via which Spain and the U.S. will work together in order to promote safe, humane, orderly, and regular migration from Latin American countries.\u00a0 We discussed Palomares as well as the renewal of the Scientific Cooperation Agreement to continue to promote working together with NASA, especially the Artemis program.\u00a0 We just signed an MOU to work together in one additional area: protecting the human rights of LGBTQI people through the world Equality Forum.\nWe unfortunately for many months have done \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the unjust, illegal war against Ukraine, and we talked about the transatlantic ties that tie the U.S. and Europe.\u00a0 Regarding the situation in Ukraine, I have discussed with Secretary Blinken the unconditional support of Spain as long as necessary with that country.\u00a0 We support Ukraine in its defense against the violation of its territorial sovereignty.\u00a0 This will \u2013 we will maintain this until peace comes once again to the borders of Ukraine and Ukraine is able to recover total sovereignty.\nWe also discussed how the Sahel is increasingly \u2013 has increasing geostrategic importance.\u00a0 We have discussed in NATO the threats that come from the southern flank, and we will continue to work to strengthen stability and development in the Sahel and coordinate our cooperation missions via AECID and USAID.\nThe transatlantic unity is key.\u00a0 It\u2019s always key, but it\u2019s even more so in moments like these \u2013 unity among Europeans, but also transatlantic unity with the U.S., which is a natural ally to Spain in many areas: health, energy, food security.\u00a0 In all of these areas, cooperation with the United States is vital.\nWe also spoke of the next EU summit during the presidency of Spain.\u00a0 This will be one of our priorities because we think that the entire Atlantic should become closer.\u00a0 There must be closer ties between our shores and we must create more stability and growth.\nIn sum, I would like to once again thank you for your hospitality, Tony.\u00a0 We will continue to work on these foundations of our relationship of friendship and cooperation, and that is why this week will culminate, then, with the meeting between President Biden and President S\u00e1nchez, which will show once again the excellent relationship that binds our countries.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Andrea Mitchell from NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister and Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good to see you, Andrea.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, as you know, China is the largest holder of U.S. debt.\u00a0 With the gridlock now in Washington, are you concerned that China and Russia will try to take advantage of the economic chaos that could ensue here and the gridlock right now, and that would damage the credibility of American democracy and economic power around the world?\nAnd I\u2019d also like to ask you what your message is to U.S. companies \u2013 companies working in China that are being raided by the police under their new law, their counterespionage law, that accuses them of espionage for sharing data with the United States.\u00a0 What do you recommend that American companies do?\u00a0 Is there anything the U.S. can do to protect them?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, your prime minister was recently in Beijing.\u00a0 China\u2019s foreign minister is now on tour in Europe and has threatened reprisals against the EU if it sanctions the Chinese companies that have supported Russia\u2019s war machine.\u00a0 Would you \u2013 is the EU \u2013 should the EU punish Chinese companies and retaliate against them despite the risk that China will have reprisals against the EU?\nThank you both very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much, Andrea. \u00a0On the debt ceiling, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the White House and our colleagues there.\u00a0 I think, as a general proposition, it\u2019s proven time and again to be a bad bet to bet against the United States.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the conversations that are going on now.\nWith regard to the treatment of some of our companies and other companies in China, I\u2019ve seen those reports and we obviously have concerns.\u00a0 I mean, one of our general concerns \u2013 and it\u2019s a concern shared by many allies and partners \u2013 is the way some of our enterprises are treated in China, certainly treated in a way that\u2019s not reciprocal to the way that many Chinese enterprises are treated, businesses are treated, around the world.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one of the challenges that I think a number of countries have.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we talk to the Chinese about.\u00a0 To the extent, of course, that China wants to have a positive business environment that attracts foreign investment, that attracts foreign businesses, the actions that it takes with regard to those businesses will have a big impact.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) China is a country \u2013 due to its demographic weight, its military capabilities, its economic weight \u2013 is extremely important for global challenges such as climate change or such as using the influence that it has on Russia and Vladimir Putin in order to achieve peace as soon as possible in Ukraine, because the war in Ukraine is a \u2013 it\u2019s not a European war, but it is a war in Europe.\u00a0 It\u2019s a war against the principles of the UN Charter, and China is a permanent member of the Security Council.\u00a0 So it is in that spirit that we work with China.\nWhat we want with every country worldwide is equal conditions under which we receive the businesses of any country in the world and where our businesses are able to go to those countries.\u00a0 And in Europe, all European countries are open societies.\u00a0 We believe in free trade and we believe in a relationship with all countries on the planet.\u00a0 We do always require equal conditions for the businesses that we receive and for our businesses that go to any other country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Eduard Ribas from EFE.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 I would like to ask the minister about the migration agreement with the U.S.\u00a0 Could you clarify how many migrants will be received by Spain, during what time, and especially what migratory status would these migrants have in Spain?\u00a0 I would also like to know if you\u2019ve celebrated any agreements to transfer the Palomares territories and when that would happen, when that transfer might happen.\nAnd for Mr. Secretary, same topics.\u00a0 Are you planning to expand the migration agreement with Spain to other European countries?\u00a0 And there is any U.S. commitment to keep the contaminated lands from the nuclear accident of Palomares?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding the migration agreement and the details of the agreement, the ministry of the interior and the ministry of inclusion, which are the two ministries in charge of deploying and implementing the agreement in and of itself, they will provide all the details in this regard.\nWhat I would like to point out is that this agreement responds to a shared vision vis-\u00e0-vis a very complex phenomenon, which is migration.\u00a0 We need to offer protection to people who for different reasons may need our protection to seek refuge and asylum in each of our countries.\u00a0 We also need to show that irregular migration, the migration that puts so many innocent lives at risk, people who only want to legitimately improve their lives but they choose the wrong path, that is not the only path that exists.\u00a0 There\u2019s also safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.\nAnd when all of us have labor markets, we have needs in these labor markets \u2013 we need labor in very specific industries.\u00a0 So we would also like to show what we\u2019re doing already with other countries through migration programs, circular migration programs.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to show that that migration path, the regular, orderly, safe path exists.\u00a0 And in the end, this is the best tool that we can use to discourage irregular migration.\u00a0 And of course, Spain will also be one of the countries that will join any initiative that may help our Latin American brothers and sisters with whom we share so many things, and so many of them area already living perfectly integrated in Spain and they promote our economic development and prosperity.\nWe discussed \u2013 I was saying this earlier \u2013 the Palomares area.\u00a0 I would like to state that both parties are willing \u2013 this is a complex issue technically speaking.\u00a0 It\u2019s been 60 years that this has been ongoing, and there are a series of technical issues that we need to solve and we need to expedite before making final decisions.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to the Regional Processing Centers, these are centers that give would-be migrants the opportunity to stay in their own countries and to determine whether they have a legal pathway to come to the United States, or to Spain, because Spain is participating in this process, and Canada has also indicated its interest in participating.\u00a0 That means that, again, a would-be migrant can stay in their own country, go to one of these centers and find out whether they qualify for a legal pathway, including, as Jos\u00e9 Manuel laid out so clearly, a worker or labor-related pathway so that they can perhaps fill a gap that exists in a given country when it comes to its labor market.\nSo we are very pleased and appreciative that Spain is participating.\u00a0 As I mentioned, Canada is participating as well; conceivably other countries could.\u00a0 Needless to say, in the case of Spain, there\u2019s a particular logic because, one, the needs of the labor markets in Spain; two, the shared language makes it particularly interesting and attractive.\nWith regard to Palomares, just as the minister said, first, we recognize the importance of this issue.\u00a0 And as he said, it goes back many years.\u00a0 We conducted remediation after the 1966 accident at Palomares.\u00a0 We now anticipate that negotiations related to further cleanup efforts will restart soon, and we very much look forward to working with our Spanish partners on this.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Tracy Wilkinson from\u00a0The Los Angeles Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, thank you.\u00a0 For Secretary Blinken, please, Spain \u2013 and like many countries in Southern Europe, those especially who have ties with the so-called Global South \u2013 have been more reluctant to join in the Ukraine mission.\u00a0 So you\u2019ve listed a couple of steps here today, and I just wondered if this is \u2013 if you\u2019re satisfied, if you\u2019d like to see more coming from Spain and countries like it.\nY para el Ministro Albares,\u00a0in English:\nFollowing on my colleagues\u2019 questions on immigration, you talked about the\u00a0misi\u00f3n compartida, the shared mission.\u00a0 Is it difficult for Spain to continue to receive more immigrants and refugees given you mentioned the many who have come from Ukraine, already several \u2013 several thousand from Venezuela and Cuba, and not to mention Northern Africa?\u00a0 So I just wonder how politically that goes over.\nAnd then second question on that issue, and last question, the United States talks about the root causes of immigration a lot, and one of those root causes is just dire, dire poverty.\u00a0 Do you \u2013 some of that poverty is exacerbated by sanctions that the United States maintains on Cuba and to a lesser extent Venezuela.\u00a0 And I wonder if you would think it a good idea for the United States to ease up on some of those sanctions.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Happy to start, Jos\u00e9 Manuel.\u00a0 Tracy, thanks very much.\u00a0 I have to tell you I don\u2019t share the premise of the question.\u00a0 Spain has been unwavering in its support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u00a0 It\u2019s made that crystal clear not only through what it says but through what it does.\u00a0 I mentioned earlier the very strong support when it comes to making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression and to retake territory that\u2019s been seized from it by Russia, including the provision of very important weapon systems through the process that we put in place, the coordinated effort that Secretary Austin has been leading.\nYou\u2019ve seen strong support for EU sanctions on Russia to continue to exert pressure on Russia for the aggression.\u00a0 The humanitarian support has been remarkably strong, both in what it\u2019s provided to Ukraine and also in the generosity of the Spanish people in taking in more than 175,000 Ukrainian refugees.\u00a0 So we have seen from day one extraordinary solidarity and a strong sense of common purpose and common action when it comes to supporting and defending Ukraine.\nThe other aspect of this that\u2019s so important is this:\u00a0 Even as we together and with many other countries are working to defend Ukraine, to help Ukraine defend itself and to deal with the Russian aggression, we are relentlessly focused on the many issues that are affecting people all around the world.\u00a0 You mentioned the Global South.\u00a0 If you look at the agenda that we just had at the recent G7 meeting of foreign ministers heading toward the leaders meeting coming up, I\u2019d say two-thirds of that was on the issues that are of most concern to people around the world and including in the Global South, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s food security, whether it\u2019s global health, whether it\u2019s finding ways to advance inclusive economic growth, whether it\u2019s meeting the development goals that the international community has set for itself.\nPart of the challenge, of course, is that the very aggression by Russia against Ukraine has actually exacerbated some of these problems, and we\u2019ve made that crystal clear.\u00a0 We are the solution to the problems, not the cause of the problem.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s been clear in the focus that we brought, including, for example, on making sure that the Black Sea Grain Initiative is extended.\u00a0 You have a situation now where Russia continues to try to use food as a weapon in its war against Ukraine.\u00a0 And Spain, the United States, many other countries are determined that that not happen because the victims in this case are people throughout the Global South who desperately need the food and desperately need to make sure that food prices are held \u2013 are held in check.\nSo I think we\u2019re both deeply appreciative of Spain\u2019s engagement and leadership on Ukraine, but also together very focused on this broad array of issues that are of fundamental concern to people around the world.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, I\u2019d like to continue along the lines that Tony Blinken was mentioning.\u00a0 I wanted to correct that mistaken perception of our support for Ukraine, which is total since day one.\u00a0 And I said it today publicly but I\u2019ve said it on many other occasions:\u00a0 It will be there for as long as necessary.\nSpain denounced from day one the illegal and unjustified aggression of Russia towards Ukraine.\u00a0 We supported the 10 packages of sanctions from the EU towards Russia.\u00a0 We have supported the use of the European Peace Facility to purchase weapons for Ukraine.\u00a0 We were with the U.S. to meet with the International Criminal Court to prosecute for the war crimes present in Ukraine, and we do have police officers from our scientific police in Ukraine helping to collect evidence.\u00a0 We provided the largest humanitarian aid package ever provided by Spain to another country.\u00a0 We have received 170,000 Ukrainian refugees under (inaudible) specific statute and we are of course willing to receive more if this unfortunate humanitarian catastrophe were to continue.\u00a0 We have provided military equipment to Ukraine that includes Leopard tanks, anti-air batteries.\nAnd of course we do speak with our friends about what is now called the Global South.\u00a0 We talk to our Latin American friends, we talk to our African friends, because as Tony very rightly pointed out, there is a food crisis, there is an energy crisis that is a global crisis and affects all of these countries.\u00a0 And we want to send the message that of course we are completely committed to Ukraine, but we are not forgetting the needs of all of these countries.\u00a0 That is why Spain has tripled its cooperation programs for development in Africa.\u00a0 In January I talked to all African Union ministers and I announced a package of millions of euros for the African Union and for insecurity situations.\nWhen it comes to migration, this phenomenon \u2013 this is your second question \u2013 and Spain knows this issue very well.\u00a0 We, as a country, have a land border with Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s 14 kilometers away from Africa, and we are very familiar with the complexity of migration.\u00a0 And one thing we do know is that this is a global phenomenon, and therefore we must act together.\u00a0 And this is the spirit with which we are going to start to work with the U.S. and Canada now, as we do with many other countries, and we do this in the EU as well.\u00a0 We will do this in order to tackle this phenomenon, which includes irregular migration, but there are many other issues when it comes to migration.\nWe cannot just become resigned and \u2013 resigned to the fact that the Mediterranean and the Atlantic will be the grave of thousands of innocent people who desperately want to improve their lives.\u00a0 And we need to tackle the root causes as well, because while the inequality between different countries is what it is, we\u2019re facing structural \u2013 a structural problem, and structural problems do not have one solution; rather, there is management, and part of this management is improving development cooperation programs as Spain is doing to promote regular migration programs like what we\u2019re doing with the United States, and we do this in many other ways as well.\nAnd regarding Cuba and Venezuela, Spain has a very special \u2013 in the best sense of the word \u2013 relationship with all Latin American and Caribbean countries.\u00a0 We are an authentic community of an Ibero-American family, and we want \u2013 what we want for all Latin American countries is the exact same thing that we want for Spain: prosperity, democracy, and freedom.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Sara Canales, La SER.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) And I will not discuss the decisions of other countries.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, this week the U.S. has agreed to send two additional destroyer ships to the Spanish naval base in Rota, increasing the number from four to six.\u00a0 How will this increase in military presence impact global security?\u00a0 Why now?\u00a0 And could we see more U.S. military presence in Spain?\nAnd then Latin America will be a big priority during Spain\u2019s turning presidency of the EU \u2013 oh, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 EU, yeah.\u00a0 How can the U.S. through this relationship with Spain benefit from this?\u00a0 What message does this send to the competitors such as China?\n(Via interpreter) Regarding Title 42, Minister, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and political divisions in the U.S. regarding the border as of Friday.\u00a0 Are you worried about this uncertainty in Spain?\u00a0 Are there guarantees from Washington, assurances that the situation can be kept under control?\u00a0 How have other EU countries seen this agreement?\nAnd when it comes to Palomares, you\u2019ve talked about complexity, but could it be resolved before 2024?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 So we were very pleased to be able to sign the Defense Cooperation Agreement with Spain, the enhanced agreement, and I think it\u2019s simply a reflection of the fact that one of the important aspects of our relationship is our cooperation in the realm of defense.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re joined together as NATO Allies.\u00a0 Spain is playing a critical role in NATO.\u00a0 In fact, the work that it\u2019s done since the Russian aggression against Ukraine to help reinforce the eastern flank of NATO is essential to the work of the Alliance and making sure that all of our members are defended.\nAnd in this context but also in the broader context of shared security interests, having stronger defense coordination, cooperation between us is important.\u00a0 That is one aspect of the relationship.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to predict any future deployments one way or the other; that\u2019s really up to our military experts and officials to determine.\u00a0 But we\u2019re very pleased that we were able to reach this agreement and strengthen and deepen even more the cooperation that we have on defense.\nAnd again, I emphasize it\u2019s on defense.\u00a0 The work that we\u2019re doing together is to defend our people, to defend our interests, to defend our values, to defend ourselves at a time when there are increasing challenges to our common security.\nWith regard to Spain\u2019s EU presidency, we welcome it for a number of reasons.\u00a0 One is, exactly as you say, the close relationship that we have, the extraordinary breadth and depth of our dialogue, I think will also be very beneficial when it comes to the relationship between the United States and the European Union, something that we have invested in very significantly over the last two and a half years.\nThe entire premise of President Biden\u2019s approach to foreign policy and to U.S. engagement in the world starts with the re-engagement, the re-energizing, the rejuvenation of our core partnerships and our core alliances, and one of our core partnerships is with the European Union.\u00a0 We have an extraordinarily rich agenda with the EU.\u00a0 One aspect of that agenda is how we see some of the challenges posed by China, and I think what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is a remarkable convergence in the approach that we\u2019re both taking.\u00a0 And I think if you look at the different articulations of policy that have put out, as well as the work that we\u2019ve actually been doing \u2013 including, for example, through the Trade and Technology Council \u2013 with the EU, you see that convergence.\nAnd I think there\u2019s a shared understanding that the relationship that we all have with China has aspects that are clearly competitive.\u00a0 There may be aspects that are adversarial, and it\u2019s our determination to make sure that competition does not veer into conflict.\u00a0 And there are aspects that can and should be cooperative because they\u2019re important things that might be important to our citizens as well as to people around the world that we should look and find ways to do together.\nAnd I think the EU, European partners, have very much the same perspective.\u00a0 The EU is one place where we can really continue to work on the details of how that convergence of views translates into specific policies, and having Spain in a leadership role I think will only advance those efforts.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding migration, there\u2019s several things.\u00a0 Migration is a global phenomenon, and we see it everywhere worldwide, and this is a challenge that we need to tackle from a \u2013 using a multilateral approach.\u00a0 Spain has a way of handling this challenge which includes constantly fighting against the mafias that smuggle human beings, a political dialogue with the origin and transit countries to offer regular pathways for migration \u2013 orderly migration \u2013 and to protect those who do warrant refuge and asylum in our countries.\nAnd especially we must \u2013 we fight against the deeply rooted causes of migration, and that is why this year we passed a new law for development cooperation that puts Central America and Africa at the center of our cooperation.\u00a0 And we have tripled our cooperation programs in many countries.\nNow, when it comes to the Palomares soil, there are technical aspects there that we must discuss at the technical level, not at the political level, and that is where we will set the different stages that must be followed.\u00a0 The important thing is that the will is there in our dialogue.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0Thank you.\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\nLet me start by thanking my good friend of so many years, Mike Abramowitz, for the honor of joining Freedom House tonight and helping you to celebrate the 2023 Annual Freedom Awards. \u00a0Now, we have to be honest with people; we\u2019ve known each other for a while, going back to our college days.\u00a0 We both wrote for our college newspaper. \u00a0Or, more accurately, I wrote for Mike because on the Crimson he held the title of president back then.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThere\u2019s something else you need to know about Mike.\u00a0 I tended to write a lot of opinion pieces read by, if I was really fortunate, one or two of my roommates and a family member too.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I was always trying to get Mike to write more opinion pieces.\u00a0 And his answer back then in being reluctant to do that was I just don\u2019t know, I really see both sides and I just have trouble coming out on one side or another.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well, something\u2019s changed in all those years, because I know, we know Mike, as being someone who is resolutely, ferociously on the side of democracy, freedom, and human rights.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe have here tonight leaders from across the Executive Branch, Congress.\u00a0 I think Chairman Mike McCaul is here, Representatives Swalwell and Panetta, others.\u00a0 Your presence reflects the bipartisan commitment to standing up for universal freedoms, universal rights, to standing up for democracy.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to be able to work with you and other members in Congress every single day to try to uphold that agenda.\nNow, when this organization was founded eight decades ago, the specter of Nazism loomed over Europe. \u00a0In the rise of Hitler, the men and women of Freedom House saw a threat not only to freedom on the continent, but to life and liberty everywhere. \u00a0And so they threw their full weight behind pushing President Roosevelt to enter World War II to join the fight against fascism.\nEver since, Freedom House has taken on challenges to freedoms everywhere \u2013 from standing up against McCarthyism, advocating for civil rights, to, in our time, protecting human rights during the pandemic, combatting transnational repression.\nThe Freedom Index that Mike spoke about is one of the most powerful tools that we in government have.\u00a0 Being able to refer to an objective, unbiased source that shows us the trajectory for good or back of democracy in our world, it helps guide our work and it is that unimpeachable document that we can use to try to leverage progress in country after country.\u00a0 And indeed, what we see today 71 years later is Freedom House helping lead the charge to defend and advance freedom and human rights in what is, I think everyone in this room knows, an extremely challenging and difficult time.\nGlobally, just to focus on the human rights dimension, governments have jailed upward of a million people just for exercising their fundamental human rights and defending the human rights of others. \u00a0That includes one of tonight\u2019s Freedom Award recipients: Russian journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza \u2013 sentenced to 25 years for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, and also for a lifetime of courageous work to seek a better future for his fellow Russian citizens.\nMillions of others are defending human rights on the frontlines, often at extraordinary personal risk. \u00a0People like Aida Ghajar, the first journalist to publish Mahsa Amini\u2019s name after her death. \u00a0We\u2019re honored that Aida is here to accept tonight\u2019s second Freedom Award.\nFor months now, Aida and hundreds of thousands of Iranian women, girls \u2013 with the support of many of their male compatriots \u2013 have demanded their basic freedoms be respected, even in the face of the most brutal repression.\nCountless journalists are working to expose and report on the truth in extremely dangerous conditions.\u00a0 Today, we were devastated to learn of the death of an AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in eastern Ukraine. \u00a0Our thoughts are with his family, with his loved ones, with the entire AFP family.\nJust a week or so ago I had the chance to welcome back to the State Department another remarkable journalist, Ben Hall from Fox, who traveled with me at the beginning of my tenure in this job and then was grievously wounded in Ukraine doing his job \u2013 trying to cover the war and bring its realities to people around the world.\u00a0 It was just a wonderful thing to have Ben back at the State Department back on the job after coming back from truly horrific injuries.\nBut he, so many others who are on the frontlines trying to make sure that they\u2019re shining a light on what\u2019s going on in the darkest recesses of Earth, more important than ever.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a lot to be said about press freedom in this moment, but I\u2019ll save that for another day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nThe work of so many who report on and advocate for human rights and human dignity \u2013 including our extraordinary Ambassador to Liberia Michael McCarthy, also being honored tonight \u2013 is both incredibly dangerous but even more so incredibly consequential.\nPresident Biden has worked to put the promotion and protection of human rights, fundamental freedoms, at the core of our diplomacy.\nAt the State Department, we\u2019ve been ramping up programs to provide emergency support and legal assistance to those who are out there defending human rights around the world; pressing for the release of political prisoners; holding human rights abusers accountable, including with sanctions, visa restrictions; strengthening the rule of law and systems of transnational[1]\u00a0justice. We\u2019re also engaging constantly with our civil society partners, like Freedom House, on how to best defend and advance human rights in the face of traditional challenges as well as evolving challenges.\nAnd of course, one of the most rapidly evolving challenges \u2013 not a surprise to anyone here \u2013 is technology, both in the affirmative pursuit of human rights but also in further enabling repression. \u00a0And that\u2019s what I thought I\u2019d spend a little bit of time on tonight.\nNow, I suspect everyone in the room felt the same way.\u00a0 For a time, it seemed that leaps in technology would be a gamechanger, tilting the balance of power away from human rights abusers and in favor of human rights defenders.\nIn 1989, President Reagan summed up the consensus view at the time when he said, \u201cMore than armies, more than diplomacy, more than the best intentions of democratic nations, the communications revolution will be the greatest force for the advancement of human freedom that the world has ever seen.\u201d\nSince then, of course, the internet, digital technologies have connected and empowered billions of people: amplifying their voices, providing the opportunity to form communities, expanding economic opportunity.\u00a0 And in many ways, expanding freedom for human rights defenders specifically, technologies provide a platform to connect, to collaborate, to communicate across borders.\nYet, at the same time, as we all know too well, in many of the same places where human rights defenders are using technology for good, authoritarians and repressive regimes have abused technology to carry out their own transgressions.\nIn short, we\u2019ve been reminded powerfully that technology is not inherently good or bad. \u00a0Whether it makes our societies more or less equitable, whether it promotes or represses human rights, whether it brings us together or drives us apart \u2013 that\u2019s up to all of us.\nThe United States is committed to doing whatever we can, drawing on the full range of our own tools, diplomatic and otherwise, to try to maximize technology as a force for good and to minimize its misuse.\nWe\u2019ve also made historic investments like the CHIPS and Science Act, because we know we can only be effective in shaping these technologies in a way that aligns with our values \u2013 in particular, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2013 if countries that support freedom maintain leadership in cutting-edge technologies and are playing a lead role in shaping the norms and rules by which these technologies are used.\nOur human rights future is going to be shaped, simply put, by our technological future.\u00a0 And that\u2019s particularly so in four areas where we have to work together if we\u2019re going to achieve the goals that unite us.\nLet me just mention these quickly.\nFirst, surveillance technology, particularly spyware. \u00a0Our digital lives make us all vulnerable to new forms of surveillance tech, embedded in the devices we carry in our pockets, we wear on our wrists, we have in our homes.\nFor many here tonight, the proliferation and misuse of surveillance technology is a daily and growing threat. \u00a0Journalists, political activists, opposition figures, human rights advocates, others across nearly every continent have been targeted with commercial spyware that\u2019s readily available to governments and nongovernmental actors alike.\nNongovernmental reports have found that over 70 governments around the world \u2013 including democracies \u2013 have acquired commercial spyware or data extraction technologies.\nNow, governments, of course, can use surveillance technologies to help protect national security; to enhance law enforcement, public safety, the environment, critical infrastructure. \u00a0But they have to be used in a way that\u2019s consistent with domestic law, with international law, and with proper legal authorization, safeguards, and oversight.\nThat\u2019s why we have mobilized a government-wide effort to try to shape how surveillance technology is used. \u00a0We\u2019ve been putting significant restrictions on the export of technologies and inputs used for surveillance and other malicious cyber activities by governments.\nWe added spyware companies that have enabled the misuse of their technology to something called the Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List, which prevents these companies from receiving products or components from our own firms without the approval of our government.\nWe will continue to identify and sanction foreign companies that develop and supply software and other surveillance technology to governments with a record of using these tools to abuse human rights.\nThis year\u2019s Second Summit for Democracy, President Biden issued an executive order that bans the U.S. Government use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our own national security, including that which has been used to target U.S. Government personnel or devices or has been misused by foreign actors to target dissidents or abuse human rights.\nWe\u2019ve also encouraged the 36 other governments that are part of the Freedom Online Coalition to begin to adopt guiding principles on surveillance technology to prevent its misuse by bad actors, like targeting people based solely on their race, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, their political views, or any other classification protected by law. \u00a0And we\u2019ll keep working to bring more countries online with these efforts.\nA second area I just wanted to highlight quickly, where we\u2019re seeing technology\u2019s impact most significantly on human rights, and that, of course, is internet freedom. \u00a0Governments are finding new ways to restrict access to the internet, to choke off the information that citizens take in and that they share. \u00a0Some shut off the internet altogether. \u00a0Others, of course, use censorship and punitive laws to control how the internet is used.\nAccording to Freedom House\u2019s most recent Freedom on the Net report, internet shutdowns and internet censorship by governments are now at an all-time high.\nNow, we know unfettered access to the internet is essential for defending human rights and human freedoms.\u00a0 Aida Ghajar\u2019s news outlet Iran Wire used the internet to receive critical information from inside Iran to do everything from documenting an accurate death toll from the repression of protests, to sharing live footage of the regime\u2019s crackdown, to gathering and disseminating reporting by its network and citizen journalists.\u00a0 One Iranian journalist put it this way and explained of the protestors: \u00a0\u201cPeople don\u2019t have weapons. They have mobile phones.\u00a0 They have social media.\u201d\u00a0 These are among the strongest tools in democracy\u2019s arsenal.\nSo we are leading a global effort to try to advance \u2013 to protect and to advance internet freedom, particularly in areas where governments are most aggressively repressing it.\nWhen the Iranian regime tried to throttle internet access for most of its 80 million citizens, we issued a General License that enables technology firms to provide more digital services, hardware, and software to people in Iran, from access to cloud computing services to better tools to enhance their own online security and privacy; in other words, to be able to remain connected with each other and connected with the rest of the world.\u00a0 These tools have been essential in helping Iranians not only report on the regime\u2019s abuses, but to tell their own stories and exercise their right to free expression. \u00a0We\u2019re committed to expanding similar efforts around the world wherever necessary.\nThe third thing I wanted to highlight.\u00a0 While we\u2019re working to promote access to the internet for all, we\u2019re also working to address threats to human rights that come with an open internet, including online harassment, abuse, disinformation.\nNow, online abuse doesn\u2019t, of course, target only human rights defenders. \u00a0Instead, the internet and digital technologies are often used to amplify attacks on vulnerable groups \u2013 women, the LGBTQI community, marginalized ethnic or religious groups \u2013 and undermine our broader fight for human rights. \u00a0So this year, we launched what is now at least a 12-country Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse.\u00a0 We\u2019re encouraging private sector to become engaged with us as well.\nWe\u2019re also working to address the massive challenge of online misinformation and disinformation \u2013 again, something familiar to everyone in this room.\u00a0 To cite one example, of course, Russia continues to push a steady, relentless stream of disinformation about its war of aggression against Ukraine, to lie about and cover up horrific abuses it\u2019s committed, to try to justify committing others.\nIn response, the State Department has developed an AI-enabled online Ukraine Content Aggregator to collect verifiable Russian disinformation and then to share that with partners around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re promoting independent media and digital literacy.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with partners in academia to reliably detect fake text generated by Russian chatbots.\nWhich leads to a fourth area that I wanted to mention tonight, a fourth area where technology and human rights are converging, and that, of course, is emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and biotechnologies, including genomics.\nAs a system that reflects the data on which it\u2019s trained \u2013 including the biases embedded in that data \u2013 AI can, of course, amplify discrimination and enable abuses.\nIt also runs the risk of strengthening autocratic governments, including by enabling them to exploit social media even more effectively to manipulate their people and sow division among and within their adversaries.\nIn October, the White House put out a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \u2013 some basic principles to try to guide the way that we design and use automated systems in ways that protect our people and defend our democratic values. \u00a0These include the principle that people should be protected from unsafe and ineffective AI, and that people should know when an automated system is being used and understand how it affects them.\nThe National Institute for Standards and Technology also developed a risk management framework for how to measure and manage the risk of automated systems and make AI that\u2019s safe, accountable, and fair, and that protects privacy.\nNow, I think it\u2019s also not a secret to everyone in this room and particularly to those of you who are either serving or have served in government to suggest that one of the biggest challenges that we face in government is keeping up with technology as a general rule, including AI.\u00a0 It takes us a while to figure it out, to understand it.\u00a0 By the time we do, it\u2019s usually leaped several generations ahead.\u00a0 And then we go to regulate it; we tend to take out a 2 by 4 that governments use instead of a scalpel that may be more effective.\nSo one of the things that we are doing relentlessly, and including in my department at State, is to bring in much more expertise than we\u2019ve had in the past to help us in real time better understand the technologies that are shaping our world and to work together in figuring out how best to try to shape them in a way that advances the good and minimizes the bad.\nIt took me a while working in government over the years as someone trained in the humanities, as most of us are working on foreign policy, to understand that I needed scientists and technologists in the room just to tell me whether I needed scientists and technologists in the room.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So we\u2019re getting there.\nBut just recently, the State Department stood up an entire new bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy.\u00a0 We have an incredibly effective senior envoy for emerging technologies.\u00a0 We want to make sure that not only are we at the table, but we\u2019re really helping to shape the discussion at that table about, again, how these technologies are going to be used because they so powerfully affect our lives.\nAccess to human genomic data opens up a whole other set of human rights concerns. \u00a0Advances in biotechnology have enabled genomic surveillance based on a person\u2019s DNA, potentially facilitating abuses.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen some of those, for example, committed by the People\u2019s Republic of China against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. \u00a0We\u2019re also concerned by reports of the spread of mass DNA collection to Tibet as an additional form of control and surveillance over the Tibetan population.\nGoing back to last September, President Biden issued an executive order on biotechnology and biomanufacturing innovation, which seeks to ensure that the United States and our partners continue to lead and set norms and rules on advanced biotechnology in a way that is rights-affirming and reflects our values.\nNow, we know these principles and guidelines aren\u2019t the final word in navigating the extraordinary complexities around these technologies, which evolve, as I said, almost faster than we can keep up with understanding them.\u00a0 But they are a way to start to create guardrails and to shape the space, particularly as countries on the cutting edge of tech-enabled repression seek to export their models and technologies, with all the biases and risks that they contain, and to do so at scale.\nThese four challenges \u2013 and others that we know will emerge in the months and years ahead \u2013\u00a0 require all of us to try to work harder, to work smarter, to work more collaboratively than ever before.\nAt the same time, for our administration as we consider the larger challenge of strengthening democracy and pushing back against autocracy, we\u2019ve tried to put in place some foundational pieces that will help us do that.\nOver the last few years, we\u2019ve been working very hard to invest in ourselves, to make sure that our own country is as competitive as can be and that it\u2019s delivering on the things that people\u00a0 most want and expect.\u00a0 Because fundamentally, if we can\u2019t demonstrate that our democracies can deliver, if we can\u2019t demonstrate that we can compete effectively, we\u2019re going to be on the losing end.\nThe other half of the coin is making sure that we\u2019re engaged, truly engaged, in the world.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ve worked very hard to re-engage, to rejuvenate, to re-energize our alliances, our partnerships, starting but not ending with our democratic partners around the world.\u00a0 Because if we can build convergence among countries about the way to approach these problems, if we can multiply the weight that we bring, we are going to stand a much better chance in being effective and getting real change and defending more effectively the freedoms and rights that are under challenge.\nBut what I know powerfully is this:\u00a0 It\u2019s simply not enough for governments to do this.\u00a0 We can\u2019t, we can\u2019t do it alone.\u00a0 On the contrary, more than ever before we need partnerships.\u00a0 We need partnerships with the private sector.\u00a0 We need partnerships with nongovernmental organizations.\u00a0 We need partnerships with academia.\u00a0 We need partnerships that bring together all of the stakeholders in this fight to strengthen, to preserve, to defend our democracies and to uphold human rights.\nWe know that in so many ways all of these stakeholders are more empowered than ever before.\u00a0 And if we\u2019re not together on the takeoff, we\u2019re probably not going to be together on the landing.\nAt the end of the day, we together have a shared commitment and a shared responsibility to uphold the freedoms that so many of us have tended to take for granted but that Freedom House never has.\u00a0 I think the great power, the great strength, the great contribution that Freedom House has made over so many years is precisely that: not taking freedom for granted, not taking democracy for granted, not taking human rights for granted; on the contrary, telling us, showing us, that we have to fight for them and we have to fight for them together every single day.\nNow, I suspect many have been awakened to that proposition a little bit more recently, but I hope it commits all of us to try to find ways to work together in ways perhaps that we haven\u2019t before.\u00a0 So what I really wanted to share with you tonight is simply that, speaking on behalf of our administration, we will continue to look to Freedom House and to human rights and freedom defenders writ large who have always been and have to remain our North Star. \u00a0We ask you to continue to work with us, including by sharing your ideas, by sharing your perspectives, and yes, holding us accountable.\n[1] transitional\n\n",

you.\u00a0 And to my friend and colleague, our remarkable ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom.\u00a0 He\u2019s been a remarkable force for the United States around the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Opening doors, opening minds, opening hearts, and making a huge difference.\u00a0 And it\u2019s always great to be with you, my friend.\nTo all of our distinguished guests, members of religious communities, civil society, the diplomatic community, thank you for joining us this afternoon and welcome to Blair House, a absolutely wonderful setting.\u00a0 Blair House, which is, I think as most of you know, the President\u2019s guesthouse, has played host to countless dignitaries over the past 80 years, including more than a hundred heads of state from predominantly Muslim countries.\u00a0 Now we are thrilled to be opening its doors \u2013 actually quite literally opening its doors \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 to community leaders for the first Eid reception hosted here by someone in my position.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo as you all know better than anyone, Eid is a time of spiritual renewal, an opportunity to reflect on a month of fasting and prayer, and to recommit \u2013 recommit to values at the heart of Islam: compassion, empathy, service, charity, gratitude, generosity.\u00a0 Our nation is strengthened by the contributions of hundreds of Muslim Americans across our government, including at the State Department.\u00a0 We know \u2013 I know profoundly \u2013 that our diversity \u2013 it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it is so profoundly true: our diversity is our greatest strength in the world, and we\u2019re putting it to use to serve American interests and values.\u00a0 We are operating in an extraordinarily diverse world.\u00a0 If we were to leave our own diversity on the sidelines, we\u2019d be shortchanging ourselves, shortchanging our foreign policy, shortchanging the country.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined not to do that.\nAs we look around the world, we see examples of Muslims living out the values that we\u2019re celebrating here today: showing compassion for the vulnerable, showing a commitment to justice, showing a commitment to the pursuit of peace.\u00a0 When a devastating earthquake hit T\u00fcrkiye and Syria just a couple of months ago in February, governments stepped up to build shelters, to dispatch search and rescue teams.\u00a0 NGOs like the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement, Islamic Relief USA, provided lifesaving equipment, humanitarian assistance, food, water, clothing, medicine.\u00a0 We saw people coming together in an hour of profound need\u00a0for so many of our fellow human beings.\nWhen the Taliban enacted restrictive bans on higher education for women, governments from across the Muslim world spoke up to condemn the Taliban\u2019s decision, arguing that their actions were inhumane and contrary to Islamic beliefs.\u00a0 Scholars of Islamic law weighed in to condemn the Taliban\u2019s actions, too, noting that the Quran gives the right to education to women and men alike. \u00a0(Applause.)\nAnd in Sudan, which has occupied our minds and focus recently, Arab countries as well as regional and international partners across Africa are providing aid and helping secure an immediate end to the conflict.the se\nThe United States is proud to support these efforts and others, and we will continue to work with our Muslim partners and allies to tackle the challenges of our time, the responsibilities that we all share.\u00a0 That includes fighting for the rights of many people around the world who simply cannot freely or safely practice their faiths.\u00a0 We\u2019re standing up for those who face persecution, for peacefully worshiping, those who are vilified for being part of a religious minority, those who face real threats to their safety, for choosing not to observe a faith at all.\nThe team at the Office of International Religious Freedom, led by Ambassador Hussain, works with partner countries and civil society to advance religious freedom and drive progress on tackling pressing challenges \u2013 global health to climate change \u2013 and they\u2019re doing that, Rashad is doing that, around the world.\nFor us, freedom of religion is a fundamental human right, one foundational to the creation of our country.\u00a0 And our government is committed to supporting the right of every person \u2013 every person \u2013 to worship as they choose.\u00a0 We\u2019re equally committed to standing against discrimination and affirming every Muslim American\u2019s place as a full member of American society.\nThe leaders in this room reflect the reality that Muslim Americans are a vital part of the fabric of this country.\u00a0 With us this afternoon: doctors, scientists, writers, poets, leaders tackling virtually every vital issue that our society has to tackle and confront.\nMina Kalil and Faisal Mumtaz are two such leaders in this room.\u00a0 Both moved from Afghanistan to the United States in 2021.\u00a0 They quickly threw themselves into serving refugees in their new community here in northern Virginia.\u00a0 They both work at the nonprofit Islamic Circle of North America Relief, where they\u2019re helping provide essential social services to new refugees like health care, like transitional housing.\u00a0 They\u2019ve both been generous about sharing their experiences with incoming refugees in panels and one-on-one conversations, because they know that\u2019s one of the best ways to help others.\nNow, if Mina and Faisal are here \u2013 there you are.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSimply put, you reflect so much of the spirit of Eid \u2013 the desire to serve, compassion for the newcomer, a commitment to building a community.\u00a0 And you are, as we would say, paying it forward in a very profound way.\nBut each of you here tonight embodies these values.\u00a0 You embody them with your words.\u00a0 You embody them with your work.\u00a0 The United States, the world, is immeasurably better off because of it.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for being here tonight, and everybody,\u00a0Eid Mubarak\u00a0to everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

Department.\u00a0 As usual, we covered a lot of ground, but I began by asking the foreign secretary to extend my warm\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla on their coronation.\nI was in Atlanta over most of the weekend.\u00a0 I can report that many members of our team got up pretty early on Saturday to watch the ceremony, including me.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s something that captivated millions and millions of Americans, as it did people around the world.\nToday, I also had the chance to thank James for the United Kingdom\u2019s crucial cooperation in getting citizens of both of our countries out of Sudan.\u00a0 These joint efforts allowed UK aircraft to evacuate more than 2,000 people, including U.S. citizens, from dangerous and unpredictable conditions (inaudible) evacuation of hundreds of additional U.S. citizens through Port Sudan.\u00a0 All told, we supported the evacuation of more than 1,300 Americans from Sudan in collaboration with our partners.\nTogether now, we are pressing the warring parties in Sudan to put down their guns and allow lifesaving aid to reach the Sudanese people.\u00a0 Even as we meet here, we have diplomats from the United States and Saudi Arabia deeply engaged in talks in Jeddah, working in close consultation with counterparts from the UK, the United Arab Emirates, the African Union, and other multilateral partners.\u00a0 The collective aim that we have is to lay the foundation for further negotiations between the parties that we hope can lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities.\nBut in the first instance, we\u2019re working in Jeddah to extend the ceasefire and get agreement on the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Sudan.\u00a0 We continue to engage directly with Sudanese civilian leaders, with Sudanese civilian society with the goal of putting their nation back on the track to civilian democratic governance.\u00a0 That\u2019s the goal that we share and the goal that we will not give up on.\nWe\u2019re also working hand in hand, as we have been for well more than a year now, to provide support for Ukraine as it defends its people and its territory against Russia\u2019s war of aggression.\u00a0 We applaud the UK\u2019s pledge to match in 2023 the $2.3 billion in military support that it provided to Ukraine during the first year of the war.\u00a0 In addition to training of tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, the UK is providing MRS, Challenger 2 tanks, armored vehicles, anti\u2011air missiles, and other military aid that will help equip Ukraine\u2019s defenders as they work to retake more of their nation\u2019s territory in the weeks and months ahead.\nWe also talked about the urgent need to extend and expand the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukraine\u2019s ports to pick up the grain: a cynical action that directly results in less food getting to global markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East, and around the world who need that food.\u00a0 While we\u2019re grateful for the tireless efforts of Secretary-General Guterres and our colleagues in T\u00fcrkiye working to break this impasse, the world shouldn\u2019t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people\u2019s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.\nWe\u2019re teaming up to help rebuild Ukraine from the colossal damage inflicted by Russia\u2019s relentless attacks.\u00a0 Next month, we\u2019ll build on these efforts at the UK-hosted Ukraine Recovery Conference, which will bring together governments like ours with the private sector, with international financial institutions, with multilateral organizations to invest in the future of Ukraine and its people.\nWe also discussed how to meet other challenges to our shared security.\u00a0 In March, the UK released its Integrated Review Refresh 2023 and its assessment of both the challenges that we face and how to effectively address them to work together in that area.\u00a0 I think we see very, very close strategic alignment.\u00a0 That includes when it comes to both our individual relationships and coordinated approach with China, which we discussed today.\nThe vision that James set out a few weeks ago in his speech at Mansion House underscores the shared approach when it comes to key issues like ensuring peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as looking for ways to cooperate with China where we can work together to solve big challenges.\u00a0 That\u2019s what people around the world expect from great powers, and it\u2019s in our collective interest.\nI think it\u2019s also important to note that even as we focused today, as we do, on Ukraine, on some of the challenges represented by our respective relationships with China, we equally focused on a much broader agenda and that is the needs, the concerns, the imperatives for people around the world as they deal, and as we deal, with the impact of climate change, food insecurity \u2013 as I\u2019ve already mentioned \u2013 energy insecurity, global health, trying to provide for more inclusive economic growth through work that we and partners in the G7, as we\u2019re preparing for the leaders\u2019 meeting of the G7, can help advance and support.\u00a0 That agenda is very much the focus of both the United Kingdom and the United States.\nJames said something when we were together recently in Japan that I\u2019ll take the liberty of quoting here.\u00a0 He said, \u201cThe world is a healthier, happier, safer, more prosperous place when the United Kingdom and the United States work closely together, and it\u2019s in our mutual interest to do so.\u201d\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t agree more.\nAnd next month\u2019s visit by Prime Minister Sunak to meet with President Biden will offer us a chance to do even more of that, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to it.\nWith that, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Tony, thank you once again for hosting me here in Washington.\u00a0 It\u2019s always a pleasure to speak with you, to discuss the areas of bilateral interest, as well as the issues which affect the whole world.\u00a0 We did so recently at the G7 with our \u2013 all our friends in the international community.\nAnd thank you also for the kind words that you\u2019ve said on behalf of your nation on the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III and Queen Camilla.\u00a0 Can I also thank the First Lady for joining us at this time of special celebration, a once in a lifetime event made more special because we were able to share it with friends from across the world.\nCan I also put on record our thanks to the United States of America and, indeed, you personally for the huge amount of effort that you have invested in seeking peace in Sudan.\u00a0 It was a situation which unfolded whilst we were meeting at the G7 in Japan, and I commend the effort that you personally put in, engaging with the generals, with the leadership of the warring factions, to try and bring initially a ceasefire and then your ongoing work, the ongoing work of the United States of America, in trying to broker a sustainable peace.\nIt should remind everybody that whilst we are, of course, working on the support that we give to Ukraine and their self-defense \u2013 and I\u2019ll touch upon that again in a moment \u2013 we are not distracted from the pressing issues of the day and we deal with them.\u00a0 We deal with them effectively; we deal with them collaboratively.\u00a0 And we\u2019re able to do so because of the very strong bilateral relationship that our two countries enjoy, a relationship which is invested in regularly by the visits that we make over here.\u00a0 And as you say, I know the prime minister\u2019s very much looking forward to meeting with President Biden when he comes across next month.\nBut also we are very grateful to the President for his recent visit to the United Kingdom to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, a topic which I know is of great interest and passion to him, and we value your country\u2019s engagement on that issue.\nWe remain committed to building peace and prosperity around the world, just as we are attempting to do in Sudan, and we continue to work towards that goal in Ukraine.\u00a0 Every time I come to the United States I make a point of thanking your nation for the scale of support that you have given to Ukraine.\u00a0 You are the largest donor, both in military and economic terms, and I know that your support is incredibly important in their ability to defend themselves against this unprovoked attack from Russia.\nWe, of course, spoke at length about the nature of that support, about the next few months, and the importance to not only look at the context through the prism of the conflict but also to focus on the future rebuilding work that will inevitably be needed.\u00a0 We are very pleased \u2013 the UK is very pleased to host on behalf of Ukraine the Ukraine Recovery Conference, where we will seek to build a coalition that will enable Ukraine to rebuild its country after this conflict has been concluded, after they regain their country back.\u00a0 And we value the United States of America\u2019s coordinating role in ensuring that the private sector as well as the public sector is heavily involved in that reconstruction.\u00a0 From the UK\u2019s point of view, we\u2019ll of course also continue to provide financial and military aid.\u00a0 We intend to give the Ukrainians the tools they need to successfully defend themselves against the invasion.\nBut just as we did with Sudan, we remain focused on the needs of some of the poorest people in the world, and I echo your comments on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 It is completely wrong that Russia uses the hunger of some of the poorest people in the world to pursue leverage during this conflict.\u00a0 They should re-sign the Black Sea Grain Initiative and do so immediately.\u00a0 They should unlock the supply of food to go to those people around the world who need it most.\u00a0 And it is perverse that they are using hunger in the developing world as leverage in their conflict in Ukraine.\nWe did, of course, also have the opportunity to speak about issues on a broader context.\u00a0 And, of course, how we recognize the role that China has in world affairs and how we respond to China\u2019s action will, of course, be an ongoing part of our bilateral discussions.\nI recently gave a major speech on the UK\u2019s posture towards China, which was derived from our recent integrated review refresh.\u00a0 We made the point that we need to defend ourselves as nations \u2013 the UK is doing this, as indeed the United States of America is \u2013 against inappropriate activities by China.\u00a0 We also need to make sure that we build alliances and strengthen the pre-existing alliances that we have, as I\u2019m doing today with the United States of America, but also with our friends in the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 And we have to engage with China directly, robustly, regularly, to seek to influence the decisions that are made in Beijing and do so in a way that benefits the whole world, whether that be on the maintenance of peace across the Taiwan Strait, which of course is something which affects all of us irrespective of where we are in the world, to issues such as climate change, pandemic prevention and response.\nAnd that of course brings us full circle to our bilateral relations with the United States of America.\u00a0 We have been close defense partners.\u00a0 We are intelligence-sharing partners.\u00a0 And of course, we have strong economic ties.\u00a0 And we will seek to find opportunities where the UK can be a strong economic partner to the United States of America as well as being a strong defensive partner as well.\nIt is \u2013 and thank you for reminding me of that quote; I do happen to be rather proud of it \u2013 I think it is in our mutual interest and in the interests of everyone around the world that the UK and U.S. bilateral relationship continues to be one of the points of pride, and one which is strong, and one which I intend to make even stronger still in the future.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Kylie Atwood from CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you both for taking questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I want to just ask you a quick question on China and then pivot to Ukraine.\u00a0 This week, when Ambassador Burns met with the Chinese foreign minister, did they agree to begin planning on your rescheduled visit to Beijing?\u00a0 And then on Ukraine, does Ukraine have what it needs to be successful in winning back at least some of the territory that Russia is now occupying in the upcoming counteroffensive?\nAnd Secretary Cleverly, the same question for you.\u00a0 Does Ukraine have everything it needs to be successful in winning back some of that territory?\u00a0 And then specifically related to international support for Ukraine headed into the coming months and year, there are reports that your country is preparing to send long-range missiles to Kyiv.\u00a0 When could those long-range missiles from the UK and potentially other European allies actually arrive in the country?\u00a0 And we have seen in the past that when the UK moves on an additional military capability for Ukraine, the U.S. has followed suit.\u00a0 In any of your conversations so far, have you gotten indications that that might be the case with long-range missile systems as well?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, thanks very much.\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 With regard to China, I\u2019m obviously not going to go into any detail about the ambassador\u2019s conversations with Chinese counterparts.\u00a0 What I can say is this.\u00a0 What we have communicated to our colleagues in the government in Beijing is the importance from our perspective in engagement, precisely because we have a deeply complicated and also consequential relationship that is important to people in the United States and China, but beyond that around the world; that our two presidents agreed when they met in Bali at the end of last year that it would be important to establish and strengthen our lines of communication; and that we believe that that\u2019s in our interests and also something that the rest of the world expects us to do because there\u2019s an expectation that we will responsibly manage the relationship.\u00a0 And precisely because we have profound differences as well as, I believe, some responsibility not only to manage those differences so that the competition that we have doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, but also the potential where it\u2019s in our mutual interest and where it answers needs that the world has as well to find areas of cooperation, that engagement\u2019s the way that we try to pursue both of those responsibilities.\nSo that\u2019s the nature of the conversation that we\u2019re having with China in this moment, and we\u2019ll see where that goes.\nWith regard to Ukraine, all along, from day one \u2013 in fact, before day one \u2013 it\u2019s been our determination to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 And throughout the more than one year of that aggression, we have worked very hard to adjust at every step of the way to what was needed at any given time; and right now, of course, the focus is on the Ukrainian efforts that we anticipate to try to retake more of the territory that\u2019s been seized from Ukraine by Russia over the last 14-plus months.\nI believe that the efforts that both of us have been deeply engaged in are very productive in terms of what more than I think 50 countries have been able to provide Ukraine.\u00a0 Secretary Austin has been leading a process, as you know, for many months where we have a coordinated process to do that.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said repeatedly, it\u2019s not only the weapons; it\u2019s the training, and the UK has been engaged in significant training.\u00a0 It\u2019s making sure that the Ukrainians can maintain the systems that we provide them.\u00a0 And it\u2019s important, of course, that they have the right plans, again, to be successful.\nMy own estimation is that they have in place across all of those dimensions what they need to continue to be successful in regaining territory that was seized by force by Russia over the last 14 months.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Kylie, thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to take slight issue with one of the elements in your \u2013 in your question, but thank you for highlighting that the UK has been very proactive in our support for Ukraine.\u00a0 We are very proud of the fact that we provided the antitank \u2013 the handheld antitank missile systems ahead of the February of last year\u2019s invasion by Russia, and those pieces of equipment proved very consequential in Ukraine\u2019s defense of Kyiv.\nBut I also think it\u2019s important that we put on record that the United States from the very start has been very active, very effective in its support, and as befits a country of the scale and power of the United States of America, it is the largest donor of the allies.\u00a0 So I wouldn\u2019t want to imply that there\u2019s either kind of competition between us or anything else.\u00a0 We have from the very start worked in close coordination.\nThe nature of our militaries is different.\u00a0 The natures of our political systems are different.\u00a0 There are some things that the UK is able to do more quickly because of the nature of our political system, and there are some things that the American system allows them to do different and better.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about always trying to replicate what our allies do.\u00a0 That\u2019s not the point of an alliance.\u00a0 The point of an alliance is that we support each other, that we reinforce each other in our work to help Ukraine defend itself.\u00a0 And as Secretary Blinken said, we constantly assess and coordinate with each other and with the Ukrainians to make sure that the support that we are giving them matches the needs at the time: those antitank missiles at the early stages, air-defense systems more recently, the training of their ground troops, the provision of armored vehicles and ammunition, and the ability for them to project effective force against Russian troops within Ukraine to push them out of their country.\u00a0 And we will continue to do so.\nIt is a collaborative effort.\u00a0 It has proven to be very, very effective.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve seen over and over again is that the Ukrainian, both politically \u2013 the Ukrainians, both politically and militarily, have learned quickly, have been relentlessly focused on using the support that we give them effectively, and have consistently outperformed expectations \u2013 certainly the expectations of Vladimir Putin.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Your assessment on the long-range missiles that potentially get to them?\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, look, you would, I\u2019m sure, understand that anything to do with operational details about the nature, the timing, the scale of our support would be counterproductive for us to discuss publicly.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Mark Stone with Sky News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you both very much.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, a question for you in a moment, if I may.\u00a0 But first of all, for Foreign Secretary Cleverly:\u00a0 It feels as though support for Ukraine is waning a little bit.\u00a0 You may disagree with that, but you can feel it on Capitol Hill with influential sections of the Republican Party and their base across America skeptical now about the never-ending \u2013 seemingly never-ending support for Ukraine.\u00a0 If Ukrainians don\u2019t deliver a decisive victory over the next few months, how do you \u2013 how does Britain persuade America that they must continue to lead support for a Ukrainian victory?\u00a0 And if you can\u2019t, what then?\nAnd a second question for you, if I can, just a little bit more on the long-range missiles.\u00a0 Can you give us any assessment of whether these long-range missiles will come and what effect that will have on the battlefield?\nAnd then in a moment for you, sir.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, I \u2013 I\u2019ve said this \u2013 why don\u2019t you put your question on record, and then (inaudible) my frame of view \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah, okay.\u00a0 Sorry, I will.\u00a0 Yeah, of course.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I want to focus with you on American priorities, if I may.\u00a0 Since Ukraine \u2013 since the war started, there have been nearly 9,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine, according to the UN.\u00a0 In America this year, in the past five months, 15,000 people have died from gun violence; 70,000 people died last year from opioid overdoses, many of those drugs coming from China.\u00a0 Your argument on defending Ukraine is clear, but with so many fundamental challenges here at home and politicians telling people that security begins at home, how do you maintain support for a battle far away?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 So firstly, on our support for Ukraine \u2013 and when I say \u201cour,\u201d I mean the wider alliance of friends who are supporting Ukraine.\u00a0 This means the UK and the United States of America and others.\u00a0 We need to recognize that the outcome of this conflict will have effect all over the world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said over and over again the eyes of the world are watching.\u00a0 They are watching how we respond to this challenge; they are watching to see our resolve.\u00a0 And whether it be in capital cities or non-state actors, the message that we send now is really important.\nI think the message that we should send is that when we commit to something, we stick with it.\u00a0\u00a0 We have the grit, we have the determination, we have the strategic endurance to see it through until its successful conclusion, and anyone watching should learn that lesson.\nI would also make the point that, of course, there has been an economic impact on people in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 This is not a byproduct of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 This is part of the conflict.\u00a0 Economic coercion through their restrictions of hydrocarbons, pinching off the supply of grain to the developing world \u2013 this is part of the conflict; it\u2019s not a byproduct of the conflict.\u00a0 And we should recognize that if we do not re-establish the principles of the UN Charter \u2013 the foundation stone of peace in the post-Second World War era, that powerful nations cannot invade their neighbors with impunity \u2013 the world will be more dangerous, more expensive, more difficult.\nSo this is not just about Ukraine, though, of course, the Ukrainians have been suffering enormously and it\u2019s right that we defend them.\u00a0 It is about us, and it is in our interest, as well as the Ukrainians\u2019 interest, that we stay resolute in our support, because it will become more painful and more expensive if we do not.\nAnd when it comes to the Ukrainians\u2019 forthcoming counteroffensive, I\u2019ve made the point that this is not a film.\u00a0 There are no certainties when it comes to conflict.\u00a0 The Ukrainians have consistently outperformed expectations, but there can be no guarantees in war.\u00a0 So we have to recognize that we are giving the Ukrainians a huge amount of support \u2013 as I\u2019ve said, they have learned quickly; they have adapted very, very successfully, and they have defended themselves incredibly effectively \u2013 and we need to continue to support them, irrespective of whether this forthcoming offensive generates huge gains on the battlefield, because until this conflict is resolved and resolved properly, it is not over.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the message that I have spoken about back home in the UK and I will continue to say to those friends and colleagues here in the United States of America as well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, I can only violently agree with my friend and strongly endorse what he\u2019s just said.\u00a0 We have exactly the same perspective.\nSecond, I would also dispute the notion of waning support.\u00a0 I would refer you, for example, just recently to the very strong statement made by the Speaker of the House McCarthy about support for Ukraine and the enduring support and determination to see this through.\nBut stepping back, there is not a zero-sum choice between some of the work that we\u2019re doing around the world and the work that we\u2019re doing at home.\u00a0 In fact, to the contrary, they\u2019re directly linked and they\u2019re mutually reinforcing.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent the last couple of years making historic investments in ourselves \u2013 infrastructure, our technological edge when it comes to semiconductors, making sure that the United States would continue to lead when it comes to dealing with climate change and producing the technology of the future, green technology for green economies.\nAt the same time, working closely with our partners, we\u2019ve revitalized, re-engaged our alliances, our partnerships.\u00a0 We\u2019ve built new ones.\u00a0 The net result is that we are stronger at home, and our standing around the world is at I think the highest level that I\u2019ve seen in recent years.\nAnd, of course, we are \u2013 I was going to say walking and chewing gum \u2013 running and chewing gum at the same time.\u00a0 Even as we are engaged in helping Ukraine defend itself against this Russian aggression, for all the reasons the Foreign Secretary laid out \u2013 and, as he said earlier, we are equally focused on a very broad global agenda that addresses the needs and concerns of people around the world as well as our own citizens, and, of course, we\u2019re focused on challenges that we have at home.\nYou mentioned opioids, synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\u00a0 We\u2019re relentlessly focused on that, and that is by definition a problem that is both local and global.\u00a0 We\u2019re in the midst of building a much stronger global coalition to deal with the ravages that fentanyl is producing.\u00a0 In the United States, it\u2019s the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 49.\u00a0 So this is right at the top of our agenda.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re working very hard at home to deal with demand, to deal with treatment, to deal with recovery.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re working very closely, including with our neighbor Mexico, on the law enforcement piece to break up the cartels, to break up the financing, to interrupt the distribution.\u00a0 But more broadly, we\u2019re also working to get at the global network that has the production of some of the chemicals that go into fentanyl being made halfway around the world, and then coming close to us, perhaps getting diverted into the illicit produciton of fentanyl, and then winding up in the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what the coalition that we\u2019re building \u2013 and more on that in the coming weeks \u2013 will work to address.\nWe know that in the United States, when it comes to fentanyl and synthetic opioids, to some extent we\u2019ve been the canary in the coal mine.\u00a0 It hit us first, and it\u2019s hit us very hard.\u00a0 But as the markets become saturated in the United States, we see criminal enterprises trying to make markets elsewhere in the world, including in Europe, including in Asia.\u00a0 And there is a growing awareness and urgency on the part of other countries to making sure that we\u2019re tackling this problem.\nSo that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re not only doing it at home \u2013 we\u2019re doing it by building a very strong partnership with other countries, with the private sector, and other institutions to engage on it.\nSo the bottom line is these are not zero-sum choices.\u00a0 These are responsibilities we have: dealing with challenges we have at home, dealing with challenges we have around the world, and understanding the connections that exist between them.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Shaun Tandon with the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi there.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 Another conflict that\u2019s caused a lot of suffering: Syria.\u00a0 Just two days ago, the Arab League voted to readmit Syria.\u00a0 To both of you, do you see this at all as a failure of the efforts to isolate Assad that have been going on for many years?\u00a0 Specifically to Secretary Blinken, across partisan lines in Congress there are calls to continue using the Caesar Act and other authorities to prevent normalization with Assad.\u00a0 Is this still something that can be done, despite the reconciliation by the Arab League and by T\u00fcrkiye, for that matter, with the Assad regime?\nAnd to Foreign Secretary Cleverly, on that note as well, does the United Kingdom agree with the U.S. approach of no reconstruction aid at this point so long as Assad is there?\u00a0 Is that the approach that you think is beneficial?\nAnd just briefly, if I could ask both of you if you had any \u2013 any thoughts on the events today in Pakistan.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Khan was arrested; there was some violence.\u00a0 If you have any thoughts on that \u2013 thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Shaun, thank you.\u00a0 Let me \u2013 let me address Syria first.\u00a0 A few things on that.\u00a0 We do not believe that Syria merits readmission to the Arab League.\u00a0 It\u2019s a point we\u2019ve made to all of our regional partners, but they have to make their own decisions.\u00a0 And our position is clear:\u00a0 We are not going to be in the business of normalizing relations with Assad and with that regime.\nHaving said that, we also clearly have shared goals when it comes to Syria with our partners.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s reflected in a number of the things that they\u2019ve said.\u00a0 First, ultimately the only solution to the crisis inflicted on Syria by Assad has to be consistent with the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 that lays out expectations for a ceasefire, for humanitarian assistance, and for free and fair elections to ensure that Syrians have a government that actually reflects the will of the Syrian people.\u00a0 We agree on the importance \u2013 the imperative \u2013 of expanding humanitarian access to Syria.\u00a0 We agree on the importance of continuing the work to degrade ISIS or Daesh, to make sure that it can\u2019t re-emerge.\u00a0 And we agree on the importance of reducing Iran\u2019s malign influence and presence in Syria, as well as more broadly in the region.\nSo I think the Arab perspective, as articulated through the Arab League, is they believe that they can pursue these objectives through more direct engagement.\u00a0 But the \u2013 we may have a different perspective when it comes to that, but the objectives that we have I think are the same.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where the focus is.\nI think it\u2019s also fair to say that in terms of what\u2019s happened over the last few years, what we\u2019ve set out to do is to work to try to stabilize as best we could from afar the situation; to ensure, as I said, that ISIS cannot re-emerge in Syria; to expand humanitarian access.\u00a0 And on those criteria I think we\u2019ve actually made some progress.\u00a0 Fewer Syrians have lost their lives in the last few years.\u00a0 It\u2019s unfortunately a low bar given the horrors of the last decade, but that is a fact.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken ISIS leaders off the battlefield to ensure that, again, that organization couldn\u2019t re-emerge in the way that it at one point controlled a huge chunk of Syria and used it as a base for potential attacks around the world.\u00a0 And the humanitarian aid has continued to flow.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve managed to expand it, and we even managed to continue it despite the horrific earthquake in Syria.\nSo I think if you look at those various metrics, we have made some progress.\u00a0 And again, with our Arab partners, even if we disagree on the readmission to the Arab League, the objectives that we have remain the same.\nAnd with regard to Pakistan, of course I\u2019ve seen the reports that you\u2019ve alluded to, and we just want to make sure that whatever happens in Pakistan is consistent with the rule of law, with the constitution.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Shaun, yes.\u00a0 Again, this is an occasion where the UK and the U.S. share very, very similar views.\u00a0 I had a number of conversations with our interlocutors in the region ahead of the formal announcement of Syria\u2019s readmission.\u00a0 I say to you now what I said to our friends in the region, that the UK is very uncomfortable with Syria\u2019s readmission to the Arab League.\u00a0 But as Secretary Blinken said, ultimately is a decision for the membership of the Arab League.\nThe point that I have made is that there needs to be conditionality if they choose to take this course of action, have they done \u2013 as they have done.\u00a0 It needs to be conditional on some fundamental changes of behavior from Damascus and from the Assad regime.\u00a0 The protection of Syrians, if they choose to go back to Syria from the refugee camps in the region, needs to be assured.\u00a0 The Security Council Resolution 2254 needs to be at the heart of any engagement with Syria.\u00a0 And we cannot just wish away the actions of the Assad regime over the last few years; the brutality against Syrian people cannot just be ignored.\u00a0 And the UK certainly won\u2019t brush that under the carpet.\nBut we do recognize that there is a huge amount of pressure on countries in the region.\u00a0 They seek to alleviate that pressure through engagement with the Assad government in \u2013 or the Assad regime in Damascus.\u00a0 (Inaudible) if they are going to do that, then my strong view is that they should make sure that any steps that they take are more than matched by fundamental changes in behavior from the Assad regime and commitments that are then adhered to in line with 2254.\nAgain, with regard to Pakistan, I\u2019ve seen the headlines.\u00a0 I have not yet had the opportunity to be briefed in detail.\u00a0 The UK has a longstanding and close relationship with Pakistan.\u00a0 We are Commonwealth partners.\u00a0 We want to see peaceful democracy in that country.\u00a0 We want to see the rule of law adhered to.\u00a0 I\u2019m uncomfortable to speculate any further without having a detailed briefing on that.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll \u2013 final question \u2013 go to Nick Allen of\u00a0The Telegraph.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 If I could turn to trade, please.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, how do you address concerns on the other side of the Atlantic about the Inflation Reduction Act?\u00a0 What do you say to allies who might feel it\u2019s protectionist at their expense?\nAnd Foreign Secretary, in the absence of an FTA, and with the emergence of the Inflation Reduction Act, what specifically are you pushing for to boost joint economic security and the bilateral investment relationship between the two countries?\u00a0 For example, was there any discussion today about critical minerals and a deal similar to the one with Japan?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I think as we\u2019ve said over these last months, our primary focus with the Inflation Reduction Act was making sure that we\u2019re making the appropriate investments in ourselves to make sure that we can deliver when it comes to continuing to produce the technologies that are necessary both for dealing with the climate crisis and that are going to be, I think, central to 21st century economies.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what the act is all about.\u00a0 This is a historic commitment to dealing with climate and also a historic commitment to making sure that our economy is producing the very things that will be front and center for economies around the world over the next decades.\nBut as we\u2019ve also said very clearly, the intent is broader than that in terms of making sure that, collectively, with countries around the world that have a similar approach and are of similar mind, that we\u2019re working together to build the strongest possible collective infrastructure, supply chains, ecosystem to produce those technologies.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also worked to make sure that to the extent there were any unintended consequences coming from the act, that we\u2019ve addressed those, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working to do, I think successfully, over the recent months.\u00a0 This is not at all zero sum.\u00a0 On the contrary, I think it offers the prospects for a collective race to the top, not a race to the bottom when it comes to both addressing the climate crisis and making sure that our economies are producing the very technologies that are going to be front and center in the 21st century global economy and making sure that our countries collectively are doing that and that we are producing the strongest possible diversified and resilient supply chains.\nAll of these things are connected.\u00a0 I think there are profound benefits in the IRA for many of our partners around the world because, again, we will be increasingly joined in a supply chain that we\u2019ve been working to build.\u00a0 So I suspect that when the prime minister is here, we\u2019ll continue with that conversation.\u00a0 As the foreign secretary said, we continue to look at ways to strengthen and deepen what is already an extraordinarily strong economic partnership between our countries.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Nate, I know FTAs are often used as a shorthand for closer economic partnerships.\u00a0 We are not prioritizing an FTA with the United States of America because there are many areas where we can work more closely, more collaboratively, have real economic coordination that does not require the traditional kind of tariff-reducing elements of an FTA.\nOne of the advantages of being able to speak directly and regularly is the ability to coordinate and make sure that the completely understandable and correct desire of every government to make sure that it protects itself against future economic coercion \u2013 for example, that it protects itself against pinch points of critical elements of its supply chain, and that is right and proper that governments seek to do that.\nBut in doing so, it also seeks the opportunity to work closely with likeminded friends and economic allies in the same way that we are amongst the strongest defensive allies in the world as two member states of NATO.\u00a0 We are intelligence-sharing partners through the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship.\u00a0 The UK is also seeking to build an economic alliance which protects the interests of the United States of America while simultaneously protecting the UK\u2019s interests, protects standards, protects against the use of constrictions of key elements of global supply chains as a form of political or \u2013 as a form of coercion.\nAnd all these things are best done in close coordination, which is why \u2013 whether it\u2019s in Japan or in London or in Washington or anywhere else \u2013 we always take the opportunity to discuss, as we do the situation in Ukraine, those other immediate pressing issues, but also some of the long-term ways that we can work more collaboratively to protect those things that Tony quoted that I\u2019ve said in the past: the things that make us healthier and wealthier and more prosperous and safer.\u00a0 And I have no doubt that when my prime minister comes to the United States next month that\u2019ll be very much on the agenda that he discusses with President Biden.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Class of 2023, congratulations!\u00a0 You made it.\u00a0 You got out.\n(Applause.)\nI want to say a special thanks right from the start to Zaria Redhead.\u00a0 Wasn\u2019t she extraordinary?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut each of you \u2013 each of you \u2013 has survived one of the most rigorous academic programs on the planet.\u00a0 You\u2019ve endured hikes up Freshman Hill.\u00a0 You have powered through all-nighters, with, as I\u2019ve already heard, a little help from Waffle House.\nYou\u2019ll never again have to wear a rat cap \u2013 unless you want to.\nNow, as America\u2019s chief diplomat, a key part of my job is trying to resolve the world\u2019s most intractable conflicts in places like Georgia.\u00a0 Yellow Jackets or Bulldogs?\u00a0 Atlanta or Athens?\nAnd look, to be a trusted go-between in conflicts like these, you can\u2019t pick a side, even when \u2013 deep down \u2013 you know that one is right.\nBut experienced diplomats know how to send the subtle signals that let people know where they stand.\nAnd so, esteemed graduates, I ask you:\u00a0 What\u2019s the good word?\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0To hell with Georgia.\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So this morning\u2019s ceremony got Tech legend Harrison Butker, whose field goals have twice won the Lombardi trophy for the Chiefs.\nYou got stuck with the guy whose last trophy came in youth soccer for \u201cparticipation.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo, I want to make it up to you.\u00a0 That is why I am proud to announce that, today, I am nominating one of Tech\u2019s own \u2013 renowned physicist, cellist, social media influencer, George P. Burdell \u2013 as America\u2019s next ambassador to France.\u00a0 He\u2019s earned it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, to get down to business.\u00a0 Before we get to where you\u2019re headed, let\u2019s just take a moment to reflect on where you\u2019ve come from, or better said, who you\u2019ve come from. \u00a0The people, as you heard the president say, who helped get you to this day, who always believed in you, even when you were a ramblin\u2019 wreck; the people who put their heads down so that you could lift yours up: moms and dads, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, grandparents, best friends.\nMany of them are here today cheering you on, and those who can\u2019t be, are part of who you are.\nThis is their day, too.\u00a0 So let\u2019s give them big round of applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nClass of 2023, I have to tell you I remember almost nothing about what the commencement speaker said at my college graduation.\u00a0 Not because it was a terrible speech \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 or because it was a long time ago \u2013 it was \u2013 but because my mind was elsewhere.\u00a0 And I suspect that may be the case for many, if not most, of you today.\nGraduation is one of those moments when your past, your present, your future all seem to be converging at once.\u00a0 You feel, rightly, immensely proud of what you\u2019ve achieved \u2013 and, at the same time, maybe a little bit anxious or even outright terrified about what you\u2019ll do next.\u00a0 It\u2019s a time when the question of who you are \u2013 and who you\u2019ll become \u2013 looms large.\nI can tell you from experience:\u00a0 It\u2019s a question you\u2019ll probably be grappling with years to come.\nSo I thought the most useful thing that I could do today is to share a few tips from my own experience about how to navigate the periods of uncertainty that lie ahead.\nFirst, get comfortable with what you don\u2019t know.\nTwo decades ago, I was hired as the staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u00a0 A big part of that job was fielding questions from senators, especially the chairman of the committee \u2013 a guy named Joe Biden \u2013 like how much aid we\u2019d given a foreign country over the last decade, or how long judges served on their supreme court.\nA lot of the time, I didn\u2019t have the answer.\nNow, when you get asked a question you don\u2019t know \u2013 especially by your boss \u2013 it\u2019s easy to feel like everyone will realize you\u2019re an impostor.\u00a0 You might be tempted to wing it \u2013 to fake it \u2018til you make it.\nDon\u2019t do it.\u00a0 Memorize this answer instead: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nI still use this line, including in Cabinet meetings with my boss, who\u2019s now President Biden.\nHere\u2019s why:\u00a0 If you give your boss bad information because you\u2019re too embarrassed to admit that you don\u2019t know, you\u2019re on the way to losing their confidence.\nIt\u2019s getting the right answer that matters, even if it takes some time to find it.\nThat\u2019s important when you\u2019re the one in charge, too, because acknowledging that there are things that you don\u2019t know signals to your team that they can also be honest with you.\nAnd it\u2019s also okay not to have the answers to the big questions like what you\u2019re going to do with your life.\u00a0 Everyone struggles with those.\nNow, you probably wouldn\u2019t know that from people\u2019s Instagram or LinkedIn accounts, where everyone seems to be crushing it.\u00a0 But remember, these are kind of like the real-world versions of George P. Burdell \u2013 they\u2019re highlight reels with the toughest parts edited out.\nYou never know what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s life, so err on the side of grace.\u00a0 And don\u2019t compare their outsides to your insides.\u00a0 Focus on your own journey.\u00a0 Be patient with yourself \u2013 you\u2019ll get there.\u00a0 You just may just need to wander a little bit first.\nWandering is how Buckminster Fuller \u2013 one of our nation\u2019s greatest innovators \u2013 found his way.\nHe was born in 1898[i].\u00a0 He failed out of Harvard \u2013 twice.\u00a0 He joined the Navy; he started a family.\u00a0 He had a successful construction company.\u00a0 Then his world unraveled.\u00a0 He lost his three-year-old daughter to a terrible illness; soon after that, he lost his job.\u00a0 Broke, sad, depressed, he considered two paths: either he would take his own life, or he would fully dedicate himself to serving humanity.\nBucky chose life, but he had no idea where to direct his new sense of purpose.\u00a0 He spent two years rigorously observing the world around him, driven by the belief that nature\u2019s patterns would teach him how to use technology to improve people\u2019s lives.\nHis first discovery was inspired by the triangular structures of spider webs and the branches of trees, which led to his realization that the right combination of tension and compression could make light, flexible structures incredibly strong.\nHe called the principle \u201ctensegrity,\u201d and designed an entire home based on it, whose lightweight parts could fit into a single shipping container.\u00a0 It was Bucky\u2019s answer to affordable and sustainable housing, and when\u00a0Fortune Magazine\u00a0put his prototype on its cover, he received 30,000 unsolicited offers.\nBucky led a wildly prolific life.\u00a0 He earned 25[ii]\u00a0patents in everything from cartography to car design, all focused on serving humanity.\u00a0 To this day, his designs are all around us.\nI was in Montreal recently, and we had a town hall at the U.S. pavilion from the 1967 World Expo \u2013 a geodesic dome that\u2019s over 20 stories high.\u00a0 Bucky designed it.\u00a0 And the mace that Vice Provost Jacobs carried when leading you out onto the field today \u2013 its design is based on Bucky\u2019s principle of tensegrity.\nSo get comfortable with not having answers.\u00a0 The search for them will lead to your most important discoveries.\nSecond, know what you do know \u2013 the principles that guide you \u2013 no matter what changes around you.\nJimmy Carter, of course, spent one of his undergraduate years here at Tech, and he later said that the only way he could \u201cget out\u201d was by getting elected president and then picking up an honorary degree.\u00a0 He had a beautiful saying for our core beliefs, which came from his high school teacher: \u201cWe must adjust to changing times and still hold [to} unchanging principles.\u201d\nThat\u2019s true for individuals; it\u2019s true for nations.\nAs President Biden often says, we\u2019re at an inflection point, when we face defining questions about the future we want and how to get there, including when it comes to technology. The unprecedented leaps in AI and biotech and quantum computing and other fields that you\u2019ve studied are already having a profound effect on the lives that we live, how we live, how we learn, how we work.\nIt can be difficult to keep up, no matter what field you\u2019re working in.\u00a0 At the State Department, I\u2019ve realized that I need scientists and technologists in the room just to tell me whether I need scientists and technologists in the room.\nBut as developments in recent years have made clear, technology \u2013 like any other field \u2013 is not inherently good or bad.\nThis fundamental truth is baked into Georgia Tech\u2019s mission statement, which commits this institution\u00a0\u201cto develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, whether technology makes our societies more or less equitable, whether it promotes or represses human rights, whether it brings us together or drives us apart, that will come down in no small part to what you do.\nThat\u2019s the story of Joy Buolamwini, Tech class of 2012.\u00a0 From the moment she started building websites in high school, she knew that she wanted to use her programming skills to serve other people.\u00a0 But Joy spent almost all her time coding, and little time talking to the people who were using what she made.\nThat changed during her junior year at Tech, when she went to Ethiopia to help the Carter Center build an app to track neglected diseases.\u00a0 That experience pushed Joy to get out into communities where she could interact with people who were using the technology that she was designing.\u00a0 And that contact raised questions, questions she hadn\u2019t grappled with before \u2013 like how seemingly minor choices in language could make people feel excluded, or how to engage people in designing the tools that were intended to serve them.\nJoy found a cardinal direction on her internal compass:\u00a0 Always \u2013 always \u2013 see the people behind the code.\nYears later, she was designing an app that could superimpose the faces of other people \u2013 like one of her heroes, tennis legend Serena Williams \u2013 on top of her own.\u00a0 But the software Joy was using couldn\u2019t detect her face.\u00a0 It only worked if she covered her skin, which was black, with a white mask.\nShe tried out other facial recognition programs \u2013 same result.\nSo she peeled back the code and found the problem:\u00a0 The programs were trained on databases made up mostly of the faces of white men.\u00a0 The result was an algorithm that literally \u2013 literally \u2013 couldn\u2019t see Joy or many other black women.\nBut Joy refused to stay unseen.\u00a0 She took the brave step of calling out the facial recognition software made by big tech companies and the harms that algorithms could cause.\u00a0 She published research; she wrote op-eds; she testified before Congress; she created museum exhibits.\u00a0 She convinced companies to sign onto a pledge limiting their use of facial recognition software, and formed a group of coders to fight for greater equity and accountability in the AI that she continues leads to this day.\nSo like Joy, each of you will have to find points on your compass.\nLet me share one of my own, which has a lot in common with Joy\u2019s:\u00a0 Never lose sight of the people \u2013 the real people \u2013 on the other side of your decisions.\nA great journalist from many years ago, Edward R. Murrow, once told a group of American diplomats that the most crucial connection in international relations is made in the last three feet, by one person talking to another.\nThe more layers there are between us and the people whose lives are affected by our actions \u2013 whether those layers are screens or miles or ideological bubbles \u2013 the easier it is to stop seeing the connections that we can only make in those last three feet, and the easier it is to start seeing people as numbers or statistics \u2013 the other \u2013 rather than as fellow human beings.\nAround the dinner table, when I was growing up, I heard a lot about our country as a beacon of hope.\u00a0 My grandfather came to the United States after fleeing pogroms in Russia.\u00a0 My stepmom found refuge here after fleeing the communist regime in Hungary.\u00a0 And my stepdad was rescued by American GIs after enduring the horrors of the Holocaust.\nSo to this day, when I meet with refugees \u2013 whether they\u2019re Ukrainians uprooted by Russia\u2019s brutal invasion, or Nicaraguans who escaped their country\u2019s repressive regime, or the Syrian and Afghan employees that I met earlier today working here in Atlanta at the Refuge Coffee Shop, I see my own family in their shoes.\nThese meetings are also a chance to hear directly from the men, the women, the children whose fates are too often decided without their voices \u2013 in air-conditioned conference rooms, in policy memos, in spreadsheets.\nNow, some people believe that when it comes to shaping our policies, empathy clouds our judgment rather than clarifies it, and that if we want to advance the interests of the American people, we have to worry less about the hardships and injustices faced by people beyond our borders.\nI\u2019ve never seen it that way.\u00a0 In fact, when I look at the programs that continue to make our country a beacon of hope \u2013 and strengthen our standing in the world \u2013 they almost always are ones where we\u2019ve remembered to see ourselves in others.\nPrograms like the President\u2019s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, which has saved more than 25 million lives and counting in the 20 years since President George W. Bush created it. Programs like the international exchanges that have fostered ties between generations of students, professors, leaders from the United States and other countries \u2013 including President Cabrera \u2013 and I\u2019m so delighted that the Fulbright program can take responsibility and credit for you being here, not to mention your marriage.\u00a0 Programs like our sustained efforts to promote the human rights of women and girls and LGBTQI people around the globe.\nIt\u2019s up close, in those last three feet \u2013 that\u2019s where we remember that the true measure of any policy \u2013 or any app, or any start-up, or any organization, anything else that we do \u2013 is the tangible difference it makes in the lives of our fellow human beings.\nThird and finally, always be open to rethinking the things that you thought you knew.\nThat includes the path you\u2019re on.\u00a0 It\u2019s never too late to change course.\nThat\u2019s what happened to me.\u00a0 I went to law school after college and then headed to a big firm. The job checked a lot of boxes.\u00a0 I had brilliant colleagues, intellectually rigorous work.\u00a0 The salary wasn\u2019t bad, either.\u00a0 But my heart just wasn\u2019t in it.\u00a0 So one year, ten months, two weeks, three days, and five hours after I started, I quit.\nSome of my best friends while I was in law school were film students, and a few of them had recently started a production company.\u00a0 So when I left, they asked me if I wanted to join them, and I said yes.\nI loved movies, and the idea of being part of building something from the ground up was incredibly exciting.\nWe produced a handful of films \u2013 including one about a brooding student-turned-vampire \u2013 no, not Twilight \u2013 and we put on a film festival in New York.\u00a0 But most of the creativity was coming from the writers, the directors, the actors \u2013 not me.\u00a0 Collaborating with them made clear they had gifts that I did not.\nAnd as much as I love movies, I was looking out at a world that was changing quickly, and I was feeling the pull to be a part of it.\u00a0 Apartheid was coming to an end in South Africa.\u00a0 The Soviet Union had collapsed.\u00a0 The people of newly independent nations were finding their own way.\u00a0 There were peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, a growing ethnic conflict in the Balkans.\nI wanted to get involved; I just didn\u2019t know how.\nThen I caught a break.\u00a0 Someone that I\u2019d worked for years earlier told me about an opening for an assistant job at the State Department.\u00a0 I applied \u2013 and I got it.\nNow, it was a pretty junior position.\u00a0 My first office \u2013 well, let me put it this way.\u00a0 The previous occupant of my first office was a very large safe, so that gives you some idea about what the office was like \u2013 basically, a windowless closet.\nBut from day one, I was hooked.\u00a0 Diplomacy felt urgent, challenging, directly connected to improving people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 It was a way to serve my country, which I badly wanted to do.\u00a0 I felt grateful every morning walking into work.\u00a0 I still do.\nNow, I\u2019m biased, but I think you might feel the same way.\u00a0 So I hope that some of you will consider putting your skills toward public service \u2013 maybe even toward making our foreign policy better \u2013 for the good of Americans, for the good of people around the world.\u00a0 We need your help.\nIn my case, it took a few tries, but I found my place.\nAnd I learned something important along the way:\u00a0 I had to be open to starting over.\u00a0 When things didn\u2019t turn out the way I hoped, I had to change my experience, not my expectations.\nLong before he was President, Jimmy Carter was a young dad with three small kids and a promising career in the Navy\u2019s nuclear submarine program.\u00a0 One day he got a call that his father, Earl, who was sick with cancer, was dying.\nJimmy drove from his base in New York to Plains, Georgia \u2013 a town of around 600 people where he\u2019d grown up.\nNow, Earl Carter, his dad, cast a big shadow in Plains, and Jimmy had worked hard to get out from under that shadow.\u00a0 But there was something about reflecting on his dad\u2019s life during that visit that planted a question in Jimmy.\u00a0 Not only was the family peanut farm one of the town\u2019s biggest employers, but Earl was a church deacon, a leader in the Elks club.\u00a0 He served on the local school and hospital boards.\u00a0 When kids in Plains couldn\u2019t afford clothes for graduation, the teachers told Earl and he donated them, anonymously.\nIf the family business went under, Jimmy knew the town would go with it.\nSeeing the community that his dad had worked so hard to build made Jimmy wonder whether it made sense and what it would be like if he tried something similar.\nAfter Earl died, Jimmy struggled with whether he should move his family back to Plains.\u00a0 And on paper, it made no sense.\u00a0 The family business was deep in debt, and he knew little about farming or running a business.\u00a0 He had a bright future ahead in the Navy.\u00a0 But he went back anyway.\nHis superiors thought he was crazy.\u00a0 His wife, Rosalynn, was so mad she refused to talk to him except through their kids.\u00a0 The first year, the farm earned $280.\nBut Jimmy found something different in Plains \u2013 something that he\u2019d been missing for years that he hadn\u2019t been able to put his finger on: a sense of community.\u00a0 And as he and Rosalynn turned the business around, he threw himself into local service: getting involved in the Lions Club, the Boy Scouts, the school, hospital, and library boards, in his church.\u00a0 Then he decided to run for a state senate seat, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nClass of 2023, you have a mantra here at Georgia Tech: \u201cWe can do that.\u201d\nAnd it rings true for so many of our shared hopes and ambitions \u2013 far beyond this campus.\nBut I would humbly suggest, as Zaria also suggested, that the most important in \u201cWe can do that\u201d is not \u201cdo\u201d but \u201cwe.\u201d\nWe can do that \u2014 whether that \u201cwe\u201d is a family, a campus, a city, a country, or the world.\nThat\u2019s certainly true today.\u00a0 Think about your experience.\u00a0 Look around.\u00a0 No one gets out by doing it alone.\u00a0 You got out because you did it together.\nAnd I\u2019m confident that as you reflect back on how you made it to this day, behind everything you\u2019ve done and everything you\u2019re proud of, there is a \u201cwe.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the one constant in navigating all the uncertainty that you\u2019ll face \u2013 whether that\u2019s getting through the times when you don\u2019t have the answers, or figuring out the principles that will anchor you in life, or keeping yourself open to rethinking the things that you thought you knew\u00a0\u2013 you must always, always be guided by people you love and trust.\nAnd so, esteemed graduates, don\u2019t forget:\u00a0 The key to navigating all uncertainty is never trying to do it alone.\nFind your \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 and there\u2019s absolutely nothing you cannot do.\nThank you, and congratulations!\n(Applause.)\n[i] 1895\n\n[ii]\u00a028\n\n\n",

I want to start by thanking our colleagues, both foreign ministers, their delegations for traveling here and for spending the time here in \u2013 at the Foreign Service Institute, and especially for their commitment to dialogue, and I think a recognition on the part of both Armenia and Azerbaijan that the only path to a lasting, durable peace is through dialogue.\u00a0 The United States is very happy to continue to offer its support, its engagement, its good offices to host this discussion and any future ones toward an enduring peace.\u00a0 That is the objective.\nThe two sides have discussed some very tough issues over the last few days and they\u2019ve made tangible progress on a durable peace agreement.\u00a0 I hope that they see \u2013 and I believe that they do, as I do \u2013 that there is an agreement within sight, within reach.\u00a0 And achieving that agreement would be, I think, not only historic, but would be profoundly in the interests of the people of Azerbaijan and Armenia, and would have very positive effects even beyond their two countries.\nI think the pace of the negotiations and the foundation that our colleagues have built shows that we really are within reach of an agreement.\u00a0 The last mile of any marathon is always the hardest; we know that.\u00a0 But the United States is here to continue to help both of our friends cross the finish line.\u00a0 And as I say, I think we\u2019re very much within reach of that.\nI have to say, finally, that the leadership that we\u2019re seeing from both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and from my friends the foreign ministers, is inspiring.\u00a0 None of this is easy, but the commitment, the determination to move forward, to deal with the remaining challenging issues is real.\u00a0 And we feel, coming out of these few days, that, as I said, we\u2019ve made very tangible progress.\u00a0 A final agreement is within reach, and we\u2019re determined to continue to help our friends achieve it.\nSo with thanks to both of you, to both of your delegations, as well as to Prime Minister Pashinyan and President Aliyev for sending you here.\u00a0 I thank everyone, and we look forward to continuing.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Good morning, everyone, and it is wonderful to see all of you here, so many of you here.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite an extraordinary turnout.\u00a0 And Don, thank you very much for that introduction and also \u2013 and more important \u2013 my thanks to you and to my good friend, Secretary Gina Raimondo, and the entire team at the Commerce Department for the work that you\u2019re doing every single day to drive economic opportunity for the American people and for our partners.\nSo it really is a pleasure for me to be here at the United States\u2019 biggest investment summit with business leaders from every part of the world, including thousands of foreign investors and representatives from the American private sector.\nA very warm welcome as well to the hundreds of city and state leaders here with us today.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the critical role that you\u2019re playing in attracting and welcoming new businesses into your communities and reminding private and public investors alike why it is always a good bet to invest in America.\nSo throughout this week, this group has heard from leaders across the U.S. Government on why the United States is the best place in the world to invest: our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, driving new products and solutions at scale; a world-class system of universities and colleges, fueling ideas and fostering talent; our rule of law, protecting intellectual property, worker rights, fostering growth.\nToday, what I thought I\u2019d do is just briefly lay out how we\u2019re building on these advantages to try to make the United States an even stronger and more attractive place to invest, to do business.\u00a0 And the short answer really is this: first and foremost, by investing in ourselves.\nWe\u2019ve made, as you know, historic investments in our competitiveness with legislation like the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \u2013 transformative laws that make America an even better place to do business, with more resilient supply chains, a stronger and more inclusive workforce, more regional innovation and technology hubs, improved infrastructure, including new roads, rail transit, waterways, airports, as well as expanded fast and free broadband across our entire country.\nBut investment in ourselves is not a zero-sum proposition.\u00a0 Our approach is predicated on building a strong, resilient, and advanced industrial base with our partners around the world.\u00a0 We can\u2019t build everything domestically, nor would we want to, because it\u2019s to our collective benefit to have diversified supply chains across all of our partners.\nWe\u2019re also trying to modernize our economic partnerships to better position us to address the challenges and opportunities of this moment that we share: from combating the climate crisis, to tackling corruption, to driving sustainable economic growth.\u00a0 New initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity will both protect our national and economic security, and that of our partners \u2013 creating closer connections between our countries, more opportunities for our businesses to invest and to thrive.\nAnd we\u2019re using existing bodies to produce results for our people, like the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, through which we\u2019re coordinating our industrial strategies to be complementary to one another.\nThis approach is delivering results.\nSince 2021, the private sector has invested more than $435 billion in businesses across the United States.\u00a0 A third of the investments announced since August have involved a foreign investor.\u00a0 There\u2019s also record demand for our international business leaders to come to the United States, and that\u2019s something that my department is working to facilitate.\nSo far this fiscal year, we have already issued nearly double the number of business visas that we did at this point last year, and we\u2019ve also surpassed the number of business visas that were issued before the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 so that entrepreneurs and investors can attend professional conferences, negotiate contracts, work with their associates, do the countless things that they do to run successful businesses.\nAs has been very evident this week, there is tremendous pent-up demand for more business travel, so we\u2019re devoting more resources and streamlining our processes to help you secure business and work visas for yourself and for your employees.\nOur Bureau of Consular Affairs stands ready to help.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made it easier to apply for these visas, including by launching the Business Visa Center.\u00a0 That\u2019s a one-stop-shop to help international investors access visas for business travel.\u00a0 Later this year, we\u2019ll be piloting a program to make it easier to renew some of our temporary work visas from within the United States instead of having to traveling abroad.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to save time and it\u2019s going to reduce uncertainty for employers.\nIf you go back to 2011, since then this conference has helped bring in more than $80 billion in private investment.\u00a0 It\u2019s supported more than 60,000 jobs in the United States while helping thousands of foreign businesses and investors enter the U.S. market, to the benefit of themselves, their economies, their fellow citizens back home.\nThese partnerships have also helped us advance critical foreign policy priorities \u2013 something that needless to say I\u2019m focused on.\nAt last year\u2019s SelectUSA Summit, the CEO of Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer GlobalWafers, Doris Hsu, announced plans for a new state-of-the-art facility in Sherman, Texas.\u00a0 It will be the largest facility of its kind in the United States.\u00a0 GlobalWafers broke ground last December, and once completed, this $5 billion facility will support more than 1,500 jobs in the United States.\u00a0 But it will also fill a critical gap in our advanced semiconductor supply chain \u2013 crucial to preserving our competitiveness on a technology that is foundational to the 21st century economy.\nOr consider the example of Delfast, a Ukrainian e-bike company that helped us confront the climate crisis by creating a zero-carbon transportation option.\u00a0 Thanks to the connections that they made with American partners at the SelectUSA Summit last year, as well as ongoing support from our embassy in Ukraine, Delfast was able to open its first store in the United States in September 2021 in Whittier, California.\u00a0 They are growing very quickly in the United States, with 70 percent of their customer base located in this country.\u00a0 In fact, Delfast has been so successful that they\u2019ve announced plans to invest another $25 million in their U.S. operations over the next year, next several years.\u00a0 That will create another 200 jobs in Whittier.\u00a0 And we\u2019re joined by representatives from dozens of Ukrainian startups similarly taking advantage of SelectUSA to thrive.\nNow, I know Delfast just won the premier award that we issue from this gathering.\u00a0 My only disappointment was that in the long journey from my car through the back stage all the way to the stage, I didn\u2019t get a chance to use one of their e-bikes, but maybe on the way out.\nGlobalWafers, Delfast, hundreds of other companies have used this summit to gain the connections and the know-how to enter the United States market.\u00a0 The State Department stands ready to help your company do the same thing.\nWe have 200 Economics and Business Affairs officers in Washington, D.C., and 1,500 economic officers in our embassies and consulates around the world, across more than 150 countries. \u00a0All have the responsibility to help foreign businesses find the strongest investment opportunities here in the United States.\u00a0 They, along with our colleagues in the Department of Commerce\u2019s Foreign Commercial Service, will be able to help you navigate legal frameworks in the United States, connect you with potential partners, and answer any questions that you\u2019ve got along the way.\nSo to our international visitors here today:\u00a0 The United States is very much open for business, and we hope you choose to invest your time and your talents with us.\nAnd to the U.S. businesses that are here today:\u00a0 We are standing by to continue supporting everything that you\u2019re doing as you grow your businesses both here in the United States and around the world.\nIf the innovation, the dynamism on display here this week is any indication, we have a lot to look forward to, a lot to be optimistic about.\u00a0 So to each and every one of you, thank you for being here.\u00a0 Thank you for taking part.\u00a0 We look forward to doing a lot of good business together in the years ahead.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 It is wonderful to be with all of you here in Denver.\u00a0 And Mike, let me just say to you first off, I can\u2019t thank you enough for your extraordinary leadership in bringing all of this together.\u00a0 The work you did to galvanize the community, to get the support that we needed for this summit, it\u2019s a remarkable contribution not just to this community but to our entire hemisphere.\nAnd I also want to especially thank Governor Polis, Mayor Hancock not just for your hospitality but for your leadership as well in bringing us all together.\u00a0 We picked Denver to host the inaugural Cities Summit of the Americas in large part because of its track record in addressing global challenges at a local level.\u00a0 And that\u2019s really what this summit is all about for us.\nI\u2019m so thrilled to be joined by literally hundreds of mayors and governors, tribal and other indigenous leaders, along with dozens of networks which support them, like ICLEI, U.S. Conference of Mayors, C40 Cities Group.\u00a0 We also want to welcome the many representatives of civil society and the private sector who are here with us today.\nIf you go back to last June, leaders from across our hemisphere came together in Los Angeles for the Ninth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 We agreed to ambitious commitments on issues that actually matter in the lives of all of our citizens: migration, climate change, democratic governance; sustainable, inclusive economic growth.\nEach of you, as city leaders, are on the front lines of tackling these global challenges.\u00a0 You\u2019re welcoming and integrating migrants into your communities.\u00a0 You\u2019re planning for and responding to natural disasters, made more frequent by the climate crisis.\u00a0 You\u2019re addressing the issues that are facing your residents, from law enforcement challenges like ransomware, to public health crises like the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 Your efforts day-in/day-out are helping us make progress on the commitments that we made as countries in Los Angeles.\nCities, when you come down to it, are where democracy is closest to its people.\u00a0 And when cities are responsive to the needs of residents, they demonstrate democracy\u2019s greatest strength: its ability to improve on itself, to empower citizens to hold their leaders accountable, to try out different solutions, and to allow the best ideas to rise to the top.\nWe\u2019re hosting the Cities Summit of the Americas because our collective ability to deliver for our people and to tackle global issues depends on all of you.\u00a0 It\u2019s as simple and as straightforward as that.\u00a0 And we look forward to continuing to elevate your voices in every dimension of our work in the hemisphere, including at the Tenth Summit of the Americas that\u2019ll be hosted by the Dominican Republic.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also why we plan for this to be the first but not the last of many Cities Summits to come.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, what we know is this and what I\u2019ve learned over 30 or so years of doing this going around the world is this:\u00a0 Somewhere, in some part of the world, someone has figured out the solution to a problem that many people are trying to solve; but if we don\u2019t share that information, if we don\u2019t share that knowledge, then everyone else just has to keep reinventing the wheel.\nSo our success in addressing the many issues that we\u2019re trying to tackle right now depends on the best ideas being shared among all of you.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why I hope that the connections \u2013 and that\u2019s the word that Mike used \u2013 is the word indeed that comes back again and again.\u00a0 Connections, interconnectivity.\u00a0 I hope the connections you\u2019ve made here in Denver will last a long time and that you use them to continue to engage with each other, to share ideas, to share solutions.\nAnd as I said, our success depends on these ideas being shared among you.\u00a0 It also depends on national governments learning from you, incorporating the ideas and perspectives of our cities and communities into the policies that we\u2019re making at a national level.\nSo what I thought I\u2019d do today as we\u2019re closing out this summit is to share just three areas where cities are leading the way, and where deeper connections between cities and national governments can make a profound difference in the lives and livelihoods of our people, starting with the first issue I\u2019ll talk about: migration.\nNow, if you step back for a minute and think about the moment we\u2019re in globally, there are more people displaced from their homes around the world than at any time in recorded history: more than 100 million.\u00a0 In our own hemisphere, more than 20 million people are on the move.\nBack at the Summit of the Americas, we came together to try to address what is an unprecedented migration challenge across our hemisphere through something we called the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which reflected the first truly regional approach to the issue.\u00a0 Twenty-one countries agreed that we have a shared responsibility to tackle the migration challenge together, and they agreed on a shared set of principles and priorities, among them expanding protections for migrants who are at risk.\nSo under the leadership of Mayor Claudia L\u00f3pez, someone I\u2019ve had the great pleasure of working with on many occasions \u2013 she\u2019s here with us today, Bogot\u00e1 has been putting this principle into practice since last year.\nI had a chance to visit last time I was in Colombia one of the city\u2019s pioneering migration integration facilities, which offers basically a one-stop-shop where people get a Temporary Protected Status card, they get connected to jobs, they get connected to schools, they get to sign up for essential services like health care.\nBecause of these efforts, Bogot\u00e1 has welcomed more refugees in recent years than any other city in the Americas \u2013 or, as Mayor L\u00f3pez likes to call them, \u201cNew Bogot\u00e1nos.\u201d\u00a0 Colombia as a whole has given refuge to more than 2.5 million Venezuelans who were displaced by their country\u2019s crisis.\nAnd because the protected status that Colombia gives them allows Venezuelans to work, they are also contributing to Colombia\u2019s economy, filling jobs, providing services, starting new businesses.\u00a0 These efforts are driving growth.\u00a0 They\u2019re creating opportunities for Colombians as well as Venezuelans.\u00a0 And they\u2019re showing that we can actually manage migration safely, humanely, and use it as an opportunity to strengthen our communities.\nCity leaders are also stepping up to tackle the second issue I want to talk about, and that\u2019s the climate crisis.\nBack in 2019, the Mississippi River Basin \u2013 and that\u2019s an area that stretches across 31 of our states in the United States \u2013 that basin experienced historic floods, causing more than $6 billion in damages.\u00a0 In the aftermath, mayors from more than a hundred cities and towns \u2013 led by Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons, who\u2019s here with us today \u2013 have been helping prepare their communities for future floods to get ahead of the next problem, the next crisis.\nWorking hand-in-hand with local and global environmental organizations, the mayors and their partners are restoring 66,000 acres of wetlands, of forests, of marshes, and adapting the land to regulate stormwater flow, with a focus on building resilience for communities that have historically been overlooked.\nOnce completed, these restored lands will capture more than 165,000 tons of carbon from the air.\u00a0 Now, that\u2019s the equivalent of taking about 36,000 cars off the road every year.\u00a0 And their efforts are making cities and towns more resilient against floods.\u00a0 When the area around St. Louis \u2013 which is in the basin \u2013 was hit with a \u201conce in a thousand-years rainfall\u201d in 2022, the wetlands there soaked up enough stormwater to fill 750 Olympic-size swimming pools, and that saved millions of dollars in potential damages.\nNow, often innovations at the city level start from the dedicated work of civil society leaders, and that\u2019s the case for the third and final area I want to talk about today, and that\u2019s transparency in our governance.\nIn Chihuahua, Mexico, members of a local anti-corruption nonprofit, Karaywah, came together to tackle lack of transparency in their municipal government.\u00a0 In 2019, when this initiative started, only about 60 percent of municipal contracts were being publicly bid.\u00a0 That meant that many companies were left out of the bidding process \u2013 reducing competition, driving up costs for taxpayers.\nKaraywah teamed up with other Mexican NGOs, with the United Nations Development Programme, and with the U.S. Agency for International Development to put together a digital platform that tracks and publishes open municipal contracts, that follows the bidding process, that allows constituents to monitor where their tax dollars are being spent.\nNow, 100 percent of municipal contracts in Chihuahua City are published online.\u00a0 The tool has been so successful that it\u2019s now being rolled out, free of cost, to 15 other city and state governments across Mexico \u2013 decreasing the potential for corruption, increasing people\u2019s\u00a0 participation and trust in government, something that is especially critical in the times that we\u2019re living.\nOn issue after issue, in city after city, local leaders are pointing the way to effective solutions.\u00a0 This week\u2019s summit shows many more promising opportunities to deliver for our people, including one starting right here in Denver.\nThe City of Denver and the State Department signed an agreement to partner on building early detection systems to track the evolution of new synthetic drugs, like fentanyl, so that we can develop lifesaving interventions early on.\u00a0 We\u2019ll share our findings with partners across the hemisphere, so that we can inform locally-led efforts to counter this public health and security threat.\nNow, this is a powerful illustration of how solutions that we\u2019re finding and answers that we\u2019re finding at the local level can have a powerful impact on the most pressing, most urgent national problems and international problems we face.\u00a0 Fentanyl in the United States is responsible for more deaths among Americans aged 18 to 49 than anything else.\u00a0 Think about that for a second.\u00a0 The leading cause of death in our country for Americans aged 18 to 49 is synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\nLast year, we seized enough fentanyl to kill every single American.\u00a0 That\u2019s the scale of the problem.\u00a0 By definition it has to have an international solution, which we\u2019re working on very hard at the State Department under President Biden\u2019s guidance, but also national and local responses.\u00a0 And I had a chance to see some of the incredibly important work that Denver is doing right here, and I\u2019m grateful for the partnership that we have.\nDozens of cities from across the hemisphere also came together to sign the Denver Declaration, which reflects their shared commitment to addressing the challenges facing our cities, including affordable housing, migration, and the climate crisis.\nAnd thanks to the leadership of Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, more than 45 cities also launched the Anti-Racist Cities Network, through which cities will share best practices for promoting equity and inclusion in our societies.\u00a0 Discrimination robs democracies, including ours in the United States, of the strength, the innovation, the creativity of so many of our citizens, which is exactly what we need to more effectively face the challenges of our time.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why efforts like this one are really important in empowering our full populations.\nTo strengthen the partnership between the United States mayors and their counterparts across the world, we at the State Department recently launched a new City and State Diplomacy Office.\u00a0 So again, people might ask, how is it that we have an office at the State Department to engage at the subnational level?\u00a0 Well, this summit here in Denver demonstrates exactly why it was important for us to do that.\nSince October, Ambassador Nina Hachigian and her team have been working at building the ties that we\u2019re seeing come to full fruition here in Denver.\u00a0 Ambassador Hachigian has held senior positions at the White House, the State Department, and the city of Los Angeles, where she was deputy mayor for international affairs. \u00a0Nina and her team are here in Denver; if you haven\u2019t had the chance to connect up with them yet, I hope in the remaining time that you have you\u2019ll take the opportunity to do so.\nThe city and state diplomacy teams work as a key component, but not the only component, of the State Department\u2019s substantive engagement with cities across our hemisphere.\u00a0 Many of you in this audience have worked closely with our embassies in your countries, in your cities, on a wide variety of issues \u2013 connecting your cities\u2019 businesses with the U.S. private sector.\u00a0 Launching partnerships to strengthen our shared energy security.\u00a0 Combating human trafficking.\u00a0 Promoting global health.\u00a0 In so many ways, the connectivity between our department and your cities is helping to produce real results.\nEarlier today I also had a chance \u2013 and I hope, again, some of you, if not all of you, had the opportunity to do this \u2013 I had a chance to visit the Innovation Plaza at the summit, where many of our companies are displaying solutions that they\u2019ve found to the challenges that you\u2019re trying to address, from accessing government services to recycling and sustainability to housing.\u00a0 These connections, too, between cities and the private sector are another very vital part of this gathering.\nNow, to build on all of this work, we\u2019re devoting additional resources to our engagement with cities.\u00a0 Yesterday we launched something called Cities Forward, an initiative to help cities build a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future.\u00a0 Through this program, which we\u2019re running with our implementing partners ICLEI, Resilient Cities Catalyst, and the Institute of the Americas, we\u2019ll start by connecting 12 American cities here in the United States with 12 Latin American and Caribbean cities so that they can share directly experiences and lessons on everything from how they\u2019re finding new ways to reduce air and water pollution to designing their infrastructure to better withstand more intense and frequent natural disasters.\nWe\u2019ll also support participating cities with funding, technical assistance to develop and implement sustainability action plans that benefit all of their constituents, including those from underserved communities.\u00a0 And while we\u2019re starting with 24 cities, we plan to share our findings with cities throughout our entire hemisphere so that what we learn from this initiative, we can take that and we can scale it.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing a little advertising \u2013 the application for Cities Forward is now live.\u00a0 Consider applying.\nAs you all know well, there is tremendous collaboration already happening in communities across our hemisphere.\u00a0 To cite just one example, look at the work being done here in Denver by community leaders Kristin Lacy and Vivi Lemus, who are also here with us today.\nWhen they first met, Kristin and Vivi realized how much that they had in common.\u00a0 Vivi was born in Guatemala; Kristin had spent years working there.\u00a0 They loved two things: coffee and cooking.\u00a0 They shared a dream of creating a space to build community between Spanish and English speakers.\u00a0 So they started putting away their savings.\u00a0 They got financing from local lenders.\u00a0 A fellow entrepreneur tipped them off to an open space, and city leaders stepped in to help them secure it.\nLast year, Kristin and Vivi opened Convivio Caf\u00e9, Denver\u2019s first women and immigrant-owned, bilingual coffee shop.\u00a0 They source their coffee directly from Guatemalan growers.\u00a0 That allows farmers to earn up to four times the profit they otherwise would, and they use the walls of their cafe as a space to display art that exposes customers to Guatemalan culture.\nConnections like these are leading to tangible benefits for people across our countries \u2013 through greater exports and good-paying jobs that respect labor rights, that give workers a fair shot at getting ahead, providing for their families and their communities.\u00a0 These partnerships are already being built \u2013 not only between our people and businesses, but also city and national governments, labor unions, civil society, multilateral organizations.\nWe\u2019re increasingly bound together through these connections, and what\u2019s so important is that we\u2019re putting them to work, putting them to work to meet the challenges of our time, the challenges we have to face if we\u2019re going to make a meaningful difference in the lives and livelihoods of our fellow citizens.\nPresident Biden has said on more than one occasion that we have everything we need to deliver for our people right here in our own hemisphere \u2013 and work being led by cities across the region, which you\u2019ve shared throughout this summit, shows exactly how we\u2019re doing that.\nSo to each and every one of you who\u2019s participated this week, and to each and every one of you who\u2019s not only participating this week but engaging every single day in these efforts, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your leadership, thank you for your partnership, thank you for the work that we\u2019re doing together as we build toward a more secure, a more prosperous shared future in the Americas.\u00a0 I, for one, am greatly looking forward to seeing all that we can accomplish for our people, and for our hemisphere, in the months and years ahead, following up on everything that\u2019s happened this week here in Denver.\u00a0 Thank you all so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Hey folks, I hope you got a chance to look around a little bit yourselves.\nSo one of the main purposes that we have bringing all of our cities together in the hemisphere is to get an opportunity for them to be talking to each other, connecting with each other, and sharing best practices. \u00a0The most powerful thing is that so many things that we\u2019re working on at a national or even international level are actually being addressed day-in/day-out at a local level by cities and by municipalities.\nBut the connection is not just between cities.\u00a0 It\u2019s between cities, the government, and the private sector, because most of the solutions to challenges that we\u2019re facing are usually going to be a combination of something the government\u2019s doing and something that the private sector is doing, especially when it comes to innovating and actually making things and providing services that are responsive to these problems.\nWhat I just saw here just in about half an hour, you can see the power of connecting the private sector, connecting our government, in actually solving problems.\u00a0 Having much easier connectivity for people who are trying to access government services, we saw that.\u00a0 Actually taking a huge challenge in recycling, in this case rubber tires, and turning it into a useful product in a way that deals with the environmental impact, otherwise having all of these tires piling up in our cities.\u00a0 And of course dealing with housing challenges, something that I just saw here.\nThese are all challenges that cities are facing, we\u2019re facing on a national level, and we\u2019re finding solutions driven by innovation driven by the private sector.\u00a0 So being able to bring everyone together in one place here in Denver at this summit, that\u2019s a way we actually make progress.\u00a0 That\u2019s a way we actually zero in on the solutions and have an opportunity to connect people to advance them.\nSo to me, coming and seeing this is always \u2013 is incredibly inspiring because we\u2019re in a growth industry for challenges right now, but when you actually see that there are solutions at hand out of innovation, out of human ingenuity, out of people wanting to try to make their communities and their societies a little bit better, it gives you a lot of hope and a lot of inspiration for the future.\nThanks.\n\n",

That speaks volumes at a time when we need those resources.\nAnyway, I was anxious to get a chance to share some of your experiences, and finally I\u2019ll say this:\u00a0 I\u2019m hoping very much that the work that\u2019s being done here and the connections that are being made across our hemisphere continue well beyond the days in Denver.\u00a0 I\u2019m really grateful to Nina Hachigian, who\u2019s leading our efforts in the State Department in what we call sub-national diplomacy, which is an increasingly critical part of what we\u2019re doing, and no one is actually better prepared to do that, having served at the highest levels of our national government but also as deputy mayor of Los Angeles, so not bad.\nIn any event, thank you all for taking some time.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nMAYOR HANCOCK:\u00a0\u00a0We are so honored to first host our Secretary of State, Secretary Blinken, to Denver and of course, the 250 mayors from around the Western Hemisphere and over 3,000 other leaders from around the hemisphere who have come to Denver to be a part of the Cities Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 What a tremendous honor it is for Denver to host it.\nOne might ask why the Secretary of State would be interested in the issue of fentanyl.\u00a0 And he\u2019ll share with you we just had a phenomenal conversation with mayors from Ecuador, Canada, and a couple of us from here in the U.S. about the scourge of fentanyl in our communities.\u00a0 Here in Denver, we have seen, as we have tested fentanyl or drugs that have come in, a 4,500 percent increase of the presence of fentanyl and these drugs over the last \u2013 since 2019?\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0\u00a0I think 2018.\nMAYOR HANCOCK:\u00a0\u00a02018.\u00a0 And today we are talking about over 400 overdoses in Denver occurred last year.\u00a0 More than 50 percent them had fentanyl as part of the drug that took the lives of people in our city.\u00a0 So this is a major, major issue not only in Denver.\u00a0 But as the Secretary will talk about, this is an international problem and one in which it\u2019s going to \u2013 Denver can\u2019t do it by itself.\u00a0 The city from Canada couldn\u2019t do it by itself or Ecuador.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to take an international effort to make it happen.\nSo we\u2019ve had a wonderful conversation with the Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m excited that he is putting the full weight of the Department of State \u2013 State Department, excuse me, behind this issue as we combat it.\nAnd I\u2019ll just finish with this, Mr. Secretary, we talked briefly about many mayors in Colorado had come together to really try to convince our state legislature last year to felonize four grams of \u2013 less than four grams of fentanyl.\u00a0 And it was a battle, but the numbers that you talked about that in 2022 the U.S. seized more \u2013 enough fentanyl to kill every American in the United States.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s right.\nMAYOR HANCOCK:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s a scary proposition.\u00a0 And the one word that was used by just about every mayor upstairs, this is a scary situation.\u00a0 And so I am grateful that you have put the full weight of the State Department behind this issue.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\nMAYOR HANCOCK:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for choosing Denver and for being here.\u00a0 I\u2019ll turn it over to our Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, Mr. Mayor, thank you so much.\u00a0 And first of all, we\u2019re so grateful to be here in Denver for this Cities Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 We\u2019re connecting cities across our hemisphere, and it\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing because what we\u2019re finding \u2013 and Denver is a great example of this \u2013 so many of the problems that different communities are trying to solve are shared problems, common problems.\u00a0 And to the extent we can find best practices and see what\u2019s working in one place and share that in another, we\u2019re going to be able to get ahead of the game on challenges that are actually even global in nature, not simply local, but they start and are addressed at the local level.\nWhat we\u2019re talking about here today is unfortunately one of the most powerful examples of that.\u00a0 As the mayor said, last year in the United States, we seized enough fentanyl to kill every single American.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the fentanyl we seized; the sea is much larger.\u00a0 The number one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49 is synthetic opioids, notably fentanyl.\u00a0 And by its very nature, this is a problem that requires us to work at a local level, at a national level, and at an international level.\nAs the mayor said, you might ask why someone in my job focusing in on this here in Denver, and it\u2019s precisely because of that.\u00a0 Just to give you a couple of quick examples, what Denver is doing so remarkably well both on dealing with prevention, with treatment, with recovery, with detection, with law enforcement, all of that is a powerful example for other communities that may be affected down the road if they\u2019re not already affected by synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\nAnd what we\u2019ve seen here is the United States has been something of the canary in the coal mine.\u00a0 It hit us here before it\u2019s hit many other places, but now we see it picking up in Mexico, in Canada.\u00a0 We heard from our colleague from Vancouver the numbers in Canada are dramatic, and we know it\u2019s going to spread to other places in the world.\u00a0 Our market is increasingly saturated.\u00a0 The criminal enterprises that are engaged in producing and distributing synthetic opioids like fentanyl are trying to make markets elsewhere.\nSo the more we can learn about how a city like Denver is being affected in dealing with the problems at a local level, the better we\u2019ll be able to share that with countries around the world.\u00a0 But we also need their help.\u00a0 Much of the fentanyl that\u2019s coming into the United States starts halfway around the world with perfectly legal chemicals that may be produced in one country then sent somewhere else, including to Mexico, and diverted into illegal use and used to manufacture fentanyl.\nSo having the cooperation and collaboration of countries around the world to prevent that diversion is critical.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got to get countries involved, we have to get the private sector involved because these chemicals are made, manufactured, and shipped.\u00a0 And all of us together can do a much better job in making sure that these chemicals are not diverted into illegal use and fabrication of fentanyl.\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons why President Biden is building an international coalition of concerned countries to work together to get ahead of this around the world.\u00a0 But at the same time, when I\u2019m going around the world and people are asking, well okay, what is the United States doing about this at home, I\u2019m able to point to a city like Denver that\u2019s leading on this effort in trying to reduce demand, in dealing with prevention, in dealing with treatment, in dealing effectively with law enforcement.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly powerful example that I can share.\nAnd then finally, there\u2019s a big law enforcement component to this at a local level but also at an international level.\u00a0 Much of this is driven by large transnational criminal enterprises that we\u2019re working every single day to break up, to break down, to break down the financing, the production, the distribution.\u00a0 But if we\u2019re not working at every single one of these levels \u2013 at the local level, at the national level, the international level \u2013 we\u2019re not going to solve the problem.\nSo being here, having so many of our colleagues from around the hemisphere here in Denver, to see what you\u2019re doing and how you\u2019re doing it, and then being able to share their own experiences and for us to be able to then build partnerships, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re ultimately going to get ahead of this problem.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really grateful \u2014 Mr. Mayor, to you; Mr. Director to you \u2013 for sharing everything that you\u2019re doing here in Denver, and we\u2019re determined together to get ahead of it.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n",

President Yoon, Mrs. Kim, it is a great pleasure to have you here with us today.\nNow, some of you may have heard this and actually seen it, but last night President Yoon \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 brought down the house at the state dinner \u2013 (applause) \u2013 singing \u201cAmerican Pie.\u201d\u00a0 So, Mr. President, I want you to know we have two great American musical giants with us here today, Herbie Hancock and Diane Reeves.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So if you feel moved to deliver another performance \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 don\u2019t let the music die, Mr. President.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nEvan and I are delighted to join Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, in welcoming all of you here today.\u00a0 And I know we\u2019re joined by an incredible group of friends, colleagues.\u00a0 Particularly I want to salute the members of Congress who are here.\u00a0 President Yoon just came from delivering an extraordinary speech to a joint session.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt has been 70 years since the United States and the Republic of Korea formed our alliance, making official a bond that was forged by Korean and American soldiers in the crucible of war.\u00a0\u00a0Katchi kapshida\u00a0\u2013 we go together \u2013 that was their motto.\u00a0 And indeed, they lived and fought and died shoulder to shoulder.\nFrom the beginning, American and Korean leaders understood that our alliance was about more than our two nations.\u00a0 President Eisenhower, speaking to Congress, said that it was an affirmation of our belief that the security of an individual nation in the free world depends on the security of its partners and constitutes another link in the collective security of free nations.\nIt was also a way to create space \u2013 space for Korean and American entrepreneurs and innovators, scientists and artists, governments and citizens \u2013 to use that security and their freedom to improve our societies in real ways.\u00a0 And who, looking at how far we\u2019ve come since that time, would question whether our partnership has lived up to its promise?\u00a0 We see the extraordinary emergence of Korea in virtually every domain around the world, not just as the strongest of security partners for the United States, but in science, technology, the arts, culture.\u00a0 We have never wavered in our commitment to our mutual defense.\u00a0 We\u2019ve invested in our shared prosperity and competitiveness.\u00a0 And we have decades of mutual growth to show for it, including in the industries and technologies that are shaping the future \u2013 from quantum computing to renewable energy to biotech.\nWe\u2019ve invested in the foundation of our strength, our democracies, while also deepening ties to our partners who share our commitment to freedom, to equal opportunity, to human rights, to the rule of law.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden convened the first two Summits for Democracy, the second of which was co-hosted by President Yoon.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why Seoul will take up the mantle now in leading the third Summit for Democracy next year.\nAs we think about all the ways that our countries go together, it\u2019s easy to take for granted our closeness, to see as somehow inevitable the parallel arcs that U.S. and Korea have traced over time.\u00a0 But the reality is this: the friendship between nations, like all friendships, ultimately comes down to the actions of individuals.\nAnd it\u2019s here that I\u2019d like to express our enormous gratitude to President Yoon.\u00a0 At a time of tremendous challenge to the international rule of law and the United Nations Charter, to our democracies, indeed to our planet, Mr. President, your principled leadership has helped bring us even closer together and has made Korea a global pivotal state.\u00a0 And that\u2019s to the benefit of Koreans, Americans, and indeed to people around the world.\nNow, it\u2019s not just our leaders who are committed to deepening our friendship, but our people, starting with Korean Americans.\u00a0 This year also marks the 120th anniversary of the arrival of the first Korean immigrants to America, a hundred or so men, women, and children who arrived on Honolulu\u2019s shores.\u00a0 Today, the extraordinary contributions of generations of Korean Americans are woven into the fabric of American society, from the sweeping histories of Min Jin Lee\u2019s novels to the explosive flavors of David Chang\u2019s dishes to the exceptional service of diplomats right here at the State Department, like one I\u2019d like to mention today: Julie Chung.\nJulie was just five years old when, in 1977, her family moved from Seoul to California.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t speak a word of English.\u00a0 Her dad got a job on the drafting floor of an engineering company.\u00a0 Her mom worked nights washing dishes in a restaurant.\u00a0 Julie\u2019s mom went on to become a librarian and a church deacon.\u00a0 Her dad later designed a heating system to prevent O-rings from freezing on space shuttles \u2013 that\u2019s what had caused the Challenger explosion \u2013 allowing NASA to restart the space missions.\u00a0 And Julie joined the first cohort of Pickering fellows at the State Department, which encourages the service of historically underrepresented minorities.\nToday, Julie\u2019s dad\u2019s engineering company is working on technology that will help the United States, Korea, and other partners who are joined in the Artemis Accord return astronauts to the Moon, including the first woman and first person of color.\u00a0 And Julie is the United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka.\nIf these are the threads that are connecting the United States and Korea through a single family, just think how rich, how deep the ties are that are binding our nations together.\nSo, President Yoon, Mrs. Kim, all of our distinguished guests, I ask you to raise a glass with me \u2013 and we\u2019ll even find a glass to raise.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 To all the ties that make our nations go together, and to all the places that they\u2019ll take us.\u00a0 Mr. President, cheers.\n(A toast was offered.)\nAnd now it\u2019s my great pleasure to turn it over to the Vice President of the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The Vice President delivered remarks.)\n(A toast was offered.)\nPRESIDENT YOON:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Emhoff, Secretary Blinken, White House Cabinet Secretary Ryan, and distinguished guests:\u00a0 I extend the gratitude to you for inviting me to the heart of global diplomacy, the Department of State.\u00a0 With Vice President Harris, a fearless fighter, and with strong supporters of the ROK-U.S. alliance, it feels as though there is no obstacle that we cannot overcome.\u00a0 It is truly reassuring.\nI heard that the name of this building is the Harry S Truman Building.\u00a0 President Biden gifted me a plaque with President Truman\u2019s words that I keep on my office desk.\u00a0 He granted me this plaque last year in Korea, and the plaque reads, \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d\u00a0 This place reminds me of the devotion and responsibility for freedom and democracy.\u00a0 And as you are well aware, President Truman in 1953, when communism attacked Korea, he dispatched U.S. forces and also put together the UN Security Council and came to our rescue.\u00a0 For the past 70 years, the ROK-U.S. alliance has developed into the most successful alliance in history on the soil that was fortified by the sacrifice of Korean War veterans.\u00a0 The Republic of Korea was able to rise from the ashes of war to become a country with global stature thanks to the power of the ROK-U.S. alliance.\nYesterday, President Biden and myself had an invaluable discussion on where the ROK-U.S. alliance should head towards.\u00a0 And based on our discussion, I plan to develop our alliance in a way that expands practical benefits for the peoples of both our countries.\u00a0 Our future will be brighter than the past.\u00a0 Our two countries will build peace through strength and lead the solidarity of freedom to promote peace in East Asia and the rest of the world.\u00a0 We will further strengthen our solidarity on cooperation in cutting-edge future technologies, including semiconductors, quantum, artificial intelligence, space, and cyber.\u00a0 And the young talents of our two countries will learn from one another and build a free, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 We will also work very closely together in response to pending global issues.\nVice President Harris, Secretary Blinken, and all distinguished participants gathered here today are the mainstays of the global comprehensive strategic alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States.\u00a0 We look forward to your continued support as the ROK-U.S. alliance marches forward.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State",
		"audience": "Press Briefing Room",
		"location": "Washington, DC",
		"date": "April 27, 2023",
		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Let me just say at the top that besides being delighted to be joined by Secretary Mayorkas, I also want to take this opportunity to say how thrilled I am that we have Matt Miller joining us as our new spokesperson.\u00a0 Probably have more to say on that in the days to come.\u00a0 But I couldn\u2019t be more pleased, not just for me but for the department and, indeed, for our country.\u00a0 An extraordinary professional I\u2019ve had the benefit of working with over many years.\u00a0 And I\u2019m equally grateful to Vedant Patel, who\u2019s done an extraordinary job as our spokesperson these past weeks.\nIn two weeks\u2019 time, the CDC\u2019s temporary Title 42 public health order will expire, as required by court order.\u00a0 President Biden and agencies across our government have been taking robust steps to prepare for the effect this will likely have on our immigration system, our partners in the region, and the movement of people across our hemisphere.\nSecretary Mayorkas will speak about the immediate impact of Title 42\u2019s expiration and our stepped-up enforcement efforts.\u00a0 But first, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to put this in the context of our broader approach to migration in the region, which we\u2019ll continue to build on in the coming weeks.\u00a0 It\u2019s an approach focused on making migration more safe, orderly, and humane, and on advancing the interests of the American people.\nIf you step back \u2013 and it\u2019s really important to do that \u2013 globally there are more than 100 million people on the move today, compelled to leave their homes in search of security and better lives.\u00a0 That is more people than at any time in recorded history.\u00a0 And in our own hemisphere, we are facing an unprecedented migration challenge.\u00a0 Long-term drivers like violence, corruption, lack of economic opportunity, continue to push people from their homes \u2013 problems that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, crises of governance, extreme weather events caused by the changing climate.\u00a0 Twenty million people are displaced across this hemisphere, and the strain on transit and host countries is high.\nMigration is the definition of a challenge that no country can solve alone.\u00a0 The magnitude, the range of drivers, the push and pull factors \u2013 all demand that we work together.\u00a0 That\u2019s why last summer President Biden brought together leaders from nations across the Western Hemisphere to agree to the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection; 21 countries have joined that declaration.\u00a0 The LA Declaration is an acknowledgment of our shared responsibility on migration, and our shared commitment to work together and leverage the strengths of partners across government, civil society, the private sector, humanitarian organizations, multilateral organizations, all coming together to address this challenge.\nSo let me highlight some of the ways the United States is working with our partners in the region on migration so as to take, among other things, pressure off our borders by giving people alternatives to making a hazardous journey to seek asylum in the United States.\nOf course, fundamentally we\u2019re working to tackle the root causes of migration so that people don\u2019t have to leave their homes in the first place.\u00a0 That includes investing and redirecting and mobilizing resources toward greater economic opportunities, as we\u2019ve done through the more than $4.2 billion in private sector commitments that Vice President Harris has helped to secure for northern Central America.\u00a0 These investments by businesses and social enterprises will sustain and create jobs, connect people to the digital economy, expand access to financing, provide training and education for young people and workers, and improve economic livelihoods across the region.\nWe\u2019re also investing in economic opportunity through the nearly $1.2 billion that we provided in humanitarian assistance across the region last year, and through initiatives like our commitment to work with our partners to train and equip 500,000 local healthcare workers across the hemisphere over the next five years so that more people can get quality care in their own communities.\u00a0 All of these investments will help people feel that they have a future in their own communities.\nNow, of course many of these investments can take time to bear fruit.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working in parallel on critical collaborations and initiatives with partners in the hemisphere to have a more near-term impact.\u00a0 First, we\u2019re supporting host countries as they provide legal protections and assistance to refugees and migrants so that they can thrive in their new communities.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that by delivering funding to schools, health facilities, and other providers of support to migrants, funding the staffing and capacity-building of local asylum centers and systems, and supporting registration and documentation efforts so that individuals can gain and demonstrate legal status, which is critical for access to work, to schools, to social services.\nOur partners in turn are doing extraordinary work in this area.\u00a0 Colombia, for example, has given 10-year temporary protected status to approximately 2.5 million Venezuelans, allowing them to work, to study, to access public services.\u00a0 Ecuador, Costa Rica, Belize are also undertaking similar efforts to regularize migrants from Venezuela and Nicaragua, as well as Peru.\u00a0 We see efforts as well to forgive existing migrant overstay fines, effectively removing one of the largest barriers to regularization.\u00a0 Brazil\u2019s \u201cOperation Welcome\u201d helped over 100,000 Venezuelans voluntarily resettle in places where they have greater economic opportunity.\u00a0 Mexico and Canada are increasing the number of people that they welcome on a humanitarian basis.\nWe\u2019re also working with partners in the hemisphere to accept repatriation flights, increase security forces along migration routes, provide more assistance to migrants and refugees.\u00a0 We continue to surge assistance to host countries throughout the hemisphere to help integrate refugees and migrants, and increase humanitarian aid and protection for vulnerable populations.\nSecond, we\u2019re announcing a 60-day surge of urgent assistance to regional partners to enhance security, to counter smuggling \u2013 an effort that Ali will share more about in a few moments.\u00a0 We\u2019re also working to counter disinformation being spread by traffickers and other bad actors, including by expanding our paid and earned media outreach to high out-migration communities and migrant routes through channels potentially reaching upward of 85 million people \u2013 so that people who want to migrate have accurate information about how to do so legally and safely, and know the dangers of putting themselves in the hands of traffickers.\nThird, we\u2019re significantly expanding access to lawful pathways for migration for those in need, including the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.\u00a0 For too many people in too many places, these pathways feel far from reach.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working to create more opportunities, and to make them more accessible.\u00a0 The United States welcomed six times as many refugees from Latin America and the Caribbean in 2022 than during the previous year.\u00a0 We\u2019re on track to more than double those arrivals in 2023.\nAnd in January, President Biden committed to welcoming 30,000 individuals every month from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, and Nicaragua through a parole program.\u00a0 Irregular migration from those four countries fell by more than 97 percent within the first month \u2013 because people now have a legal and safe pathway.\u00a0 That means tens of thousands of people are no longer making the perilous overland journey to our border, or putting themselves at the mercy of abusive smugglers.\nWe\u2019re partnering with both national and international NGOs to connect the most vulnerable populations \u2013 including religious minorities, political dissidents, LGBTQI+ persons, and survivors of gender-based violence \u2013 to expedited resettlement processes.\nWe\u2019re developing new ways to increase the scope and effectiveness of our migration system, like Welcome Corps, which \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 allows American individuals to sponsor refugees.\nAnd soon we will stand up Regional Processing Centers in select locations in the region.\u00a0 I want to thank Colombia and Guatemala specifically for their role as excellent partners of the United States in these efforts.\u00a0 These centers will be operated by international organization partners and improve qualified individuals\u2019 access to accelerated refugee resettlement processing, family reunification, and labor pathways in the United States.\u00a0 They will also be a referral point for lawful pathways as well, as well as humanitarian and refugee protections in other countries, like Canada and Spain.\nThese centers will take a hugely important step to prevent people from making the dangerous journey to the border by providing a much safer legal option to migrate that they can pursue in and from their own countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new and innovative approach that does right by people who want to migrate, and that enhances security and stability in the region.\nLater today, I\u2019ll have a chance to travel to Denver for the Cities Summit of the Americas, where we\u2019ve convened leaders to talk about how governments can better deliver for their people.\u00a0 And that mission is at the heart of the migration challenge:\u00a0 How can we all work together, as we are, to provide the foundation for better, more secure, and more hopeful futures for all our citizens?\nWith that, let me turn it over to Secretary Mayorkas.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 As the Secretary described, this is a hemispheric challenge that demands hemispheric solutions.\u00a0\u00a0 Working with our neighbors in the region, we can and will reduce the number of migrants who reach our southern border.\u00a0 The Regional Processing Centers announced today will be a critical addition to the programs and processes DHS has in place for qualifying individuals to obtain authorization to enter the United States before arriving at our borders.\nThis is particularly important because we have a humanitarian obligation to cut the smugglers out.\u00a0 We have seen a dramatic rise in the reach, sophistication, and cruelty of the smuggling organizations over the past ten years and the challenges that presents.\nThe comprehensive plan we have developed and are executing takes this reality into account.\u00a0 We are building lawful pathways for people to come to the United States without resorting to the smugglers.\u00a0 At the same time, we are imposing consequences on those who do not use those pathways and instead irregularly migrate to our southern border.\nThis plan has proven effective.\u00a0 Building on the success of Uniting for Ukraine, we created parole processes for qualifying Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, and we expelled individuals from these countries who sought to enter at our southern border.\u00a0 We have seen a high degree of interest in these parole processes and a dramatic drop in encounters from these nationalities.\u00a0 Overall, the number of Border Patrol encounters in March 2023 was down 23\u00a0percent compared to March of last year.\u00a0 When people have safe and orderly pathways to come to the United States and face consequences for failing to do so, they use those pathways.\nAfter May 11th, our court-compelled use of Title 42 will end and we will once again process all migrants under Title 8 of the United States code.\u00a0 This is a longstanding immigration enforcement authority that multiple administrations \u2013 Republican and Democratic alike \u2013 have used to process individuals.\u00a0 It carries stiff consequences for irregular migration, including at least a five-year ban on reentry and potential criminal prosecution for repeated attempts to cross unlawfully.\u00a0 The return to processing migrants under Title 8 authorities will be swift and immediate.\nWe have been preparing for this transition for more than a year and a half.\u00a0 Notwithstanding those preparations, we do expect that encounters at our southern border will increasing, as smugglers are seeking to take advantage of this change and already are hard at work spreading disinformation that the border will be open after that.\u00a0 High encounters will place a strain on our entire system, including our dedicated and heroic workforce and our communities.\nThe smuggler\u2019s propaganda is false.\u00a0 Let me be clear:\u00a0 Our border is not open and will not be open after May 11th.\nToday, we are announcing the expansion of our plan to build lawful pathways and to impose consequences for failure to use those pathways.\nFirst, the Department of Homeland Security is proud to work with the State Department in establishing the Regional Processing Centers that Secretary Blinken described.\u00a0 We are dedicating specially trained refugee officers to the centers.\u00a0 They will interview applicants for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and provide for the swift processing of a greater number of individuals.\u00a0 In addition to refugee processing, migrants may be screened at these centers and referred to pursue additional pathways to the United States or to other countries for which they may be eligible.\nSecond, we are streamlining the long-established family reunification parole processes for Cubans and Haitians so that individuals from these countries with approved family-based petitions can more quickly reunite with their families here in the United States.\nThird, I have directed my team to develop family reunification processes that will extend this well-recognized model to certain individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Colombia.\u00a0 More information about these processes will be available by May 11th.\nFourth, we will continue the successful processes we announced in January.\u00a0 Through our CPB One mobile app, we will enable individuals to schedule more appointments at ports of entry, consistent with Title 8 processing.\u00a0 The Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela parole processes, as well as the corresponding returns to Mexico for those without a legal basis to remain will continue.\nAt the same time, we are imposing consequences for individuals who do not use our lawful pathways.\nBeginning on May 12th, we will be \u2013 we will place eligible individuals who arrive at our southern border in expedited removal proceedings.\u00a0 Those who arrive at our border and do not have a legal basis to stay will have made the journey, often having suffered horrific trauma and having paid their life savings to the smugglers, only to be quickly removed.\u00a0 They will be removed most often in a matter of days in just a few weeks.\nUnlike the Title 42 public health authority, the penalty for being removed from the United States under Title 8 through expedited removal and other immigration laws we will be enforcing is not just removal.\u00a0 An individual who is removed is subject to at least a five-year ban on admission to the United States and can face criminal prosecution for any subsequent attempt to cross the border illegally.\nWe will process eligible single adults for expedited removal while they are in our Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\u00a0 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will be conducting any credible fear interviews.\u00a0 We have expanded our holding capacity and set up equipment and procedures so that individuals have the ability to access counsel.\u00a0 We have digitized processes, surged personnel, and with the cooperation of partner governments increased return flights.\u00a0 We are ensuring that removals are accomplished fairly, efficiently, and quickly.\nFamilies have always presented unique challenges within our immigration system, particularly for an administration like ours that priorities family unity and opposes family separation.\u00a0 Like single adults, families will be placed in removal proceedings, including expedited removal.\u00a0 We are currently focused on utilizing the full spectrum of our Alternatives to Detention Programs, including GPS monitoring and enhanced supervision, such as curfews and expanding case management services.\u00a0 This will be coupled with more stringent measures for those who do not comply.\nThe same principle will apply to single adults and families.\u00a0 They will have an opportunity to seek protection or other relief from removal.\u00a0 If they receive a final order of removal, we will enforce the law, and they will be removed.\nIn addition to our land border, we will continue to confront the challenge of migration on our seas.\nSince we announced our parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, we have made it clear that those who arrive at our southern border are not eligible for the parole processes.\u00a0 We are announcing today that that ineligibility will now extend to individuals who take to the seas and are interdicted trying to arrive at our maritime borders.\u00a0 We have seen too many people \u2013 families, women, children \u2013 perish in the rough seas.\nWe have increased the presence of our United States Coast Guard to interdict migrants trying to reach the United States by sea.\u00a0 We have saved countless lives, and we have returned the migrants to their home countries.\u00a0 That will continue.\nIn addition, we are finalizing the regulation that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security jointly proposed earlier this year.\u00a0 That proposed regulation will incentivize individuals to avail themselves of lawful, safe, and orderly pathways, and disincentivize dangerous border crossings by placing a new condition on asylum eligibility for those who fail to use those pathways.\u00a0 The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security aim to have the rule finalized by May 11 and will swiftly implement it.\nThe work we have been performing to prepare for post Title 42 continues, as I have previously outlined in our six-pillar plan.\u00a0 We are surging resources to our border, modernizing processes, attacking the smuggling organizations with unprecedented law enforcement focus, strengthening our immigration enforcement tool of expedited removal, working to increase information sharing and resources \u2013 having distributed over $130 million this fiscal year with 290 more to be awarded in the coming weeks \u2013 for local communities and their non-profit organizations.\u00a0 We are partnering with nations in the region to address the challenges of unprecedented migration throughout the hemisphere.\nFor example, two weeks ago we reached a trilateral agreement with Colombia and Panama to attack the smugglers who falsely coax people into the treacherous terrain of the Darien.\u00a0 We initiated a 60-day coordinated campaign with Panama and Colombia to prevent the incredibly dangerous humanitarian situation of migrants traversing the Darien jungle.\u00a0 We have made more than 10,000 smuggling arrests since April of last year and seized more than $47 million in smugglers\u2019 illegal property and finances.\u00a0 The Canadian commitment to accept an additional 15,000 migrants was part of a complementary effort to create lawful pathways.\nEveryone agrees \u2013 everyone agrees \u2013 our immigration system is outdated and badly broken.\u00a0 We must tackle the challenges before us together.\u00a0 This includes the potential for increases in migration after May 11 and the strain it will place on our communities, our workforce, and our system.\nThat\u2019s why today we notified Congress of our intent to reprogram funds within our budget to support other emerging requirements across DHS.\u00a0 This reprograming of existing funds will not meet our longer term needs for securing our border and enforcing our laws.\u00a0 The administration requested $4.9 billion for these requirements but received only $2.7 billion in the funding bill passed this December.\u00a0 While the department is prudently utilizing the limited funding Congress has provided to prepare for the post-Title 42 environment, this notification of repurposing existing funds is only a fraction of what we will ultimately need.\nWe know smugglers will seek to take advantage of the end of Title 42 and that the first few weeks will be challenging, but I have full confidence in the dedicated men and women of DHS.\u00a0 We will do all we can to manage our border and increased encounters in a safe, orderly, and humane way.\u00a0 We are working with our regional partners.\u00a0 We are going after the smugglers.\u00a0 We are surging resources to the border.\u00a0 But we cannot do everything that we need to do until Congress provides the needed resources and reforms.\u00a0 We call on Congress to provide the resources we need to continue our work.\u00a0 We stand ready to work with Congress to pass desperately needed reform to our immigration and asylum system.\u00a0 In the meantime, we will continue to do our part, implementing the approach we have described here today.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We will take a couple questions.\u00a0 I see we have a special guest today.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you want to ask the secretaries first.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 It\u2019s Take Your Children to Work Day, and we\u2019d happy \u2013 happy to take a question from you, if you have one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Or you can whisper to Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Well, I think she wanted to ask about the geopolitical and strategic implications of the U.S.-China-Russia rivalry, but that\u2019s a little bit off topic.\u00a0 Instead, she had a joke she wanted to tell, but I don\u2019t \u2013 not sure if she\u2019s got a little bit of stage fright.\u00a0 So let me go ahead and start.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Go ahead, Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 One, for either of you, on the Regional Processing Centers, do you have a target, an estimate, of how many people will be able to \u2013 the capacity for these, like per week or per month?\u00a0 And whether you do or not, if you think that they will be so successful and are truly new and innovative, why hasn\u2019t this been done before?\nAnd then secondly, for Secretary Blinken, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any updates on the Sudan evacuation or non-evacuation situation in terms of the State Department.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Do you want to start, Ali?\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 Happy to.\u00a0 So this is a process that will scale up over time.\u00a0 We are going to begin in collaboration, of course, with the State Department and our partner countries to begin several thousand each month, 5-6,000 plus each month individuals processed, a material impact on the decision-making of people who are seeking relief in a country.\u00a0 The whole model is to reach the people where they are, to cut the smugglers out, and to have them avoid the perilous journey that too many do not make.\u00a0 But we are beginning in Guatemala and Colombia.\u00a0 We are beginning at the level that I described and we will scale up.\u00a0 We are incredibly proud of the fact that we negotiated this agreement with those foreign countries and we hope to expand beyond there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Ali.\u00a0 And Matt, just to add one point on that, I think as this effort moves forward and we establish it, my expectation would be that even beyond the numbers of people who might be processed in a given month, other people, having \u2013 seeing that this is now a way to access legal pathways to the United States that doesn\u2019t require them to, again, take the hazardous journey to our border and to put themselves in the hands of smugglers, and then to come only to be turned away in any event, my expectation would be that many other people beyond those who are actually being processed in a given month will stay put and wait to avail themselves of this additional way of accessing legal pathways.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We have to build it out and we\u2019re very actively working on doing that.\nAs to why this hasn\u2019t been done before, well, I mean, it\u2019s like any good idea.\u00a0 You can say, \u201cGee, why didn\u2019t we think of this before?\u201d\u00a0 But the fact is we\u2019re working on it now, and we\u2019re working to make it real and effective.\nOn Sudan, just a few things.\u00a0 First, we are very actively working to extend the ceasefire.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a 72-hour ceasefire, which like most ceasefires is imperfect but nonetheless has reduced violence.\u00a0 And that\u2019s obviously created somewhat better conditions for people in Sudan.\u00a0 It\u2019s also enabled some humanitarian assistance to continue to move around.\nBut we want to make sure that, if possible, this is extended.\u00a0 We\u2019re very actively engaged on that.\u00a0 I hope and expect to have more information on that in the coming hours.\u00a0 And the focus, again, is on extending the ceasefire and making sure there is humanitarian access.\nWith regard to American citizens in Sudan, a few things to be said about that.\u00a0 We are providing the best possible advice that we can to anyone asking for our assistance about conditions, about safety, about security, so that they can make decisions with the most information possible about what they want to do, whether they want to stay, whether they want to try to go.\nAs you know, the vast majority of American citizens who are in Sudan are dual nationals, most of whom have made their lives and livelihoods in Sudan for years, decades.\u00a0 So these are very challenging decisions for people to make.\u00a0 But we\u2019re in contact with Americans who have registered with us in one way or another, and very active contact.\nWhat\u2019s happened over the last 72 or so hours is that the reduction in violence that we were able to achieve through the ceasefires that we helped produce has allowed partners and allies, in coordination with us, to conduct some aerial evacuations.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing important logistical support to these efforts.\u00a0 This is a collaborative process and we have managed to direct many Americans who have \u2013 were seeking to leave to that evacuation process so that they could, along with other nationals, take advantage of it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s ongoing.\nAt the same time, what happens in these situations is you have people who are not all at once\u00a0\u2013 everyone making a decision in a given moment, at a given time, about what they\u2019re going to do or not do.\u00a0 This changes over time.\u00a0 So people who today think that they\u2019re going to stay put may decide next week, next month, that they want to leave.\nWhat we need to do and what we\u2019re working to establish is a sustained process for enabling people to leave, assuming that the conditions that we see now are maintained, by which I mean on the one hand, yes, a ceasefire, however imperfect, but also ongoing violence, confrontation between the two rival military groups, et cetera.\nAs we\u2019ve looked at this, we believe that the best way to have an enduring capability to help people leave Sudan, if that\u2019s what they so choose, is overland.\u00a0 And we are working to establish a process that would enable people to move overland to a place where they can more easily exit the country \u2013 in all likelihood, Port Sudan.\u00a0 So that\u2019s under very active development, and again, that will be the most effective way to have a sustained process, a sustained mechanism, an enduring capability to enable people to leave if that\u2019s the choice they make.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Tracy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A couple of technical questions and then something broader for either of you.\u00a0 Following up on the regional centers, how many more countries are you negotiating with to set up centers to add them down the line?\u00a0 You have set a goal, I think you said, of doubling the number of refugees to be admitted.\u00a0 Is that realistic given the huge backlog, the enormous demand, and how long it does take to scale up to the 6,000 a month or whatever it is?\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering how many more people will really be helped in these new measures.\nSecretary Mayorkas, you said something I didn\u2019t quite get about family detention.\u00a0 Will entire families now be detained?\u00a0 Is that the idea?\nAnd finally, for Secretary Blinken, you mentioned the global aspect of immigration, and so I wanted to ask about Russians who\u2019ve been coming to the United States seeking asylum, saying they\u2019re fleeing conscription.\u00a0 Many of them are minorities, and it seems like their cases are being turned down.\u00a0 Many have been detained by ICE and a few that we know of have been deported back to Russia.\u00a0 So why is that not a \u2013 why do they not have a credible fear case?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 So let me \u2013 I can take the questions, if I may.\u00a0 So the issue of credible fear, the determination of credible fear is a very case-specific, individualized determination.\u00a0 Our very experienced asylum officers make those determinations based on the facts presented to them as well as their background information with respect to the country conditions.\u00a0 And so they evaluate the claims based on the people before them and the case that those individuals present.\nWe are indeed in discussions with other countries to expand the Regional Processing Centers, and they will have a significant impact on the migratory decisions of individuals in the region, and our parole processes really communicate that fact quite powerfully.\u00a0 People don\u2019t want to place their lives and their life savings in the hands of ruthless smugglers.\u00a0 If they have a lawful, safe, and orderly pathway to come to the United States or another destination country \u2013 like Canada or Spain, as Secretary Blinken mentioned \u2013 they will avail themselves of those lawful pathways.\u00a0 That has proven true through our parole processes and other lawful pathways that we have implemented to date.\nThat is especially true when, if they do take that perilous journey and happen to survive, because all too many do not, they will find that the border is not open and they are subject to removal.\u00a0 And removal will occur in the expedited removal context swiftly, in a matter of days or just a few weeks.\nThe Regional Processing Centers will indeed make a big difference because we are surging asylum officers to work with the international organizations \u2013 the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration \u2013 to screen people very quickly.\u00a0 We are going to be delivering efficiencies in the refugee screening process to move that process more rapidly than before.\u00a0 This is going to have a material impact in a number of ways.\u00a0 One, we will provide relief for a greater number of people; and two, an even greater number of people will wait to avail themselves of this pathway because of its magnitude and the consequence of not doing so.\nWe have no plan to detain families.\u00a0 As I mentioned, we will be employing alternatives to detention, including some innovations in that regard, and we will on a case-by-case basis use enhanced alternatives to detention as warranted.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Camilla.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 The \u2013 my understanding is that the U.S. intends to continue deporting Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans to Mexico if they crossed the southern border unlawfully.\u00a0 So do you know how many migrants or deportees Mexico has agreed to accept, if any?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think Mexico has spoken about it publicly.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 To date \u2013 to date, Mexico has agreed to accept up to 30,000 expulsions under Title 42 per month.\u00a0 That is a decision that they have made.\u00a0 We intend in a post-Title 42 environment, when we are using expedited removal \u2013 our Title 8 of the United States Code authorities \u2013 we intend to return individuals to Mexico from those nationalities.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Leon.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Just a technical question on these regional centers, if I may.\u00a0 If I understood you correctly, you said they were being \u2013 they would be operated by international partners.\u00a0 Are you outsourcing the immigration process?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start with that.\u00a0 No, the point here is to do the following:\u00a0 It\u2019s to take advantage of the fact that international partners have physical locations in a number of countries where they are doing very, very important work, and to be able to bring some of our own officers and experts into these centers so that people can come to them and explore whether they are eligible for one of the various legal pathways to come to this country, whether it\u2019s as a refugee, whether it\u2019s for family reunification, whether it\u2019s for a labor pathway.\u00a0 And that means that it\u2019s a lot easier for people who are contemplating coming to determine from their own countries whether they have a legal pathway to do that, so it\u2019s making legal pathways much more accessible.\nAnd as Secretary Mayorkas was saying, as this gets up and running and as people see that there is now a more accessible way to determine whether they are eligible to come to the United States through a variety of pathways, we believe that that will take significant incentive away for people to instead make this incredibly hazardous journey to the United States, put themselves in the hands of smugglers, encounter all the terrible dangers that we know they encounter along the way in an effort to pursue asylum, and in any event not get in.\nSo that\u2019s the idea.\u00a0 But no, it is reliant on our own people to share the information and to do some prescreening of individuals who come to these centers.\nAnything you want to \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Have you discussed with Colombia about returning migrants?\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\n\n",

I really appreciate the good, productive conversation that we had a short while ago.\nHowever, before I turn to that and to the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Dialogue, which is underway today, let me just share a brief update on Sudan.\nOn Saturday, I directed the temporary suspension of operations at Embassy Khartoum, and we conducted a successful operation to safely evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel and their dependents.\nI want to reiterate my appreciation for the leadership of Ambassador John Godfrey and the entire embassy team who managed the consolidation of our people and the necessary preparations for the evacuation under a very fluid security situation, even as they were tirelessly working to broker an Eid ceasefire.\u00a0 I could not be prouder of our team, most of whom are now en route back to the United States.\nI especially want to express my gratitude to Secretary of Defense Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Milley, and the men and women of the U.S. military who executed the evacuation operation with their usual extraordinary precision and skill.\u00a0 They once again demonstrated that they are the finest in the world.\nA decision to suspend operations at the embassy, remove our personnel from their assigned post, is among the most difficult that any Secretary has to make.\u00a0 But my first priority is the safety of our people, and I determined that the deteriorating security conditions in Khartoum posed an unacceptable risk to keeping our team there at this time.\nI want to be clear that even as we have temporarily suspended operations on the ground in Khartoum, our diplomatic and consular work in Sudan continues.\u00a0 Indeed, in just the last 36 hours since the embassy evacuation operation was completed, we\u2019ve continued to be in close communication with U.S. citizens and individuals affiliated with the U.S. Government to provide assistance and facilitate available departure routes for those seeking to move to safety via land, air, and sea.\nThis includes Americans who are traveling overland in the UN convoy from Khartoum to Port Sudan.\u00a0 We also continue to coordinate with allies and partners who are conducting their own operations, and to leverage those efforts to include Americans.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking further steps to support Americans and are exploring options to return the diplomatic and consular presence to Sudan as soon as possible.\nWe also continue to engage directly with General Burhan and General Hemedti to press them to extend and expand the Eid ceasefire to a sustainable cessation of hostilities that prevents further violence and upholds humanitarian obligations.\u00a0 The Sudanese people are not giving up on their aspirations for a secure, free, and democratic future; neither will we.\nThe United States will work with all parties, in coordination with regional and international partners, to bring an end to the fighting and a return to the transition to a civilian government.\nKenya, under President Ruto, has been a strong partner in this effort.\u00a0 And indeed, Kenya is a security leader throughout the region.\u00a0 That\u2019s evident not only in its commitment to resolving the current crisis in Sudan, but also in its support for United Nations and African Union peacekeeping efforts and the counterterrorism mission in Somalia, in its partnership to reach the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Ethiopia, and in its stewardship of the Nairobi process to advance peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAnd over the last two years, its tenure on the UN Security Council, Kenya has consistently stood up for the UN Charter and focused members on addressing the humanitarian and human rights crises across the continent and beyond.\nBeyond peace and security, Kenya and the United States are partnering on a wide range of issues.\u00a0 And that\u2019s reflected in the breadth of topics that we\u2019re tackling in the Strategic Dialogue.\u00a0 One of the major focuses we had today is public health, an area in which Kenya is demonstrating its potential to be a regional and indeed a global leader.\u00a0 The United States is supporting Kenyan-led vaccine production, including through Moderna\u2019s $500 million investment in a new manufacturing facility near Nairobi, which will produce mRNA vaccines to tackle viruses from COVID-19 to Ebola, from RSV to HIV.\nKenya remains at the forefront of the global HIV response.\u00a0 Today that\u2019s nearly reached \u2013 and has nearly reached \u2013 excuse me \u2013 its 95-95-95 targets: diagnose 95 percent of all HIV\u2011positive individuals, provide anti-retroviral therapy for 95 percent of those diagnosed, and achieve viral suppression for 95 percent of those treated.\u00a0 That is a tremendous milestone that is saving countless lives, and we\u2019re proud to have supported this effort over two decades with PEPFAR as it\u2019s been operating in Kenya.\u00a0 Now, we\u2019re building on that success by moving to a Kenya-owned, Kenya-driven, and Kenya-funded framework that will position the country to achieve sustained HIV epidemic control by 2025.\nHealth security and food security are closely intertwined.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard loudly and clearly from African leaders that emergency aid cannot be the only solution.\u00a0 So we\u2019re investing in sustainable, long-term African food production.\u00a0 That includes our work, with the AU and the UN, to invest in nutritious, climate-resilient crops and develop climate-smart agriculture.\u00a0 And it includes mobilizing the private sector in that effort.\nPresident Ruto recently announced 14 investments valued at over $150 million by private firms in Kenya\u2019s agro-industrial productivity.\u00a0 In total, these new partnerships will create over 20,000 Kenyan jobs, boost incomes by \u2013 for more than 1 million smallholder farmers, and increase sales and exports by over $130 million \u2013 while, of course, dramatically increasing local crop production and reducing malnutrition.\nU.S. companies are eager to invest in Kenya\u2019s success.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to supporting U.S. investment in Kenya \u2013 particularly in key sectors like information and communications technologies, agriculture, renewable energy \u2013 which will help Kenya achieve its goal of reaching upper-middle income status by 2030, while creating jobs and opportunity for people in both our countries.\nFinally, we\u2019re discussing through the Strategic Dialogue how the United States can continue to support Kenya\u2019s democratic progress.\u00a0 Its recent and fair elections and orderly and peaceful transition of power are a model for the region \u2013 demonstrating the commitment of its people, civil society, and leaders to transparent governance that is accountable to its citizens.\nSo we have made a lot of progress, and we\u2019re proud of it, and we have a lot on the agenda today.\u00a0 And as with all of our Strategic Dialogues, particularly with Kenya, the work of today is also the work of the 364 days that follow.\u00a0 This is an effort that takes place day-in, day-out between our governments, between our officials, between our experts, but also between our private sectors, our civil societies, our citizens, building, strengthening a partnership between our countries.\nI want to thank the cabinet secretary for his commitment to advancing this agenda, and Alfred, the floor is yours.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I\u2019m very happy to be here with my team.\u00a0 And I want to thank you for the warm welcome that you have given to us and the hospitality, and this Strategic Dialogue that is very important for both our countries, and not just both our countries, but also the African continent.\nLet me start the way you finished, and that is the issue of democracy.\u00a0 Kenya prides itself to be a democratic country that believes in the rights of the people to be able to go to the ballot box and choose their leaders and to live in a stable country where there\u2019s economic growth.\u00a0 And we want to thank the United States for the support you\u2019ve given us over the years in ensuring that we have a democratic country.\u00a0 And we will continue expounding the views and the principles and philosophies of true democracy as it is and stability in the region.\nKenya is open for business, as we usually say.\u00a0 We are moving into an era where we are saying we want more trade, not aid.\u00a0 Kenya is well placed in the African continent to be a hub for American investors.\u00a0 In the African continent, we now have the African Continental Free Trade Area, with a population of 1.3 billion people.\u00a0 When you come and invest in Kenya, it means you\u2019re investing in the continent of Africa.\u00a0 You\u2019re able to supply your goods, you\u2019re coming from a hub that can able to help you.\u00a0 We have worked very closely with American companies, and we had a very good Chamber of Commerce meeting in Nairobi, where a raft of new initiatives were announced to enable people to be able to \u2013 American farms to be able to come and invest in Kenya.\u00a0 So welcome, Americans, to come and invest in Kenya as you continue.\nIn the area of our cooperation and Strategic Dialogue, you mentioned Moderna as a company that is about to break ground in Kenya.\u00a0 We welcome more companies to come to Kenya, because we\u2019ve always been very good partners, and we\u2019ll continue working well together.\nIn this Strategic Dialogue, I think we\u2019re also talking about issues of climate change.\u00a0 The reality is that it is not a matter of when but if the world has transitioned from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\u00a0 Kenya, we\u2019re at a good place and only 2 percent of our energy is renewable energy, using hydro, geothermal, solar, and wind.\u00a0 And we want to grow that to 100 percent by 2030.\u00a0 And we want to work with American farms and American Government towards supporting the production of green hydrogen, which is what the future will need.\nSo we have looked at the past.\u00a0 We have fossil fuels.\u00a0 We\u2019ve decided not to tap into them because the environment is very important.\u00a0 We have to protect now for future, otherwise the world will not be in a very, very good place.\u00a0 So we want to be able to work together in those many ways.\nWe\u2019ll be discussing many issues, ranging from security, peace in the region \u2013 as you know, Kenya has been quite involved in the mediation in Ethiopia, and also looking at what you can do for Democratic Republic of Congo.\u00a0 COVID has taught us that what happens in one part of the world will happen \u2013 will have an influence or an impact on what happens in the rest of the world.\u00a0 So we want to acknowledge the support we have been receiving, and the comradeship between us and the United States in terms of bringing peace to the region.\u00a0 And we are committed to be the peacemakers of the continent of Africa, if not the world, looking at silencing the guns, people sitting down and being able to work together.\nIt is in the same spirit we are talking about the Russia and Ukraine conflict where Kenya recognizes Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders, and we\u2019ve been calling for cessation of hostilities, and the steps that have been taken so far to tell others that you cannot roll back history.\u00a0 We\u2019re at a place we are by now; we have to move forward.\u00a0 You can\u2019t start claiming countries, or claiming countries that are part of you.\u00a0 Nostalgia is not the order of the day now.\u00a0 We need people to be respected, they need peace and security, and we have to have a system where we don\u2019t let things get out of hand.\u00a0 Because today it\u2019s Ukraine; what about tomorrow?\u00a0 What will it be?\nWe also are very happy about many things that are happening.\u00a0 But as they happen also, we are quite sad of what\u2019s happening in the Sudan.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been working closely with the Government of Sudan, trying to get to a place whereby we can have peace and stability.\u00a0 It is quite tragic that we have more bullets coming into Sudan or being used in Sudan than food.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a tragedy, because we see from where we sit a lot of international interference, a lot of other players trying to use Sudan as a playing field for whatever reason, for the gold in Sudan, for territorial strength and control of the region.\nAnd we\u2019re trying to ask \u2013 we are asking external forces to leave Sudan alone.\u00a0 As an African continent and the AU and intergovernmental organization called IGAD, we are trying to find solutions for Sudan.\u00a0 I know you\u2019ve pulled your teams out.\u00a0 Kenya is not pulling its diplomatic offices.\u00a0 We\u2019re not shutting them down because we want to have a presence as we negotiate.\nPresident Ruto is looking forward to going to Sudan as soon as it stabilizes and there is enough security to try and see how we can engage the leaders.\u00a0 We are trying to engage the two warring parties, we\u2019re trying to bring them to the table so that we can have a good end, to a cessation of the violence.\u00a0 And what we want is civilian rule eventually over there.\nPresident Ruto has offered Kenya to mediate the conflict and to restore civility and peace.\u00a0 And we are quite persuaded that a peacefully negotiated solution to the conflict in Sudan is within reach.\u00a0 And as always, we stand ready to make our contribution, and we\u2019ll be playing hand-in-hand with that.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll be able to work together and see what we can do.\nI want to thank you.\u00a0 There are many topics we can talk about.\u00a0 We look forward to welcoming you back to Kenya sometime soon, and we look forward to President Biden also visiting Kenya, and President Ruto coming back, and thus holding these meeting at presidential level as we continue to work.\nWhat I can assure you is that Kenya will remain a good partner, will remain a friend of the United States, and we\u2019ll be able to work in sync as we try to improve the world that we live in.\u00a0\u00a0 When it comes to issues of trade, when it comes to the issue of health, when it comes to the issue of peace and stability, when it comes to issues of humanity, we are all the same people and we want to have a good life while we\u2019re here.\u00a0 And if we can work together as friends, it will be very good.\nAnd at that note, I want to welcome Americans to visit Kenya.\u00a0 We don\u2019t get as many Americans coming to Kenya as they should.\u00a0 I think our elephants and lions are complaining that they don\u2019t see a lot of Americans in our national parks.\u00a0 So Kenya is a safe and happy place, and we welcome Americans to come down for safari where you actually get to interact with the animals as long as they don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t get too close.\u00a0 But they\u2019ll be happy to see you.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take three questions.\u00a0 First, we\u2019ll go to Cindy Spang from Voice of America.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, thank you.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 I have one question for you, Secretary Blinken, and several questions for both of you, please.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, do you have numbers of how many Americans remain in Sudan?\u00a0 And could you share any updates on their safety and well\u2011being?\u00a0 And what options are there for those who want to leave?\nAnd for both of you:\u00a0 Cabinet Secretary Mutua, you mentioned foreign involvement in Sudan.\u00a0 Could you elaborate on that, please?\u00a0 And have either of you seen direct or indirect involvement from Egypt or the United Arab Emirates?\u00a0 And if so, have you spoken to their leaders about that?\u00a0 And have you seen involvement by the Wagner Group, and you are \u2013 how concerned are you that Russia may fan the violence?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 First, in terms of American citizens in Sudan, as you know, in any country around the world, whether it\u2019s Sudan or anywhere else, we never know with any precision how many Americans may be there at any given time because Americans are not required to register with the embassy, with the government, either when they go, when they reside, or when they leave.\u00a0 So we don\u2019t have a good fix on the number of Americans who are there at any given time, including now.\nWe do know, of course, the number of Americans who have registered with us and with whom we\u2019re in very active touch, communication.\u00a0 And of those, I would say some dozens have expressed an interest in leaving, and as I mentioned just a few moments ago, even with the withdrawal of our embassy personnel from Sudan, our efforts to provide services to American citizens who are there \u2013 consular services, other services, advice \u2013 continues, and we\u2019re in regular communication with American citizens.\u00a0 We are looking to see how we can help them ensure their own safety.\u00a0 We have been working with allies and with partners to do as much as we can to enable them to find their way out if that\u2019s what they choose to do.\nNow, keep in mind as well that the overwhelming majority of American citizens in Sudan are dual nationals who have made their lives there, been living there for years, for decades, for generations, and many want to continue to do that.\u00a0 But for those who are seeking to leave, we\u2019ll continue to engage directly with them to see what we can do to help them, and as I said, with allies and partners as well to help facilitate their departure.\u00a0 And this is going to be an ongoing process.\nIn addition, we\u2019re looking at what options we have to perhaps resume a diplomatic presence in Sudan, including in Port Sudan; that\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 But conditions are very challenging and we\u2019re tracking that very carefully.\nJust to pick up on the second part of the question, look, on one level, a whole variety of countries are involved in Sudan, have been engaged there, and engaged in \u2013 to some extent in trying to help Sudan move forward with its transition to a civilian-led government.\u00a0 And we have been in touch repeatedly throughout this crisis with a variety of them.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken directly to counterparts in Saudi Arabia, in the United Arab Emirates; other members of our team have spoken to Egypt and other countries, the United Kingdom \u2013 all to the same end, which is trying to get a ceasefire, trying to get a more sustainable cessation of hostilities, and then trying to get the country back on track to the transition to a civilian-led government that it was on before the violence that erupted derailed that effort.\u00a0 And it remains vitally important that countries use whatever positive influence they have to try to move Sudan in that direction.\nWe do have deep concern about the engagement of the Prigozhin group, the Wagner Group, in Sudan.\u00a0 It\u2019s in so many different countries in Africa \u2013 an element that, when it\u2019s engaged, simply brings more death and destruction with it.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very important that we not see its further engagement in Sudan.\u00a0 And I know a number of countries are very concerned with that prospect.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I agree with you there with the last statement about all these groups coming in and destabilizing.\u00a0 Currently in Sudan, we are trying also to evacuate Kenyans who have been working and living in Sudan.\u00a0 We\u2019ve (inaudible) to a lot of requests by the international organizations, the UN particularly, and other countries to help evacuate some of their people and bring them to Kenya or get them out of Sudan because of current need to accompany, and so we\u2019ll be proceeding.\nBut it would be good if we can find a way of establishing a ceasefire, even for a few hours or even a half a day or a day, to enable people to be able to move, to enable food and supplies to be brought in to the \u2013 especially in the capital, Khartoum, and other places.\nIn terms of involvement and indirect and direct involvement of various groups, we\u2019ve been quite concerned by some of our friends in the Middle East as (inaudible) Russia and others who for a long time have been friendly to either one or the other side.\u00a0 And we are just saying that at this particular time, it is not a time to take sides in a war.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to be able to come together and bring them together because at the end of the day, peace has to prevail.\u00a0 And so it doesn\u2019t matter who you support; at the end of the day, we need to have the people of Sudan have stability.\nSo all these other interests, if they can just keep off and let us bring peace to Sudan, we do believe it is possible.\u00a0 And that is where we are working towards as Kenya, together with our partners.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t want to be talking to people who are being supported and armed more and given strength by outsiders who don\u2019t live in Sudan.\u00a0 We care about Sudan.\u00a0 As part of the African Union, we want to silence the guns in Sudan, want to find an African solution to African problems with the support of our friends.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t effectively do that if we are talking to groups that are being strengthened every day by the parties who believe that all they need to do is to fight to the end.\u00a0 There is no fighting to the end.\u00a0 At the end of the day, it\u2019s the local and the normal people who lose, not just their leaders.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Julian Pecquet from\u00a0The Africa Report.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Julian Pecquet of\u00a0The Africa Report,\u00a0Jeune Afrique.\u00a0 You mentioned, Secretary Mutua, about President Ruto\u2019s involvement with IGAD and the talks with the Sudanese, so I have a few questions.\u00a0 One of them is what are you hearing from the parties to the conflict?\u00a0 What are you telling them?\u00a0 What kind of progress are we seeing, are we making since the past week?\u00a0 Any progress on when the president might host the parties in Nairobi if he can\u2019t go to Sudan because of the security situation?\u00a0 And how are you working with the African Union, which has its own effort going on?\u00a0 Secretary Blinken perhaps can talk to what the U.S. can do to help with the African-led negotiations.\nEastern Congo is another conflict where foreign actors are working at cross-purposes.\u00a0 I wanted to ask if Kenya can be a meaningful force in the DRC.\u00a0 Are you willing to take on the fight to the M23, which is what the Congolese seem to want?\u00a0 And can you tell us what the latest is with negotiations to renew the mandate of the East Africa Community regional force?\u00a0 And here as well, what role can the U.S. play?\nAnd then finally, on trade, perhaps we can talk about agriculture specifically, which is a very big deal to the Kenyans, obviously.\u00a0 What kind of progress are we making in the bilateral talks on agriculture, and particularly U.S. GMO exports to your country?\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 As members of IGAD, we have decided to be at the forefront in finding a solution to all these problems.\u00a0 We do believe that we are at a good place because the two warring leaders are talking to us, so that\u2019s a good sign.\u00a0 They are not \u2013 they \u2013 when you talk \u2013 when they are being talked to, they\u2019re talking back, and we\u2019re able to open the channels of communication.\u00a0 The fighting is still going on in Sudan, but we just feel that at least we have an entryway.\u00a0 They have not locked themselves up and shut their ears to the world.\u00a0 They are listening to the world, and they know the pressure that is being felt around them.\nOur president is ready.\u00a0 We have said that Kenya is ready at any moment\u2019s notice.\u00a0 Even if our president may not be able to go there immediately, we are ready to start discussions, and that\u2019s a message we are communicating to them, is that send us part of your teams.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start talking about what needs to be achieved because there\u2019s a reason they are fighting.\u00a0 They are fighting because they can\u2019t agree about something and we need to be able to sort out what they can\u2019t agree about, find a common, agreeable ground and then be able to move forward.\u00a0 And this is also under the auspices of the African Union.\u00a0 The African Union had a ministerial meeting where they called cessation of fighting, where they called for dialogue, and so this is part of the process.\nWhat we are doing as Kenya is that we are not just going to wait.\u00a0 We are saying \u2013 we\u2019ve put \u2013 stuck our necks out and said, we can provide a solution.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been in this game for some time.\u00a0 We\u2019ve \u2013 kind of have a bit of experience in how these things are done, and we love the people of Sudan so much that we say that we are ready to commit ourselves to hosting a negotiation between the two of you, the two warring groups, and trying to find solution so that the innocent people of Sudan \u2013 great people of Sudan \u2013 who are suffering can have this burden lifted from them.\nIn terms of eastern Congo, yes, our troops are on the ground, and it\u2019s not about us fighting the M23.\u00a0 We are not there to fight M23 or to fight anybody.\u00a0 We are there to provide a corridor that allows the groups that are fighting the Congolese Government and the ones that are being fought by the Congolese Government to have a sense of security through there.\u00a0 That they can start \u2013 we can \u2013 they can start putting down their guns and getting to the table and be able to negotiate.\nIt is important to note that M23 has been in operation for over 30 years.\u00a0 It is not just a simple problem that just started yesterday.\u00a0 So we are working together, and the Nairobi processes are still \u2013 is still going on, process still going on.\u00a0 We have Nairobi 4 coming up, and so we are fully engaged.\u00a0 And they have different meetings being called this coming month to try and sort out the issue.\nIn terms of the regional force and extending, that\u2019s in the process, and we are confident that will be \u2013 Kenya is not planning to withdraw its troops until we find an amicable solution.\u00a0 And we want to thank our partners, the United States and others, for the promised support that we can be able to work together to ensure that that region is stable.\nMaybe you can take agriculture fast, then I can \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Alfred.\u00a0 Let me just add that in terms of our engagement in Sudan, first, we\u2019ve been deeply engaged directly with the parties.\u00a0 I have spoken to Generals Burhan and Hemedti on multiple occasions.\u00a0 We strongly support African-led efforts to help both mediate this crisis, to end the hostilities, and, as I said, get back on the \u2013 on track to transition to a civilian-led government.\u00a0 We participated in, I think, an important meeting by video conference that was convened by the chairperson of the African Union, Mr. Faki, just at the end of last week that included the secretary-general of the United Nations, that included virtually all of the stakeholders in Africa and beyond who have an interest in trying to help Sudan get back on track, and we continue to support those efforts.\nWe all have the same goal.\u00a0 We\u2019re all driving to the same place.\u00a0 That is a ceasefire that\u2019s genuinely durable, that turns into a full cessation of hostilities between the competing forces, and that resumes the very important negotiations that were underway to create a transition to a civilian-led government \u2013 negotiations that had produced very significant progress, including the agreed framework.\u00a0 So that is everyone\u2019s goal, and we\u2019ll use both our direct engagement as helpful and as appropriate, but also strongly in support of AU-led efforts to put this back on track.\nWith regard to the United States and Kenya and trade, I think first it\u2019s worth pointing out that it\u2019s up 20 percent over the last year.\u00a0 That in and of itself speaks volumes.\u00a0 And when it comes to agriculture, that\u2019s exactly one of the things that we focused on today in a variety of ways, and I think that\u2019s going to be also the product of the Strategic Dialogue that we\u2019re having today and that you\u2019ll hear more about when we conclude our conversations.\nOne of the things that we talked about \u2013 and this has been part of an ongoing conversation \u2013 is of course Kenya is on the receiving end of an acute food insecurity challenge, like many other countries in Africa and beyond.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen an almost perfect storm that\u2019s emerged \u2013 the combination of climate change, of COVID, and of conflict, including the Russian aggression against Ukraine \u2013 all of which have contributed dramatically to rising food insecurity in Africa and beyond.\nWe have been deeply and intensely engaged in meeting this challenge.\u00a0 If you go back to February of last year when Russia invaded Ukraine again, we\u2019ve provided since then about $13.5 billion toward building greater food security, including direct assistance to Kenya and to many other countries.\u00a0 The United States has provided about 75 percent of the United Nations appeal for Kenya when it comes to food security.\nBut for all of the efforts that we and other countries are making in partnership with Kenya and other friends to address the immediate crisis, we\u2019re equally focused on helping countries build sustainable, long-term, productive capacity themselves.\u00a0 That is fundamentally the answer to the challenge.\u00a0 And I think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity there, including in the work that we\u2019re doing with Kenya.\nOne aspect of that is making sure that, using remarkable technology that we\u2019ve developed over recent years, that two things are addressed: the health and strength of soil, and the resilience of seeds.\u00a0 We have the capacity to basically map soil anywhere to determine whether it\u2019s strong or not and needs help.\u00a0 We also have remarkable technology when it comes to seeds to make sure that they are much more resilient to climate change, to droughts, to extreme conditions.\u00a0 And this is one of the things that we\u2019re working on with Kenya, as well as building out the entire production infrastructure that\u2019s also vital to making sure that there\u2019s genuine food security.\nSo this is very much part of our dialogue.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of our ongoing conversation.\u00a0 And I expect you\u2019ll see more on that in \u2013 both today and in the months to come.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\u00a0 Just to add on to issues of agriculture, and this is where with the impact of climate change I think it\u2019s a lesson to all of us that we can\u2019t keep on relying on rainfed agriculture.\u00a0 So we have a massive program in Kenya of building dams so that we can be able to conduct irrigation \u2013 hold irrigation programs so that now when it rains \u2013 it doesn\u2019t rain at least over there, but we still have to combat climate change.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we are planting 15 billion trees over the next few years to try and roll back what is happening.\nAgriculture in our region will only thrive if our farmers feel that they need to use it for economic reasons.\u00a0 Agriculture is not only for food, because when a farmer grows crops, that farmer uses \u2013 sells those crops, eats some and sells the crops and gets money for school fees, for building, for their car, et cetera, et cetera.\u00a0 So to us when it came to agriculture is also an economic issue, and that\u2019s why we are talking about value addition in the conversation we\u2019re talking about, getting our products here.\nI can say with no fear of contradiction that Kenya has the best tea and coffee in the world, and so we would like to be able to get more of that in the United States.\u00a0 And even our products \u2013 as we add value to our products, which means that with opening up of the markets means that our farmers get more money in their pocket as a motivation, they engage more into growing crops, and then it becomes a cycle that is able to continue.\u00a0 So it\u2019s about sustainability.\nMR. PATEL:\u00a0Final question. Kylie Atwood, CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thanks, you guys.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to start with Secretary Mutua, please.\u00a0 I just wonder if you could be a little bit more explicit for us in terms of how exactly Kenya has seen the Wagner Group\u2019s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Sudan.\u00a0 And you said that you believe that a peaceful resolution is in reach in Sudan.\u00a0 Why exactly do you feel that that is in reach?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, just questions on Sudan and then also on Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 First, on Sudan, have the convoys that have attempted to leave Sudan, that have American citizens who have joined them, run into any problems, any violence along the routes on the way out, as far as the U.S. knows at this point?\u00a0 And you mentioned potentially resuming a U.S. diplomatic presence at Port Sudan.\u00a0 Could that happen as soon as this week?\nAnd then just one question about a report this morning in\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0on the \u2013 on Ukrainians planning to attack Moscow earlier this year, on the one-year anniversary of the war.\u00a0 Based on that article, which comes from leaked classified U.S. Intelligence documents, it says that the country\u2019s military intelligence directorate agreed to postpone the strikes at Washington\u2019s request.\u00a0 Have Ukrainian officials ever discussed with you such potential plans for an attack on Moscow?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your message to any Ukrainian Government officials who may be privately advocating for such an approach?\u00a0 Thank you.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I think the position that Kenya holds is that we don\u2019t want interference by any group, may be Warner Group or individual countries that may be involved directly or indirectly.\u00a0 At this particular time, we\u2019d just like us to be left with Sudan without foreign and other groups interfering with the peace process.\nWe are quite encouraged about peace being found in Sudan very soon.\u00a0 This is because we\u2019ve had negotiations and mediation and a process in Sudan that has gone on for some time.\u00a0 And a few weeks ago, there was a very successful forum held in Khartoum, where there was an agreement basically in terms of returning the country to civilian rule, in terms of when the next elections will be held, in terms of the balance of how things will run.\u00a0 And it was only one item that there was a bit of disagreement, and it\u2019s not even a major item.\u00a0 It was all about the militia \u2013 the RSF joining the national military and how the timelines and the groups \u2013 which was a very, very small issue, and we are confident that that is an issue that you can tackle.\u00a0 Basically, it\u2019s a 2 percent that remains; 98 percent has already been done and agreed and signed to.\u00a0 That is why we are very confident that, once there\u2019s cessation, and with a bit of mediation, we believe that by the end of this year we\u2019ll be talking a different story about Sudan.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, in terms of the convoys, it\u2019s \u2013 look, it\u2019s a moving picture, and we\u2019ve seen to date different things.\u00a0 Some of the convoys that have tried to move people out, including all the way to Port Sudan but also to places closer into Khartoum, some of them have encountered problems, including robbery, looting, that kind of thing.\u00a0 Others not.\u00a0 But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking very, very carefully.\nTo the extent that we\u2019ve been able to facilitate Americans being folded into some of those convoys, we\u2019ll continue to do that.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also trying to provide the best possible advice we can to anyone asking for our assistance about conditions, about safety, about security, so that they can make their own decisions with the most information possible.\u00a0 But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking as carefully as we can, and of course we\u2019re in very close contact with a number of countries that are engaged in removing their personnel from Sudan to make sure that we know from them what they\u2019re experiencing, what they\u2019re encountering.\u00a0 All of that factors into the advice that we can provide and the decisions that we make.\nWhen it comes to resuming our own diplomatic presence in Sudan, look, that\u2019s going to be entirely dependent on the conditions in Sudan. \u00a0Again, something that we\u2019ll look at day-in/day-out, but I can\u2019t put a timeframe on it at all.\u00a0 It\u2019s really conditions dependent.\nAnd finally, the last part of your question:\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to comment on any purported intelligence documents that are being reported on in the press.\u00a0 Thanks.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 When it comes to what Ukraine does to defend itself against the Russian aggression, these are decisions for the Ukrainians to make.\nThank you.\n",

		"speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State",
		"audience": "The Prince Karuizawa ",
		"location": "Karuizawa, Japan",
		"date": "April 18, 2023",
		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone. \u00a0Let me \u2013 let me start with the situation in Sudan. \u00a0For the past 36 hours, we and our partners have been focused on how to stop the widespread fighting in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. \u00a0Indiscriminate military operations have resulted in significant civilian deaths and injuries, and are recklessly endangering the Sudanese people, diplomats including U.S. personnel, and humanitarian aid workers.\nThis morning, I made calls to Generals Burhan and Hemedti, urging them to agree to a 24-hour ceasefire to allow Sudanese to safely reunite with their families and to obtain desperately needed relief supplies.\nI also underscored in both calls the responsibilities that Sudanese fighting forces bear for ensuring the safety and security of U.S. and other diplomats who are resident in Sudan, as well as for UN staff and other humanitarian partners. \u00a0If implemented successfully, a ceasefire for 24 hours can create a foundation to build upon for a more sustained halt to the fighting and a return to negotiations on a durable end to the hostilities.\nThe people of Sudan have made clear their democratic aspirations. \u00a0After months of talks, they were close to restoring a civilian-led government.\u00a0 We remain committed to helping them achieve that goal. \u00a0At the same time, we will take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of our people.\nNow, we just finished up a marathon couple of days, during which the G7 foreign ministers came together to address some of the most consequential issues confronting our countries and people all over the world.\nI want to thank our Japanese hosts and especially my friend Foreign Minister Hayashi for the warm hospitality and for his leadership.\nTogether, we have strengthened the centrality of the G7 as the steering committee of the world\u2019s advanced industrial democracies, and deepened ties with other countries around the world. \u00a0And together, we emerge from this ministerial more globally engaged than ever.\nA major theme of this G7 was how our nations can leverage our strengths to work with our partners to deliver better futures for people around the world, to focus on the issues of most concern to them in their daily lives. \u00a0And this means combining our political and economic muscle and our development dollars, yen, euros, and pounds to support countries on every continent in meeting their food, energy, climate, infrastructure, and technology challenges.\nIt means shaping a more inclusive international system \u2013 including with UN reform, making the international financial system more responsive to the actual needs of countries, and finding new formats for consultation that welcome more voices. \u00a0It means offering more countries better, more sustainable, and more equitable ways to prosper, while respecting their sovereignty. \u00a0From Central Asia to the Pacific Islands to Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, our goal is to offer leaders and citizens better choices \u2013 free from coercion, unsustainable debt, and malign influence.\nWe also discussed a range of challenges to our shared vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous international system. \u00a0The most immediate challenge, of course, is Russia\u2019s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.\nYesterday, we recommitted to Ukraine: with the security and economic support that it needs today to defend its sovereignty and people, and for the long term to ensure that Ukraine doesn\u2019t just survive, that it thrives \u2013 and that Russia is deterred from further aggression.\nThis includes continuing to tighten sanctions and export controls, putting that pressure on Russia to limit its ability to wage its war, cracking down on sanctions evaders wherever they hide, rejecting Moscow\u2019s nuclear blackmail, and ensuring accountability for war crimes.\nThe G7 from the get-go has led the world in galvanizing and sustaining support for Ukraine. \u00a0Now, as Ukraine prepares to launch a counteroffensive to take back its land, to liberate its people in occupied territories, to stop the missiles, bombs, and drones which continue to rain down daily on its civilians, we stand with Ukraine.\nAnd when the inevitable voices, led by a Russia that is losing its war of conquest, talk about avoiding escalation or call for Ukraine to stop reclaiming its own territory, we will remind the world who is the aggressor and who is the victim \u2013 who has 20 percent of its land occupied by enemy forces; whose children are being disappeared, and whose civilians are being killed and left in mass graves.\nAt the same time, Russia is again blocking Ukraine\u2019s grain from reaching the world, spiking food prices for people everywhere. \u00a0For the last few days, no ships have gotten out of Ukraine, and more than 50 have been blocked from going in to load up. \u00a0Countries around the world depend on this life-saving grain. \u00a0Russia is breaking its promises to them.\nWe also discussed China. \u00a0All of our nations have consequential relationships with Beijing, and a number of G7 colleagues have recently visited. \u00a0What struck me in hearing the readouts of those conversations is that we are resolved and united in the need for candid discussions with Beijing about its unfair trade practices, its actions that undermine the international rules that all nations benefit from, and the risks if it breaks its word and starts arming Russia. \u00a0And of course we\u2019re united in making clear to Beijing our opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo with Taiwan.\nWe\u2019re also equally committed, individually and collectively, to constructively engaging with Beijing if it chooses to contribute its efforts \u2013 to efforts to address shared global challenges. \u00a0That is what the world expects of responsible powers.\nAt this ministerial, we also focused on nuclear proliferation. \u00a0I\u2019m grateful to Japan for the high priority that it has placed on countering nuclear threats \u2013 including from the DPRK\u2019s dangerous ballistic missile launches; Iran\u2019s expansion of its nuclear activities, including the operation of advanced centrifuges and the accumulation of highly enriched uranium, for which it has no credible civilian explanation or purpose; Russia\u2019s New START suspension and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric; and the PRC\u2019s opaque and rapid build-up of its own nuclear arsenal. \u00a0These actions only strengthen our determination to address nuclear dangers.\nWe\u2019re also focused on the threat posed by synthetic opioids. \u00a0Our communique speaks to our collective commitment to developing and implementing solutions to this crisis, and we will continue to cooperate closely \u2013 indeed, we will strengthen that cooperation \u2013 addressing illicit financing, disrupting trafficking networks, supporting public health responses, and more.\nSo it\u2019s been a very productive and important few days which lay the groundwork for the Leaders Summit in Hiroshima in a month\u2019s time.\u00a0 And I commend to you the joint statement that we issued, or will soon issue, reflecting the work that we\u2019ve done.\nWith that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 All right, we\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Nike Ching from Voice of America.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Nike, how are you?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Inaudible.) \u00a0Thanks for the press conference.\u00a0 On Sudan, can you provide more details on reports that a U.S. embassy vehicle was targeted in Khartoum, which means (inaudible) divided?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your plan to ensure the safety and security of U.S. citizens and diplomats?\u00a0 Is there a plan to evacuate the embassy there given the newest developments?\u00a0 And if I may, do you support the calls from some senators to sanction generals of the two fighting military factions?\nAnd finally, if I may, on\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporter.\u00a0 Do you have more details on Ambassador Lynne Tracy\u2019s access to Evan Gershkovich given reports that a Moscow court is scheduled on Tuesday to hear an appeal on his case?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to Sudan, look, I\u2019m limited in terms of the details and what I can get into from here, but I can confirm that yesterday we had an American diplomatic convoy that was fired on.\u00a0 All of our people are safe and unharmed.\u00a0 But this action was reckless, it was irresponsible, and of course unsafe \u2013 a diplomatic convoy with diplomatic plates, a U.S. flag, being fired upon.\nIn the calls that I had this morning with Generals Hemedti and Burhan, I made very clear that any attacks, threats, dangers posed to our diplomats were totally unacceptable.\u00a0 This particular incident is still being investigated in terms of understanding exactly what happened.\u00a0 The initial reports that we have is that it was undertaken by forces associated with the RSF, and again, I made very clear in my conversation with General Hemedti that any attacks that endanger our diplomats are totally unacceptable, and I shared the same with General Burhan.\nWe have deep concerns, of course, about the overall security environment as it affects civilians, as it affects diplomats, as it affects aid workers.\u00a0 World Food Program had to suspend its operations; three of its people were killed.\u00a0 That potentially has terrible consequences for the Sudanese people, who are in desperate need of the assistance provided by the World Food Program.\u00a0 That only underscores the imperative of getting a ceasefire and putting Sudan back on the track that it was on, which was talks and negotiations toward the restoration of a civilian-led government.\nWe will continue to track this very closely and very carefully.\u00a0 My number one priority, of course, is the safety and security of our personnel.\u00a0 I\u2019m in very close contact with \u2013 as is my entire team \u2013 with Ambassador John Godfrey and our entire team in Khartoum.\u00a0 Again, I won\u2019t go into any details except to say that we are and will continue to take every responsible measure to make sure that our people are safe and secure.\nWe\u2019re also in very close coordination with other countries that have influence in Sudan.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been on the phone with counterparts from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, to make sure that we\u2019re coordinating carefully.\u00a0 Our team as well has been in very close contact with the African Union, with other international organizations \u2013 again, to make sure that everyone is coordinated and that we are channeling the shared determination among the international community to get to a ceasefire as quickly as possible and to put Sudan back on the track of talks, negotiations, again, to restore civilian-led government in Sudan.\nBut first things first, the imperative is getting quickly to a ceasefire so that the guns stop firing, people can move about safely, reunite with their families, get the assistance they need, and all of us can continue to engage in supporting Sudan as it makes its transition.\nWith regard to Evan Gershkovich, yes, Ambassador Tracy and our chief consular officer were able to see Evan in prison in Moscow.\u00a0 I can report, based on what Ambassador Tracy has said, that he is in good health and good spirits considering the \u2013 considering the circumstances.\u00a0 We continue to call for his immediate release from this unjust detention.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Tetsuo Shintomi with Kyodo News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I would like to ask on the nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation, which is of big interest among Japanese people.\u00a0 As you know, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida has expressed his hope to discuss on a world without nuclear weapons at coming G7 Leaders Summit.\u00a0 As you are wrapping up foreign ministers meeting here in Karuizawa, do you feel any tangible progress toward that end?\u00a0 And how do you think about the possibility of a world without \u2013 achieving a world without nuclear weapons despite all these challenges?\nAnd in addition, if I may, many local people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including a\u00a0Hibakusha, which is an atomic bomb survivor, are looking forward to a U.S. leader\u2019s visit to Hiroshima in May.\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering if you had any message to them.\nThank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, I should tell you that we had \u2013 during this G7 meeting we had dedicated sessions on specific issues, the most important issues on our agenda.\u00a0 And the final session that we had, dedicated session, was on arms control and nonproliferation, which in and of itself underscores the importance that the G7 attaches to it.\u00a0 And I have to praise Japan\u2019s leadership, as always, on this issue.\nWe, as G7 countries, are committed to maintaining and strengthening disarmament and nonproliferation efforts toward a more secure, stable, and safer world.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be convening, as you noted, at a leaders level in Hiroshima, which together with Nagasaki offers the most powerful reminder of the unprecedented devastation and immense human suffering that the people of Japan experienced as a result of the atomic bombings in 1945.\nThe overall decline in global nuclear arsenals has to continue and must not be reversed.\u00a0 If you look at the trajectory from the onset of the Cold War through to today, we\u2019ve seen that overall decline.\u00a0 And that can and should be achieved through a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach to arms control and nonproliferation.\nHaving said that, we also see some very significant challenges not just on the horizon but fully present, and we have to continue to work collectively to counter these challenges: Russia\u2019s suspension of the New START agreement, irresponsible nuclear rhetoric; the DPRK\u2019s dangerous ballistic missile launches and further development of its own nuclear program; Iran\u2019s expansion of its nuclear activities; and China\u2019s pursuit in a very opaque way of a rapid nuclear arsenal buildup.\nSo based on our conversations today, I can tell you that these actions only strengthen our determination to address nuclear dangers, and it\u2019s particularly why I\u2019m grateful to Japan for the high priority it\u2019s placed on this topic under its G7 presidency.\nI can also tell you that the President very much looks forward to being in Japan for the G7 leaders and in Hiroshima specifically, and I know he\u2019ll have much more to say when he\u2019s here, but it\u2019s something that he\u2019s very focused on and looks very much forward to.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg news.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary. \u00a0Chinse leader Xi Jinping has recently, obviously, made diplomatic waves both with the Saudi Arabia-Iran deal and its own proposal for peace in Ukraine.\u00a0 Just the other day, Brazil\u2019s president said the U.S. should stop encouraging war and start talking peace, and Brazil\u2019s foreign minister also criticized Western sanctions for taking an unnecessary toll on nations involved in the conflict.\u00a0 Do you think the Brazilian comments suggest that the U.S. is potentially losing the battle for public opinion on Ukraine in the Global South?\u00a0 And do you think it\u2019s time that Washington should meaningfully engage with China\u2019s peace proposal, even despite the reservations about it freezing Russia\u2019s territorial gains?\nAnd secondly, just on China.\u00a0 It\u2019s been weeks since Biden said he would try and speak with Xi, and there\u2019s still no clear plan for your own previously postponed trip to Beijing.\u00a0 Given your own G7 counterparts are visiting China and urging engagement, do you think it\u2019s time the U.S. started more substantive, meaningful engagement with senior Chinese officials or do you think Beijing\u2019s unwillingness to engage is holding that back?\nThanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, just speaking to the G7 itself and what I heard here and what we\u2019ve been discussing over the last few days, what I \u2013 what I heard, again, is remarkable convergence on concerns related to the PRC and on what we\u2019re doing to address those concerns.\u00a0 And I think some of you heard my counterparts speaking to that directly, and I\u2019d also invite you to read the joint statement that we put out that reflects very well the shared approach that we have to China \u2013 both the challenges it poses as well as the need for engagement that we all see and share.\nBut in general, over the past two years what I\u2019ve seen not just in Europe but also in Asia is much greater convergence on the approach to take to China, which for all of our countries is among the most consequential as well as complicated relationships that we have.\u00a0 We believe \u2013 the United States \u2013 that having lines of communication, being able to engage across the broad range of issues that animate the relationship, is important.\u00a0 And we also believe that countries around the world expect us to manage the relationship with China responsibly, and that starts with engagement, with having lines of communication.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what President Biden sought to reinforce in Bali when he met with President Xi, and my expectation would be that we will be able to move forward on that.\u00a0 But it does require China to make clear its own intentions in doing that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll look to see if they do so, but if they do so my expectation would be that we will find ways to engage as the presidents agreed during their Bali meeting.\nBeyond that, I\u2019m not going to speak to any individual countries.\u00a0 I can just say more generally with regard to Brazil that President Biden, President Lula had a very good meeting when President Lula visited the White House \u2013 I think his first or certainly among his very first visits to any country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 The final question, Ryo Kiyomiya from\u00a0Asahi Shimbun.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Welcome to Japan.\u00a0 I have several questions on Taiwan and engagement with the Global South.\nFirst, on Taiwan, French President Macron said in his interview that Europe must not be a follower of either the U.S. or China on Taiwan, and we heard that there was some discussions on this comment during the ministerial meeting.\u00a0 How much are you worried his comment may undermine global support for Taiwan?\u00a0 And do you think they represent perhaps a small victory for Xi Jinping in China\u2019s effort to divide Europe and the U.S. on foreign policy issues?\nAnd secondly, on the Global South, to address the challenges of Russia and China\u2019s influence in the developing world, how do you mean to offer an alternative to China by engaging more with the Global South?\u00a0 And also, what kind of role do you expect Japan to play in increasing engagement with the Global South?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to Taiwan, there is clear unanimity in the approach that we\u2019re taking with all of our G7 partners and many other countries around the world, and that is an expectation that any differences be dealt with peacefully and that neither side take any unilateral actions that would disrupt the status quo that preserves peace and stability.\u00a0 That is clearly what every single one of our G7 partners believes.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s reflected well in the G7 statement that we\u2019re putting out today.\u00a0 And again, a number of partners spoke directly to their views, to their countries\u2019 views, on the broader relationship with China and the more specific question of Taiwan.\u00a0 And as I said a moment ago, in my experience we actually have not seen greater convergence at any other time in the approach than we see now, both with Europe as well as with key countries in Asia.\nWith regard to what\u2019s called the Global South, I think if you look at the discussions that we had just over the last two and a half or three days, the vast majority of the time was spent on looking at the issues that are actually affecting people\u2019s lives around the world and focusing, as I said, on how we can leverage our strengths to deliver actual solutions on the issues that, as I said, are having an impact on the lives of people around the world as well as in our own countries.\nSo look at what we spent our time focused on and developing concrete action plans on: food security; energy and climate change; health security; building infrastructure that addresses the needs of countries around the world; catalyzing more investment from the private sector; broader and more inclusive economic growth; international financial institutions that actually respond to the needs of countries around the world.\u00a0 That was probably two-thirds of the discussion that we had over the last two and a half days, and I suspect that you\u2019ll see the leaders do the same when they meet in a month\u2019s time.\nAnd what this comes down to is that we as a G7, as individual countries, along with many other countries that are not part of the G7, want to spend our time, our focus, our resources on addressing these challenges and making it clear to countries around the world that this is not about asking or making them choose; it\u2019s about offering a good, indeed a better \u2013 a better choice.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve focused our attention on.\u00a0 Again, I invite you to take a look at the statement that we put out.\u00a0 I think it reflects it very well, and it\u2019s a very good prelude to the meeting that the leaders will have in a month\u2019s time.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 So I have been long been looking forward to returning to Vietnam and making my first visit here as Secretary of State.\u00a0 I was here as deputy secretary in 2015 and 2016, but I am so pleased to be back today.\nA decade since the United States and Vietnam launched our Comprehensive Partnership, and nearly 28 years since we normalized relations, our nations have forged a relationship that is robust, dynamic, and consequential.\nI\u2019m here at the behest of President Biden to further broaden and deepen that partnership following the President\u2019s call with the general secretary last month and building on earlier high-level visits, including from Vice President Harris, Secretary of Defense Austin, U.S. Trade Representative Tai, USAID Administrator Power, and recently as well members of Congress.\nThroughout my engagements today, I focused on how the United States can continue to support Vietnam\u2019s success \u2013 which is good for the Vietnamese people, for Americans, and indeed for the entire region.\nOur countries are collaborating on an incredibly broad range of shared interests, and we believe that by supporting Vietnam\u2019s ambitions we advance our own, from the creation of American jobs and the strengthening of American businesses, to progress on the climate crisis that affects us all, to preventing pandemics.\nI also focused on how our countries can advance a free and open Indo-Pacific, one that is at peace and grounded in respect for the rules-based international order.\u00a0 When we talk about \u201cfree and open,\u201d we mean countries being free to choose their own path and their own partners and that problems will be dealt with openly; rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly; and goods, ideas, and people will flow freely across land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nIn my meetings with General Secretary Trong, with Prime Minister Chinh, with Foreign Minister Son, and External Relations Commission Chairman Trung, I discussed our work to promote broad-based prosperity in Vietnam and throughout the region, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 Vietnam has joined negotiations on all four pillars of IPEF, and that will help lead a race to the top on the issues that are shaping the 21st century economy, including supply chain resilience, the clean energy transition, digital connectivity, and that will benefit Americans and people across this region.\nWe discussed our mutual respect for ASEAN centrality and our close partnership through regional economic frameworks, including APEC, which the United States is proud to be hosting this year, and the Mekong-U.S.\u00a0 Partnership.\u00a0 We appreciate Vietnam\u2019s indispensable leadership in solving development challenges in the Mekong region that have been made worse by dam construction, climate change, and overfishing.\nWe\u2019re also growing our bilateral economic partnership.\u00a0 The U.S. is helping Vietnam double down on key reforms it\u2019s embraced \u2013 including on labor, intellectual property, fair trade \u2013 which have made it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\nWe believe that Vietnam can achieve its goal of becoming a connected, high-income country by 2045 by pursuing growth that lifts up all communities, while building resilience to adapt to climate change.\nWe know Vietnam is increasingly vulnerable to threats posed by the climate crisis.\u00a0 As Vietnam takes steps to become a leader on climate energy transition, the United States is investing in that tremendous potential.\nWe\u2019re launching new bilateral climate initiatives that were announced by Vice President Harris during her August 2021 visit to Vietnam, which do everything from conserving ecosystems and reducing emissions from rice farming in the Mekong Delta, to expanding a market-driven clean energy system and scaling up adoption of electric vehicles, to leveraging our private sectors to drive climate action.\nWe\u2019re also harnessing the power of regional frameworks like the Just Energy Transition Partnership.\u00a0 Vietnam recently joined that partnership.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to deploy $15.5 billion to help the country deliver on its ambitious Net Zero 2050 goal as well as the Japan-U.S.-Mekong Power Partnership.\nWe\u2019re also collaborating to build up Vietnam\u2019s public health capacity, including by establishing a national CDC here in Vietnam.\u00a0 We\u2019ve partnered closely to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, with the United States donating more than 40 million vaccine doses, followed by Vietnam\u2019s donation \u2013 following \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Vietnam\u2019s donation of millions of articles of PPE during the earliest part of the pandemic, when America was at a time of its greatest need.\u00a0 And I have to say this is a very powerful example of countries coming together and coming to each other\u2019s assistance when each of us needed it most.\nAs part of our bilateral security partnership, which is growing, we\u2019re finalizing the transfer of the third U.S. Coast Guard cutter to Vietnam, complementing a fleet of 24 patrol boats and other equipment, training, and operational facilities that we\u2019ve provided since 2016.\u00a0 All of these efforts bolster Vietnam\u2019s capacity to contribute to maritime peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nThe United States is committed to supporting a strong, prosperous, independent, and resilient Vietnam.\u00a0 And we respect Vietnam\u2019s right to shape its future under its own political system.\u00a0 At the same time, we continue to underscore how future progress on human rights is essential to unleashing the full potential of the Vietnamese people.\u00a0 That\u2019s the central focus of the U.S.-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue.\nFinally, the United States is committed to our ongoing work to address the legacies of the war, even as we focus on the future.\u00a0 This is a matter of trust, of commitment, and of duty.\nWe\u2019re continuing our joint efforts to clear unexploded ordnance.\u00a0 Next month, we\u2019ll complete the survey of the heavily bombed Quang Tri Province.\u00a0 We\u2019re making significant progress cleaning up dioxin hotspots from the war.\u00a0 Last month, we announced a new $73 million contract to treat contaminated soil and sediment at Bien Hoa Air Base.\nAnd we\u2019re continuing the important humanitarian work to account for those missing from the war, including by increasing Vietnam\u2019s capacity to identify its own missing and dead.\u00a0 We recognize the longstanding support of the Government of Vietnam to account for U.S.\u00a0 personnel lost during the war.\u00a0 Our reciprocal cooperation for ensuring families from both countries receive the closure they deserve remains vitally important.\nToday, we took another step to strengthen our relationship by breaking ground on our new embassy compound.\u00a0 When completed, our new embassy in Hanoi will be a state-of-art facility worthy of our ambitious vision for the future of our partnership and worthy of the American and Vietnamese people who work every day to make that vision a reality.\nWith that, I\u2019m happy to take some questions.\u00a0 Vedant.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll do four questions today.\u00a0 First question, John Hudson of\u00a0The Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, a three-part question on Vietnam if you\u2019ll indulge me.\u00a0\u00a0 You have underscored that the U.S. and Vietnam \u2013 the U.S. and Vietnam are aligned on a common view of free and Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 How does this square with Vietnam\u2019s recent crackdown on dissent?\nSecondly, advocacy groups say Vietnam deported several Russian residents who expressed opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\u00a0 And Vietnam earlier this year also voted to abstain from a UN vote to condemn the Russian invasion.\u00a0 Did you discuss Vietnam\u2019s position on the war with leaders today?\u00a0 And if so, what did you hear from them?\nAnd then lastly, from your discussion today, what ways does the U.S. and Vietnam share concerns about China\u2019s assertiveness in the region?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, John.\u00a0 So first, I am not aware of the deportations that you referenced.\u00a0 We did talk about Ukraine and about the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 Vietnam has a long history and relationship with Russia.\u00a0 We understand that and recognize that.\nAt the same time, I\u2019ve heard clearly from our Vietnamese interlocutors and I\u2019ve heard them state publicly their commitment and the importance that they attach to the basic principles that are also under threat by Russia\u2019s aggression, the principles at the heart of the UN Charter \u2013 territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence.\u00a0 Vietnam stands strongly for those.\u00a0 They\u2019ve made that clear.\u00a0 They\u2019ve said so publicly and they repeated that in conversation with us today.\nWith regard to human rights and the relationship that we have, this is a conversation that we regularly engage in.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve said to our counterparts, it\u2019s very important that we continue to speak directly, openly, candidly about our concerns.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly, exactly what we do.\nWe continue to seek progress on issues like freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of religion.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen, I think, positive steps taken in some areas, to include, for example, the respect for the rights of the LGBTQI+ community.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen important work that Vietnam has done with UNHCR on the right of stateless people, for example.\u00a0 But in these other areas we continue to have concerns that we\u2019ve shared.\nAs well, I think it\u2019s important that the space be expanded for nongovernmental organizations to be able to register, to operate without burdensome intrusion by the state.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve noted and we\u2019ve noted the important contributions these organizations make to issues that matter to all Vietnamese, for example, on climate change, on conservation, on dealing with transnational crime.\u00a0 But this is an ongoing part of our dialogue and an important one.\nFinally, on South China Sea, I think it\u2019s very clear that countries throughout the region, to include Vietnam, feel strongly about the importance of respecting the rule of law, particularly under the Law of the Sea Convention, when it comes to issues of freedom of navigation, when it comes to maritime disputes, when it comes to illegal fishing, et cetera.\u00a0 And a lot of good work is being done, for example, through ASEAN to try to address these issues.\u00a0 That\u2019s been going on for some time.\nAnd in our own relationship with Vietnam, with other countries in the region, one of the things that we\u2019ve worked on, I think very productively, is helping countries strengthen what we call maritime domain awareness \u2013 having the capacity to see very clearly what is happening in the seas that surround their countries, particularly when it comes to things like piracy, like illegal fishing, or like any use of coercion by other countries against \u2013 against these countries, against their fishing fleets, et cetera.\nSo that\u2019s an important part of the conversation as well, and it does go to the heart of what we have as a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, one in which, again, countries are free to pursue their own policies, their own partnerships, and in which everyone in the region abides by the international rule of law.\u00a0 This is something that joins us together with Vietnam.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to\u00a0H\u00e0ng Duy Linh with Tuoi Tre.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So let me ask you in Vietnamese, okay?\n(Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, before your arrival there are already speculation that this year will be the very good year to change the partnership from comprehensive to strategic partnership.\u00a0 Why would the U.S. would like that, and what do you think whether you can \u2013 the two countries can result in that goal?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I think from the perspective of the United States \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to speak for our Vietnamese colleagues, but certainly from our perspective \u2013 we think this is an auspicious time to elevate our existing partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had for the last 10 years this Comprehensive Partnership that has created an incredibly strong foundation of cooperation across many different areas.\nAnd as a result, we think this is a good moment to go even further.\u00a0 And by that we mean this: to make even more effective the existing cooperation that we have, and then to work in new areas of cooperation and collaboration in the partnership.\u00a0 And this is something that the \u2013 that President Biden and the general secretary discussed when they spoke on the phone a couple of weeks ago, and it was very much part of the conversations that we had today.\nSo I think what you\u2019ll see in the weeks and months ahead is our teams working on this.\u00a0 There are so many areas where we can either deepen cooperation or really add cooperation to what we\u2019re already doing, whether it\u2019s on climate change, whether it\u2019s on health, security, science and technology, and education.\u00a0 I was just at the Hanoi University for Science and Technology and saw some remarkable young Vietnamese innovators, including a robotics team that will be coming to the United States. \u00a0We think there\u2019s an area there for significant collaboration in building up science and technology in Vietnam and also deepening even more educational exchanges.\u00a0 We have many Vietnamese students in the United States.\u00a0 We want even more.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to see Americans come here.\nBut also the digital transformation, which is part \u2013 already part of IPEF, strengthening supply chains and building more resilient ones, deepening the work that we\u2019re doing together in the Mekong Delta.\u00a0 Each of these areas, whether it\u2019s an existing area of cooperation or one that we can add, I think would go to an enhanced partnership that we\u2019ll be working on in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Matt Lee with The Associated Press.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thanks, Vedant.\u00a0 Hi, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 A couple things.\u00a0 One, do you have any understanding of what the situation \u2013 what\u2019s going on in Khartoum right now in Sudan?\nAnd then more to the point of this trip, tomorrow you\u2019re going to be beginning almost three days of talks with your G7 colleagues in what is the first big international meeting since these leaks of the highly classified information.\u00a0 Whether or not you expect or worry that your colleagues in Japan might ask you about that or raise it as a problematic issue, what do you say to people who ask whether the U.S. can still be a trusted partner and ally given that this set of leaks is like the fourth major one in about a decade from Americans?\nAnd then lastly on Evan Gershkovich, is there any update on his situation in terms of getting consular access?\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that the Russians have said that they might be willing to arrange some kind of a swap for him.\u00a0 Is there anything to report on that front?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Matt.\u00a0 First on Khartoum, the major parties in Khartoum some weeks ago reached a very important framework agreement on how to proceed with a transition to civilian government.\u00a0 And there\u2019s been real progress in trying to move that forward.\u00a0 I spoke to General Burhan just a couple of days ago on that very topic, and there are still some remaining \u2013 important remaining issues that need to be dealt with.\u00a0 But I think there\u2019s a real opportunity to move forward on the agreed framework, and certainly that\u2019s what we\u2019re strongly supporting.\nIt\u2019s a fragile situation.\u00a0 There are other actors that may be pushing against that progress.\u00a0 But this is a real opportunity to finally carry forward the civilian-led transition, and one that we and other countries are trying to bolster.\u00a0 So we\u2019re very focused on that along with other partners.\nOn the intelligence leaks, what I can tell you is this:\u00a0 We have engaged with our allies and partners since these leaks came out, and we have done so at high levels, and we have made clear our commitment to safeguarding intelligence and our commitment to our security partnerships.\nWhat I\u2019ve heard so far at least is an appreciation for the steps that we\u2019re taking, and it\u2019s not affected our cooperation.\u00a0 I just haven\u2019t seen that.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard that.\u00a0 And of course, the investigation is taking its course.\u00a0 There\u2019s now, as you know, a suspect in custody but importantly as well, I know, measures being taken to further safeguard information.\u00a0 But to date, based on the conversations I\u2019ve had, I have not \u2013 not heard anything that would affect our cooperation with allies and partners.\nOn Evan Gershkovich, I don\u2019t have anything new to share.\u00a0 We continue to seek consular access.\u00a0 That has not yet been granted.\u00a0 It needs to be.\u00a0 This is a Russian obligation, and so we\u2019re looking to that.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve heard some of the comments that have been made, but there\u2019s nothing \u2013 nothing that I have to report on where this might go.\u00a0 We continue to call for his immediate release, and certainly we need to see consular access now.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, B\u00f9i Ki\u1ec1u Li\u00ean with Bao Chinh Phu.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam, how does it progress?\u00a0 How has it been progressing since?\u00a0 And what that relationship, the result of that relationship, the economic-wise and politically-wise?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s fair to say this has been one of the more remarkable evolutions in relationships that we\u2019ve seen in recent years and in recent decades.\u00a0 And it\u2019s one that is very gratifying to me and to the United States as a whole.\nLet me just give you one example.\u00a0 When we lifted the trade embargo in 1994, there was virtually no trade between Vietnam and the United States.\u00a0 Twenty years later in 2015, the first time that I was here as a representative of the United States, trade was roughly $45 billion between our countries.\u00a0 So it had gone up from virtually zero to $45 billion.\u00a0 Today, we\u2019re approaching $140 billion in trade.\u00a0 So just looking at that aspect of the relationship, we\u2019ve seen a dramatic, dramatic change.\nBut much more broadly than that, we\u2019re seeing the United States and Vietnam working closely together in virtually every area that matters to people in both of our countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in building the strong economic trade and investment relationship.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in the work that we\u2019re doing together now on climate change.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in the work that we\u2019re doing on building the resilience of our supply chains, which we know is so critical.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together to address the needs in the Mekong Delta, including on agriculture.\u00a0 In fact, our Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack will be here, I think, tomorrow following my visit.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve had a whole host of senior officials from across our government reflecting the full range of actions that \u2013 and activities that we\u2019re engaged in.\nBut whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy security, whether it\u2019s trade and investment, in science and technology, education \u2013 all of these areas, cooperation, collaboration between the United States and Vietnam has grown exponentially.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re also working very closely together in regional organizations like ASEAN, APEC, and collaborating to advance the international rule of law that both of our countries strongly adhere to and want to make sure is upheld and strengthened.\nAnd so in so many ways we become genuine partners trying to advance mutual interests and doing it in a way that reflects the interests of our people.\u00a0 As I said a moment ago, earlier today I had the opportunity to break ground for our new embassy compound, and that in and of itself is very symbolic of the relationship.\u00a0 The fact that we need that compound because we were doing so much together that our diplomatic presence is even more important than it\u2019s ever been.\nSo for us, for President Biden, for Washington, this is one of the most dynamic and one of the most important relationships\u00a0 we\u2019ve had.\u00a0 It\u2019s had a remarkable trajectory over the last couple of decades.\u00a0 Our conviction is that it can and will grow even stronger in the decades ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you, everyone, very, very much.\u00a0 This really is a particular pleasure because this has been a day long in the making.\nI heard about this project, I think, the first time I was here as deputy secretary from Ambassador Osius, then Ambassador Kritenbrink.\u00a0 Marc, congratulations.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But thank you, in all seriousness, for your extraordinary leadership at a time of tremendous importance.\nTo my friend the foreign minister, we\u2019re so grateful not just for your presence but for our partnership every single day and for the work that you are instrumental in doing in bringing us to this day.\nAnd to the vice minister, to our colleagues from the city as well, the planning commission, thank you, thank you so much.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for this partnership, this collaboration.\u00a0 And it doesn\u2019t take that much imagination \u2013 maybe just a little bit \u2013 to see what this could be in just a few years\u2019 time, but also to see what it\u2019s going to represent in both symbolic and practical ways for the relationship between our countries.\nTo everyone who\u2019s here from the Government of Vietnam, from our embassy team, all colleagues past and present: \u00a0Thank you for all of the hard work that has gone to making this day possible.\u00a0 I know that it took a lot of work.\u00a0\nSo in a few moments, we will symbolically break ground on the new embassy campus here in Hanoi.\nYears in the making, this is the culmination of dedicated and often very creative engagement between countless Americans and countless Vietnamese diplomats.\nAnd again, that\u2019s something I saw firsthand when I was here in 2015 and 2016 as deputy secretary working together to find the land for the campus.\nNow, this groundbreaking \u2013 and the new embassy that we\u2019ll build \u2013 represents another significant step toward strengthening a vital partnership between our countries and between our people.\nBack in 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Hanoi to normalize diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.\u00a0 Opening the embassy was a key part of that effort.\nNow, back then, things looked a little bit different at the U.S. embassy.\u00a0 There were fewer than 30 American employees.\u00a0 Much of their work was done with a very exciting technology that let them communicate instantly with colleagues around the world: the fax machine.\u00a0\nSo we\u2019ve come a little bit of distance from those days.\u00a0 A few things have changed. \u00a0We have emails.\u00a0 And the small team that opened the embassy back then has grown to include more than 600 American and local staff.\nOver the last 27 years, similarly, the ties that connect our countries, Vietnam and the United States, have grown stronger and stronger.\u00a0 And that\u2019s happened in no small part because of our renewed diplomatic presence in Hanoi, because of our exceptional staff \u2013 at the embassy, at our consulate in Ho Chi Minh City \u2013 who have worked day-in/day-out to forge a relationship that\u2019s robust, that\u2019s dynamic, that\u2019s consequential, and that addresses the needs of the people in both of our countries.\u00a0\nToday, we are, as you\u2019ve head, celebrating 10 years of collaboration through our Comprehensive Partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019ve joined forces on everything from improving public health, to expanding inclusive economic opportunities, to accelerating the clean energy transition.\nWe\u2019re advancing together a free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific region, one that is at peace and rooted in respect for the rules-based international order.\u00a0 And we\u2019re continuing to work together to address the legacy of the war in Vietnam.\nFor nearly three decades, our embassy in Hanoi has been at the center of every one of these shared activities, and many more.\u00a0 And what the new facility will enable us to do is to build on that foundation for decades to come, meet modern challenges, and deliver for our people.\nIt\u2019s going to be eight stories tall.\u00a0 The building will be big enough to bring our entire team together under one roof, enabling both greater collaboration and greater efficiency.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have four times the number of consular windows as our current office, so that we can get visas and passports to more people more quickly.\u00a0 And over an estimated six years of construction, the project will provide good jobs for as many as 1,800 local workers, while adding $350 million to the Vietnamese economy.\nWhat\u2019s also powerful and important is that the embassy is going to reflect a fusion of our cultures and our nations.\u00a0 The complex was designed by an American company, inspired by a mix of Vietnam\u2019s topography and Hanoi\u2019s urban architecture.\nThe base of the building will be made from basalt \u2013 a rock that\u2019s found both in Vietnam and the United States.\u00a0 And the embassy\u2019s construction will embody our countries\u2019 shared commitment to environmental sustainability and resilience.\u00a0 We\u2019re building much of the embassy using recycled materials, and the design will both conserve energy and mitigate the risk of flooding from severe storms.\nWhen Secretary Christopher opened the embassy in Hanoi in 1995, he spoke about building a bridge of cooperation between our nations.\u00a0 But what no one could have anticipated, and what is plainly visible to all today, almost three decades later, is everything that building that bridge has enabled.\u00a0 With this new campus, we will be able to foster still more of those connections and all the relationships, the innovations, the opportunities that come with them.\nSo this is really a special day.\u00a0 And I was saying to the foreign minister, when the embassy is actually complete and built, I hope both of us are pulled out of our retirements and brought back to help actually open it.\u00a0 Thank you all very much for being here today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n",

working on issues that really matter to our people, from dealing with climate change, to finding new renewable sources of energy, to building more resilient supply chains.\u00a0 All of these things and more, I think, are front and center on the agenda.\nPresident Biden deeply valued the call with the general secretary and asked me to again extend his appreciation to you, to the general secretary when I\u2019ll have a chance to see him later today.\u00a0 And we are very gratified to be able to move forward with the new embassy compound.\u00a0 I brought my shovel with me, so we\u2019re ready.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\nBut we also just very much appreciate, Prime Minister, the very good working relationship we have with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the people across the government, and we\u2019re grateful for your hospitality today.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n",

the third ever \u2013 and first since 2016 \u2013 U.S.-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial alongside Secretary of Defense Austin.\u00a0 Today\u2019s meeting builds on the momentum of the high-level U.S. visits to the Philippines just over the past year, including by Vice President Harris, by Secretary Austin, and myself.\nThe Philippines is the United States\u2019 oldest ally in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our relationship is based on the shared interests and values of Americans and Filipinos, including our abiding commitment to democracy.\u00a0 For decades, we\u2019ve worked together to promote peace and stability across the region, and we\u2019re growing that effective partnership in scale and scope every single day, including through very productive, very rich discussions today.\nOur security alliance is an enduring source of strength for both of our nations.\u00a0 Today, we focused on ways to continue our close partnership under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement so that our forces can work even more closely together, including to provide humanitarian assistance and respond to disasters.\u00a0 Secretary Austin and I also reaffirmed the United States\u2019 unwavering commitment to standing with the Philippines against any intimidation or coercion, including in the South China Sea, and to preserving a region that\u2019s governed by international law where goods and ideas and people can move freely.\nWe also discussed deepening our robust economic ties, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity.\u00a0 We\u2019re working closely with other IPEF partners to build out this framework to help our economies grow faster and fairer so that all our people can reach their full potential, lead on issues shaping the 21st-century economy, and do it in a way that is sustainable for our planet.\nOne way that we\u2019re putting our partnership through IPEF to work is by collaborating to increase economic opportunities for women and girls in the Philippines.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing training in growing industries like data science and artificial intelligence, where women have been under-represented, and boosting digital literacy rates.\nAnd more broadly, as we discussed today, we\u2019re committed to expanding our economic cooperation across the board.\u00a0 Indeed, we discussed a number of areas where we can deepen our collaboration, cooperation in pursuit of that goal.\nTogether, we\u2019re stepping up to address global challenges that no country can solve alone.\u00a0 We discussed our shared efforts to combat the climate crisis and strengthen energy security.\u00a0 The United States is committed to helping the Philippines reach its ambitious goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent by 2030.\u00a0 To do that, the U.S. Government and critically, the private sector, are supporting the growth of the offshore wind market, the development of nickel and cobalt facilities that will help the Philippines sustainable process \u2013 sustainably process minerals essential to the clean energy transition.\nWe\u2019re also providing technical assistance and regulatory guidance to support the growth of the Philippines\u2019 civil nuclear energy program.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking to grow our cooperation through a 123 agreement on civil nuclear cooperation which will make it easier for us to share technical knowledge as well as nuclear material and equipment.\nWe\u2019re delivering solutions to the food security challenges impacting the Philippines like so many other countries.\u00a0 Philippines-based companies, with the support of the United States Government and the American private sector, are making impressive progress in developing climate-smart food systems, increasing their productivity, and the sustainability of their supply chains.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking forward to continuing this progress at the inaugural U.S.-Philippines Food Security Dialogue a little bit later this year.\nWe\u2019re able to do this work not only because of the partnership between our governments but also because of the partnership between our peoples.\u00a0 This year, we\u2019re celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Fulbright Program in the Philippines, the longest running Fulbright Program in the world.\u00a0 More than 22,000 Filipinos have come to the United States through the Fulbright and other U.S. exchange programs, enriching our communities with their perspectives and experiences, innovating and launching businesses, building enduring bonds between our people \u2013 bonds that to this day renew and revitalize the friendship between our countries.\nAcross all of these areas and more, the United States values and is proud of our robust and deepening partnership with the Philippines.\u00a0 Secretary Austin and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss in-depth how we\u2019ll make this essential relationship even stronger in the months and years ahead.\nSo really grateful to our colleagues for being here today, grateful to their teams at the hard work that\u2019s been done, but not grateful simply for their presence but also the spirit in which together we are working to strengthen the bonds between our countries.\nRicky, over to you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Tony.\u00a0 Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Senior Undersecretary and OIC Carlito G. Galvez, Jr., friends from the media, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\u00a0 I\u2019m very pleased to be here in Washington and to address all of you today.\u00a0 Some of you were with Secretary Blinken when we held our first meeting in our current capacities in Manila last August.\u00a0 We agreed then to work together in sustaining the positive momentum and trajectory of Philippine-U.S. relations, including by reconvening our 2+2 ministerial dialogue in 2023.\u00a0 And I\u2019m happy to report that we have in fact followed through on that commitment.\nToday is only the third iteration of our dialogue in the 2+2 format since it was established in 2012.\u00a0 After a seven-year gap since the second meeting in 2016, this meeting holds particular significance as it further reaffirms our shared commitment to advancing our common priorities as treaty allies and close partners amidst evolving regional and global security challenges.\nThe joint statement we will issue today, and the various areas it covers, demonstrates the breadth and depth of our bilateral relationship.\u00a0 We have reached a number of key understandings that the Philippines believes will truly elevate our relationship and translate into direct, substantial, and tangible benefits for our peoples and countries.\nAt today\u2019s meeting, we redoubled our commitment to modernizing the Philippine-U.S. alliance, recognizing that our partnership will need to play a stronger role in preserving an international law-based international order.\u00a0 This means ensuring the conduct of high-level and high-impact, high-value joint exercises, trainings, and other related activities.\u00a0 We especially welcome the United States pledge to fast-track and to ramp up support for the modernization of our defense, civilian law enforcement, and humanitarian assistance and disaster response capabilities, especially in the maritime domain, as well as the implementation of EDCA projects and investments in and around EDCA-agreed locations.\nI wish to point out that we also underscored the importance of equally ensuring that our modern alliance not only serves as an instrument as peace, but it shall also be a force for good that brings about sustained economic benefits to our two countries, down to our local communities.\nOur discussions and proposed ways forwards are aligned with the Philippines\u2019 priorities on agriculture, food security, promoting energy security as we transition to clean energy, boosting trade, and building resilience of our supply chains, as well as enhancing connectivity and digitalization.\u00a0 Our discussions focused also on areas such as economic cooperation, climate change, renewable energy, economic resilience, and economic security.\nThank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Manalo, and Secretary Galvez, I\u2019m honored to be here with you today for the third U.S.-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue.\u00a0 As you\u2019ve heard, this is the first of its kind in seven years.\nBut first, let me just say a few words about the story that I know many of you are tracking.\u00a0 I was first briefed on the reports of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and classified material on the morning of April 6th.\u00a0 And since then, I have been convening senior department leaders daily on our response, and I have directed an urgent cross-department effort.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve referred the matter to the Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal investigation.\u00a0 Now, I can\u2019t say much more while the Justice Department\u2019s investigation is ongoing, but we take this very seriously.\u00a0 And we will continue to work closely with our outstanding allies and partners, and nothing will ever stop us from keeping America secure.\nNow, let me turn to today\u2019s important discussions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come together at an historic moment in our alliance.\u00a0 For more than seven decades, the U.S. and Philippine forces have trained and fought alongside each other.\u00a0 And today we\u2019re building on those bonds to bring greater security, stability, and prosperity to the Indo-Pacific for the next 70 years and beyond.\u00a0 The commitments that we made today will spur even deeper cooperation to help ensure that we\u2019re poised to tackle the defining challenges of our time \u2013 together.\nWe all reaffirmed today that our Mutual Defense Treaty remains the bedrock of our cooperation.\u00a0 As Secretary Blinken and I have said clearly and repeatedly, the Mutual Defense Treaty applies to armed attacks on either of our armed forces, our aircraft, or public vessels \u2013 including our Coast Guard \u2013 anywhere in the South China Sea.\nAnd so today we built on our work together during my recent visit to Manila and discussed plans to operationalize the four new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement locations in Palawan and northern Luzon.\u00a0 These sites will support combined training exercises and interoperability between our forces to ensure that we\u2019re even better prepared for future crises.\nWe\u2019re proud of the investments we\u2019re making, and by the end of FY \u201923 we expect to have allocated more than $100 million in infrastructure investments at the new and existing EDCA sites.\u00a0 So those investments will spur job creation and economic growth in local Philippine communities.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also committed to swiftly finalizing the U.S.\u2013 Philippines bilateral defense guidelines, which charts our vision for alliance cooperation across all operational domains, including space and cyberspace.\nIn the face of coercion and gray zone aggression, Secretary Galvez and I agreed to redouble our efforts to strengthen our combined ability to resist armed attack by modernizing our armed forces.\u00a0 We also discussed near-term plans to complete a security sector assistance roadmap to support the delivery of priority defense platforms over the next five to ten years, including radars, unmanned aerial systems, military transport aircraft, and coastal and air defense systems.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on the some 500 defense engagements that our militaries conduct each year, and we\u2019re forging new ties between our militaries and expanding the breadth of our cooperation.\nYesterday, we celebrated the start of our 38th annual Exercise Balikatan.\u00a0 More than 17,000 troops are participating this year.\u00a0 It is the largest and most complex iteration in the exercise\u2019s history.\u00a0 Now the commitments that we made today will further integrate our strong bilateral ties into multilateral networks, including with Japan and Australia, and we discussed plans to conduct combined maritime activities with likeminded partners in the South China Sea later this year as we work to enhance our collective deterrence.\nOur alliance is ultimately guided by our deep and enduring commitment to freedom.\u00a0 So we\u2019re not just allies, we\u2019re democratic allies, and the United States and the Philippines are bound by a common vision for the future \u2013 a vision that\u2019s anchored in the rule of law and freedom of the seas and respect for the territorial integrity of sovereign states.\nAnd Secretary Galvez, Secretary Manalo, and Secretary Blinken, thank you for your leadership and your steadfast partnership as we build this future together.\nSecretary Galvez, the floor is yours, sir.\nOFFICER IN CHARGE GALVEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Foremost, my highest courtesies to the Secretary Antony J. Blinken and Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, to my most esteemed colleague Secretary Enrique Manalo.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\nFirst of all, we would like to take this moment to express our profoundest thanks to the U.S.\u00a0 We are grateful to the U.S. Government and the American people for their kind assistance in our current environmental sea disaster in containing the oil spill in Oriental Mindoro.\u00a0 Upon our request for assistance, the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Embassy, and the U.S. Navy manifested their unwavering support to its deployment of the Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, as well as the technical support provided by the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to help contain an oil spill.\nThe timely and efficient response of our allies in providing the technical and material support, amounting to more than $20 million U.S., was very instrumental in mitigating the impact of this environmental disaster on our coastal communities that may affect millions of Filipino people.\u00a0 The aid and cooperation demonstrates the strength of the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance, and we are very proud to be partner of the United States.\u00a0 And your commitment to assisting us in this time of need has reinforced the band of friendship and mutual trust between our nations.\u00a0 We will not forget.\nAs to vaccine, sir, I would like also to \u2013 like to reiterate our appreciation for the 3.6 million vaccine doses donated by the U.S. Government to the Philippines, which save millions of Filipino lives and help our economy to recover.\nToday, we have just concluded the third 2+2 ministerial meeting between the Philippines and the United States.\u00a0 And I am pleased to announce that it had been a most productive meeting, which expanded to even to economic security.\u00a0 The last time the 2+2 ministerial consultation were convened was in January 2016.\u00a0 The fact that we are able to convene once again highlights the continued importance and relevance of our partnership and the need for continued dialogue and cooperation on matters of mutual interest.\nIt is also noteworthy that this is the first time the meeting will be convened under the Marcos administration, which highlights the Philippine Government\u2019s commitment to strengthening our alliance with the United States.\u00a0 Our meeting today will set the direction that we would like to be the Philippine-U.S. alliance to take in consideration of our present-day realities and common security challenges.\nAlong this line, I wish to emphasize the strength and credibility of the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance, which is founded on a shared commitment to regional peace, stability, and security.\u00a0 Our partnership has weathered many challenges in the past and continues to stand strong today.\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to the Mutual Defense Treaty, which is our cornerstone of our partnership.\nOur defense establishments recognize the need to work together to enhance our interoperability, increase our defense capacity, and build our resilience against emerging challenges.\u00a0 To this end, we agreed to explore new areas of cooperation and deepen our existing partnership in key areas such as mutual defense, maritime security, and information/intelligence sharing, and joint sails and solidarity patrols.\nWe also welcomed the ongoing conduct of the biggest ever Exercise Balikatan, which involved 17,000 forces \u2013 12,000 U.S. personnel, 5,000 AFP personnel, and 111 Australian defense forces and observers from other likeminded countries, which capacitates our armed forces to train and operate together, improve interoperability, and enhance our respective capabilities.\nWith the announcement of the four additional sites where Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement agreed locations can be developed, and we reaffirm our commitment to work together in implementing the EDCA through the completion of both existing and potential projects.\nLastly, we discussed opportunities for future cooperation with likeminded partners in the region.\u00a0 We recognize that we cannot address such a wide range of security challenges and that we need to work with other countries who share our interest in accordance with our respective national laws and policies.\u00a0 We affirm the commitment to sustain regular exchanges through existing platforms, namely the 2+2 ministerial consultations, Bilateral Strategic Dialogue, the Mutual Defense Board, Security Engagement Board, and among others.\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize that the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance is strong and credible, and we are committed to modernizing our alliance to meet the evolving security challenges of the region.\u00a0 This alliance is for peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take three questions.\u00a0 First we\u2019ll go to Demetri Sevastopulo with\u00a0The Financial Times.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 I have questions for both sides.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, can you give us a sense of what kinds and numbers of military assets and personnel that you intend to position or rotate through the EDCA sites in the Philippines?\u00a0 And can you explain how specifically does this enhanced cooperation increase your ability to prepare for any possible conflict with China over Taiwan?\nAnd to Secretaries Manalo and Galvez, how will the EDCA sites be used if the U.S. and China go to war over Taiwan?\u00a0 And will there be any restrictions on what the U.S. military can do with the sites?\nAnd finally, Secretary Blinken, this is a China question.\u00a0 Your relations with China appear to be deteriorating continuously with only sporadic signs of positive developments.\u00a0 Is this the long-term future of U.S. relations with China, or is there some kind of a realistic way to turn things around?\u00a0 And when do you expect to go to Beijing?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, thanks for your question, Demetri.\u00a0 EDCA is a key pillar to our alliance.\u00a0 It provides us the opportunity to train together, to increase interoperability.\u00a0 And you know, Demetri, interoperability is not something that you can show up at the last moment and snap your figures and achieve.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that you\u2019ve got to work on each and every day.\u00a0 And so the addition of these EDCA sites puts us in a position to be able to not only train together but also respond to meet the needs of the Philippines in the event of a crisis like a natural disaster or a requirement to rapidly provide humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 And so I think it helps us not only work together, but it helps us address the needs of the Philippines as well.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s essential to our ability to strengthen our combined deterrence posture.\nI think it\u2019s a bit early to try to discuss numbers and specific timing of rotations, but certainly these are things that Secretary Galvez and I will continue to work on going forward.\u00a0 But again, it is a tremendous opportunity.\nI would finally emphasize that whatever we do in the future in terms of rotations and numbers of troops, it is a joint decision between the Philippines and \u2013 the Philippine Government and the U.S. Government.\u00a0 So again, a great opportunity.\u00a0 I\u2019m excited about the ability to increase interoperability and look forward to continuing our great work together.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0 Thank you very much for your question.\u00a0 What I can say at this stage is that the new sites that have been identified, the new EDCA sites, are mainly aimed at increasing or improving interoperability as well as addressing potential human, humanitarian disasters or climate-related disasters.\nAnd in operationalizing these sites, of course, much work still has to be done.\u00a0 We have to identify the terms and references, how these activities will be undertaken.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really at any stage yet to answer how they might be used.\u00a0 They\u2019re still open to discussion.\u00a0 But I think we have already reached an understanding that the basic elements of these sites would be, the basic purposes of these sites would be to address humanitarian disaster-related events, to increase and improve interoperability and training of Filipino and American assets, and also to be in a position to improve the interoperability and perhaps respond to other types of security challenges.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Demetri, with regard to China, you\u2019ve heard me say before, Secretary Austin and others say before, that the relationship between our countries is among the most consequential and also the most complex of any that we have, and the same could probably be said for many other countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re not reducing it to a bumper sticker, as \u2013 again \u2013 I\u2019ve said before.\u00a0 It has different aspects to it: certainly competitive, cooperative in other respects, and in some instances more adversarial.\nWhat we\u2019ve been working to do, first of all, is to make sure that when it comes to our own strategy and our own approach we\u2019re following through on it, making investments in ourselves and our strength at home.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that, aligning increasingly with partners around the world, whether that\u2019s in Europe and Asia, and we\u2019ve done that with greater convergence than I\u2019ve seen at any time with key partners on the approach to some of the challenges posed by China, and putting those assets together so that we\u2019re competing very vigorously in upholding our interests, upholding our values, and building our vision for the future.\nWhat I hear from countries around the world and what I believe is profoundly in our interest is for us to manage the relationship with China responsibly.\u00a0 And our goal is peace, security, stability, and creating opportunity.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to engage in a new cold war.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to contain China.\u00a0 But in doing that, in trying to advance a world that is peaceful, secure, stable, and with more opportunity, we\u2019re going to stand up very vigorously for our values and for our interests, and we\u2019re doing that with regard to China.\nWe\u2019re also prepared to work cooperatively with China where it\u2019s in our interest and their interest and, I believe, in the interests of the world.\u00a0 And there are a number of issues that we\u2019ve laid out \u2013 transnational challenges that no one country can solve alone where it would benefit all of us and benefit the world for us to find ways to work together.\nThrough all of this, it\u2019s, I believe, important to maintain channels of communication to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to each other clearly, and we\u2019ve certainly continued to do that even through what\u2019s been a challenging period in our relationship.\u00a0 I think as our two presidents agreed when they met in Bali at the end of last year at the G20, it would be important to continue to find ways to strengthen those channels of communication.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We look to do that in the time ahead.\nAnd when it comes to my own visit to China, when the conditions are right I\u2019ll certainly look forward to pursuing that.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, you just said that you first learned about the leaked documents on the 6th of April.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been online for months.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t U.S. intelligence, the rest of U.S. Government, see those leaked documents online for all those months?\u00a0 Is that an intelligence failure?\nAnd I\u2019d like to ask Secretary Blinken that same issue, as well as your conversations with Foreign Minister Kuleba of Ukraine.\u00a0 We have seen documents that indicate that Ukraine has crossed \u2013 with Ukrainian agents working for the government have launched drone attacks in Russia and in Belarus, contrary to commitments that they would not do that.\u00a0 Are you concerned that this would \u2013 will \u2013 undermine Western support for Ukraine?\u00a0 And can you talk about the overall damage that these leaks have caused to our reputation for handling intelligence with our closest allies?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, do you have concerns about sharing intelligence with the United States given the fact that these leaked documents were online for so many months?\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Thanks, Andrea.\u00a0 The documents that we are aware of are dated the 28th of February and 1st of March.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if there are other documents that are \u2013 that have been online before.\u00a0 These are things that we will find, find out as we continue to investigate.\u00a0 But the documents that we are focused on\u00a0thus far \u2013 28th of February and the 1st of March.\u00a0 Again, we will continue to investigate and try to determine the full scope of the activity.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But, sir, why did we know about it and why didn\u2019t you know about it before April 6th?\u00a0 That means that they were up for at least many weeks, months, before U.S. intelligence knew that they were in the public domain.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, they were somewhere in the web, and where exactly and who had access at that point we don\u2019t know.\u00a0 We simply don\u2019t know at this point.\u00a0 So \u2013 and again, I won\u2019t speculate, Andrea.\u00a0 I will tell you that we take this very seriously and we will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Andrea, my \u2013 I don\u2019t have much to add beyond what the Secretary said.\u00a0 Let me just say with regard to, broadly, allies and partners and these documents, we have engaged with allies and partners at high levels over the past \u2013 the past days, including to reassure them about our own commitment to safeguarding intelligence and, of course, our commitment to our security partnerships.\nWith regard to Ukraine itself, I did speak to Foreign Minister Kuleba today, and in speaking to him, among other things, I reaffirmed our enduring support for Ukraine and for its efforts to defend its territorial integrity, its sovereignty, its independence; reaffirmed the extraordinary support that we have provided to Ukraine along with dozens of other countries over the last year to help it defend itself, support that will be ongoing and indeed, as you\u2019ve seen just as recently this week, additional support that was provided.\nI\u2019m not going to comment on specific actions that Ukraine takes when it comes to defending its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, but we are determined to assist Ukraine in the efforts that it\u2019s making to regain the territory that\u2019s been seized from it, and I reaffirmed that commitment today in speaking to Foreign Minister Kuleba.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Are you concerned about cross-border attacks?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, I\u2019m not going to speak directly to any particular actions, and I\u2019m certainly not going to comment on these purported documents.\u00a0 But Ukraine has to make decisions about how it can most effectively defend itself against Russian aggression and take back the territory that\u2019s been seized from it.\u00a0 We give our advice as appropriate, we provide the support; that is well-known.\u00a0 But Ukraine makes the decisions about how it actually prosecutes the effort to regain its territory.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Oh.\u00a0 First let me also share the view of Secretary Blinken that we are very confident after \u2013 especially after today\u2019s meeting of the commitment to our alliance and our partnership.\u00a0 And I really don\u2019t want to jump to any speculation or jump to any conclusions at this stage.\u00a0 We have full confidence in the investigation that will be undertaken.\u00a0 And certainly we would have to wait for the results before we can even comment.\nBut just let me say that we are confident of the strength of our relationship and our growing partnership.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Will Mauldin of\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 First for Undersecretary Galvez, the mentioned exercise is going to take place later this year in the South China Sea.\u00a0 I wonder what countries would be involved in those exercises and whether there are any concerns that these exercises or the ongoing ones or different steps that the U.S. is taking with its allies and partners in the region would generate a response \u2013 a dangerous response from China.\nFor Secretary Austin, I wanted to ask:\u00a0 Irregardless of where the investigation into the documents take us or the veracity of the documents, they\u2019re posted online and definitely seen by the Russians as well as the Ukrainians.\u00a0 I wonder to what degree this will affect the tactics of the expected Ukrainian offensive this spring or summer.\u00a0 How \u2013 to what degree will their tactics need to change?\u00a0 To what degree will you recommend changes in those tactics?\nFinally, for Secretary Blinken, I wanted to ask about my good friend and colleague Evan Gershkovich.\u00a0 You found him wrongfully detained, and so I wanted to ask when your staff will be able to get consular access to him in Russia.\u00a0 What\u2019s taking so long there?\u00a0 And will there be any leverage that you can exert?\u00a0 Is there any leverage that you can exert to get Russia to provide that access and what strategies will you work on and will the administration be working on to free him?\nThank you.\nOFFICER IN CHARGE GALVEZ:\u00a0 The Balikatan exercise \u2013 this is its 38th activation, and it\u2019s been \u2013 we are doing the Balikatan yearly.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t expect any violent reaction considering that this exercise is intended for our collective defense with the U.S. and other allies.\nFor today, for this Balikatan, we have the participation of, as I have said earlier, 17,000 troops, including 12,000 Americans, 5,000 Filipinos, and 111 Australians.\u00a0 We have also observers from the ASEAN nations and also from other allies, and we are happy to say that\u00a0these exercises are varied exercises on counterterrorism, humanitarian response, and also on developing interoperability with our U.S. forces and also our Australian friends.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0Hey Will, thanks for the question.\u00a0 I just spoke with my counterpart in Ukraine today, Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.\u00a0 And we talked about a number of issues, but \u2013 as we typically do.\u00a0 But he and the leadership remain focused on the task at hand.\u00a0 And I have every confidence that they will do what good leaders, great leaders do:\u00a0 They will fight the enemy and not be driven by a specific plan.\u00a0 They have a great plan to start and \u2013 but only President Zelenskyy and his leadership really know the full details of that plan.\nSo they have much of the capability that they need to continue to be successful.\u00a0 We\u2019ve trained an enormous number of troops.\u00a0 We have provided a substantial number of platforms.\u00a0 And so I think he feels that he\u2019s in a \u2013 they\u2019re in a pretty good position.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll stay focused on continuing to generate security assistance capability so that they can continue to be successful whenever they choose to take up offensive operations.\nAnd again, sustainment will be there throughout.\u00a0 We\u2019ll stay connected with our allies and partners.\u00a0 We next meet for our next round of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on the 21st, and I look forward to seeing him and the rest of our colleagues at that meeting.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And Will, as to your question regarding Evan, yes, I made the determination yesterday that he is being wrongfully detained by Russia.\nPresident Biden had an opportunity to speak to his family today, I believe.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken to your colleagues, including leadership at\u00a0The Wall Street Journal, multiple times about Evan\u2019s situation.\u00a0 When I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov about a week ago now, just after Evan was detained, I of course pressed for his immediate release, but I also pressed for immediate consular access to him.\u00a0 The fact that Russia has not granted that access puts it once again in violation of international commitments it\u2019s made, commitments that are at the heart of diplomatic relations between countries and the ability of our citizens as well to be able to safely be present in other countries.\nI think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access \u2013 never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes \u2013 is going to do even more damage to Russia\u2019s standing around the world, a standing that has been in freefall particularly since its reinvasion of Ukraine last year.\nAnd I think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there lest they be arbitrarily detained, and in the context of being arbitrarily detained not even having access for the diplomats who are there to look out for their interests and who, as a matter of solemn international obligations that Russia has undertaken, should be allowed that access.\nI\u2019m not going to get into what measures, steps we\u2019re taking or might take to do that.\u00a0 I can simply tell you that we are engaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan\u2019s release.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, your Excellencies.\n\n",

		"audience": "NATO Headquarters",
		"location": "Brussels, Belgium",
		"date": "April 5, 2023",
		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s always good to be back in Belgium, in Brussels, at the NATO Headquarters, which has become almost a home away from home.\u00a0 But this week, these last two days, this has genuinely been a historic NATO meeting.\nYesterday, on the 74th anniversary of the Alliance, I accepted Finland\u2019s membership documents to join NATO.\u00a0 Finland is now our 31st Ally.\u00a0 With this step, Finland is safer; NATO is stronger.\u00a0 We look forward to welcoming Sweden to NATO in the near future.\u00a0 Like Finland, it\u2019s militarily capable.\u00a0 It\u2019s a strong democracy, fully dedicated to upholding the commitments and values that underpin our Alliance, including Article 5.\nAt the NATO leaders summit last summer, the NATO Allies agreed on a new strategy for the first time in a decade.\u00a0 Since then, including at this ministerial, we\u2019ve been working to implement that strategy, making our Alliance stronger, more resilient, better positioned for the future.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on the Wales defense investment pledge to invest 2 percent of our GDP in defense.\u00a0 It is critical that we have the means to replenish stockpiles, to increase the readiness of our forces, to meet force generation commitments for NATO missions and operations, to keep pace with 21st century challenges.\nWe\u2019re developing new partnerships, including in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 At this ministerial, we welcomed the participation of Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, who share our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region but also recognize that many of the challenges that we face are interconnected and global in nature.\nAnd of course, the Alliance remains relentlessly focused on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 The NATO-Ukraine Commission met for the first time in five years, with Foreign Minister Kuleba\u2019s participation, to talk about ways that we can continue to help Ukraine in the weeks, the months, and indeed the years ahead.\nWhen the NATO foreign ministers last convened back in November of last year, President Putin was pursuing his new strategy to win his brutal war against Ukraine.\u00a0 Having suffered devastating setbacks on the battlefield, he tried to bomb and freeze Ukraine\u2019s civilian population into submission.\u00a0 He accelerated his campaign to weaponize energy against Ukraine\u2019s European partners so that they would decide that the cost of supporting the country were too high.\u00a0 And he continued to try to raise food and energy prices in some of the poorest countries in the world to manufacture a false choice between supporting Ukraine and making ends meet for their people.\nPresident Putin has failed.\u00a0 Thanks to the remarkable courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people and unprecedented support from Ukraine\u2019s partners, Ukraine endures.\u00a0 More than 50 countries have been providing security assistance.\u00a0 Dozens of countries jumped in to help Ukraine defend and repair its energy grid in the face of Russia\u2019s onslaught.\u00a0 We sustained and increased the pressure on Russia with unprecedented sanctions and export controls, which are having a dramatic and growing impact.\u00a0 The Kremlin\u2019s usable financial reserves are plummeting.\u00a0 Its budget revenues from oil and gas have been cut in half since last year.\u00a0 Hundreds, even more than a thousand, companies have fled the country and aren\u2019t coming back.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands of young people have fled Russia \u2013 literally Russia\u2019s future.\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated again our unity of purpose and our unity of action.\u00a0 And after this ministerial, I am confident that that will endure for as long as it takes for Ukraine to defend its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, its independence.\nYesterday, the United States announced our 35th drawdown of arms and equipment.\u00a0 That includes more ammunition for HIMARS, air defense interceptors and artillery rounds, as well as antiarmor systems, small arms, heavy equipment transport vehicles, and maintenance support.\u00a0 These contributions will continue to enable Ukraine to protect civilian infrastructure from missile and drone attacks and to hold and retake Ukraine\u2019s territory.\nThe United States and Ukraine\u2019s partners support meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve a peace, but not just any kind of peace.\u00a0 It has to be a just peace that upholds the principles of the UN Charter \u2013 sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence \u2013 and it has to be an durable peace that ensures that Russia can\u2019t simply rest and refit its troops and then relaunch the war at a time of its choosing.\u00a0 That\u2019s the kind of peace, a just and durable one, that 141 countries at the United Nations General Assembly endorsed just a few weeks ago.\nUntil that peace is achieved, the United States, together with allies and partners from around the world, will continue to provide the assistance that Ukraine needs to defend its territory and defend its people.\nThe story of NATO over the last year has been one of unity and resolve.\u00a0 Amid new challenges to our values, to a rules-based order, to our collective security, our Alliance has emerged stronger than ever and now larger than ever.\u00a0 As we prepare for Vilnius and beyond, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to meet the challenges of this moment and the time to come.\nSo with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Vivian Salama with\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Vivian.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I want to ask you about my colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who as of today has been detained in Russia for the last year \u2013 for the last week, sorry.\u00a0 Do you \u2013 it feels like a year.\u00a0 Do you anticipate that you will approve a designation of wrongfully detained for Evan, or do you need to wait however long it will take for the Russians to agree to grant him consular access for that to even happen?\nAnd secondly, prisoner swaps have occurred in recent years to bring a number of detained Americans home.\u00a0 Is there anyone that the Russians want or would be willing to exchange either for Evan or for Paul Whelan, who is also being held on espionage charges?\u00a0 And more broadly, are you concerned that there is a precedent being set now by our adversaries who are detaining Americans in the hope that maybe they would be some sort of prisoner swap in return?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks very much, Vivian. \u00a0First \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard me say this before \u2013 from my perspective, from the department\u2019s perspective, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of American citizens around the world, and that includes those who may be wrongfully detained, held hostage, otherwise kept from coming home, being with their families.\nIn Evan\u2019s case, we are working through the determination on wrongful detention, and there\u2019s a process to do that and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working through very deliberately but expeditiously as well.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll let that process play out.\u00a0 In my own mind, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s being wrongfully detained by Russia, which is exactly what I said to Foreign Minister Lavrov when I spoke to him over the weekend and insisted that Evan be released immediately.\u00a0 But I want to make sure that \u2013 as always, because there is a formal process \u2013 that we go through it, and we will, and I expect that to be completed soon.\nMore broadly, when it comes, first of all, to Paul Whelan, as I\u2019ve also said, there\u2019s a proposal on the table that\u2019s been on the table for some months.\u00a0 Again, with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I reiterated that Russia should move on that proposal so that we can bring Paul home.\u00a0 In any of these instances, there is a balance to be done between trying to bring home people who are being unjustly detained in one way or another and what it takes to do that.\u00a0 I believe that, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past and as a result as well of legislation that we have and other tools that we have, that even as we engage in efforts to bring people home, we can also increase the pressure and increase the penalties on those who would engage in the practice of unlawful, arbitrary detention of American citizens.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing, including, for example, implementing the Robert Levinson Act and other tools that we have.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Vitaliy Syzov with Freedom TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I have one question.\u00a0 Yesterday, after meeting with you, minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine said that he want to see some proposal from NATO during the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 Today, minister of foreign affairs of Estonia said that Ukraine should be provided with a roadmap of accession to NATO.\u00a0 What are your thoughts about this process?\u00a0 Each proposal could expect to get Ukraine during Vilnius Summit.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Our focus right now is relentlessly on doing what needs to be done to help Ukraine defend itself against the Russian aggression and, indeed, to put it in a \u2013 help put it in a position to retake more of the territory that\u2019s been seized from it by Russia.\u00a0 That\u2019s our intense focus.\nWe\u2019re also looking at what we can do over a longer period of time to build up Ukraine\u2019s capacity to deter aggression, to defend against aggression, and, if necessary again in the future, to defeat aggression.\u00a0 And a big part of that is bringing Ukraine up to NATO standards and to NATO interoperability.\u00a0 And I suspect that you\u2019ll see that focus continue at the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the summit, but we are very focused on these very practical steps that can be taken and need to continue to be taken to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards.\nOf course, NATO\u2019s door remain open \u2013 remains open.\u00a0 There\u2019s no change in that, but we have to be in this moment focused intensely on the weeks and months ahead, particularly as Ukraine prepares for a counteroffensive, again, to try to retake more of its territory, as well as work that needs to be done to continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards and NATO interoperability.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Kylie Atwood with CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Hi, Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you for doing this.\u00a0 It was a momentous week here, but there\u2019s a lot going on at home, so I have a few questions for you.\u00a0 Bear with me.\u00a0 In terms of what happened here, obviously, you said that NATO has become stronger this week with Finland joining, but how tangibly will Ukraine benefit from Finland joining NATO?\nAnd then my second two questions have to do with what is happening at home.\u00a0 First, President Tsai of Taiwan is meeting with Speaker McCarthy today in California.\u00a0 Do you support this meeting at this time?\u00a0 And how concerned are you about China already vowing that it will retaliate?\nAnd then my second question has to do with politics at home.\u00a0 Yesterday, the world watched as former President Trump was arrested.\u00a0 He\u2019s now the first current or former president to face criminal charges, and he\u2019s running for re-election to be president.\u00a0 Have any of your allies asked you about this while you\u2019ve been here at NATO?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your response to revive concerns among Allies that many of us have heard about the long-term reliability of the United States given the polarized nature of politics at home?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Kylie, last question first.\u00a0 As you know well, I don\u2019t do politics.\u00a0 I can tell you, though, that the question you raised about the proceedings in New York actually did not come up in my conversations with NATO colleagues, nor did I get questions about the durability of our approach.\u00a0 I think people are very focused on what we\u2019re actually doing, and what we\u2019re doing is a lot, including what I just went through in terms of the outcomes from this ministerial, the preparations for the leaders summit in Vilnius, the intense focus on everything we\u2019re doing to support Ukraine, to implement the new Strategic Concept for NATO.\u00a0 That\u2019s what everyone was talking about and focused on, and also, as I mentioned, the fact that we have the growing engagement between NATO and other partners, to include our partners from the Indo-Pacific, to include the European Union \u2013 its high representative was here as well today.\u00a0 That was the entirety of the conversation and our focus.\nIn terms of Finland\u2019s membership in NATO and Ukraine, look, in the first instance, irrespective of the \u2013 of that question, as I\u2019ve detailed at some length, a big focus of our meetings here over the last day and a half was on Ukraine and the support that virtually every NATO member is providing individually, as well as the support that NATO institutionally is providing, both in the immediate and also looking toward the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 I mentioned a moment ago work that the Alliance looks to do to help continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards, NATO interoperability, and I think that\u2019s something you\u2019ll see featured at the at the leaders summit.\nFinland\u2019s membership in NATO does two things.\u00a0 It, as I\u2019ve said, makes Finland safer because one of the things that resulted from Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was deep and growing concern among a number of countries that they could be next, and that created what I think is truly historic sea change in both Finland and Sweden, seeking membership in NATO, and thus seeking to benefit from its Article 5 guarantees.\u00a0 So Finland now benefits in that, but Finland also makes the Alliance as a whole stronger, and that\u2019s important in and of itself.\u00a0 I think it may have some additional benefits in the sense that, to the extent Russia thinks about expanding or broadening its aggression, the deterrent that NATO poses to that has now become even stronger.\nNATO is a defensive Alliance; it\u2019s not seeking to engage in conflict with Russia.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a defensive Alliance that has to have a strong deterrent, precisely because we want to make sure that countries think twice, think three times, and then don\u2019t engage in aggression.\u00a0 And I think Finland will \u2013 its membership in the Alliance adds to NATO\u2019s deterrence strength and, if necessary, its defensive strength.\nWith regard to President Tsai\u2019s transit of the United States, I think the first thing to emphasize is that these transits by high-level Taiwanese authorities are nothing new.\u00a0 They\u2019re private, they\u2019re unofficial, but they\u2019ve been going on for years, and President Tsai and her predecessors have done the same thing.\u00a0 In fact, every Taiwan president has transited the United States at one point or another.\u00a0 The meetings, the engagements that the president has also are very much in line with precedent.\u00a0 And similarly, our own approach to Taiwan has remained very consistent and unchanged, including our adherence to the \u201cone China\u201d policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Communiques, the Six Assurances, our opposition to any unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying that, given that, Beijing should not use the transits as an excuse to take any actions to ratchet up tensions, to further push at changing the status quo.\u00a0 And our objective remains the same: to have peace, to have stability across the Taiwan Strait, and to ensure that any differences that exist between mainland and Taiwan are resolved peacefully.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Rikhard Husu with \u2013 from YLE.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for taking my question.\u00a0 A follow-up on Finland:\u00a0 How do you see that Finland will strengthen the Alliance?\u00a0 And do you see that this decision to join can also strengthen the ties, bilateral ties between the U.S. and Finland, for instance in regard to a future defense cooperation agreement?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much.\u00a0 Well, the bilateral ties between the United States and Finland are already extraordinarily strong.\u00a0 But I think Finland\u2019s membership in the Alliance can, if it does anything, will only strengthen those ties, as well as Finland\u2019s ties to all the other members of NATO.\u00a0 But as I said before, what Finland brings to this enterprise is a country that has very strong military capacity, and equally important is a strong and vital democracy.\u00a0 And so both in terms of advancing the interests that bring NATO countries together and the values that we share, Finland is a very compelling member of the Alliance.\nAnd I think what\u2019s important, too, is that Finland and the NATO Alliance have been working closely together for years.\u00a0 What membership does now is it makes, in a sense, formal what\u2019s in many ways been the case for a long time, but it also provides Finland with the commitment of every NATO Ally to Finland and its security and its defense as a member of NATO and as a beneficiary of Article 5.\u00a0 But I would anticipate that, across the board, this has the effect of just further strengthening, deepening relationships, not only between the United States and Finland but between Finland and all the other members of NATO.\nWe also have now even more increasing overlap between membership in the European Union and membership in NATO.\u00a0 And that too has the effect of creating even greater convergence between the United States and Europe than we\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 In fact, I think in my experience now, doing this for 30 years in one way or another, there is more convergence than there\u2019s ever been between the United States and Europe on the big challenges and questions of our time \u2013 dealing with the Russian aggression against Ukraine; meeting some of the challenges posed by China; looking at new things emerging from cyberspace, emerging technologies and their impact on our security and our interests \u2013 much greater convergence in how we approach each of these challenges than we\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0 And I think Finland\u2019s membership in NATO is just one more expression of that, but it really is across the board, and it\u2019s something that, from my perspective, puts us collectively in a much stronger position to deal effectively with all of these challenges.\nWe started with \u2013 this administration started with the basic proposition that American engagement, American leadership is important.\u00a0 It makes a difference because in its absence, some else may try to fill the gap and maybe not in ways that advance our interests and values, or no one does, and then you\u2019ve got a vacuum that tends to be filled by bad things before it\u2019s filled by good things.\u00a0 But the flip side of that coin, the importance of U.S. engagement, is that for virtually all of the challenges that we\u2019re dealing with, no single country, even the United States, can really effectively address them alone.\u00a0 We\u2019re much better off when we\u2019re doing it in partnership, in alliance with other countries, and where we adopt a similar approach.\nThat\u2019s been the story of these last two and a half years: the strengthening of our alliances; creating new partnerships to deal with some of these new challenges, fit for particular purposes; and, fundamentally, a much greater convergence than there\u2019s ever been \u2013 between the United States and Europe, between the United States and Asia, Asia and Europe \u2013 on what we need to do to effectively deal with these challenges.\u00a0 And this ministerial just confirms that trend, confirms that convergence.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

It\u2019s a pleasure to be with Foreign Minister Mahuta and to have an opportunity here at NATO to talk about our strong and vital partnership in the Indo-Pacific and in fact around the world. I think New Zealand\u2019s presence is further evidence of the fact that there\u2019s a recognition among European partners, Indo-Pacific partners, that so many of the issues that we have to tackle are global in nature and are interconnected. I\u2019m looking very much forward to the conversation we\u2019re going to have in a short while with all of our allies and partners from (inaudible) to the Indo-Pacific.\nSo welcome, very good to have you. I should also say that the terrible extreme weather event that New Zealand recently experienced in February that took a dozen or so lives, I know affected many, many people, many communities. We were pleased to be able to be of some support, especially through the work of USAID, and we share our thoughts and condolences to those who were victimized by that event.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MAHUTA: Thank you very much for the message of condolences and sympathy in relation to Cyclone Gabrielle. I think you and I both agree that there is a huge challenge in relation to climate change \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MAHUTA: \u2014 that we have to respond to and that is significant in terms of how the Pacific sees this challenge ahead of us.\nNew Zealand is really pleased to be here at this NATO meeting to continue to reinforce that we will remain committed to significant geostrategic challenges in this part of the world that have a consequence in our part of the world as well.

		"audience": "European Council Building",
		"location": " Brussels, Belgium ",
		"date": "April 4, 2023",
		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0High Representative Borrell, Josep, thank you. Thank you for bringing us together today and for continuing an ongoing discussion, an ongoing action that we\u2019ve had with the United States and the European Union on an issue that\u2019s critical in the lives of all of our fellow citizens. I\u2019m very much looking forward to pursuing the discussion we actually began earlier this morning. It\u2019s great to be joined, Tobias, by you, Commissioner Simson, our Deputy Secretary of Energy Dave Turk. Very good to be with everyone this morning.\nWhen this council met on February 7th, 2022, Russia was on the verge of invading Ukraine. Europe was on the verge of an energy crisis. President Putin bet that his threat of stopping gas supplies would deter Europe and the world from standing up to his aggression against Ukraine. He was wrong.\nHe then doubled down \u2013 stopping natural gas supplies to many European countries, dramatically reducing flows to others, forcing record-high prices on millions in Europe and around the world. He sought to wipe out Ukraine\u2019s critical energy infrastructure \u2013 damaging or destroying 50 percent of Ukraine\u2019s grid, leaving millions without reliable power and heat.\nAnd again \u2013 he failed. Ukraine stands \u2013 and stands strong. Europe stands \u2013 and stands strong. The world is reducing its dependence on Russian energy, accelerating the transition to the green economy.\nThis is possible, in no small part, because of the partnership between the United States and the European Union.\nThe U.S.-EU Energy Council has worked as never before to help make Europe more energy secure. The United States has more than doubled our supply of natural gas to the continent \u2013 exporting 56 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas last year. Because of these and other efforts, Russia\u2019s natural gas only accounted for about 16 percent of the EU\u2019s natural gas imports by the end of 2022 \u2013 compared to 37 percent in March of 2022. And as I mentioned, our supplies went up more than twofold \u2013 over 140 percent increase between 2021 and 2022.\nThe EU\u2019s leadership has been vital in this shift \u2013 for example, with its Save the Gas for a Safe Winter program, through which citizens voluntarily lowered their electricity use and used more energy efficient appliances. These and other efforts contributed to a 19 percent reduction in natural gas demand between August of 2022 and January of 2023.\nWe accelerated, as I mentioned, the clean energy transition. The U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security is helping our governments and private sector partners share information to boost energy efficiency and diversify supply, like deploying more heat pumps and smart thermostats.\nHere, too, the European Union has shown remarkable leadership, increasing its goal of energy from renewables from 40 percent to 45 percent by 2030. EU countries added roughly 50 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity last year \u2013 which together generated more electricity than natural gas in 2022.\nLast year, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in American history, and we\u2019re heartened that Europe too is working on ambitious clean energy incentives. Through the Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue, which President Biden and President von der Leyen launched last month, we are working together to make sure that these efforts are mutually reenforcing, so that our incentives create a positive feedback loop of innovation, investment for energy transition, jobs for our people.\nWe also come together to support Ukraine\u2019s energy needs. Together, the EU, the U.S., and our G7+ partners have delivered more than 4,000 power generators, 1,000 transformers, and more than 5 million pieces of equipment, like circuit breakers and cables, to help repair and replace the country\u2019s battered energy grid.\nToday, we\u2019ll talk about ways to continue rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. We\u2019ll also talk about our shared work to deploy new technologies like clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, among other efforts, to advance the energy transition across Europe and the United States.\nThese collective efforts are directly benefiting people on both sides of the Atlantic through more affordable, more reliable energy, good-paying jobs, and a safer, more sustainable future.\nToday\u2019s discussions will bring us one step closer to that future, and like everyone, I\u2019m eager to get the conversation started. So again, Josep, thanks so much for having us here today, and I look forward to our discussions.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nHIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0I\u2019m very happy to welcome you, Secretary Blinken, in Brussels.\u00a0We just had a very good bilateral meeting marking our great transatlantic cooperation.\u00a0Now we will co-chair the EU-U.S. Energy Council, and later we will see each other also at the NATO Ministerial.\nAllow me some words about our bilateral discussion.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, we start discussing and talking about the Russian war in Ukraine, the situation in Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, and the Middle East peace process.\nIt\u2019s more than one year ago that Putin start destroying Ukraine, and he seems determined to continue with his brutal bloodshed and destruction, and he still escalates further despite not achieving anything.\u00a0\u00a0His newest nuclear gamble \u2013 with nuclear weapons moved to Belarus \u2013 constitutes a new escalation and poses a direct threat to European security.\u00a0\u00a0And this comes, ironically, after Chinese President Xi visited Moscow and mentioned the need for peace and they agreed on the need to not deploy nuclear arms abroad.\u00a0\u00a0Some days later, Russia deployed tactical weapons \u2013 nuclear tactical weapons in Belarus.\nWe have been discussing with Secretary Blinken about the role of China on supporting Russia\u2019s blatant violations of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0\u00a0There is a clear expectation from a permanent member of the Security Council to stand up in defense of international rules-based order.\u00a0\u00a0And China has a moral duty to contribute to a fair peace.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot be siding with the aggressor.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot be militarily supporting the aggression.\nThis is our message to China, from today\u2019s meeting and from all the European Union\u2019s visits going to Beijing.\u00a0\u00a0Today, President von der Leyen will be in Beijing with French President Macron, Spanish Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez was there last week, and I will travel next week too.\u00a0\u00a0So, as you see, a lot of Europeans going to China.\nBut we have been clear with China that its position on Russia\u2019s atrocities and war crimes will determine the quality of our relations with Beijing.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, the European Union stands united and our transatlantic community remains also united.\u00a0\u00a0We are committed to continue supporting Ukraine in its self-defense, and we will maintain the collective pressure on Russia to stop the widespread violations of international law.\u00a0\u00a0We are doing everything we can militarily, politically, and providing financial support to ensure that Ukraine prevails.\nWe also talked about the Middle East, and we shared our concerns about the vicious cycle of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territories.\u00a0\u00a0The latest developments painfully demonstrate that the path towards a resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict is urgently needed.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciated the recent U.S. mediation efforts in Aqaba and Sharm el-Sheikh, and I also shared with you, Secretary Blinken, about my efforts together with partners in the Arab world to try to revive peace efforts by building on the Arab Peace Initiative and adding European peace contribution to it.\nWe also discussed about some topics in Africa.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, on Ethiopia, this was a major crisis, and now, fortunately, things start to move towards solving it.\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s one of the rare good news that we have in the world.\u00a0\u00a0And to sustain the current progress, it is important that the EU and U.S. continue working hand-in-hand.\u00a0\u00a0The message to both the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigrayans is to make them understand that we are watching the settling of the conflict and will only normalize our relations in a gradual way, step by step.\nOn Central African Republic, we exchanged views on the ongoing international efforts, including our own efforts, to help to stabilize the country so they did not have to rely on the Wagner mercenaries.\u00a0\u00a0You know that the Wagner mercenaries, this destructive group, has had a negative impact on each country where they are present, be in Central African Republic and others in the Sahelian area, contributing only to further destabilization and impacting negatively in the entire region.\nFinally, we are going to co-chair now the 10th EU-U.S. Energy Council, but this year is different from our previous meetings in Washington, and the past year has been marked by atrocities, war against Ukraine, and the unprecedented EU-U.S. coordination to support the country and to support our energy security in Europe.\u00a0\u00a0We, the European Union and its member-states, are the lead donors when it comes to energy assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0We have been able to get rid of the Russian dependency on gas, and we will discuss today about how to accelerate the green energy transition, reducing methane emissions, and launching a new global energy efficiency initiative.\u00a0\u00a0That also is a good news.\nThank you.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0And let me just start by thanking the High Representative, my friend Josep, for another very productive and timely meeting, building on the momentum that President Biden and European Commission President von der Leyen produced at the White House just last month.\nThis discussion today reinforced what has been evident to us for some time: U.S.-European Union relations have never been stronger or more important for advancing our shared interests.\nAfter more than a year of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, the stakes for our partnership could not be higher \u2013 for the transatlantic relationship; for Ukraine itself; indeed, for people around the world who are bearing many of the consequences of this aggression.\nThe United States and the EU continue to work in lockstep, together with a broad coalition of partners around the world, to ensure that Ukraine can defend itself, its people, its territory, the right to choose its own path.\nEuropean partners have spent about $13 billion in European \u2013 in military assistance thus far, on top of tens of billions more in economic and humanitarian assistance, extraordinary support for refugees who have come from Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0We very much appreciate the announcement from the EU that it will be providing an additional 2 billion in euros worth of ammunition through its European Peace Facility.\nTogether, we\u2019re freezing the assets of those fueling the Kremlin\u2019s aggression, deploying sweeping sanctions and export controls that are degrading Russia\u2019s capacity to wage war.\u00a0\u00a0The Kremlin\u2019s finances have been squeezed to devastating effect, forcing it to choose between pouring money into the war or providing for its own citizens.\u00a0\u00a0As one Russian billionaire starkly said of Russia\u2019s future: \u201cThere will be no money next year.\u201d\nThe United States and the European Union are further working together to defend the energy and food security of millions of people around the world who have been affected by President Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, to press for accountability for Russian atrocities, and to support meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve a just and durable peace.\nJosep and I also discussed the United States and Europe\u2019s unprecedented cooperation on energy security, and indeed, we\u2019ll take that up in more detail in a few minutes.\u00a0\u00a0We share a commitment to preventing a climate catastrophe, accelerating the global clean energy transition, building resilient, secure, and diversified supply chains for renewable energy \u2013 and doing it in a way that creates good-paying jobs and lowers costs for people on both sides of the Atlantic.\nRussia\u2019s weaponization of energy has underscored the urgency of that task \u2013 and an opportunity to accelerate our progress.\u00a0\u00a0And so, over the past year, the United States and Europe have thrown our energy security cooperation into even higher gear.\nIn 2022, the United States exported 56 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe: that is 40 percent of Europe\u2019s total imports; it\u2019s a 140 percent increase over our LNG exports to Europe the previous year.\u00a0\u00a0The European Union cut dependence on Russian gas from nearly 40 percent at the start of the war to about 15 percent by the end of 2022.\u00a0\u00a0That is extraordinary.\u00a0\u00a0When we convene the council in a few minutes, we will focus on how we can further reduce European dependence on Russian energy, and boost the Euro-Atlantic region\u2019s clean energy production.\nWe also spoke about our continued partnership on economic security.\u00a0\u00a0We have serious concerns about the challenges posed by economic coercion, by the weaponization of economic dependencies, and non-market policies and practices, including by the PRC, and we discussed ways to address these issues.\u00a0\u00a0Later this spring, we\u2019ll hold another meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, where these and other priorities will be on the agenda.\nAs Josep mentioned, we also did something of a tour of the world of challenging places and areas where our work together, our coordination, our cooperation can make a difference, from Ethiopia to the Central African Republic to the Middle East.\u00a0\u00a0And in all of these areas, the coordination between the United States and the European Union is as great and, indeed, I would say greater than it\u2019s ever been.\nFinally, running through our conversation was our focus on revitalizing our democracies and our democratic values \u2013 which bind us, and which brought hundreds of partners together just this week around the world and in Washington for the Summit for Democracy.\nThe relationship between the United States and the European Union is the most comprehensive, dynamic relationship in the world, and I\u2019m pleased to be here to continue our work to deliver a stronger and more secure future for people on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThank you very much.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, this is really a moment to just drop the mic and leave because \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 a few things I wanted to share with all of you, but I think the first and most important is this:\u00a0 Moments like this are important.\u00a0 We don\u2019t usually take the time, even half an hour, 45 minutes, to just press pause and reflect on something that we\u2019ve done, because there\u2019s just too much to do.\u00a0 And the inboxes are overflowing, and it\u2019s always move, move, move.\u00a0 But it is important to do that because when we\u2019re at our best, as each of you has been in this extraordinary chapter, it really is worth reflecting on.\u00a0 And I hope that it inspires, energizes, encourages each of us to keep going, to keep doing this, to keep with this calling that has drawn all of us together in this incredible enterprise.\nErin said something that is I think very powerful and it\u2019s that we get called upon to do lots of things in our careers here at State, other agencies.\u00a0 But there\u2019re not that many moments when you can really say and see directly that something you have done has actually changed someone\u2019s life, and changed it for the better.\u00a0 There\u2019s usually too many points of connection along the way to really see it and really feel it, but the experience that each of you has had \u2013 in this instance, I hope really makes that connection, makes it powerful, and is something that you\u2019ll take with you throughout your careers and throughout your lives no matter what you do going forward.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply the most powerful thing that we occasionally have an opportunity to do, and it really is worth reflecting on.\nTressa, my friend, my travel companion, colleague, this is the epitome of the person here who runs into the burning building every single time, no matter how challenging it is, and gets the job done.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen that again and again.\u00a0 I\u2019m so grateful once again to you for your incredible leadership in this instance.\nThe extraordinary team of volunteers \u2013 and that was a hugely important word, volunteers \u2013 that Mike shared with us.\u00a0 That just inspires me tremendously because, again, I\u2019ve seen it time and again in this department.\u00a0 When we\u2019ve had an urgency, when we\u2019ve had an emergency situation, when we\u2019ve had a daunting challenge, people have been raising their hands.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been standing up.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve been running \u2013 you\u2019ve been running \u2013 into the building, and that makes a huge difference.\u00a0 Your determination, your skill, your heart, which is also very apparent in the stories that we\u2019ve heard from Katherine, from Marta, from Josh, from Hannah, from Gail, from Michael \u2013 that truly is inspiring to me as well.\nAnd to everyone who is joining us today, including folks who are online, as well as everyone here in person, thank you for everything that you\u2019ve done; and thank you for sharing the stories.\u00a0 We know that for each of the six stories, seven stories that we just heard, there are hundreds more \u2013 from across the U.S. Government, from across NGOs \u2013 from people who stepped up to welcome the 222.\u00a0 And I hope that in some way, as well, we\u2019ll find a way to collect some of those stories and maybe share them with colleagues because \u2013 again, I think it\u2019s going to be incredibly inspiring to them.\nBut these doctors, these political leaders, these journalists, these priests, these others who all came together and found themselves together \u2013 as a result of your work \u2013 on that plane, they had one thing that connected them, one overriding aspiration, and that was to simply exercise their fundamental freedoms and to try to safeguard the freedom of their fellow citizens.\u00a0 Tragically, in Ortega\u2019s Nicaragua, that\u2019s a crime.\u00a0 It\u2019s why these activists were imprisoned for months and sometimes years; denied visits from their loved ones.\u00a0 Many were held in harsh conditions, little access to sunlight, to fresh air, writing materials, books.\u00a0 One prisoner recalled reading and re-reading the label on a tube of toothpaste.\nAnd as you\u2019ve heard, living with that constant fear that you could be pulled into another cell to be beaten up, to be tortured \u2013 the constant fear that you might even be executed.\u00a0 Living with that, every single day, is its own kind of horrific torture.\nBut it\u2019s precisely because of the power of their message, their actions, the alternative vision that they have for their own country and the way it should treat its own people \u2013 it\u2019s exactly why the regime stripped them of their citizenship soon after they came to the United States.\u00a0 That too speaks volumes.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also why we felt compelled to do what we could to bring them to safety. \u00a0And it\u2019s why the work that all of you did \u2013 and did together \u2013 was so important.\nNow, that work began, in large part, with our colleagues in Embassy Managua who negotiated with the Nicaraguan Government, creating a system to ensure that each of 222 prisoners was accounted for, and \u2013 when the moment finally came, during the early morning hours of February 9th \u2013 physically escorting them to the airplane and then to their freedom.\nKatherine talked about the \u2013 waiting for that final confirmation, and I know that\u2019s excruciating.\u00a0 And as this was all happening, and Brian and Erin and others were keeping me informed of what was going on, I have to admit, I wasn\u2019t so sure this was really going to come together.\u00a0 I had a funny feeling, oh, this is going to fall apart.\u00a0 It seems almost \u2013 almost too good to be true, but too good to be true because so much work actually goes into this.\u00a0 These things don\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 It takes the incredible effort that started in Managua to actually get it done.\nFrom there, more than 350 \u2013 more than 350 of our colleagues from the U.S. Government, as well as partners from the state of Virginia, NGOs \u2013 you all took over.\u00a0 You worked around the clock, you worked through the weekend, reuniting prisoners with their loved ones.\u00a0 You interpreted for them.\u00a0 You provided them with food, with clothing, with healthcare.\u00a0 You helped them through the jarring process of starting a new life far from their homes and their communities.\nAnd what I heard also in the stories that were told is I think you all responded in a powerfully human way, because I imagine as you\u2019re there with someone who has just had this absolute sea change in their life, you\u2019re thinking and feeling and understanding how totally jarring and disorienting that is \u2013 even in this incredibly positive way.\u00a0 And the humanity that you showed as fellow human beings in helping them navigate this particular passage \u2013 that in and of itself was hugely important.\nAnd indeed, it wasn\u2019t just what you did, it\u2019s how you did it: with care, with compassion, by asking each of our Nicaraguan friends how are you doing, are you okay, what do you need \u2013 probably a question they hadn\u2019t been asked in a long, long time.\u00a0 By arriving at the tarmac with American colleagues that they knew from the past, they were welcomed by familiar faces.\u00a0 And Marta, I know that must have had a powerful impact on them as well.\nAs one of the volunteers put it, \u201cThe whole operation was successful because we all cared too much to accept anything less.\u201d\nNow, because of this work, our Nicaraguan friends are beginning new lives across more than two dozen U.S. states, some now moving on to other countries as well.\u00a0 Some have already jumped back into activism \u2013 no surprise \u2013 rallying international support and pressure for a better future for their country at the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Summit for Democracy just this week.\u00a0 At the summit, we heard some of these voices.\u00a0 Others are starting the process of opening new businesses, continuing their studies, getting on with their lives that were so violently interrupted by the Nicaraguan regime.\nNow, in the months ahead, we have our NGO partners that will continue to support the recent arrivals\u2019 relocation.\u00a0 We have our embassy colleagues who will work to reunify family members in Nicaragua with their newly settled family members in the United States.\u00a0 So, this process goes forward.\u00a0 It carries on.\nAnd at the same time, for us, a government, we\u2019ll join our partners across the hemisphere and around the world to continue to push for a return to democracy and respect for human rights in Nicaragua, while also using all of the diplomatic and economic tools that we have to try to promote accountability for the widespread abuses from the regime.\nSo, in a very small period of time, in a very intense way, you gave us a reminder of who we are when we\u2019re at our best \u2013 which is not every day, but it was in the days that you were engaged in this mission: a country that stands with those on the side of freedom and human rights, and fights for our democratic values around the world.\u00a0 You\u2019ve demonstrated that with your service; you\u2019ve demonstrated that with your dedication.\nSo, I\u2019m so glad we just had a few moments together, again, to press the pause button, to reflect a little bit on what each of you has done, and to take that with you going forward because this career that all of you have been called to in a variety of ways, I know a lot of days can be frustrating.\u00a0 I know we pile on the work.\u00a0 The inbox gets higher, the resources seem to get \u2013 to shrink, and we\u2019re working on all of that.\u00a0 And I know there are days for each of us when we say, is it worth it?\u00a0 Maybe I should be doing something else.\nI hope and I believe strongly that this experience is a reminder of what an incredible pursuit this is, what an incredible responsibility we all have, but also what an incredible privilege it is to actually work for, represent your country, and try to make sure that the country that we love and share and the department that we love and share is actually operating at its best.\u00a0 In this instance it was because you were.\u00a0 And I just wanted to thank you on behalf of the President and as a fellow American.\u00a0 Thanks for exemplary work.\u00a0 Thanks for your service to our country.\u00a0 Thank you.\n",

more able to address the issues that matter most in the lives and livelihoods of their populations, whether it\u2019s protecting public health, advancing children\u2019s education, expanding economic opportunity.\nAnd we know that the pursuit of a stronger, freer, more democratic future is shared by people and governments from big and small countries, North and South, developed and developing.\nAs President Biden has said, democracy doesn\u2019t happen by accident.\u00a0 It requires constant effort, constant tending by each new generation \u2013 and by each of us.\u00a0 And indeed, we are at an inflection point when it comes to the future of democracy, where a defining question of this time is whether we are willing to do what it takes to make sure that democracies continue to deliver for their people, continue to thrive.\nThroughout this Year of Action, this group has answered that question with a resounding yes.\u00a0 Since the last Summit for Democracy, we have made \u2013 and we are delivering on \u2013 over 700 commitments that help us defend and strengthen democratic values and institutions.\nThese commitments include new laws and initiatives to combat corruption \u2013 like Ecuador\u2019s new National Anti-Corruption Strategy, the Dominican Republic\u2019s Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture, and Australia\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Commission Act.\nSteps to support a free and independent press \u2013 including the contributions of France, Slovakia, New Zealand, and the United States to initiatives that help independent news outlets become more financially stable and sustainable, and protect journalists, as well as the abolition of laws, as in Zambia, that could be used to silence government critics.\nGovernments have taken measures to bolster democratic institutions, including judicial reform in Albania and Angola; to encourage inclusive representation in government, particularly by women, members of the LGBTQI+ community, and other historically marginalized groups.\nAnd many have taken action to protect civic and human rights.\u00a0 The Democratic Republic of Congo passed landmark legislation to recognize indigenous peoples\u2019 land and cultural rights.\u00a0 Taiwan lifted barriers to prevent the recognition of transnational same-sex marriage.\u00a0 Nepal passed legislation to punish perpetrators of acid attacks and rape, to name just a few.\nThese national commitments are significant.\u00a0 They\u2019re making a difference, an actual difference, in the lives of millions of people around the world.\u00a0 And as we close this second Summit for Democracy, as we prepare for summits to come, we\u2019ll continue to help one another sustain, adapt, and build on our collective efforts.\nBecause President Biden believes deeply \u2013 as do I \u2013 that safeguarding our democracies is a collective effort, one that depends on our governments and on our people working together.\u00a0 Because all people, all nations, all sectors have contributions to make.\u00a0 And for sure, none of us has a monopoly on ideas, never mind good ideas.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why we tried to bring such a wide-ranging group of summit participants together to drive progress on shared priorities \u2013 from promoting youth engagement in politics, supporting an independent press, securing free and fair elections \u2013 and, as we discussed today, shaping the norms around the internet and emerging technologies.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why such a major focus of our work leading up to this summit, and in the months that will follow it, is on multilateral efforts \u2013 including Democracy Cohorts: innovative platforms that bring governments together with leading civil society and private sector groups.\nThis\u00a0shared fight against corruption is just one powerful example of why we need to work together across borders and with partners across our societies.\u00a0 And there has been \u2013 and I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019ve done it \u2013 real focus on combating corruption through our Summit for Democracy process.\nWe know that corruption is a transnational scourge.\u00a0 It discourages investment.\u00a0 It stifles competition.\u00a0 It deepens inequities.\u00a0 And maybe worst of all, it erodes public trust in government and institutions.\nEvery country, unfortunately, has experience in fighting corruption \u2013 experience that we need to be sharing with one another.\u00a0 Over the last 15 months, the United States, together with the Brookings Institution and the Open Government Partnership \u2013 which includes 76 countries, 106 local governments, representing more than 2 billion people, and thousands of civil society organizations \u2013 we\u2019ve been leading a new Financial Transparency and Integrity Democracy Cohort to do just that, to come together, to bring our experiences, our knowledge, and our efforts together in combating corruption.\nBringing these diverse perspectives together, the Cohort has worked to study the problem across regions.\u00a0 And it\u2019s crafting actual solutions based on lessons learned, based on best practices from member countries.\u00a0 Guidelines put together by the Cohort will help prevent bad actors from shielding illicit activity behind shell companies, stopping corrupt government officials and their cronies from enriching themselves, making sure that gatekeepers of the financial system \u2013 lawyers, accountants, investment managers \u2013 don\u2019t enable money laundering.\nThis work \u2013 this summit \u2013 is about looking inward at our democracies: recognizing our challenges, striving to do better by our people.\nAnd in a very profound way, I believe that\u2019s what distinguishes democracies: our willingness to confront these challenges \u2013 out in the open, transparently; to acknowledge our shortcomings \u2013 not to sweep them under the rug, not to pretend they don\u2019t exist.\u00a0 That is one of our greatest strengths.\u00a0 It\u2019s what we mean in the United States when we commit to the enduring task of forming a more perfect union.\nWe don\u2019t believe that we hold all the solutions \u2013 far from it.\u00a0 But we do know that when we join together with our fellow democracies, we make one another stronger, more resilient, more responsive to our citizens, and better able to do what we\u2019re here to do, which is to deliver for them \u2013 and, I hope, for the world.\nSo to each of you who are still here hanging in there at the end of the day, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your participation.\u00a0 Thank you for your engagement \u2013 but not just today, every single day \u2013 in doing this work.\u00a0 It matters.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a difference, and I can think of no recent time in history when it\u2019s been more vital.\u00a0 So thanks to everyone.\u00a0 Have a great evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

technology can promote democracy.\u00a0 Our first session, Advancing Democracy and Internet Freedom in a Digital Age, will help us think through how we might craft a world in which technology and democracy are mutually reinforcing.\nWe\u2019re joined today by three speakers; let me introduce them now.\u00a0 Jorge Arg\u00fcello is ambassador of Argentina to the United States.\u00a0 Nighat Dad \u2013 (applause) \u2013 Nighat Dad is executive director of Digital Rights Foundation.\u00a0 And Funke Opeke is CEO and founder of Main One.\u00a0 And I will now give the floor \u2013 (applause) \u2013 back to our moderator for this session, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Jeanne.\u00a0 So this is what I really like, because I actually get to ask the questions for once.\u00a0 And we have a great group of colleagues to hear from, to listen to, and to learn from.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really thrilled to be able to join each of you today and to, I think, focus on a few things.\u00a0 I think we all recognize that democracies have to make an affirmative case for how societies can leverage technology to actually advance, to make progress, and, as we were talking about just few minutes ago, to actually try to deliver positive results for our people.\u00a0 And I think we also recognize that the same human rights that we are so engaged in defending offline have to be also respected online, and this is one of the big challenges of our time.\u00a0 We have to have an internet, we have to have a digital ecosystem that respects and protects those rights, and each of you in different ways is engaged in that.\nSo a few things that I wanted to try to put on the table and invite our colleagues to talk about.\u00a0 First of all, my friend Ambassador Arg\u00fcello \u2013 Argentina is a member of the Freedom Online Coalition.\u00a0 We\u2019re very proud to chair this effort, and many in this room are members.\u00a0 As you\u2019re looking at it from Argentina\u2019s perspective, tell us a little bit about how you see Argentina working to advance internet freedom and to protect the space that we all have to share.\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0 Perfect.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary, Antony.\u00a0 Good morning to everyone here.\u00a0 First and foremost, I would like to stress that our country\u2019s highly honored to be part of this important event, as well as to be part of the second Summit for Democracy and endorse its final declaration.\u00a0 As you all know \u2013 and you probably know or you may know \u2013 our President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, the president of Argentina, was in Washington, D.C., yesterday in order to have a bilateral meeting with President Biden, which was held yesterday at the White House.\u00a0 Our Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero was part of the presidential delegation.\u00a0 He received the invitation to participate in this panel as a speaker.\u00a0 Unfortunately, he was called away for last-minute business and he is now in Buenos Aires for what he asked me to convey: his deepest apologies to you all.\nBut let me now turn to the topic that gathers us today.\u00a0 Information and communication technologies are in process of constant progress and have become fundamental tools that improve productivity for development, both economically and socially, fostering greater participation of societies and allowing better access to knowledge while promoting the strengthening of education in our countries.\u00a0 Likewise, and from the point of view of government interaction with citizens within the framework of truly democratic societies, these technologies have enhanced the capacity to provide quality, agile services with greater transparency, open communications, and greater participation.\u00a0 In this sense, increasing access to these technologies while strengthening connectivity and achieving the universalization of ICT services is a clear priority that allows us to avoid digital exclusion and reduce inequality \u2013 and reduce inequality.\nTherefore, aspiring to a knowledge society cannot be dissociated from the achievement of the highest possible levels of social inclusion.\u00a0 The achievement of one will not be fair or democratic if it is not built on the basis of the other.\u00a0 The adoption and implementation of technologies are still a challenge for many countries because, while some technologies make leaps of great magnitudes, certain technologies, groups, industries, sectors, workers go at a different pace and require a different policy approach.\u00a0 We must look closely at the different divides \u2013 gender, rural, industrial systems, security systems \u2013 and analyze together, with the private sector and civil society, which are the best policies to address those gaps.\nIn Argentina, ARSAT, the state-owned telecommunications company which operates the federal fiber optic network, plays a key role in connecting the unconnected, reaching the demand of small- and medium-sized companies, cooperatives, and rural areas.\u00a0 ARSAT, the company, was present some weeks ago here in D.C. for the SATELLITE Conference\u00a0and had many meetings with U.S. Government and companies to enhance cooperation in telecommunication and data centers.\u00a0 Also, it is important to highlight that in Argentina, fundamental human rights are protected by a solid legal framework guaranteed by our national constitution and in international treaties that have a constitutional hierarchy.\u00a0 The exercise of the rights of freedom of expression and association and the right to privacy is protected and guaranteed in the virtual and real world by the three branches of government.\nBearing this in mind, I would like to share with you some important milestones of our laws and policies regarding the ICTs.\nArgentina has a law which states that \u2013 and I\u2019m going to read \u2013 the search, reception, and dissemination of information and ideas of all kinds through the internet service is considered to be included within the constitutional guarantee that protects freedom of expression.\u00a0 Another law guarantees the complete neutrality of networks in all telecommunications services and ICT developments.\nNow, due to the boost we provide to the ICT sector, knowledge-based services represent the fourth \u2013 the fourth largest export complex in Argentina, and the development of Argentine technology companies with high levels of competitiveness is on the rise.\u00a0 We have also adopted a new knowledge economy law which broadens and deepens incentives into the sector.\u00a0 Likewise, under the firm conviction that certain vulnerable groups deserve special protection, in 2020 we sanctioned a law which creates a national program for the prevention and awareness of grooming or cyber bullying against children and adolescents, a crime that was also incorporated to our national criminal code.\nOn the other hand, regarding hate speech and its dissemination, it is worth mentioning that such crime is contemplated.\u00a0 As an open, multicultural, and multireligious society, in Argentina we strongly believe in our duty to work for an internet free of hate speech.\u00a0 Our rejection of online terrorism is clear and resounding.\u00a0 Argentina adhered to the Christchurch Call in September 2019.\u00a0 The call focuses on the delicate and sensitive balance between security considerations and freedom of expression and data privacy.\u00a0 Argentina has participated in many areas regarding the right of freedom of expression in digital context.\u00a0 We have adhered to a number of international instances, such as the Information and Democracy Forum or the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.\u00a0 Likewise, since June 2016, Argentina has been a member of the Freedom Online Coalition, and we are very proud to work in that sense.\nIn that regard, we wish the U.S. every success in its new chairmanship and reiterate our willingness to work together constructively.\u00a0 The Argentine Republic plays an active role in international and regional forums on issues related to human rights in the digital environment.\nFinally, Antony, and before giving back the floor to you, I would like to reaffirm our country\u2019s deep commitment to the development of information and communication technologies as fundamental tools for the empowerment of our peoples, with free access, without exclusion, which allows a true strengthening of societies, helping education and culture and access to information, as well as a better economic development.\u00a0 We \u2013 government along with the private sector along with the civil society \u2013 must tirelessly work together to make this happen.\nThank you very much, Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Ambassador, thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you for sharing that with all of us.\nLet\u2019s talk a little bit about digital inclusion.\u00a0 So, Ms. Dad, you are working to do exactly that: to try to make sure that women and girls, other marginalized communities are able to access technology and use it to thrive.\u00a0 So what I want to focus on here is your own experience through civil society in advancing rights and inclusion in the digital ecosystem.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Firstly, it\u2019s a pleasure to share this panel with esteemed panelists.\u00a0 As a civil society in past few years, we have had a front-row seat in seeing the role of digital technologies and internet in both advancing democracies and undermining institutions integral to a free democratic space.\u00a0 And holding these two realities together is important as we truly want to present a holistic picture of the role that technologies play in our democracies.\nThese two binaries also come as no surprise to me, having worked with young women and girls in Pakistan regarding their access to technologies and internet, which can be both as a liberating space in their lives but also abuse and violence not only online but offline as well.\u00a0 So it\u2019s really important that when we all are talking about digital rights, we center the experiences of marginalized groups \u2013 young women and girls, female journalists, women human rights defenders, activists \u2013 when we talk about democracy in the digital age, because\u00a0these experiences have a lot to teach us.\u00a0 And when it comes to technologies and digital spaces, there are two very main stakeholders who are dominating this space.\u00a0 One is governments around the world and the second is tech companies, platforms.\nOn one hand we have governments scrambling to acquire technologies and pass laws that would allow them to control the internet and dominate the pervasive narratives in these spaces.\u00a0 The loss of control over the information we consume and who gets to speak has been troubling for governments with long histories of interrupted and weak democratic rule.\u00a0 Even in countries where rule of law is strong, we \u2013 what we have seen is that they also struggle to come up with really good regulations, the regulations that respect international human rights framework.\nAnd on the other hand, we have powerful platforms dominating this space with so much space, profit margins, power to control content and our data, and often we have seen that \u2013 in my experience, the decade-long work, that we have seen that they are mostly unaccountable towards their \u2013 towards the governments but also mainly towards the users who should be the center of the conversation in these spaces.\nAnd this sort of throws up fundamental question about democracy:\u00a0 Do we want powerful tech companies to decide our democratic future?\u00a0 And while we are looking into these questions about governments and powerful companies, I think it\u2019s important to talk about solutions also, and there is this one solution which is self-regulatory model.\u00a0 It\u2019s an independent \u2013 Meta\u2019s Oversight Board that the company came up with a solution to hold itself accountable.\nBut the question is:\u00a0 Are they holding themself accountable independently and transparently?\u00a0 And the answer is that just this model that came up three years ago, where the people who are actually making decisions around content moderation of this platform are from diverse background.\u00a0 I sit on the board.\u00a0 I am from global majority.\u00a0 English is not my first language.\u00a0 I bring experiences of the marginalized groups not only from Pakistan but South Asia.\u00a0 But then telling companies sitting on this board that the decision that you are making are not truly democratic, are not following international human rights framework, and then come up with solution to tell them what they can do in these situations.\u00a0 And how we are making ourselves transparent is that \u2013 actually releasing our reports, the progress that we have made, the progress that the company has made so far.\u00a0 So I think these are the regulatory models I feel are so important to hold these companies accountable.\nAnd if I talk about my own personal experience as Digital Rights Foundation head in Pakistan, I feel that the global majority is actually at the end of \u2013 at the receiving end the decisions that the Global North, not only governments but the tech platforms, make.\u00a0 And there is very little say of the users, especially from Global South or global majority.\u00a0 There are such initiatives, local initiatives \u2013 if you look around, there are so many civil society organizations around the world who have been working on digital rights for such a long time.\u00a0 They have come up with local solutions.\u00a0 They have been part of international debates.\u00a0 But I think \u2013 and we\u2019ll speak about this later in the panel conversation as well \u2013 that these local solutions need to be taken into account in the global conversations.\u00a0 We cannot really come up with a top-down approach.\u00a0 I think we really need to see what people are locally doing, how they are contextualizing this issue, how they are holding their governments accountable who are coming up with bad regulations and laws while preserving speech in the online space, at the same time holding people in the Global North accountable, that what they are deciding can set bad precedents for the authoritarian regimes as well.\nThank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I think particularly the last point that you were making about the need to look to local solutions, to look to local ideas, to do this from the bottom up and the middle out not just the top down, is going to be vital to success and ultimately to having sustainable ways of doing things, because if people are not bought in, they will opt out one way or the other.\u00a0 So appreciate that very much.\nAccessibility.\u00a0 Ms. Opeke, tell us about how you are looking at this in the work that you\u2019re doing in Africa, and particularly operationalizing accessibility.\u00a0 We talked about this a little bit earlier, but we always run the risk with new technologies of having totally bifurcated worlds and those who have access to them, those who don\u2019t.\u00a0 And this is a vital part of your mission.\u00a0 Tell us how you\u2019re seeing it.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, and truly is an honor to be part of this distinguished panel.\u00a0 As you mentioned, Main One, which is a company that I run, was founded in 2008 to address the digital divide in Africa.\u00a0 It was informed \u2013 the vision was informed at that time with the reality that internet access was only a 10 percent penetration rate when the rest of the world was at 50 percent.\u00a0 Today we have 70 percent global internet penetration, but most of the African continent is at 50 percent or below.\nAnd so we set out to try to close that gap with a focus on West Africa.\u00a0 Now, how were we able to do that?\u00a0 Nigeria, which is the company that \u2013 country that I am from, had returned to democratic rule in 1999, and coming in 2001 on the heels of that was a liberalization of the telecommunications sector, which enabled private sector companies to deploy telecoms infrastructure for the first time to deliver to\u00a0citizens.\u00a0 And so coming on the heels of that, we were able to obtain licenses in Nigeria and Ghana, the first private licenses for open access submarine cables to connect West Africa to the rest of the world through Europe.\u00a0 Doing that, building that 7,000 kilometer cable, which initially served two countries in West Africa but is delivering a mix of services to 11 countries today, is part of what has enabled that growth in access to 50 percent.\nSo what really are the building blocks on which we did that, first, was the liberalization.\u00a0 And it is worth noting that not all African countries today have liberalized their telecommunications laws, which says in the \u2013 that the shortage of resources and the large infrastructure deficits that a lot of these countries face, they\u2019re not able to accelerate digital transformation of the economies because they\u2019re not enabling private capital to come in.\u00a0 The next step of our journey, of course, was private capital.\u00a0 And the African Development Bank was a key anchor, so having the kind of patient, more risk, higher-risk appetite capital to come into this market; obviously, skills; and then access to technology, where we had an American company with a depth of experience and capacity deploy the network for us.\nSo what do we see today is that the work is not done yet.\u00a0 And of course, as you go further down the pyramid and try to enable access and more inclusion, it does get more challenging. The word is\u2026what we have to do in these economics is to truly grow the market. \u00a0Because the value chain, in terms of realizing the return from investment in digital infrastructure, is simply not as mature as what you have in the advanced economies. \u00a0So there is a lot of partnering. \u00a0There is a need for patient capital to consider the affordability and also consider the provision of other elements in the value chain.\u00a0 Which is places like Lagos, Nigeria or Cape Town, South Africa or Nairobi, Kenya on the African continent your starting to see today.\u00a0 But there\u2019s still a lot more to be done.\nThe obvious returns are, there are successful companies of scale delivering the services on the African continent, so it proves that it can be done; and that delivering such infrastructure is also providing dividends for democracy, because as you have greater shared prosperity, job creation, financial inclusion, access to services, people are able to drive better outcomes, they\u2019re able to reduce unemployment rates for more people to work.\nAfrica, when you think of it, with 50 percent internet penetration of a population of 1.4 billion, that\u2019s about 700 million people.\u00a0 The average age on the continent is 19, who do not have access and constitute the workforce of tomorrow.\u00a0 So getting the access to those who have currently been excluded so they can form part of this fabric we are building is really critical.\u00a0 And that\u2019s \u2013 building the partnership to enable that is, I think, going to be critical to get there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I really want to underscore the point that you made about this not being a favor that one group of countries may be doing for another.\u00a0 It\u2019s profoundly in everyone\u2019s interests.\u00a0 And in the case of Africa, as you point out, the next 20 years we\u2019ll have one in four people on this planet being from and of Africa, so bridging these divides is going to be hugely important.\nI want to come back to one thing that you mentioned, then maybe we can go a little deeper on some of the things that people have already touched on.\u00a0 You mentioned the importance of private capital.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And of course, that\u2019s exactly right.\u00a0 And most of our governments, most of our systems, can\u2019t simply dedicate and direct state resources to some of these challenges.\u00a0 What we can do, what our comparative advantage is, is in catalyzing and leveraging private sector investment.\nBased on this experience, though, what do you see \u2013 and you\u2019ve touched on it a little bit \u2013 as some of the impediments to that?\u00a0 And then, are there any thoughts that you have about how that can be facilitated?\u00a0 You mentioned the need to actually make markets.\u00a0 I\u2019m hopeful, for example, that as the free trade area in Africa actually emerges and we get beyond this abnormal situation where African countries trade more with countries outside of Africa than they do with themselves, that will also help create markets that attract investment in an easier way.\u00a0 But are there other things that come to mind based on your experience?\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, understood about governments not being able to write checks, open checks to drive private infrastructure investment in developing countries.\u00a0 However, for the funds that have been identified, I believe helping to create the frameworks, a lot of these lesser developed economies do not have strong institutions.\u00a0 One of the areas where progress can be made and impacts can be driven is helping to strengthen the frameworks, helping to strengthen the work of institutions that are set up to establish and guide those examples.\u00a0 And I really think that\u2019s where the most impact can be made.\nAs you mentioned also with the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, implementation has not kept pace with expectations that were set a few years ago when the free trades agreement went into effect.\u00a0 So what can be done and based on the U.S. experience in setting up and working with such agreements to actually facilitate implementation and impact?\u00a0 I believe that\u2019s probably where the most impact can be had for the kind of checks that can be written by the U.S. Government.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 So we have an expression:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m from the federal government;\u00a0 I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I\u2019m from the federal government; I\u2019m here to help.\nFrom the perspective of civil society, what can governments be doing better, more effectively, to make sure that we\u2019re advancing inclusion, that we\u2019re making sure that in particularly underserved people, community groups, have the benefit of accessibility and also are not finding themselves in the situation where these tools and this technology is actually being used against them?\nMS DAD:\u00a0\u00a0I think for that, there has been a lot of conversation around including civil society in these conversations.\u00a0 I think, first and foremost, is we need to really see who are the people from civil society in these conversations.\u00a0 Are these only people from Western democracy and Global North?\u00a0 And if civil society from global majority is not part of this conversation, then why not?\u00a0 And I think that leads us to the conversation where civil society is being \u2013 the civic space has been eroded very slowly, very gradually, and no one even felt that.\u00a0 And I think what Western democracies who are setting good precedents, they can also hold those governments accountable, that why this is happening, why these civil \u2013 civil society cannot participate in these conversations if they are not truly liberated.\nAnd I think the second point is are they \u2013 do they have resources to do that?\u00a0 I think empowering them, not only making them included in these conversations but also do they have money to do that.\u00a0 And I think while I\u2019m saying these resources, I have seen people doing a lot of labor in these countries for \u2013 labor towards these companies, telling them what are the gaps that they have so that they can make these online spaces safer for their own communities, and telling government that the laws that they are making are problematic.\u00a0 So it\u2019s free labor; it\u2019s a thankless job.\u00a0 And I think what governments like U.S. can do is actually help empowering civil society, not only in their own jurisdiction but around the world, and hold other governments accountable what exactly they are doing to keep these space safer and freer for civil society.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAmbassador, any thoughts from the perspective of your country, your government, both on these questions of inclusion and these questions of accessibility?\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 Well, first of all, I would like to stress the importance of the battle we are facing, and allow me to congratulate you for calling for this gathering.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s very important to share the floor with my Nigerian and Pakistani friend.\u00a0 They do a very important work in their countries from the civil society.\u00a0 And something \u2013 what we must having clear is that they there must be an alliance between the government, the civil society, and the private sector.\u00a0 Otherwise we \u2013 it will not fly.\u00a0 And what we are trying to do is precisely \u2013 is to have it flying.\nIn the case of our country, we are working with different international initiatives.\u00a0 I wrote here the information for Democracy Forum \u2013 we have been working together in that sense \u2013 the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and the Freedom for \u2013 Online Coalition.\u00a0 These are our main activities we develop in the international field.\u00a0 And I would like to stress something that Funke just said:\u00a0 The work is not done yet.\u00a0 The battle is starting.\u00a0 Our democracy \u2013 the national democracy, the international democracy, the freedom is at stake.\u00a0 So we must take \u2013 be part of this discussion.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m cognizant of time \u2013 I want to make sure that we get some other people in on this conversation.\u00a0 So we have a number of \u2013 probably 600 experts in this audience today, but we can\u2019t hear from everyone.\u00a0 But there are a few people I\u2019d like to call on just to get perspectives and also any questions that you have for our wonderful panelists.\nSo Amalia Toledo from the Wikimedia Foundation, who\u2019s working on technology\u2019s impacts on human rights.\u00a0 Amalia, are you here?\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you to the panel.\u00a0 My question is (inaudible) digitalization happening across government \u2013 how can they ensure that tech companies are respecting the human rights of individuals?\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 If I may, I think that\u2019s a very important question because \u2013 and it needs a clear answer.\u00a0 There is only one way to guarantee that, and it\u2019s the development of a strong legal framework.\u00a0 So I want to reiterate there is an alliance to be \u2013 to put on the table between the government, the civil society, and the private sector.\u00a0 Otherwise, we won\u2019t be able to protect the right of freedom of expression, both, as you said, Antony, online and offline.\u00a0 So I think that that\u2019s our main target to play.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Other thoughts on this?\nMS DAD:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, I mean, yes, governments are powerful, and they are already bringing lot of regulations and laws to hold companies accountable.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s important that we look into other mechanisms where these platforms find themselves accountable as well.\u00a0 And one initiative I have already mentioned, like independent oversight body, which is truly independent, and which is also transparent.\nBut I would also like to be very cautious towards giving an only solution, like regulatory framework and laws, because it really doesn\u2019t work for everyone around the world.\u00a0 There are regulations and laws that we have seen that were made in the name of protecting young women and girls in the online space, cyber harassment, abuse, hate speech, disinformation, but those laws have been weaponized against the very same people.\u00a0 So I think we really need to see how those laws are being made, whether the governments are following international human rights framework, whether civil society is part of those conversations while these laws are being drafted and then implemented, and whether the judges are actually trained to develop good jurisprudence.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNext from our audience, Frane Maroevi\u0107 from the International Press Institute, who\u2019s working on advancing press freedoms around the world.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, excellencies and ladies and gentlemen.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be interested, as digitalization is happening across governments and different departments are working, how can\u00a0you ensure that it\u2019s all coordinated around the human rights agenda, that the human rights is at the focus of the work of each government department as they work on digitalization and promoting media freedom?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good question.\u00a0 Anyone want to jump in?\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Well, maybe that\u2019s for you, Secretary.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I was afraid you were going to say that.\u00a0 No, it\u2019s a hugely important question, and it goes to the work that we\u2019re trying to do to make sure that questions, obligations, responsibilities when it comes to human rights are infused in pretty much everything we do, including in places in our own department that might not naturally take that perspective into account when they\u2019re trying to formulate policy or advance policy.\nSo one of the challenges, I think, for particularly our organizations in government is to make sure that we\u2019re working horizontally as much as possible, because virtually everything we\u2019re talking about today connects to the equities of seven, eight, 10, 12 different offices in my own department, and it\u2019s the same, I\u2019m sure, for the ambassador and other colleagues in government.\nSo one of the things that we\u2019ve made a real effort to do is to make sure that in each of our bureaus, both from a geographic perspective but also a functional perspective \u2013 the human rights perspective and dimension is included in the deliberations.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019ve tried to bring together in the State Department, under one roof, all of these questions, to include the human rights dimension of technology in a new bureau that we stood up for Cyberspace and Digital Policy as well as for emerging technologies.\nSo partly this is a question of making sure that the direction, the responsibility to do that is clearly communicated, but it\u2019s also about setting up the mechanisms within government to make sure that that voice, that perspective is being included \u2013 and we\u2019ve tried to organize ourselves to do that.\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve had a similar experience.\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 Yes, I do.\u00a0 I agree with what you have said.\u00a0 I would add that our target, what we are pursuing when we talk about human rights, is a key word.\u00a0 We are trying to guarantee access.\u00a0 We are \u2013 for everybody, for everyone all over the world.\u00a0 We are trying to guarantee a true democratization of knowledge.\u00a0 That\u2019s human rights.\nAnd allow me to celebrate a decision made by the Biden administration.\u00a0 Argentina has a very firm stand in the human rights field, probably because of our own terrible experience during the last dictatorships in the \u201870s, but I said the international community is still celebrating the return of the U.S. to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations.\u00a0 We are working together.\u00a0 We are coordinating every action, not only between us but with all the members of the committee \u2013 the commission.\u00a0 But I think that is very important, and that will allow us to contribute to guarantee that everybody in \u2013 can engage in this public discussion.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0 I would like to speak from the standpoint of weaker democracies who \u2013 which governments are not necessarily inclined to protect human rights.\u00a0 And in such economies or such countries, what we\u2019re finding is access in and of itself starts providing citizens with a voice and a means of easier, faster information dissemination to call attention to the issues and actually push for their rights to be protected.\u00a0 So taking another \u2013 yes, there are governments that are working actively to promote human rights, but there are also governments who want to silence those dissenting voices, and the more access is enabled and is free and affordable, the more we\u2019re able to have those dissenting voices speak up.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s a very powerful point.\u00a0 I\u2019ll give you one other example, Frane, because you\u2019re working on press freedom every single day.\u00a0 One of the things we see from autocratic governance is an effort basically to use lawfare to silence journalists who are just doing their jobs.\u00a0 At this very summit a year ago, one of the initiatives that came out of it was standing up a fund to \u2013 that journalists, media enterprises, particularly small, independent media that usually doesn\u2019t have the resources \u2013 a fund that they can tap into if they\u2019re on the receiving end of bogus legal proceedings that are trying in effect to drive them out of business.\u00a0 That\u2019s just one initiative among many as we look at what is being done and how technology is being used or misused to try to silence voices, whether it\u2019s from media or from civil society or human rights defenders.\u00a0 We\u2019re also looking at what tools can we provide to help them more effectively defend themselves, and that\u2019s just one example.\nJohn Morris from the Internet Society, working on expanding internet access and freedom.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 At the Internet Society, we believe that the internet, the globally \u2013 the open, globally connected, secure, and trustworthy internet is a tremendous enabler of democracy, but increasingly decisions in government \u2013 by governments in democratic countries and non-democratic countries are threatening the internet\u2019s operations and its global nature.\u00a0 So my question is:\u00a0 How can we ensure that governments proactively assess the potential harmful impact on the internet from their policy proposals so that we don\u2019t inadvertently undermine both global speech, global internet access, and democracy worldwide?\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 I think we should stress the importance of the civil society.\u00a0 You have invited three of us; two of them come from the civil society, NGOs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s very important, because it\u2019s true that not every government works in this direction.\u00a0 Some governments do exactly the contrary.\u00a0 So the multilateral fora, the civil \u2013 the organizations from the civil society are called to play a key role in this issue.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, I couldn\u2019t agree more with that.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s imperative on us in government in particular to make sure that we have all of the different stakeholders in on the takeoff, not just on the landing, precisely because we need to make sure that we\u2019re factoring in these different perspectives, precisely because there are inevitably \u2013 to your point \u2013 second- and third-order consequences that we may not see because we\u2019re coming at it from one perspective that we need to be able to identify upfront before it\u2019s too late, and we actually have an effect that is not the one that we wanted to have.\nAnd it goes to a point I was making earlier when I was speaking, and I\u2019ve found this over 30 years in government, particularly when it comes to technology.\u00a0 The pace with which it\u2019s moving is so fast and the relative lack of expertise in government is such that we\u2019re constantly playing\u00a0catch-up, and just understanding \u2013 never mind trying to figure out what is the appropriate rule, norm, regulation that actually makes sense, doesn\u2019t have second- and third-order consequences that we don\u2019t like, that somehow balances the different equities that are in play.\nI think one of the answers to this for me, besides making sure that the stakeholders are at the table from the takeoff, is actually to make sure that in government itself we have more of this expertise and that it\u2019s not only, as important as that is, so-called outside stakeholders that are involved, but within our own institutions we have people who have come up in these disciplines, who bring that perspective to bear, and can make a huge difference in making \u2013 helping us to make policy.\nOne of the things that struck me some years ago in government was so much of what we do actually has a technological or innovative solution as part, at least, of the answer, what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But so many of us again are not coming up in these disciplines, and we need technologists, innovators, civil society, and others in the room, sometimes even just to tell us whether we need technologists, innovators, and civil societies in the room because, again, it\u2019s identifying a problem from the outset that we may not see.\nSo I think it just goes to this point that both of us are making, that unless everyone with an equity, a perspective, an experience on these questions is in on the takeoff, we\u2019re probably not going to have a smooth landing.\nSo we have a few minutes left.\u00a0 One of the things that I know bedevils all of us in different ways is how we think about dealing with disinformation and misinformation that\u2019s in our ecosystems, and to do it in a way that is protective of speech, not destructive of it, and to do it in a way, again, that uses \u2013 truth has now become a subjective word so I hate to use it \u2013 but that brings truth to bear.\nI\u2019m just wondering, from each of your perspectives, if this is something that you\u2019ve had to grapple with, to think about, and whether there are any ideas that you want to surface today in helping us think about it.\u00a0 Just throwing that out there.\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 We need a growing, transparent public discussion.\u00a0 This is the way we should follow to pursue the target.\u00a0 I want to share something with you.\u00a0 In Argentina, we are doing an experiment, an electoral experiment.\u00a0 We have called \u2013 I have mentioned government, civil society, private sector.\u00a0 We have called Facebook and Twitter.\u00a0 And there is a public agreement between the government, the political parties, and these two companies related to the electoral debate in Argentina, for example.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2013 what is the idea?\nThe idea is to guarantee transparency in the discussion, the possibility of having everyone on board, every sector on board, and particularly, I would like to stress, to guarantee a real public debate where everyone has the chance to participate.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s a \u2013 might be a new \u2013 in my country it\u2019s going to be a new tool that will provide a better solution \u2013 situation, sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I think that more conversation is needed.\u00a0 Education, awareness raising among stakeholders, government officials, judiciary.\u00a0 But at the same time, I think keeping an eye that there\u2019s always this tendency from the powerful actors to criminalize this kind of speech, and I think we have to be very, very careful, if governments are making these decisions, how civil society can be part of those conversation.\nAnd I believe that more speech is an answer and not banning the speech.\u00a0 And just want to mention one initiative that I\u2019m also part of is, because misinformation and disinformation has harmed women and girls online, female journalists.\u00a0 It has increased gender \u2013 online gender-based violence.\u00a0 And this global partnership on \u2013 to address tech-facilitated violence which, again, U.S. Government is taking the leading role and other governments are part of it \u2013 I think these are the kind of initiatives that we need more.\nAnd also like-minded governments are part of such kind of partnerships.\u00a0 We need to see how we can bring those governments which are not like-minded and how they are becoming part of these conversation.\u00a0 I think that that\u2019s much needed.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR OPEKE:\u00a0 Well, I think what you have are that the most powerful and motivated and the authoritarian voices then try to crowd people out and feed a lot of this misinformation.\u00a0 So I also agree that more conversation is required, but more \u2013 the broadening of access so that the advantage some of these people have in weaponizing, in being the loudest and the \u2013 sometimes the only voices or the strongest voices in the room, can be crowded out by broader sections of society.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Please.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Secretary, can I just \u2013 like just one last thing.\u00a0 I really want to commend the executive order that has been issued by the President Biden to ban spyware which violates human rights.\u00a0 And I would like to acknowledge that civil society has been doing a lot of work for years around this issue.\u00a0 And I think you guys have set a really good precedent for other governments, and we would like to see this kind of decision coming from other Western democracies and then hopefully from other regimes as well.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, you just heard it, so thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe are predictably out of time.\u00a0 I just want to see if anyone has any last things that they want to say, put on the table, that they didn\u2019t get a chance to say.\u00a0 Ambassador, anything?\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 I just want to thank you again.\u00a0 This is the way.\u00a0 This is the direction we should work on.\u00a0 So I want you to know that we will try to reproduce this scenario in our country following what you\u2019re doing here today.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Anything?\nMS DAD:\u00a0 I just want to say empower civil society.\u00a0 Give them resources.\u00a0 Make them part of these conversations in proper spirit.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s it.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good way to conclude.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you. (Applause.)\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Jeanne, thank you so much for the introduction and for helping to move us along today.\nAnd I really want to first extend a very warm welcome to everyone who is here as well as to the many who are joining us online.\nNot long after its invention, Thomas Edison said of electricity: \u201cIt holds the secrets that will reorganize the life of the world.\u201d\nToday, we are again living through a time when technology is reorganizing the life of the world, the world that we all share.\u00a0 Every country \u2013 no matter its form of government, no matter its geography, no matter its size or power \u2013 is being transformed by new and evolving tools from biotechnology altering the building blocks of life, to artificial intelligence changing the production of knowledge, to the devices that we\u2019ve all got in our pockets redefining how we relate to each other as human beings.\nThe test we face as democracies is how we can shape this transformation in a way that maximizes its promise, that minimizes its dangers, and reinforces our core values.\nSo, today, what I wanted to do kick us off is to set out a few of the ways that we\u2019re working to try to meet this test, working together in government, with partners in the private sector and civil society \u2013 a test that as we meet it today, I think will do much to shape many, many years to come.\nPresident Biden likes to say that in many ways we\u2019re at an inflection point where the decisions that we\u2019re making now in the next few years are likely to shape the next decades.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of those moments that comes along every few generations where we\u2019re really at a point of inflection and our actions are going to make a big difference.\nSo first, we are focused on using technology to try to make our democracies a little bit healthier, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more inclusive.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on democracy\u2019s core strengths \u2013 our openness, our transparency, our adaptability, and the faith that we place in our citizens to make the system work better, to actually deliver results.\nJust a few examples of how governments here are using technology to shore up the foundations of democracy, to strengthen its institutions in ways that actually deliver results for people.\nIn the Maldives recently they introduced video technology that allows people to participate virtually in court hearings, freeing up time for judges, reducing costs for citizens.\nIn Estonia, as many of you know, citizens can go online to do everything from registering a new business, to paying their taxes, to requesting refills of medical prescriptions all within minutes.\nAfter Malaysia adopted legislation lowering the voting age from 21 to 18, the government was able to automatically register people online who were newly eligible to vote.\u00a0 Participation in elections shot up 25 percent, giving voice to more than 3 million additional voters.\nAnd of course, it\u2019s not just governments that are using digital tools to improve people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 Transparency advocates are creating open databases that allow members of the public to identify corruption in public works projects.\u00a0 Epidemiologists and researchers are sharing data to accelerate our understanding of deadly viruses and the creation of safe, effective vaccines.\u00a0 Climate scientists are using predictive models to help farmers make better decisions about when and where to plant, increasing agricultural productivity, reducing hunger.\nAcross these efforts, we\u2019re working to make sure that all people have access to digital tools and their benefits because one of the things that history teaches us is that leaps in technology too often deepen instead of diminishing inequities in our societies.\u00a0 And we have to have that constantly in mind as we look at how we\u2019re adapting and shaping the technologies of our time.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re making investments at home and around the world to try to close some of the digital divides \u2013 whether on gender, nationality, race, disability, geography, income, or any other factor \u2013 that perpetuate a lack of access to opportunity for underserved groups and underserved communities.\nHere in the United States to take one example, as many of you know, we passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that dedicates $65 billion to ensuring that everyone in our country has access to reliable, affordable high-speed internet \u2013 rural, suburban, urban; low, middle, high-income.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already helped millions of lower-income Americans and their households pay their internet bills, because as President Biden says, high-speed connectivity is no longer a luxury; it\u2019s a necessity.\nAnd we\u2019re helping partners around the world broaden access too, like the more than $260 million in financing the United States is providing to help upgrade infrastructure in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\u00a0 Rio is in the process of installing 5,000 public Wi-Fi access points, as well as public lighting systems that cut electricity consumption by up to 60 percent, while also lowering costs and cutting their emissions.\u00a0 And three-quarters of these investments will be made in neighborhoods where people live below the city\u2019s average income level.\nSecond, we\u2019re working with partners to update and establish as necessary rules and norms, so that technology is developed and used in ways that reflect our democratic values and interests.\nThat includes for old technologies, like the internet.\u00a0 We\u2019ve long promoted an open, interoperable, secure, reliable internet \u2013 principles that created the conditions for the internet to grow into a dynamic force for learning, for connection, for economic opportunity.\nBut everyone in this room knows, and colleagues who are joining us online know, that the internet is also growing more closed, more insecure, more siloed by the day.\u00a0 More countries are putting up firewalls and shutting down access, using the internet to try to control speech, quash dissent, spread misinformation and disinformation.\nSo we are using all the tools in our kit \u2013 from software to hardware, from trade to diplomacy \u2013 to defend our longstanding vision and stand against these and other threats.\u00a0 A year ago, we launched the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.\u00a0 It reaffirms our commitment to a single, open \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d that respects democratic principles and human rights.\u00a0 To date, more than 65 partners and counting have joined us in making this pledge \u2013 and taking action to make that pledge real.\nWe also recognize that we have to do better at addressing some of the risks that come with the open internet.\u00a0 People have important concerns about how platforms collect, exploit, and share our personal data, fan the flames of polarization and extremism, endanger women and girls, children, LGBTQI+ people, and other vulnerable groups.\nTackling these and other issues requires a delicate balance of the principles at the heart of our vision \u2013 such as between openness and security, between protecting speech and preventing incitement, between fostering innovation and limiting the power of Big Tech.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s more than obvious to say we do not yet have all the answers.\u00a0 We\u2019re all working on them, thinking about them, struggling with them.\u00a0 But we have to engage this.\nOur people and increasingly our companies are looking to democratic governments to help establish limits for how platforms can collect, use, and share citizens\u2019 personal data.\u00a0 We have heard that message.\nThat\u2019s why, in addition to using his authority to address these issues, President Biden has been urging Congress to pass strong bipartisan legislation to protect Americans\u2019 privacy.\u00a0 The President has also made clear that we need to be able to hold platforms accountable when they fail to address the harms caused by their technology, from the content they spread to the algorithms that they use.\nIt\u2019s also why we\u2019re stepping up to shape the rules and guidelines around emerging digital tools, like artificial intelligence.\nThe rollout of AI chatbots in recent months has demonstrated how quickly this technology is evolving, how big of an impact it\u2019s going to have on each of our lives.\u00a0 In October, we put out a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \u2013 five principles to try to guide the way we design, use, deploy automated systems in ways that protect our people and defend our democratic values.\nThese include the principle that people should be protected from unsafe or ineffective AI; that people should know when an automated system is being used and understand how it affects them.\nWe\u2019ve also developed a risk management framework to give individuals, organizations, and societies practical guidance on how to measure and manage the risks of automated systems, and make AI that\u2019s safe, that\u2019s accountable, that\u2019s fair, that protects privacy.\nThese principles and guidelines aren\u2019t meant to be the final word in navigating the extraordinary complexities around AI and other emerging tools.\u00a0 We know the technology is changing too fast for that.\u00a0 And speaking as someone who\u2019s in government \u2013 and again, you all know this, many from experience \u2013 government is constantly playing catch-up when it comes to technology.\u00a0 And at a time when things seem to be evolving more quickly than ever before, that game of catch-up is even more intense than ever before.\u00a0 But we have to find ways to create guardrails that will continue to strengthen and improve \u2013 that we\u2019ll continue to strengthen and improve on together with partners.\nThird big piece:\u00a0 We\u2019re doubling down on investing in democracies\u2019 ability to lead on technological innovation. Our ability to shape the digital landscape depends in significant part on maintaining our competitive edge in innovation.\u00a0 Democracies\u2019 free flow of ideas and information gives us a built-in advantage, but we can\u2019t take our own dynamism for granted.\u00a0 We have to continue to find ways to foster it, to catalyze it, to support it, to encourage it.\nAnd that\u2019s the basic idea behind the historic investment that President Biden and Congress have made through the CHIPS and Science Act, through the Inflation Reduction Act, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\u00a0 It\u2019s the biggest investment America has made in generations in revitalizing key industries, recharging our manufacturing base, leading the global energy transition,\u00a0and boosting basic research \u2013 something we\u2019ve gotten away from in recent decades \u2013 while also bolstering the resilience and security of the supply chains that underpin every single one of these efforts.\nAnd we\u2019re not just investing here at home.\u00a0 We\u2019re laying the foundation for innovation in democracies around the world, because leaps in rights-affirming and privacy-respecting technologies don\u2019t just benefit the countries where they\u2019re invented; they are good for people everywhere.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind the pledge we made at the recent Africa Leaders Summit right here in this Convention Center to dedicate more than $350 million toward digital transformation in African countries, which will unlock catalytic investments from the private sector on the continent.\nWe\u2019re urging allies and partners to make these investments too, because our collective competitiveness depends on it.\u00a0 And democracies are answering the call, such as the G7\u2019s unprecedented commitment to spend tens of billions of dollars on tech infrastructure around the globe in the coming years.\nFourth, we are pushing back vigorously on authoritarian governments\u2019 increasing use of technology to abuse human rights and undermine democracy.\nThat starts with shoring up our resilience against efforts by autocratic governments to sow distrust in democracy, to weaken our institutions, to reach across borders to target people in our countries.\nA key part of that is countering the disinformation and misinformation that authoritarian governments spread to polarize our societies.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that not only by exposing lies and manipulations, but by disseminating the truth through individuals, networks, independent media that local communities trust.\nWe\u2019re taking steps to protect the security of our citizens\u2019 data from authoritarian governments, particularly those with a track record of gathering such information to profile our people, to target those that they see as critics, to steal intellectual property.\u00a0 Protecting this information is also vital to preventing these governments from exploiting platforms to shape what our citizens see online.\nWe\u2019re working to thwart the efforts of autocrats to use technology to repress people within as well as beyond their borders.\nTogether with 35 fellow governments in the Freedom Online Coalition, we led an effort to develop a set of guiding principles to encourage the responsible use of surveillance technology, to prevent its misuse by bad actors, such as targeting people based solely on their race, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, political views, or any other classification that is protected by international law.\nWe\u2019re taking immediate steps to translate these principles into practice.\u00a0 Just this week, President Biden issued an executive order that bans the U.S. Government\u2019s use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our national security or that has been misused by foreign actors to abuse human rights.\nAnd we\u2019re working to help people living under repressive regimes get access to digital tools, including the uncensored internet.\u00a0 Last September, when the killing of Mahsa Amini by Iran\u2019s security forces sparked months of massive protests, the regime cracked down viciously \u2013 killing hundreds of people, imprisoning tens of thousands more, and routinely shutting down the internet.\nIn response, we teamed up with companies and civil society groups to help provide the Iranian people with ongoing access to the internet and other vital communications tools so they could continue to communicate with one another and with the outside world and shine a spotlight on the regime\u2019s abuses.\nNew reforms that we rolled out this week will make it easier for our government to provide similar support for people who are facing digital crackdowns in other countries.\nIt\u2019s not just Iran where the private sector and civil society are working with democratic governments to push back against digital authoritarianism.\u00a0 Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of last year, businesses and citizens from the United States and other democracies have been on the front lines helping Ukraine defend its independence, its right to exist, its very democracy.\u00a0 These volunteers have helped maintain connectivity for Ukrainian Government institutions and citizens, despite the relentless attacks, providing the Ukrainian Government with free access to a secure cloud to store sensitive national databases, helping to counter Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaigns on social media.\nCompanies and citizens from democracies have come forward because they believe technology should be used to affirm people\u2019s rights, not abuse them; and that it should empower people to define their own path, not allow others to use coercion and violence to choose that path for them.\nThis brings me to a final point that I want to leave you with, and it\u2019s the reason that ultimately we feel optimistic about democracies\u2019 ability to deliver in a period where technology is once again \u2013 as during Thomas Edison\u2019s lifetime \u2013 reorganizing the life of the world.\nFor all of the challenges that these disruptive technologies present, no system of government is better equipped to drive the forces that they represent in improving our people\u2019s lives than democracy.\nWe excel at innovation.\u00a0 We\u2019re nimble.\nWe encourage a multiplicity of voices and perspectives to find solutions.\nWe let the best ideas rise to the top, rather than assuming that the best ideas come from the top.\nWe believe our people have a vital role to play in the ongoing process of making our system better, of fixing its flaws.\nWe embrace vigorous and open debate within and across our democracies.\nAnd while we democracies may not be perfectly aligned \u2013 we may not agree on everything, on how to proceed, we don\u2019t try to be.\u00a0 Our willingness to try out different approaches \u2013 openly,\u00a0 transparently \u2013 lets us learn from one another, lets us adapt, lets us improve.\nIndeed, on all four of the priorities that I\u2019ve set out today \u2013 using technology to improve our people\u2019s lives in tangible ways, establishing rights-respecting rules for emerging technologies, investing in our innovation, and countering authoritarian governments\u2019 use of digital tools to abuse people and weaken democracies \u2013 on every single one of those lines of effort, our success ultimately depends on working effectively together.\nTo pass the test, we have to continue to build and broaden coalitions of allies and partners who share our democratic values, who are committed to putting them at the heart of our shared technological future.\u00a0 Whether they\u2019re in government or civil society, whether they\u2019re innovators or regulators, academics or activists, or simply citizens \u2013 we\u2019re counting on them, we\u2019re counting on you, to be part of this collective effort.\nAnd in fact, that\u2019s exactly what we see in the group gathered at the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what gives us confidence that our democracies will not only survive a truly unprecedented period of technological transformation, but \u2013 but \u2013 shape it to the benefit of our people and to people around the world.\nThanks so much for being here.\u00a0 Thanks so much for taking part in the summit, and I\u2019m now looking forward to a conversation with some colleagues.\u00a0 Thanks very much, everyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the State Department and welcome to the second Summit for Democracy.\nJen, to you for your remarkable leadership at the White House Gender Policy Council; to Kat, for yours here at the State Department on Global Women\u2019s Issues:\u00a0 We could not have a better team, a more dynamic duo, leading our efforts.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful to each of you every day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019re joined in-person and virtually by government leaders from around the world, as well as partners from across the United States Government, multilateral organizations, civil society.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for all the work that you\u2019ve doing every single day to advance women\u2019s equality and thereby advance democracy.\u00a0 These two things are inexorably linked, as you\u2019ve already heard.\nThe President has long believed that democracies are strengthened by the active participation of all citizens, particularly women and girls.\u00a0 And since day one, he\u2019s made advancing women\u2019s and girls\u2019 civic and political engagement a top priority of this administration.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re kicking off this session as one of the summit\u2019s first events \u2013 because the status of women is indeed the status of democracy.\nWe all know in this room and everyone who\u2019s listening in the rights of women in many parts of the world are under threat and under attack.\u00a0 Repressive governments are passing targeted laws to restrict women\u2019s fundamental freedoms, including the right to free speech and assembly.\u00a0 Extremist actors are disproportionately targeting women and girls, especially those from historically marginalized identities like LGBTQI+ people, women from racial, ethnic, and religious communities.\nBut it\u2019s not just in autocracies that women are being denied their full and equal rights.\u00a0 In far too many parts of the world, women and girls still do not have equal opportunities to study and work.\u00a0 Women journalists, advocates, politicians, and others are subject to persistent online harassment and abuse.\u00a0 Women who are victims of violence often do not have equal access to justice.\u00a0 Women are subject to discrimination that often puts them at a disadvantage \u2013 whether through double standards they face in the workplace, in access to reproductive rights, or in nationality laws, which can result in barriers to accessing education, health care, and property for themselves and for their families.\nBut, in the face of these forces, women and girls are leading the charge for their rights and for human rights and democracy around the world.\u00a0 And they\u2019re demonstrating the importance of having women at the decision-making table.\nIn Afghanistan \u2013 in the face of the Taliban\u2019s daily efforts to erase them from daily life \u2013 women are still protesting.\u00a0 They\u2019re still finding ways to document human rights abuses.\u00a0 They are still fighting for a brighter future for their country.\nIn Iran, courageous women are marching in the streets, under great threat to themselves, to call for \u201cwoman, life, and freedom.\u201d\nThe United States stands in solidarity with these women and all who are working for women\u2019s full, free, and equal participation around the world.\u00a0 Through our diplomacy, we\u2019re committed to supporting them and advancing gender equality worldwide.\nAt the last Summit for Democracy, the United States launched our \u201cSupport Her Empowerment \u2013 Women\u2019s Inclusion in New Security,\u201d or \u201cSHE WINS,\u201d as the acronym appropriately has it.\u00a0 This initiative, which supports local women and women-led civil society organizations \u2013 we\u2019re working to increase women\u2019s political and civic participation in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Papua New Guinea, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.\nIn partnership with Denmark, we\u2019ve also been leading the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse, a coalition of 12 countries focused on countering technology-facilitated gender-based violence.\nSoon, you\u2019ll be hearing from leaders like Phumzile Van Damme, a former parliamentarian in South Africa who shared her experiences as a target of online harassment \u2013 and who now works to combat this scourge, including as part of the Advisory Group to the Global Partnership.\nWe\u2019re heartened by the Global Partnership\u2019s initial progress over the past year.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen some member countries increase resources to combatting this issue at home, including by providing more trainings for those in the legal and justice systems, as well as for advocates working with survivors of online harassment.\u00a0 And it is so vitally important that their voices be heard and fully inform our efforts.\u00a0 Others are beginning to collect data to better measure online abuse and its effects.\u00a0 And as a whole, the Global Partnership has worked to build consensus on shared principles to better identify, prevent, and combat this urgent issue at venues from the G7 to the United Nations.\nSo today we have an opportunity to recognize some of these successes, but also \u2013 also \u2013 to recommit to the work that lies ahead in advancing gender equality.\nWhen we succeed, we not only do the right thing, but we also do the smart and necessary thing to make our countries more prosperous, to make them more secure, to make them a little bit more full of opportunity for all of our people.\u00a0 With the group that\u2019s assembled here, we\u2019ve got everything we need to continue making progress toward what is for us an absolutely essential goal.\nSo to each of you who is here today, to each of you who is listening in, thank you again for what you\u2019re doing every single day to advance this agenda.\u00a0 And thank you for helping us kick off the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 Again, what we\u2019re doing here today, what we\u2019ll be doing for the next few days, these are fully joined.\u00a0 And I can think of no more appropriate, no more important way, to kick off the summit than with all of you here today.\nSo welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking forward to some great discussions.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"speaker": "Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State",
		"audience": "FREEDOM ONLINE COALITION EVENT ATLANTIC COUNCIL",
		"location": "Washington, DC",
		"date": "March 27, 2023",
		"content": "\n\nGood afternoon. It\u2019s good to be with you. Thank you, Rose, for your introduction and for all of the work that the Freedom Online Coalition is doing.\nIt is fitting to be here at the Atlantic Council for this event, because your mission sums up our purpose perfectly: \u201cshaping the global future together.\u201d\nThat is our fundamental charge in the field of technology and democracy\u2014how we use modern innovations to forge a better future.\nThat\u2019s what the DFR Lab strives to achieve through your research and advocacy. That\u2019s what the Freedom Online Coalition, its members, observers, and Advisory Network seek to accomplish through our work. Thank you for your partnership.\nMore than five decades ago\u2014seems like a long time ago, but really, very short\u2014the internet found its origins in the form of the first online message ever sent\u2014all of two letters in length, delivered from a professor at UCLA to colleagues at Stanford.\nIt was part of a project conceived in university labs and facilitated by government. It was an effort meant to test the outer limits of rapidly evolving technologies and tap into the transformative power of swiftly growing computer networks.\nWhat these pioneers intended, at the time, was actually to devise a system that could allow people to communicate in the event of a nuclear attack or another catastrophic event.\nYet what they created changed everything. How we live and work. How we participate in our economy and our politics. How we organize movements. How we consume media, read books, order groceries, pay bills, run businesses, conduct research, learn, write, and do nearly anything we can think of.\nChange didn\u2019t happen overnight, of course, and that change came with both promise and peril.\nThis was a remarkable feat of scientific discovery, and it upended life as we know it, for better and sometimes worse. Over the years, as we went from search engines to social media, we started to face complicated questions, as leaders, as parents and grandparents, as members of the global community.\nQuestions about how the internet can best be utilized; how it should be governed; who might misuse it; how it impacts our children\u2019s mental and emotional health; who could access it and how we can ensure that access is equitable, benefitting people in big cities, rural areas, and everywhere in between.\nBig picture questions arose about these tectonic shifts\u2014what they would mean for our values and our systems of government. Whether it\u2019s the internet as we understand it today or artificial intelligence revolutionizing our world tomorrow, will digital tools create more democracy or less? Will they be deployed to maximize human rights or limit them? Will they be used to enlarge the circle of freedom or constrain and contract it?\nFor the United States, the Freedom Online Coalition, and likeminded partners, the answers should point in a clear direction: at a basic level, the internet should be open and secure for everyone. It should be a force for free enterprise and free expression.\nIt should be a vast forum that increases connectivity; that expands people\u2019s ability to exercise their rights; that facilitates unfettered access to knowledge and unprecedented opportunities for billions.\nMeeting that standard, however, is not simple. Change that happens this fast in society and reaches this far into our lives rarely yields a straightforward response, especially when there are those who seek to manipulate technology for nefarious ends.\nThe fact is, where all of us may strive to ensure technology delivers for our citizens, autocratic regimes are finding another means of repression.\nWhere democracies seek to tap into the power of the internet to lift individuals up to their highest potential, authoritarian governments seek to deploy these technologies to divide and disenfranchise; to censor and suppress; to limit freedoms, foment fear, and violate human dignity.\nThey view the internet not as a network of empowerment, but as an avenue of control. From Cuba and Venezuela to Iran, Russia, the PRC, and beyond, they see new ways to crush dissent through internet shutdowns, virtual blackouts, restricted networks, blocked websites, and more.\nHere in the United States, alongside many of you, we have acted to sustain connections to internet-based services and the free flow of information across the globe, so no one is cut off from each other or the outside world, or cut off from the truth.\nYet even with these steps, none of us are perfect.\nEvery day\u2014almost everywhere we look\u2014democracies grapple with how to harness data for positive ends while preserving privacy; how to bring out the best in modern innovations without amplifying their worst possibilities; how to protect the most vulnerable online while defending the liberties we hold dear.\nIt isn\u2019t an easy task\u2014and in many respects, as I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s only getting harder.\nThe growth of surveillance capabilities is forcing us to constantly reevaluate how to strike the balance between using technologies for public safety and preserving personal liberties.\nThe advent of AI is arriving with a level of speed and sophistication we haven\u2019t witnessed before. It will not be five decades before we know the impact of AI. That impact is happening now.\nWho creates it, who controls it, who manipulates it will help define the next phase of the intersection between technology and democracy. By the time we realize AI\u2019s massive reach and potential, the internet\u2019s influence might really pale in comparison.\nThe digital sphere is evolving at a pace we can\u2019t fully fathom and in ways at least I can\u2019t completely imagine. Frankly, we have to accept the fact that the FOC\u2019s absolutely vital work can feel like a continuous game of catchup. We have to acknowledge that the guidelines we adopt today might seem outdated as soon as tomorrow.\nNow, let me be perfectly clear: I am not saying we should throw our hands in the air and give up. To the contrary: I\u2019m suggesting that this is a massive challenge we have to confront and a generational charge we have to embrace.\nWe have to set standards that meet this moment\u2014and that lay the foundation for whatever comes next. We have to address what we see in front of us\u2014and equip ourselves with the building blocks to tackle what we cannot predict.\nTo put a spin on a famous phrase: with the great power of these digital tools comes great responsibility to use that power for good.\nThat duty falls on all our shoulders, and the stakes could not be higher for internet freedom, for our common prosperity, for global progress.\nBecause expanded connectivity\u2014getting the two billion unconnected people online\u2014can drive economic growth; raise standards of living; create jobs; and fuel innovative solutions for everything from combating climate change to reducing food insecurity to improving public health to promoting good governance and sustainable development.\nSo we need to double-down on what we stand for: an affirmative, cohesive, values-driven, rights-respecting vision for democracy in the digital era.\nWe need to reinforce rules of the road for cyberspace that mirror and match the ideals of the rules-based international order.\nWe need to be ready to adapt our legal and policy approaches for emerging technologies.\nWe need the FOC, alongside partners in civil society, industry, and elsewhere, to remain an essential vehicle for keeping the digital sphere open, secure, interoperable, and reliable.\nThe United States believes in this cause as a central plank of our democracy and of our diplomacy.\nThat\u2019s why Secretary Blinken established our Department\u2019s Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy\u2014and made digital freedom one of its core priorities.\nThat\u2019s why the Biden-Harris Administration spearheaded and signed onto the principles in the Declaration for the Future of the Internet, alongside 61 countries ready to advance a positive vision for digital technologies.\nThat\u2019s why we released core principles for tech platform accountability last fall, and why the President called on Congress to take bipartisan action in January.\nThat\u2019s why we are committed to using our turn as FOC Chair as a platform to advance a series of key goals.\nFirst, we will deepen efforts to protect fundamental freedoms, including human rights defenders online and offline\u2014many of whom speak out at grave risk to their own lives and to their families\u2019 safety. We will do so by countering disruptions to internet access, combating internet shutdowns, and ensuring everyone\u2019s ability to keep using technology to advance the reach of freedom.\nSecond, we will focus on building resilience against the rise of digital authoritarianism, the proliferation of commercial spyware, and the misuse of technology, which we know has disproportionate and chilling impacts on journalists, activists, women, and LGBTQI+ individuals.\nTo that end, just a few hours ago, President Biden issued an Executive Order that, for the first time, will prohibit our government\u2019s use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our national security\u2014or that\u2019s been misused by foreign actors to enable human rights abuses overseas.\nOn top of that step, as part of this week\u2019s Summit for Democracy, the members of the FOC and other partners will lay out a set of Guiding Principles on Government Use of Surveillance Technologies.\nThese principles describe responsible practices for the use of surveillance tech. They reflect democratic values and the rule of law; adhere to international obligations; strive to address the disparate effect on certain communities; and minimize the data collected.\nOur third objective as FOC Chair focuses on artificial intelligence. and the way emerging technologies respect human rights.\nAs some try to apply AI to help automate censorship of content and suppression of free expression, FOC members must build a consensus around policies to limit these abuses.\nFinally, we will strengthen our efforts on digital inclusion. On closing the gender gap online. On expanding digital literacy and skill building. On promoting access to safe online spaces and robust civic participation for all, particularly women and girls, LGBTQI+ persons, those with disabilities, and more.\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: the FOC\u2019s work is essential, and its impact will boil down to what we do, as a coalition, to advance a simple but powerful idea\u2014preserving and promoting the value of openness.\nThe internet, the web, the online universe is at its best when it is open for creativity and collaboration. Open for innovation and ideas. Open for communication and community, debate and discourse, disagreement and diplomacy.\nThe same is true for democracy\u2014a system of governance, a social contract, and a societal structure that is strongest when defined by open spaces to vote, deliberate, gather, demonstrate, organize, and advocate.\nThis openness could not be more important. Because when the digital world is transparent. when democracy is done right\u2014that\u2019s when everyone has a stake in our collective success.\nThat\u2019s what makes everyone strive for a society that is free and fair, in our politics and in cyberspace.\nThat\u2019s what will give everyone reason to keep tapping into the positive potential of technology to forge a future of endless possibility and boundless prosperity for all.\nLet\u2019s keep shaping that future, together.\nSo, good luck with all your remaining work. There\u2019s lots ahead. And thank you so much for all that you do.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Good morning. Buenos d\u00edas. I would like to welcome all of you, especially our guests from Colombia. Bienvenidos a todos. This is the 10th year we mark the \u2013 this High-Level Dialogue, and we are honored to host this year. The High-Level Dialogues present remarkable opportunities to engage at a deeper level on our shared interests. The dialogue continues to speak to the strength of the bonds between our two countries. We are especially honored today by the presence of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who will formally open the dialogue.\nMr. Secretary, welcome.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good morning, everyone. Wonderful to see you all here. And to our friends from Colombia, bienvenido. I just am particularly pleased to do this because I also have a little history with this. In fact, I\u2019ve taken part in these dialogues going back to 2015 and 2016 when I was deputy secretary of state. So as Brian said, this has been an ongoing and, I believe, very important process between our two countries.\nA very special welcome, \u00c1lvaro, to you. Wonderful to have you here for what is indeed the 10th dialogue between \u2013 High-Level Dialogue between our countries.\nI had the opportunity to lead our delegation to the last dialogue, in Bogot\u00e1, in 2021, and it\u2019s a testament to the strength of the relationship that this exchange, as I said, has continued, and indeed has expanded, across administrations in both of our nations.\nThe dialogue \u2013 like a two-centuries-old friendship \u2013 is built on a shared foundation of two vibrant democracies committed to ensuring that our people can reach their full potential.\nWe recognize that when it comes to tackling the global challenges that are affecting the lives of Colombians and Americans alike \u2013 from the existential threat posed by climate change to the unprecedented movement of people across our hemisphere \u2013 we\u2019re simply better off when we\u2019re tackling these challenges together. And the ripple effects of our cooperation on these and other issues extend far beyond our two countries. They extend to the hemisphere; indeed they extend to the world.\nAcross the upcoming dialogue, we will focus on concrete steps to strengthen our cooperation and work to deliver tangible results for our people. So let me just take a few minutes to highlight some of the areas where we are going to work to do that.\nWe\u2019ll continue working to help Colombia reach its ambitious climate goals, from providing ongoing technical assistance on wind and solar projects to strengthening protection of the Amazon.\nWe\u2019ll expand pathways for farmers, for textile producers, and other small- and medium-sized businesses in rural areas to get their products to global markets, and reap the benefits of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement.\nOur dialogue will also focus, of course, on improving civilian security. For decades, we have worked to strengthen cooperation on security and law enforcement, and that will continue.\nAt the same time, we recognize that to sustainably reduce violence, we have to tackle the root causes of insecurity \u2013 like corruption, like impunity \u2013 impunity for crimes \u2013 human rights abuses, and the lack of economic opportunity.\nThat\u2019s why we continue to partner on bolstering the rule of law and expanding access to justice. And it\u2019s also why USAID is investing $60 million over five years to expand opportunities for Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities.\nEnsuring equitable development is a central focus of the Ethnic Chapter of the 2016 Peace Accord. It recognizes that there can be no lasting peace without justice and equality for the country\u2019s underserved communities. Back in October, I joined Vice President Marquez at the extraordinary Fragmentos Museum; I had the honor of signing the United States on as the chapter\u2019s first international accompanier.\nAmbassador Murillo \u2013 who is here today \u2013 was with us in Bogot\u00e1 on that historic day. He has dedicated much of his life to giving voice to these communities, including the Ethnic Chapter.\nIn the time since we signed on as an accompanier, the U.S. embassy in Colombia, led by our Charg\u00e9 Michael[1] Palmieri, who is with us here today as well, has dedicated a full team supporting the Ethnic Chapter\u2019s implementation, building on our longstanding partnerships with both Colombia\u2019s Government and with civil society. And let me just give one example of those relationships.\nA few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to join our First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, in honoring International Women of Courage at the White House. The awardees included Josefina Klinger, a remarkable Afro-Colombia leader who rallied her community around transforming the national park where they live into an ecotourism destination, preserving the environment, providing a sustainable livelihood to local families.\nFor years, we have been a proud supporter of her organization, including when she was threatened by drug trafficking organizations for the work that she was doing.\nCountering these illicit groups and the flow of illegal drugs is a key part of our ongoing discussions on security, including here at the High-Level Dialogue. We\u2019re bringing a holistic approach to this challenge.\nThat means looking at ways to further reduce demand by investing in substance abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery for those who are struggling with addiction in our countries \u2013 because this is fundamentally a public health problem.\nAnd it means discussing ways to reduce supply \u2013 from strengthening interdiction by land and sea, to providing vulnerable communities with alternative ways to earn a living.\nThe dialogue also gives us an opportunity to deepen our joint efforts to address unprecedented migration across our hemisphere. Indeed, we are all experiencing unprecedented migration around the world. There are more people on the move, forcibly deplaced from their homes around the world \u2013 more than 100 million \u2013 than at any time since we\u2019ve been recording these numbers. Colombia was a crucial partner in shaping the Los Angeles Declaration, which has put its principles into practice in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. More than 1.5 million Venezuelans have been granted Temporary Protective Status in Colombia, allowing them to work, to send their kids to school, to access public health services.\nHere again, I had a chance to meet last time I was in Bogot\u00e1 with some Venezuelan families \u2013 this is back in October at the integrata centers \u2013 and heard first-hand how TPS has allowed them to become productive members of their new communities. Colombia is showing the way that migration, when it\u2019s managed safely, humanely, and as a region, can actually increase stability and can be an opportunity, not a burden, for communities.\nThe United States has been a steadfast partner in these efforts, providing more than $900 million in humanitarian, economic, development, and health assistance to Colombia, to help Colombia address the consequences of the Venezuela crisis.\nNext month, we will host our first-ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver, Colorado. The mayor of Bogot\u00e1, my host at the integrata center, will be there, along with the mayors of Cartagena, Barranquilla, dozens of other cities across the hemisphere, including in the United States. This summit will allow them to share best practices in tackling many of the issues that we discuss here.\nI think one of the things we know is that there needs to be and there is an integrated response across national governments, but these challenges also have answers in work \u2013 at a subnational level, between and among municipalities, between municipalities and the federal government, states, et cetera. Again, it\u2019s a reminder that important as this dialogue between our national governments is, there are U.S.-Colombian dialogues at every level of our societies \u2013 between our governments, businesses, civil society, and directly between our citizens.\nAnd I\u2019m convinced, based on the experience that we\u2019ve had over many years, that these dialogues are one of the most important ways to actually benefit our people, to benefit our communities, to benefit the region that we share.\nSo with that, thank you all for being here, thank you for your participation, for all the hard work that\u2019s gone into today, for all the hard work that will continue today and in the days that follow.\nAnd with that, \u00c1lvaro, the floor is yours. (Applause.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER LEYVA: (Via interpreter) Mr. Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken, it is a great honor for me to be here with you. I\u2019d first like to extend greetings from President Petro, and to, of course, President Biden. We are allies. And this is not new; we\u2019ve been for a long time. We are actually on the tenth High-Level Dialogue, and I have to say it\u2019s impressive. Look at the delegation we\u2019re bringing to you. Behind each and every one of these people there\u2019s a wise person, and I\u2019m not exaggerating. People who have great reputation on the moral and intellectual levels, and they have devoted their careers to the seven points that once again bring us here, which are the social and economic opportunities; public diplomacy; the environment and climate change; energy, mining, and infrastructure; democracy, good governance, and human rights; security, counternarcotics, and rural development; and migration.\nThese are issues that in the eighth and ninth dialogues were there, but they didn\u2019t have the significance that they have today. Today there\u2019s a geopolitical dimension; new things are happening every day; new visions are crystallizing on each one of these topics. And so today\u2019s conference goes beyond expectations. We are allies; we truly are, because we acknowledge that we have a new role in this world. Just to give you an example, we used to be a nation known for cocaine, but now we are one of the biggest sponges when it comes to observing solutions for seeking ways of putting an end to the disappearance of humankind. We\u2019re saving the planet, and so our relationship is thus modified. Because there\u2019s a new head of state, he has a discourse, but it\u2019s not surprising \u2013 there will never be a surprise coming from my administration, in our relationships, and certainly not with \u2013 in our relationships with our longtime allies, such as the United States.\nThis brings me to manifest something that is very important: migration. Migration is a political issue for many countries \u2013 for us, for the United States, for Mexico. That\u2019s why the President has managed to convince Mexico of the importance of celebrating as soon as possible a Latin American conference on migration.\nBangladesh had never been through Colombia. Afghanistan had never gone through Colombia. China had never gone through Colombia. But they\u2019re coming through Colombia too on their way north, and they\u2019re coming back. We not only have the migrants coming from Venezuela, which of course has its own circumstances, but we\u2019re seeing a phenomenon that touches the whole planet. So I wanted to tell you that, just as Mr. Petro said, we are going to celebrate that conference on migration as soon as possible.\nThe conference on drug trafficking \u2013 that stopped being a Colombian topic. There is a multinational organization that is impacting the globe. We saw that in Ecuador. In one single day, 11 attacks that left people dead. Talking to people \u2013 Lula, right after he took charge, he said, \u201cPresident Petro, Brazil \u2013 in Brazil the multinational drug enterprise is creating problems for us. We have to attack them with intelligence.\u201d So how best to do this? By using the knowledge that Colombia has and creating and celebrating a conference on migration that involves the whole continent to discuss drug trafficking, and we will not only comply with what was said in Havana, but also we will analyze demand because we\u2019re all in the same boat here. I think it\u2019s of the utmost importance to highlight the call that President Petro has placed upon all of us.\nIn terms of fighting greenhouse emissions, something completely new, we are going to hold \u2013 and I think Canada has already said yes \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a conference on the power interconnection grid from Patagonia, just so we can bring to the North electricity coming from renewal \u2013 clean energy methods. This is just to say that this High-Level Dialogue goes beyond business as usual, and we are going to need the U.S. to be present, to be by our side in each and every one of these topics, because we are the same people, the same continent, the same security, the same issues \u2013 perhaps a little bigger now up north, of course, given the global responsibility that the U.S. has in its role in the world. But each one of the people that you see here is an ally, and they can bring solutions \u2013 definitive solutions to the problems that are afflicting the world.\nI am very thankful for your presence. Please take into consideration this new vision that President Petro is bringing. He is trying his best to deal with continental circumstances, to deal with the problems afflicting humanity, and of course to deal with problems that are also happening in the U.S. We\u2019re all in the same boat, and we are guided by the same goal.\nThank you for being here today. (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Thank you, Foreign Minister Leyva. Thank you, Secretary Blinken. And with that powerful introduction, I have the honor to declare the 10th High-Level Dialogue open. I expect great things, and I am sure that you will deliver for both of our peoples.\nHave a great day. (Applause.)\n\nFrancisco \u2191\n\n\n",

committee,\u00a0thank you for the opportunity today to speak with you about the FY24 budget for the State Department and USAID. \u00a0But also, thank you day-in, day-out for the work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 This is critical for us.\u00a0 We appreciate deeply the work of this committee, and I really look forward to the year ahead as we work together to try to make sure, together, that we have the strongest possible tools to advance America\u2019s interests around the world.\nAnd second, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Lee, thank you for \u2013 both of you \u2013 for your strong and positive words about the State Department \u2013 the people of the State Department.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u00a0 I am so deeply honored for this period of time to be leading them and serving with them.\u00a0 And I deeply appreciate the appreciation you\u2019ve expressed for the work that they do, day-in, day-out.\u00a0 So thank you for that.\nAnd I could not agree more \u2013 we are at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over, and there is an intense competition underway right now to shape what comes next.\u00a0 The United States has a positive vision for the future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, that is prosperous.\nThis budget will help us advance that vision and deliver on the issues that matter to the American people, by preparing us to take on two major sets of challenges that are distinct but also interconnected and overlapping.\nThe first set is posed by our strategic competitors \u2013 the immediate, acute threat posed by Russia\u2019s autocracy and aggression, most destructively through its brutal aggression against Ukraine, and of course, the long-term challenge that is posed by the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nThe second set of challenges is posed by shared global tests that we have to meet, including the climate crisis, migration, food and energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly affect the lives of our fellow citizens, as well as their livelihoods, and people around the world.\nWith this committee\u2019s leadership and support, including through the FY23 Omnibus, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical position than we were a few years ago to take on these challenges.\u00a0 We have drawn enormous power from investments that we\u2019ve made here at home in our economic strength and technological edge, including through the Infrastructure Investment Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has never been stronger, and I think that\u2019s in part because we have reinvested in them, working to re-engage them, rejuvenate them, re-energize them.\nWe\u2019re expanding our presence in critical regions, like the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And we\u2019re leading unprecedented coalitions to confront aggression and address humanitarian crises around the world.\nThe FY24 budget request for the State Department and USAID meets this moment.\u00a0 The budget will sustain our security, our economic and energy and humanitarian support for Ukraine, so that we ensure that President Putin\u2019s war remains a strategic failure.\nThe budget will also strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC.\u00a0 President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 That\u2019s why this proposal asks for an 18 percent increase in our budget for that region for FY \u2013 over FY23.\u00a0 The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory proposals \u2013 I suspect we\u2019ll come back to those \u2013 for new, innovative investments to outcompete China, including by enhancing our presence in the region, ensuring that what we and our fellow democracies have to offer \u2013 including things like maritime security, disease surveillance, energy infrastructure, digital technology \u2013 is more attractive than the alternative being proposed.\nThe budget will help us push back on advancing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening democracies around the world including through supporting independent media, countering corruption, defending free and fair elections.\u00a0 And it will allow us to pay our contributions to international organizations because we do need to be at the table wherever and whenever new international rules, standards, norms are being decided that affect the livelihoods of our people.\u00a0 Wherever they\u2019re being debated and decided, we need to be there.\nThe budget will also allow us to continue leading the world in addressing these global challenges, from food and energy insecurity to climate and health crises.\u00a0 Just on that last point: we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which I believe is one the greatest achievements in our foreign policy over the last couple of decades.\u00a0 And to Ranking Member Lee, to you and others, for your strong support and leadership on this, I think it\u2019s been a great tribute and credit to our country.\u00a0 It\u2019s something I hear, as I travel, for example, throughout Africa.\u00a0 It saved 25 million lives.\u00a0 This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/AIDS while advancing health security more broadly through a new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I look forward to working with Congress to establish this year.\nThe budget will advance our efforts to modernize our department, including by expanding our training float, updating our technology, carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, including to make our overseas missions more accessible.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful for the progress that we\u2019ve already made together, including Congress\u2019s support in updating the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and the Accountability Review Board, to give us the flexibility to open new missions and to better manage the risks that our people face around the world.\nWe know there\u2019s more to do, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with Congress, working with this committee, to accelerate modernization efforts so that the department can better attract, retain, and support our first-rate workforce that you referred to.\u00a0 We\u2019re in a competition there, too, for talent, and I want to make sure we have a department that attracts that workforce and keeps them.\nFinally, the budget will further what is a personal priority for me that\u2019s been referenced today already, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan allies.\u00a0 Keeping our promises to those who stood by us and served with us remains an unwavering priority for me.\u00a0 The budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.\nWhen I took on this role, one of the things that I was dead serious about was working to restore Congress\u2019s place as an equal partner in our foreign policymaking.\u00a0 I really am serious and committed to that.\u00a0 I, Mr. Chairman, deeply appreciate the conversations we\u2019ve had and the work that I hope we can do together.\nSo with that, I welcome questions, comments.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Chairman, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 To you, to Ranking Member Meeks, to all the members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about the administration\u2019s proposed FY24 budget for the State Department and the Agency for International Development.\nLet me say at the outset that I join both of you \u2013 I join every member of this committee \u2013 in saluting all of our veterans of Afghanistan, saluting those who lost their lives, gave their lives, so that their fellow citizens could enjoy a greater measure of security, and particularly the presence of Sergeant Gee\u2019s mother here today; I am humble in your presence.\u00a0 I think of the 13.\u00a0 I think of the 2,402 Americans who lost their lives over 20 years in Afghanistan, serving and protecting our country.\u00a0 I think of the 20,000-plus wounded.\u00a0 And I think of so many others who served and have injuries of a different kind, including members of my State Department team.\u00a0 And I join you, Mr. Chairman, I join you, Ranking Member Meeks, I think I join every member of this committee in being determined that we look \u2013 not only look but draw the lessons from 20 years, including the last year in Afghanistan.\nWe do meet at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War world is over.\u00a0 There is an intense competition underway to determine what comes next.\u00a0 The United States has a positive vision for the future: a world that is free, that is open, secure, and that\u2019s prosperous.\nThe budget that we put before you will, in our judgment, advance that vision and deliver on the issues that matter most to the American people by preparing us to meet two major sets of challenges that are distinct but also overlapping.\nThe first set is posed by our strategic competitors \u2013 the immediate, acute threat posed by Russia\u2019s autocracy and aggression, most destructively through this brutal war of aggression against Ukraine, and the long-term challenge from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nThe second set is posed by a series of shared global tests, including the climate crisis, migration, food and energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly impact the lives and the livelihoods of Americans and people around the world.\nWith this committee\u2019s leadership and support across two State Department authorization bills, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical position than we were two years ago to address these challenges.\nWe\u2019ve drawn enormous power from investments that we\u2019ve made in our economic strength and technological edge here at home, including through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\u00a0 Our unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has grown stronger \u2013 in fact, they have never been stronger.\u00a0 We\u2019re expanding our presence in critical regions, like the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We are leading unprecedented coalitions, including a number of new ones, to confront aggression and to address humanitarian crises around the world.\nThe President\u2019s FY24 Budget, the requests for the State Department and USAID meet this moment head on.\nThe budget will sustain our security, economic, energy, and humanitarian support for Ukraine to ensure that President Putin\u2019s war remains a strategic failure.\nThe budget will also strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC.\u00a0 President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is why this proposal asks for an 18 percent increase in our budget for that region over FY23.\u00a0 The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory proposals for new, innovative investments to outcompete China \u2013 including by enhancing our presence in the region, ensuring what we and our fellow democracies have to offer, including things like maritime security, disease surveillance, clean energy infrastructure, digital technology, is more attractive than the alternative being proposed to them.\nThe budget will help us push back on advancing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening democracies around the world, including through supporting independent media, countering corruption, defending free and fair elections.\u00a0 And it will allow us to pay our contributions to international organizations, because the United States needs to be at the table wherever and whenever new international rules that affect the livelihoods of our

accelerate modernization efforts so that the department can better attract, retain, as well as support our first-rate workforce as they advance our interests in what is a very complex and fast-moving world.\nFinally, the budget will further a personal priority for me that I know is shared by the leadership and the members of this committee, and that is supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan allies.\u00a0 Keeping our promises to those who served the U.S. remains an unwavering priority; this budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.\nMr. Chairman, when I began this role, I committed to working to really restore the partnership between the Executive Branch and Congress when it comes to our foreign policymaking.\nI\u2019m determined to continue to work with you, the ranking member, the members of this committee, to do that, and I very much look forward to the close coordination over the coming year.\u00a0 Grateful for the chance to appear before you today and to answer any questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

committee members here today, thank you for this opportunity to speak with you about our proposed FY24 budget for the State Department and USAID.\nAnd I think as you\u2019ve both laid out in different ways, we are meeting at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over, and there is an intense competition underway to shape, to determine what comes next.\nWe, the United States, have a positive vision for the future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, that is prosperous.\u00a0\u00a0 And it\u2019s our belief that the budget that we put forward will help advance that

remarks and take a couple of questions before he has to head back upstairs for some engagements.\u00a0 Assistant Secretary Barclay and Ambassador Van Schaack, though, will hang back downstairs to answer some more Q&A once the Secretary departs.\nSecretary, the floor is yours.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Vedant, thank you.\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\nLet me just start with some very good news this morning, and that is the release of Jeffrey Woodke after more than six years in captivity.\u00a0 I want to thank the Government of Niger, where I was just last week, for its important assistance in bringing him home.\u00a0 I also want to thank our team, starting with Special Envoy Roger Carstens, all of those who have been working at the department to bring him home, tireless efforts, and I\u2019m very pleased that we are now seeing that come to fruition today.\nAs you know, I have no higher priority or focus than bringing home any unjustly detained American, wherever that is in the world.\u00a0 We won\u2019t rest until they\u2019re all home and, like Jeffrey, reunited with their families.\nThis morning, I\u2019ll be launching the 2022 Human Rights Report.\u00a0 But just before I turn to that, I want to speak to what\u2019s happening right now in Moscow.\nToday, and throughout this week, President Xi is meeting with President Putin in Russia.\u00a0 We expect that China may use this visit to reiterate calls for a ceasefire under its peace proposal.\nThe United States welcomes any initiative that advances a just and durable peace.\u00a0 China\u2019s proposal includes elements that we have long supported, including ensuring nuclear safety, resolving the humanitarian crisis, protecting civilians.\nAnd indeed, the first element calls for upholding sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all countries.\nThe fundamental element of any plan for ending the war in Ukraine and producing a just and durable peace must be upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nAny plan that does not prioritize this critical principle is a stalling tactic at best or is merely seeking to facilitate an unjust outcome.\u00a0 That is not constructive diplomacy.\nCalling for a ceasefire that does not include the removal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory would effectively be supporting the ratification of Russian conquest.\u00a0 It would recognize Russia\u2019s attempts to seize a sovereign neighbor\u2019s territory by force.\u00a0 It would enable Russia to further entrench positions in Ukraine.\u00a0 And a ceasefire now, without a durable solution, would allow President Putin to rest and refit his troops and then restart the war at a time more advantageous to Russia.\nThe world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia \u2013 supported by China or any other country \u2013 to freeze the war on its own terms.\u00a0 Such a move would violate the UN Charter and delay \u2013 defy, excuse me \u2013 the will of the 141 countries who have condemned Russia\u2019s war in the United Nations General Assembly.\nOne party to this conflict \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 has already put forward a just peace formula.\u00a0 If China is committed to supporting an end to the war based on the principles of the UN Charter as called for in point one of its plan, it can engage with President Zelenskyy and Ukraine on this basis and use its influence to compel Moscow to pull back its forces.\nRussia\u2019s purported annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, including vast areas it doesn\u2019t even control, and its ongoing, brutal attacks on civilians make clear that President Putin currently has no interest in such a peace.\nThat President Xi is traveling to Russia days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Putin suggests that China feels no responsibility to hold the Kremlin accountable for the atrocities committed in Ukraine, and instead of even condemning them, it would rather provide diplomatic cover for Russia to continue to commit those very crimes.\nNow, every year, I come to this podium for the launch of the Human Rights Report.\u00a0 I do so because the report embodies the importance of human rights for American diplomacy and for our vision of an open, free, prosperous, and secure world.\nHuman rights are universal.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t defined by any one country, philosophy, or region.\u00a0 They apply to everyone, everywhere.\nThis report makes a factual, objective, and rigorous accounting of human rights conditions around the world, looking at nearly 200 countries and territories.\u00a0 And, importantly, it applies the same standards to everyone: our allies and partners, and countries with which we have differences.\nThe goal of this report is not to lecture or to shame.\u00a0 Rather, it is to provide a resource for those individuals working around the world to safeguard and uphold human dignity when it\u2019s under threat in so many ways.\u00a0 And while this report looks outward to countries around the world, we know the United States faces its own set of challenges on human rights.\nOur willingness to confront our challenges openly, to acknowledge our own shortcomings \u2013 not to sweep them under the rug or pretend they don\u2019t exist \u2013 that is what distinguishes us and other democracies.\nThe report makes clear that, in 2022, in countries across every region, we continued to see a backsliding in human rights conditions \u2013 the closing of civic space, disrespect for fundamental human dignity.\nThe report details the appalling and ongoing abuses committed by the regime in Iran against its own people.\u00a0 In the wake of the tragic death of Mahsa Amini, authorities have killed hundreds of peaceful protestors, including dozens of children, and have arbitrarily detained thousands.\nIranian forces are using torture and gender-based violence against arrested protesters.\u00a0 Journalists and lawyers are harassed and pre-emptively detained.\u00a0 Sham trials and hasty executions are used to further intimidate the people of Iran.\nThe international community has come together to condemn and confront Iran\u2019s brutal crackdown, and we\u2019ll continue to act in support of the right of the Iranian people to speak out for their fundamental freedoms.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban relentlessly discriminates against and represses women and girls, so far issuing 80 decrees and \u2013 that restrict women\u2019s freedom of movement and their right to education and work.\u00a0 The Taliban\u2019s December edict barring female employees of non-governmental organizations from the workplace imperils the tens of millions of Afghans who depend on humanitarian assistance for their very survival.\nHuman rights have further eroded in Burma, where the military regime brutalizes the population.\u00a0 Thousands of activists have been killed by the authorities \u2013 including four pro-democracy leaders executed last summer.\nThe PRC continues its abuses, including genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs, repression of Tibetans, crackdown on basic rights in Hong Kong, and targeting of individuals on the mainland for exercising fundamental freedoms.\nIn Cuba, courts have issued draconian jail sentences to hundreds of people for protesting for their rights.\u00a0 And in Nicaragua, the authoritarian government continues to detain political prisoners and hold them in appalling prison conditions.\nThe 2022 Human Rights Report is also a reminder of the extraordinary courage of so many \u2013 activists, journalists, lawyers, government officials, regular citizens \u2013 who stand up to these abuses.\u00a0 Many do so at great personal risk of retaliation, harassment, detention, torture, even death.\nIn February, we celebrated ten Global Human Rights Defender awardees \u2013 individuals from around the world who are promoting and defending fundamental freedoms, from combatting slavery, to advocating for families of those forcibly disappeared, to demanding better wages and working conditions for low-income laborers, to representing political prisoners on death row.\u00a0 This report honors them.\nI\u2019m also proud of my colleagues here at the State Department \u2013 in Washington and at every post around the world \u2013 for not only reporting and documenting human rights abuses but also drawing on the power and purpose of American diplomacy to advance human dignity.\nNow, as you know, I recently traveled to Ethiopia, where I had a very productive discussion with Prime Minister Abiy and his team.\u00a0 I also met with Getachew Reda, the TPLF signatory to the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, who was just selected to be the leader of its interim administration.\u00a0 I commended both sides for reaching that agreement and the significant progress made in its implementation.\nWith this agreement in place, the fighting has stopped, humanitarian assistance is flowing, services are being restored, human rights[i] in northern Ethiopia are significantly down, Eritrean forces are leaving, the Ethiopian Government is taking the first steps toward transitional justice.\nBut, as I discussed with both sides during my visit, to build a durable peace, there must be acknowledgment of the atrocities committed by all parties, as well as accountability together with reconciliation.\nThe conflict in northern Ethiopia was devastating.\u00a0 Men, women, and children were killed.\u00a0 Women and girls were subject to horrific forms of sexual violence.\u00a0 Thousands were forcibly displaced from their homes.\u00a0 Entire communities were specifically targeted based on their ethnicity.\nMany of these actions were not random or a mere byproduct of war.\u00a0 They were calculated and deliberate.\nAfter the department\u2019s careful review of the law and the facts, I\u2019ve determined that members of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, Eritrean Defense Forces, Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front forces, and Amhara forces committed war crimes during the conflict in northern Ethiopia.\nMembers of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, the Eritrean Defense Forces, and Amhara forces also committed crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and persecution.\nMembers of the Amhara forces committed the crime against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer and committed ethnic cleansing through their treatment of Tigrayans in western Tigray.\nWe welcome the commitment that the parties to the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement have made to acknowledge the atrocities committed and their devastating consequences.\nThe Government of Ethiopia is taking the first steps by publicly releasing a detailed green paper of transitional justice options based upon best practices and building upon the experiences of other states emerging from periods of mass violence.\u00a0 It has invited experts from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to join the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to deploy a team of human rights monitors to conflict-affected areas to ensure that such acts have truly ceased.\nThe government is also holding public consultations about transitional justice, which, as I discussed with the prime minister, should be inclusive of all stakeholders and provide victims a voice.\u00a0 The process is benefiting from the advice of experts in the field, including members of my team who participated in a workshop on transitional justice with other international specialists just last week.\nFinally, and crucially, we urge the Government of Ethiopia and the Government of Eritrea, as well as the TPLF, to hold those responsible for these atrocities accountable.\nThese steps \u2013 acknowledgement, accountability, reconciliation \u2013 are key to breaking the cycle of ethnic and political violence that has gripped Ethiopia and prevented it from reaching its unlimited potential for so long.\nThe United States will partner with Ethiopia as it implements a credible transitional justice process for the benefit of all victims and affected communities.\u00a0 We will stand with Ethiopia as it honestly faces the abuses in its past, provides accountability for the harms committed against its citizens, and moves toward a future of lasting peace.\nWith that, happy to take a couple of questions before turning it over to my colleagues.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Matt, go ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and welcome back.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I\u2019ve got about 17 questions, but for the sake of \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Hold on, let me get my pen out.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But \u2013 yeah, but for the sake of both you and my colleagues, I\u2019ll narrow it down to just one.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And that has to do with the Ethiopia \u2013 and the decision you just made.\u00a0 As you noted, you were just there.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t you make this determination either while you were there or before you went?\u00a0 Were your conversations while you were there instructive in \u2013 did the \u2013 in making this?\nAnd then the other thing is \u2013 on this \u2013 you seem to suggest that you think that Ethiopian courts can take care \u2013 can deal with this.\u00a0 That is not so much the case as it relates to Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 And I \u2013 so I\u2019m just wondering why it is that you think that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Matt.\u00a0 Well, look, I\u2019m not \u2013 obviously not going to get into the details of private discussions that I had, but two things.\u00a0 First, this determination is the product of a lot of very deliberate, detailed work, and we are, when we make these determinations, very focused on doing that work, making sure that we have the facts, that we apply them to the law, and all of that takes time and focus.\nIt seemed appropriate to release the determination that we made as we\u2019re putting out the Human Rights Report.\u00a0 And beyond that, I\u2019d say that in terms of what happens next in Ethiopia, including what process they establish to provide for justice, for accountability, we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been determined.\u00a0 What has been determined and what I could see from my meetings and conversations last week is a commitment on all sides to engage in this process of transitional justice; an acknowledgement of the atrocities that have been committed \u2013 again, by all sides \u2013 in the course of this conflict in northern Ethiopia; and, I believe, a commitment to genuinely get to a better place that has to include accountability, that has to include, I think, reconciliation if we\u2019re going to have a truly durable peace.\nThat\u2019s what I heard on the trip, and again, I think the situation that we\u2019re seeing now in Ethiopia is vastly different than situations in other parts of the world in that, over the last four months, the steps that all sides have taken to implement the cessation of hostilities agreement has literally saved lives and changed lives for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t erase what happened over the last two years, which is why it is so important that we get this transitional justice process moving and that there is accountability as well as reconciliation.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Afghanistan?\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s go to Missy in the back.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Please, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Afghan situation also is very bad.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Any message for our new year?\u00a0 We celebrated our new year.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Nazira, I\u2019m going to call the questions.\u00a0 Missy, (inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Please \u2013 you guys don\u2019t give me opportunity.\u00a0 Any comment about Afghan women?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your message for our new year?\u00a0 We celebrated, but Afghan women crying.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, we \u2014\nQUESTION: \u00a0I know you don\u2019t give me a chance.\u00a0 Sorry, I have a lot of pain.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019ll say very simply \u2013 no, no, I\u2019m happy to address that.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say very simply that we deplore the edicts that the Taliban have promulgated repeatedly that fundamentally repress the rights of Afghan women and girls.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen this now time and again: denying them education, denying them the ability to work, denying them the ability to participate in the provision of humanitarian assistance that benefits all Afghans.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s safe to say from conversations with countries around the world that to the extent the Taliban is looking for more normal relations with countries around the world, that will not happen in so long as they continue to advance these repressive edicts against women and girls.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Missy, go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, thanks so much for coming to talk to us about the report.\u00a0 What would your response be to those that would say despite the content of the \u2013 contents of the report and despite all of the work that goes into it, that the issues that are flagged don\u2019t \u2013 are not sufficiently influencing policymaking, especially when it comes to countries where it is harder for the United States to have those tough discussions on human rights, like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Israel?\u00a0 What\u2019s your response to that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, we have those tough discussions across the board with friends, adversaries, competitors alike.\u00a0 So that \u2013 and the report itself makes that very clear.\u00a0 But in the day-in, day-out, it\u2019s the same thing.\u00a0 So we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not pulling our punches with anyone as \u2013 we call things as we see them.\u00a0 Sometimes we do it more publicly; sometimes we do it more privately.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to determine in each instance how we hopefully can be most effective in advancing human rights and advancing human dignity.\nSo I think it\u2019s safe to say, without getting into details, that we raise these concerns with everyone \u2013 again, friends, adversaries, competitors.\nAt the same time, as we\u2019re working in different ways with different countries, we have a multiplicity of interests that we\u2019re working on, and we always try to determine how we can most effectively advance them.\u00a0 Human rights is a central interest of ours; it\u2019s not the only one.\u00a0 And my responsibility is to make sure that we\u2019re doing our best to advance all of our interests however we can.\u00a0 But as this report makes clear \u2013 and it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s a very public report and that it applies the same standards to countries around the world, whatever their relationship with us \u2013 I think demonstrates the seriousness with which we take this issue.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave it in the very capable hands of my colleagues.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\n",

Those aggressions violate international law and the United Nations Charter, without which there cannot be an international community.\nThe United States, I would like to say it and recall it, as everybody knows is one of our major partners in terms of cooperation for development as well as in terms of cooperation for security and our security and defense.\u00a0\u00a0We have U.S. interventions in civil cooperation via the USAID efforts, that everybody here knows, as well as multifaceted efforts in priority sectors of our country.\u00a0\u00a0We also have United States action as part of our MCC national compact, which also works in priority sectors such as agriculture, irrigation, rural roads in order to create conditions for growth.\nWe have just signed recently in Washington a regional compact as part of the MCC with B\u00e9nin in order to reduce the cost of the corridor, which is a vital corridor for our country through which transit practically all of our exports and imports.\u00a0\u00a0So this cost reduction, this reduction of these timelines, is the essential goal of this compact that will allow us to have greater competitivity for economy.\nThe overall volume \u2013 of course, we also have military cooperation, which is very important the United States intervene in the training and the generation of the special forces battalion.\u00a0\u00a0The United States is presently equipping these battalions and general equipping of our armed forces, for our army and our air force and intelligence, as you know.\u00a0\u00a0And also this contribution for the United States allows our forces to be more effective and allows our country to be resilient against the aggression it faces.\nAll of these interventions by your country, the total volume today exceeds 1,000 billion CFA francs. It is a lot. This makes your country one of the main partners, both in development and in matters of defense and security. We also want to take this opportunity to thank you. And we know that this important commitment will be even more important in the future, in view of the conclusions of the last U.S.- Africa summit, where commitments were made by your country towards Africa and in line with the Agenda 2063 of the African Union. Therefore aligned with our priorities, once again, and knowing Ambassador Johnnie Carson, whom we have known here, we know very well that these commitments will be kept.\nIn conclusion, we must tell you that we owe a lot to the cooperation between Niger and the United States, to your commitment by our side, that explains the resilience of our country, of this system, of this democratic state in this chaotic environment. We owe it to our partnership, with you, we also owe it to our own commitment and our determination to defend our values and our system, and we also owe it to other partners such as France and other European countries. We want, in conclusion, to demonstrate by our existence, by our resilience, our model, that a stable democratic state is the only lasting response to the terrorist aggression of which our region is the target today. We want to demonstrate this, and the other alternatives -we are convinced- will be a failure compared to the path we have followed. This is the introduction I wanted to give you, in any case welcome to Niger, welcome Mr. Secretary of State. Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0Hello.\u00a0 Greetings.\u00a0\u00a0Assalamu alaikum.\u00a0 It is wonderful for me to be back in Niger.\u00a0 As the minister said, as it happens, I\u2019m the first American Secretary of State to be here in that capacity, but I was here in my previous job as deputy of secretary of state in 2015, and I\u2019m so appreciative of the incredibly warm welcome\u00a0that we\u2019ve had today.\nWe have \u2013 Niger and the United States \u2013 a deep but also growing bond.\u00a0 We have a genuine and responsive partnership that allows us \u2013 and increasingly \u2013 to deliver for our people on our shared priorities.\u00a0 I saw already back in 2015 the strength of that partnership, and I\u2019m honored to return today to see it move forward in very significant ways.\nAs President Bazoum has said, Niger is a young democracy in a challenging part of the world, but it remains true to the democratic values that we share.\u00a0 And Niger has been quick to defend democratic values under threat in neighboring countries.\nNiger\u2019s leaders have distinguished themselves in the face of other pressing challenges, from violent extremism to the climate crisis.\u00a0 In each case, Niger has prioritized inclusion, community engagement, pragmatic solutions.\u00a0 The United States is committed to the close partnership we\u2019ve forged together and to make it even closer.\nWe deeply appreciated the very thoughtful, the deeply experienced views that President Bazoum brought on questions of peace, security, and governance at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last December.\u00a0 And in many ways, that conversation was the starting point for the discussions that we\u2019ve had here today in Niamey.\nToday, I announced nearly $150 million in new humanitarian assistance to help meet needs in West and Central Africa and the Sahel created by regional instability.\u00a0 That assistance will support the provision of shelter, essential healthcare, emergency food, safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene services, and will also support vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers evacuated to Niger.\u00a0 And I have to say, the generosity of Niger \u2013 of its people \u2013 to so many refugees, so many displaced persons, is remarkable.\nWe are also supporting investments in the long-term security of Niger, investments that, you\u2019ve heard the minister refer to, help make Niger\u2019s law enforcement more effective in combating terrorism, strengthening border security, enhancing counternarcotics capacity, stemming trafficking, helping to investigate, prosecute, and ultimately reduce terrorism, violent extremism.\nWe\u2019re committed to continuing to invest in the resilience of democracies to a wide range of threats and challenges, from corruption to disinformation.\u00a0 And we continue to support a free and independent press, as we have done in Niger for decades.\u00a0 In the coming months, we\u2019re going to actually welcome another cohort of Nigerien media professionals to the United States, an opportunity to meet fellow journalists and practitioners, to exchange lessons learned and participate in training and other professional development opportunities.\nWe\u2019re also supporting President Bazoum\u2019s remarkable disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, and reconciliation program.\u00a0 I saw this for myself firsthand earlier today.\u00a0 Over the past couple of decades, what we\u2019ve learned is that to effectively counter violent extremism we have to find ways to pave alternative pathways that give former combatants an opportunity to build a real future for themselves.\u00a0 When I had a chance to meet earlier today with young people who\u2019ve completed this program, I heard about their experiences, their ideas for preventing the spread of violent extremism.\u00a0 And again, I think this program can and should be a model for many others.\nToday, the president, foreign minister, and I also talked about another threat to peace and prosperity, and that is the global food crisis.\u00a0 Now, this has been something that has been long in the making.\u00a0 A combination of climate change, of COVID, of various conflicts has created an almost perfect storm.\nNow over the past year, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine has just added fuel to an already burning fire, driving up food and fertilizer prices for Nigeriens, for many others, putting millions at risk of going hungry.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been supporting immediate interventions to help those facing acute food insecurity.\u00a0 Just since the aggression by Russia against Ukraine a year ago, we\u2019ve contributed an additional $13.5 billion to address food insecurity around the world, but most of that has gone to Africa.\u00a0 We\u2019re by far the largest donor to the World Food Program as well, and other international mechanisms that are helping to deal with food insecurity.\nWe\u2019re also supporting something called the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has brought Ukrainian grain to countries across Africa and lowered the prices worldwide.\u00a0 Now keep in mind, this initiative never should have been necessary in the first place, but one of the results of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was to block Ukrainian ports and prevent Ukraine from exporting grain and other food products to the world, which it\u2019s done for years.\u00a0 Thanks to very good work done by the United Nations, by T\u00fcrkiye, an agreement was reached to create this corridor to allow Ukraine\u2019s grain to reach world markets.\u00a0 Over 4 million metric tons of wheat have gone directly to developing countries as a result of this initiative.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of 8 billion loaves of bread.\u00a0 And so millions of people around the world \u2013 and especially here in Africa \u2013 rely on this initiative to help deal with food insecurity.\u00a0 It\u2019s imperative that it continue and it\u2019s imperative that Russia allow it to continue.\nBeyond emergency aid though \u2013 and this is maybe just as important, if not more important \u2013\u00a0 we are working together to make long-term investments in African food production capacity and resilience, because ultimately the goal that we all share is for African countries to be able to produce on their own the food that their people need, and for that matter be able to export it not just in the region that they happen to be in on the continent, but even to other places in the world.\nOne way that we\u2019re doing that here in Niger is through the Millennium Challenge Corporation\u2019s compacts that you\u2019ve heard the minister discuss.\u00a0 They simultaneously address a couple of the really big constraints to economic growth: lack of access to water and institutional barriers to trade.\nOne of the compacts for $442 million is strengthening irrigation infrastructure, climate-resilient production, and market access for agricultural products.\u00a0 And it\u2019s having a major impact in a country where four out of five people are employed in the agriculture sector.\nBy the end of April, we will have established 300 kilometers of roads, built vast irrigation networks, improved more than 1,000 kilometers of livestock corridors, provided literacy training to more than 5,000 people.\u00a0 In 2021, just a couple of years ago, a project that was funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation using satellite technology discovered five aquifers containing over 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.\u00a0 That has the potential to benefit millions of people here in Niger.\nWe\u2019re also supporting Niger\u2019s regional integration and its broader economic development.\u00a0 At the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last year, I joined President Bazoum and the president of Benin, President Talon, in signing another MCC compact that will bring the two countries together to have a regional transportation program that will facilitate trade between the two of them and facilitate the export beyond those countries of food products.\u00a0 It will make it faster and safer to transport and export goods from Niger along rehabilitated roads and across borders. Ultimately, it will connect Niger to bigger markets and even greater opportunities.\nIn all of our meetings, President Bazoum raised the importance of education, because he knows that the single most important contributor to the future of any country is its human resources and giving them the ability to reach their full potential.\u00a0 And that starts with education.\nUnder President Bazoum, Niger has prioritized building and improving girls\u2019 schools to ensure that they can get a good education and acquire the skills they need to participate fully in the economy.\u00a0 USAID is assisting this mission, including with programs to increase girls\u2019 primary school enrollment, provide career training opportunities, deliver distance education for girls who can\u2019t go to school because they live in a high insecurity area.\u00a0 We\u2019re a major contributor, the United States, to the Global Partnership for Education, which has identified Niger as a priority country and is providing nearly $200 million to strengthen the formal education system here.\nThere are so many other ways in which we are working together to deepen this partnership.\u00a0 And we began a discussion, a long discussion with our \u2013 between our teams.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to continue it shortly over dinner, because there\u2019s so much to talk about.\u00a0 But in all of this, I come back to the fact that Niger is really an extraordinary model at a time of great challenge \u2013 a model of resilience, a model of democracy, a model of cooperation.\u00a0 It\u2019s one that we deeply value and deeply respect.\nMODERATOR: \u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to the Secretary of State for those introductory words. We will now give the floor to the representatives of the media. We have a list, and it is not very long, I assure you. First we have Mr. Michael Crowley, New York Times. Go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Minister.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, we\u2019ve seen growing activity in the region by the Russian Wagner Group as countries turn to Russia to address their security concerns, given that the U.S. and also French efforts in recent years have not succeeded in quelling terrorist and extremist threats to these countries.\u00a0 I understand that you believe that working with the Wagner Group is bound to end badly for these countries, but I just wonder if you can talk about what specifically the U.S. and its allies can offer these countries that Russia cannot.\nAnd Mr. Minister, related to that, why do you think so many countries in this region have been turning to the Wagner Group for assistance?\u00a0 And what lessons do you draw from their experiences so far?\nIf I may just add a brief question for you, Mr. Secretary, on Ukraine.\u00a0 Poland\u2019s government said today that Poland will be sending fighter jets to Ukraine.\u00a0 Can we have your reaction to that, please?\u00a0 And does that change at all the Biden administration\u2019s thinking about potentially providing fighter jets of our own?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Michael.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 And actually, I\u2019ll just take the last question first, and then go to the broader question.\nWith regard to the decision by Poland to provide jets to Ukraine \u2013 look, these are sovereign decisions for countries to make, what they will provide to Ukraine to help it defend itself against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 And we, of course, are working closely with dozens of countries on these questions, but different countries are doing different things in response to what they have and what the perceived needs are.\u00a0 Our focus has been on doing everything we can to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, what it can use, and what it particularly needs in this moment, dealing both with the offensive that we\u2019re seeing from Russia across the eastern front, but also in preparation for its own actions in the weeks and months to come as it seeks to take back more of the territory that Russia has seized from it.\nSo we\u2019ve done this throughout in close consultation with the Ukrainians and with our partners.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said many times before, I think it\u2019s a mistake to get focused on any particular weapon system at any given time.\u00a0 We know that there are basic things that Ukraine needs, whether it\u2019s air defenses, whether it\u2019s artillery, whether it\u2019s ammunition, whether it\u2019s armored vehicles and the like.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, as you know, led a very, very successful process in bringing together dozens of countries to help find and coordinate that assistance.\u00a0 And at the same time, as I\u2019ve, again, said before, what\u2019s very important to us and our focus is not only making sure that the Ukrainians have the right weapon system, but again, they can use it \u2013 so depending on the system, that might require significant training \u2013 that they have the ability to maintain it \u2013 again, depending on the system, that can be more or less complicated \u2013 and that it fits into a comprehensive plan.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying that\u2019s been our approach all along, it remains our approach, and individual partner countries will, again, make their own decisions about what they can provide, when they can provide it, and how they provide it.\nWhen it comes to Wagner and the security question more broadly, first, what is I think the most effective way \u2013 and this is something where, again, Niger has really been in the lead \u2013 we know that dealing with insecurity, yes, requires taking steps on the security side of the equation, military side of the equation.\u00a0 That\u2019s necessary, but it\u2019s not sufficient.\u00a0 And the focus that we\u2019re bringing to bear, that Niger is bringing to bear, that other countries are bringing to bear that care about insecurity here because of the potential that it has to spread even well beyond the region and beyond the continent, is a comprehensive approach \u2013 one that\u2019s focused not just on the security steps that we\u2019re taking, but on good governance, on development, on creating opportunity, on being responsive to the needs of the people.\u00a0 And I think that is exactly the difference-maker \u2013 not at all what Wagner or any other groups of its like have to offer.\nAnd I think what we\u2019ve seen already, it\u2019s not just we know this is going to end badly; we\u2019ve already seen it end badly in a number of places.\u00a0 Where Wagner has been present, bad things have inevitably followed.\u00a0 The \u2013 it has not proven to be an effective response to insecurity, and at the same time we\u2019ve seen countries that find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, less independent as a result of an association with Wagner.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also seen Wagner engage in the exploitation of a country\u2019s resources, bring corruption with it, bring violence with it \u2013 overall worsening security, not improving it \u2013 and engaging in human rights abuses at the same time.\nSo this is not a recipe for success that I think anyone should be looking to.\u00a0 But yes, it is incumbent upon us to demonstrate through this much more comprehensive approach that we\u2019re taking to insecurity that we can actually deliver results.\u00a0 That was a big part of our conversation with President Bazoum earlier today, which, again, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue over dinner.\u00a0 But I think you\u2019re going to see very, very concrete results.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is this:\u00a0 I mentioned the disarmament and demobilization and reintegration program here.\u00a0 That, too, should be a model that\u2019s integrated in what we\u2019re doing regionally, because you can see the results.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU: \u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Well thank you, so I would like to complete the response of the Secretary of State. For us, the principle is that this war is up to us to wage, it is not up to our partners to wage war in our place. This is the misunderstanding among some. Therefore, it\u2019s up to our countries, it\u2019s up to us to fight, the goal is that our partners should only complement our efforts. That\u2019s our doctrine, that\u2019s what the doctrine should be, that\u2019s the misunderstanding that there was.\nIt\u2019s that others, the reactions that we sometimes see today on social media, is that it is said that our partners have failed in certain countries, to defeat the enemy \u2013 but that is a misunderstanding. The war is ours to fight. Therefore, we never had the illusion in our country of believing or of making the population believe that this war must be waged and carried out by our partners, in our place. That\u2019s the first principle.\nThe second principle is that, as the Secretary of State was saying earlier, we had a discussion about it, that this war is not being waged only with weapons. We do it holistically. We must first have resolved, or resolve at the same time, the problems of governance, the problems of national cohesion which have not been resolved elsewhere. Terrorists take advantage of flaws in terms of cohesion, social cohesion, national cohesion, that\u2019s why we have the tools to carry out this permanent negotiation between the communities, to effectively prevent a collapse at that level, to prevent an inter-community confrontation, and reduce it to the bare minimum. So this political fight we are carrying out at the same time as the war, it is a part of the war. It is one of the aspects of this war.\nThirdly, it goes without saying that we must not give up development while we are at war. This is why we say that the stabilization and recovery actions that we carry out in these areas affected by the war are also part of the conditions for success. So those are the three elements, as we see them, that condition success or failure.\nAs far as Wagner itself is concerned, with ECOWAS, the first press release we issued after the first rumors of Wagner settling in our sub-region, was to condemn that. It\u2019s been a long time since the West African space has known this, since \u201cExecutive Outcomes\u201d in Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was a South African mercenary company at the time, and obviously we consider that these kinds of elements, this type of heterogeneous force, mercenaries, we cannot accept in our AU space. There is an ECOWAS communiqu\u00e9 in this regard\nAnd what is the outcome today? It is that we find that Wagner is only present in failed or soon to be failed states. Let\u2019s take examples, I won\u2019t cite any, just look around you. Second, the outcome is more than catastrophic. I don\u2019t think there has been any progress in the successes of those countries, where Wagner is present. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a challenge for us. We are now fighting to demonstrate first that our vision, the way we wage this war is the right one, secondly that our democratic institutions can defeat terrorism. In fact, that there are no other alternatives, quite simply, in this fight to defeat terrorism, other than this model for a state. So here are some of the issues which we face, and I believe that the immediate future will prove us right. This is the answer I can give to your question. Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Thank you Minister of State.\u00a0\u00a0Moussa Kama, RFI.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Good evening Your Excellency, my question goes to the two ministers please. An answer in French would really please us, Mr. Secretary of State of the United States. My first question is on security. You have done a lot for Niger, the Nigerien army recognizes this; when will the United States be ready to finance military operations on our borders against the jihadists? My second question is on foreign policy. What will the United States do to bring democracy to our neighbors in Burkina Faso and Mali\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0What are you ready to do? Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0First of all, we have, and the Minister mentioned it, a partnership on security issues which requires significant funding insofar as together we train our colleagues in Niger, we bring important equipment precisely so that they can carry out the necessary operations, we coordinate all of that with others, and all that is a financial contribution because\u2026 all of it costs money. So there is genuine support that has lasted for years and we are strengthening it.\nBut I insist on the point that the minister brought up so well, that while doing this, this holistic approach is for us, for both our countries, the key to success. And there too, there is a very, very significant investment as mentioned for example, the Millennium Challenge Corporation projects. The Minister mentioned the total of our investments in these projects which are also very important to prevent people from falling into extremism and terrorism, and those amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.\nWe are talking with President Bazoum and the minister about the issues, the challenges that we see in the region, including the democratic backsliding, the military coups, which so far have not led to a renewal of a democratic constitutional process in these countries. We discuss it together, and I won\u2019t say more this evening, but I think that we must indeed all be very clear about the need of neighboring countries to restore their constitutional and democratic course.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0 I\u00a0think that what the Secretary of State said is enough, and earlier I told you about the volume of funding through USAID, through the MCC and through equipment, the training of our armed forces, through the intelligence they give us. For all of this I gave a figure, I said no less than 1000 billion CFA francs. I think that\u2026and in addition there are other types of interventions in the multilateral framework which we cannot evaluate here but which are enormous. We have seen for example the commitments of the World Bank. Today in Niger we are the second country after Nigeria in Africa, today, when it comes to World Bank commitments. All of this is a form of support from our partners also through this unprecedented multilateral effort, which was unimaginable a few years ago.\nTherefore, it\u2019s not limited to direct investment in terms of financing our operations, I think we\u2019re waging war, it\u2019s up to us to do so, I want to stress this, and that\u2019s important. The support of our partners, we need it on the strict military level as well as on the civil level \u2013 but not that they fight the war instead of us. This is extremely important. So if there is a misunderstanding in this respect we are not going to get out of it. So I think, and we welcome this commitment by the United States at our side and we think that this model, the bet we have made on democracy, on the stability of democratic institutions, to defeat terrorism, this bet will pay off. We are going to win this bet against the authoritarian model and the criminal model, the criminal groups, that we see elsewhere, it is not a model for us. It is a failure from the point of view of the fight against terrorism, in terms of security sensu stricto, and it is also a failure in terms of development prospects quite simply. Because, today, I don\u2019t think those behind Wagner have any other proposals in terms of development aid, in terms of civil aid, they don\u2019t have any other proposals than that. So here it is, time will tell who is right. We are certain that we are right. This is the answer I can give you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Thank you\u00a0 Minister of State. The penultimate question, William Mauldin from the Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 I wanted to follow up first of all on the RFE question, Mr. Foreign Minister, specifically about Burkina Faso, if you could help some of those \u2013 some of us who aren\u2019t from the region understand what\u2019s going on there in terms of that country and the Wagner Group.\u00a0 And do you think the U.S. should remain active in Burkina Faso despite the military coups?\u00a0 Maybe Mr. Secretary wants to answer that too.\nBut specifically for you, Secretary Blinken, I wanted to ask a little bit if you could \u2013 I mean, you were here, if I understand, as deputy secretary of state before.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sure there were efforts for humanitarian aid and other types of assistance back then in the economic and humanitarian space.\u00a0 What types of programs are working, or paint us a picture?\u00a0 Some of the programs you mentioned today with the Millennium Corporation, how, specifically, do you see that helping this country avoiding \u2013 falling into some of the pitfalls of extremism, hunger, and migrant crises that we\u2019ve seen before?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0As far as Burkina Faso is concerned, I simply note that there have been two successive coups. With ECOWAS we have a mediator who has an agreement at the moment with the military authorities for a way back to a normal constitutional life, for elections, within 24 months. So for the moment we are within the framework of this plan.\nSecondly, we note that the security situation has further deteriorated and we are very concerned about this continued deterioration of the security situation. As for the presence of Wagner in Burkina, we are not yet\u2026 we think, the information that we have does not allow us to say that Wagner is still in Burkina Faso. Our wish is that this country maintains the trajectory with ECOWAS. Secondly, that it does not continue this trajectory towards this organization which we qualify as criminal, mercenary, which ECOWAS has already condemned. We don\u2019t want this trajectory, in which they seem to be going, to come to a conclusion. We believe that, we want them to pull themselves together to reintegrate into the community and that we can, with them, move towards the end of the transition process and cooperate, fight together, against terrorism. This is our view but obviously it does not depend only on us. It depends on them too. But this is our wish.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, just to come back to something I said \u2013 and forgive me for repeating myself, but it does go directly to your question, and I think it\u2019s important.\u00a0 So we have these big projects, including Millennium Challenge Corporation projects that people hear about, and we talk about the very large sums of money that are involved in these projects.\u00a0 But what I\u2019ve seen, and the difference that I\u2019ve seen between when I was last here in 2015 and now, is the concrete results that this \u2013 these projects that we\u2019re doing together are actually delivering and concrete results that are having a direct impact on improving people\u2019s lives, creating opportunity, and creating a strong future.\nI mentioned this just a few minutes ago in my opening statement: by the end of April, we will have rehabilitated through the Millennium Challenge Corporation projects and other things that we\u2019re doing 300 kilometers of Nigerien roads.\u00a0 We will have built a vast irrigation network, which for, again, a country that is 70 or 80 percent in the agricultural sector, may be the most important foundational thing.\u00a0 We will have improved more than 1,000 kilometers of livestock corridors, just to cite a few things.\u00a0 But what does that translate into?\u00a0 It translates into people having much greater opportunity to actually cultivate the land that they enjoy, to bring their products to market in ways that they couldn\u2019t before, and as a \u2013 in the same time, create many new jobs.\nBeyond that, through AID and other partners, we\u2019re doing things like providing literacy training to thousands of people.\u00a0 That, again, enables them to participate much more effectively in the economy.\u00a0 I mentioned, too, this remarkable discovery \u2013 again, an MCC-funded project \u2013 of the five aquifers: 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.\u00a0 The impact that that\u2019s going to have as that water is actually brought to use on the agricultural system here on productivity and on sustainability I think will be dramatic.\u00a0 And again, that translates into livelihoods for people.\u00a0 It translates into opportunity.\u00a0 It translates for everyone into lower food prices, reducing food insecurity, and that\u2019s (inaudible).\u00a0 The bottom line is this:\u00a0 Through everything that we\u2019re doing as partners here, it\u2019s less about the program, whatever it\u2019s called; the amount of money, as great as it is.\u00a0 It\u2019s about the fact that it is actually producing concrete results, concrete opportunities, concrete development which is foundational to Niger\u2019s strength and resilience as a democracy.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0The last question is for\u00a0Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Niger, Madam Nadia Maman.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via\u00a0Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Good evening, my question is for Mr. Blinken. At present, given the evolution of the war in Ukraine, and the impact of this war on the world, does the United States intend to keep going as is or play the card of diplomacy?\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So with regard to Ukraine and to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, let me just say a couple of things.\u00a0 First of all, no one wanted this war.\u00a0 No one wanted this aggression.\u00a0 Maybe the only person who wanted it was Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 We worked very hard when we saw the storm clouds rising.\u00a0 We had information about what the Russians were planning to do.\u00a0 We tried to prevent it with diplomacy.\u00a0 And I spent months, as did my colleagues, engaging with Russia to see if we could head off its aggression.\nI think what we learned in the process is that the reason for this aggression is because Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine shouldn\u2019t exist as an independent country.\u00a0 In his mind, it\u2019s part of Russia, and so he tried to seize it back.\u00a0 I know that there are dozens of countries in Africa in particular who, having been on the receiving end of imperialism, can appreciate why it was so important to stand against it and to make sure that a country, a big country like Russia, couldn\u2019t simply try to erase another country by force \u2013 change its borders, eliminate its independence.\nThe minister said it very eloquently at the very start of this press conference.\u00a0 This is bigger than Ukraine.\u00a0 It really is about the principles that are at the heart of the international system that, after two world wars, countries came together and said we need, if we\u2019re not going to have another world war, territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty.\u00a0 And if we allow those principles to be violated anywhere, they\u2019re in danger everywhere, because the message to a would-be aggressor \u2013 if Russia can get away with what it did, what it\u2019s doing in Ukraine, the message to another would-be aggressor, maybe in Africa, maybe in the Middle East, maybe somewhere else is if they can get away with it, so can I.\u00a0 And that leads to a world of conflict.\u00a0 It leads to a world of violence.\u00a0 It leads to a world where countries that have imperial designs on others will carry the day.\nSo that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so important, I think, why so many countries around the world have stood against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 Just a few weeks ago, 143 countries at the United Nations \u2013 three-quarters of the countries in the world \u2013 stood up and voted in opposition to Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 At the same time, as we\u2019ve already talked about, we\u2019ve seen the terrible consequences that this aggression has had not just for people in Ukraine, but for people around the world because of the impact it\u2019s had, for example, on food insecurity.\u00a0 And we talked about this earlier.\u00a0 Ukraine was one of the biggest exporters of wheat and grain to the world, including to Africa.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s invasion stopped that and was blocking Ukraine from exporting its wheat and grain, including to Africa.\u00a0 Fortunately, we were able to get an agreement to allow Ukrainian grain and wheat to get out of Ukraine.\u00a0 And when I was in Ethiopia just yesterday, I saw the large bags of wheat and grain from Ukraine in Ethiopia.\nNow, the people who, more than anyone else, want this war to be over as soon as possible, are the Ukrainian people who are on the receiving end every day of bombs, of violence, of destruction.\u00a0 And like many other countries around the world, we would like to see the same thing, but there has to be a just and durable peace \u2013 just in the sense that it reflects the principles of the United Nations Charter, because if it\u2019s a peace that allows Russia to keep all the territory it seized by force, that\u2019s not justice; and durable in the sense that no one wants to see Russia repeat this a year or two or three years later.\nSo with those principles in mind, every day we are looking for ways to see if we can bring the war to an end.\u00a0 I see no evidence that right now Russia is interested in a diplomatic resolution, a negotiation that would end this war.\u00a0 And so the quickest way to end it is to continue to support Ukraine so that it is strong on the battlefield \u2013 and the battlefield is its own country \u2013 so that hopefully, at some point, Mr. Putin recognizes the reality that this has to stop, that he\u2019s not going to succeed, and he\u2019s prepared for diplomacy and for negotiation.\u00a0 When that day comes, we\u2019ll be the first to engage to try to end things.\u00a0 But as I said, in this moment, at least, I don\u2019t see any evidence of that.\nMODERATOR: \u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0We are at the end of this exercise, so your Excellencies, Mr. Minister of State, Mr. Secretary of State, thank you for answering questions from journalists.\u00a0Thank you so much.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had an enduring partnership when it comes to humanitarian assistance with Ethiopia, going back decades.\u00a0 And it\u2019s enduring because we\u2019ve had periods of famine, conflict, displacement, and yet throughout we have found ways, working with extraordinary partners like World Vision, like Catholic Relief Services, to make sure we were working with our partners to provide assistance.\nJust in the last couple of years, even with the conflict in Tigray in Ethiopia, we have provided about $3 billion worth of humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 And it\u2019s been very important to us that we do everything we can to make sure the people who are caught up in any of these human tragedies get the assistance that they need.\u00a0 And indeed, today I can share that we\u2019re going to be providing an addition $331 million in assistance through this joint emergency operations program to try to reach more people in Ethiopia who are in need of food security, and we think we\u2019ll reach another 13 million or so people being affected by drought in particular.\nBesides being enduring, what\u2019s so important is that it\u2019s intended for everyone in Ethiopia \u2013 not any particular group, region.\u00a0 We\u2019re active through our partners with the government in nine of the 11 regions in Ethiopia, trying to make sure that whoever\u2019s in need is getting assistance.\nAnd finally, as you\u2019ve seen a little bit of today, of course it starts with food, the most basic necessity, but it\u2019s broader than that.\u00a0 It includes everything from hygiene kits to sanitation to medicine to water.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to continue to do that day-in, day-out.\nBut a few other things that are so important.\u00a0 One is, as I said, we can\u2019t do this without a strong partnership with the government; we can\u2019t do it without strong partnerships with, as I said, remarkable implementing partners like Catholic Relief Services, like World Vision.\u00a0 And I\u2019m especially proud of the work that USAID \u2013 the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2013 is doing in country after country, including here in Ethiopia.\u00a0 As I like to say, USAID is where the rubber meets the road, where we\u2019re making a tangible difference in people\u2019s lives.\nAs a result of the cessation of hostilities agreement in Tigray, we now have humanitarian assistance flowing in very important ways.\u00a0 And that\u2019s reaching people who were not being reached before, and making a big difference.\nFinally, one footnote.\u00a0 You noticed that some of the food products here are from the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 And I would simply note that that just underscores the importance of making sure that the arrangements that have been put into place \u2013 necessitated, unfortunately, by the Russian aggression against Ukraine \u2013 the Black Sea corridor, making sure that grain could get out of Ukraine and able to reach faraway places in the world, that that continues.\u00a0 It\u2019s vital that that continues, it\u2019s vital that as it comes up for renewal that it be renewed.\u00a0 And we can see the impact if that doesn\u2019t happen, because it literally means that what you\u2019re seeing right here won\u2019t get here, won\u2019t get to many other places.\u00a0 It\u2019ll also have an impact on prices for people around the world.\nBut the most important thing is day-in, day-out, we\u2019re committed to this partnership with Ethiopia, doing our part in making sure that people have what they need.\u00a0 I\u2019m also very proud that the United States is the largest contributor by far to the World Food Program.\u00a0 Grateful for the work that WFP does every day.\u00a0 We provide about 50 percent of the World Food Program\u2019s budget.\nThe very last thing is this:\u00a0 As vital, as necessary, as urgent as this assistance is, we\u2019re equally committed to working closely with our partners in Ethiopia to help them develop and strengthen their own productive capacity.\u00a0 That ultimately is the most important thing that we can do.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m convinced, we\u2019re convinced, that in Ethiopia and many other partner countries in Africa, it\u2019s that long-term productive capacity that can be resilient to things like droughts, like climate change, like disease, that can take advantage of the extraordinary natural resources and expertise that already resides in these countries, that that is fundamentally the most important answer, so that we don\u2019t have to deal on an emergency basis with a lack of food or the impact of some kind of crisis.\nSo as we\u2019re working in this partnership to provide emergency support, we\u2019re equally focused on making sure that we\u2019re working together to provide the kinds of investments that will allow Ethiopia to fully realize the potential of its own productive capacity.\nMr. Minister.\nFINANCE MINISTER SHIDE:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Your Excellency Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Your Excellency Ambassador Tracey Jacobson, Mr. Sean Jones, USAID mission director for Ethiopia, dignitaries from Ethiopian Government (inaudible), on behalf of the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, it is an honor for me to warmly welcome Secretary Blinken and his team to Ethiopia.\u00a0 We are delighted to have the opportunity to further consult on our bilateral missions and particularly the economic cooperation between our two countries.\nToday there has been extensive discussion between the prime minister and with you, and a consensus has been reached to further enhance our strategic partnerships.\nAs you are well aware, the diplomatic relationship between Ethiopia and the U.S. dates back to over a century, and over the past several decades we have made considerable progress in elevating that partnership, which has become more strategic and vital for the goals and development of Ethiopia, and more broadly for the Horn of Africa, and particularly Ethiopia and United States partnerships is very strategic and important for our two-way mutually beneficial relationship, and also for the regional stability.\nThe United States is Ethiopia\u2019s largest humanitarian and development donor.\u00a0 I fully agree what you have said.\u00a0 Ethiopia has been receiving U.S. support in wide-ranging areas such as agriculture, trade, investment, climate and food security and health to state a few, Your Excellency.\nToday on the occasion of the launch of this USAID\u2019s new five-year Joint Emergency Operation Program, in the presence of Your Excellency, we\u2019d like to share our deep gratitude to the United States Government and the American people for their continued commitment in supporting our country\u2019s address urgent humanitarian challenges which have affected the most vulnerable.\u00a0 I acknowledge and sincerely appreciate that in 2022 alone, the U.S. provided more than 1.7 billion to respond to humanitarian needs driven by the crisis in northern Ethiopia and the civil drought in pastural areas in southern and southeast Ethiopia.\u00a0 Recently we have also received an additional 271 million to scale up the humanitarian assistance to drought and the country\u2019s affected communities.\nI fully welcome your initiative today to support it further.\u00a0 Excellency, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly highlight our recent achievement and key challenges.\u00a0 As most of you know very well, the last two years have been a challenging period for our country due to internal as well as global factors.\u00a0 Ethiopia, like the rest of the Horn of Africa, is confronted by multiple challenges.\u00a0 Our rains have failed for the five consecutive seasons in pastoral areas \u2013 the current drought being the most extreme in 40 years.\nMoreover, first, we had the problem with desert locusts, then COVID, and now the global food shortage has affected the lives \u2013 livelihoods and the economy.\u00a0 There are presently over 20 million people in need of humanitarian assistance while the conflict reconstruction needs are significant.\u00a0 This is on top of sustaining and deepening our economic reform agenda.\u00a0 This \u2013 all of the challenging environment has been exacerbated by the significant drop in external development assistance.\u00a0 With your visit, we do fully believe that the development potential will be fully unlocked.\nAs Ethiopia emerges from the divisive conflict of the last two years, we are getting up efforts for recovery and for communities and the economy from (inaudible) effect of the conflict and other successive shocks.\u00a0 The signing of the peace agreement on November 2, 2022 paved the way for a critical and inclusive recovery as well as for strengthening social cooperation among all Ethiopians.\u00a0 Since its signing, we have expedited the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict and the fully implemented restoration of basic services, utilities, banking, and other essential government services.\u00a0 We have progressed well on the resettlement and demobilization of ex-combatants and have established the National Rehabilitation Commission to implement the integration program for the nearly 250,000 ex-combatants.\u00a0 Here, I want to stress the criticality of timely reintegration of ex-combatants, which in turn we contribute to the peace consolidation.\u00a0 We are also working on establishing of the interim regional government in Tigray until elections have been held.\nWe have begun implementing immediate recovery interventions primarily using our own resources and by support of the World Bank.\u00a0 But we cannot do this alone as the financing need for the post-conflict reconstruction is substantial.\u00a0 Conservatively estimated close to $20 billion is needed over the coming five years.\u00a0 We need the support of our partners to meet this significant need to ensure that (inaudible) any development (inaudible) are passed, decades are not reversed, and the well-being of our cooperation is important.\nLet me underscore Ethiopia\u2019s determination to address underlying causes and drivers of fragilities through an inclusive national dialogue for which is essential to adequately address the grievances and the aspirations in our society and attain sustainable peace and democracy.\u00a0 The recently established National Dialogue Commission is working towards that objective.\u00a0 Mechanisms for transitional justice are also being set up to ensure justice and accountability to end perpetual acts of violence and advert impunity.\nWith regard to our reform agenda, Ethiopia remains committed to pursuing transformative economy reform to correct prevailing macro-economic imbalances, to remove obstacles to private sector development, and enhance productivity and job creation.\u00a0 Despite the headwinds of historic proportions, we preserve it with implementation of our key reforms, including financial market revitalization, telecom sector revitalization, subsidy for enhancing agricultural productivity, and debt management.\u00a0 We know that much more needs to be done, and we are ready to take bold actions on the most transformative reforms.\nWe are also working to address greening our economy.\u00a0 We are applying various strategies, including expanding renewable energy generation through diverse sources, as well as green legacy initiatives led by the prime minister, to cite a few examples.\u00a0 And we are already producing a lot of food in the country which is going to be vital for the future and currently.\nExcellency, wide humanitarian assistance is essential to save lives and address the short-term needs.\u00a0 Broader and long-term development, as you have mentioned, focuses critical for building our resilience and advancing our development aspirations and fostering inclusive and sustainable growth, and overall tackling the root cause of Ethiopia\u2019s vulnerabilities.\u00a0 Those conditions are key to sustain and consolidate development gains of recent years and to sustain peace and stability in the country.\nAs I conclude my remarks, let me reiterate my appreciation to the U.S. Government for their commitment to support Ethiopia during this challenging time, and I look forward to discussing and exchanging views on resuming and strengthening our longstanding partnership in trade, investment, full-fledge development assistance, and the cooperation (inaudible) shared goals, understanding, and mutual interest.\u00a0 U.S. Secretary, we count on U.S. to leverage broader support to Ethiopia from all our bilateral (inaudible) development partners as we forge ahead with recovery, development, and sustaining and deepening our reform agenda.\u00a0 I thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone.\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good evening, everyone.\u00a0 It is great to be back in Africa, but also to make my first appearance to Ethiopia as Secretary of State.\nI\u2019m here in Ethiopia \u2013 and then on to Niger \u2013 to reaffirm the pledge that President Biden made at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit late last year.\u00a0 As he put it, the United States is \u201call in on Africa, and all in with Africa.\u201d\u00a0 That means the United States is committed to deep, responsive, and genuine partnerships on the continent, because we believe we can only solve shared challenges \u2013 and deliver on the fundamental aspirations of our people \u2013 if we work together.\nOne way we\u2019re doing that is making good on the commitment that we\u2019ve made to help partners in Africa deal with the huge challenge of food insecurity.\u00a0 Last year, 140 million people in Africa suffered from acute food insecurity \u2013 a crisis exacerbated by COVID-19, by climate change, by conflict.\u00a0 This led to shortfalls in commodities, fertilizer, and fuel, all of which spiked prices and created supply chain disruptions.\u00a0 To meet that challenge, the United States has invested $13.5 billion last year to reduce acute and chronic hunger worldwide, largely in Africa.\nAt the same time, together with African countries, we\u2019re supporting immediate interventions like the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has brought Ukrainian grain to countries across Africa as well as lowering prices around the world.\nOver 4 million metric tons of wheat have gone directly to developing countries as a result of that initiative \u2013 that is the equivalent of 8 billion loaves of bread.\u00a0 Millions rely on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 It cannot be allowed to lapse.\nBut we\u2019ve also heard loudly and clearly from African partners that emergency aid cannot be the only solution.\u00a0 So we\u2019re investing in sustainable, long-term African food production \u2013 working with our African partners on innovative solutions that will ensure that Africa not only meets needs on the continent but can become a supplier for the rest of the world.\nToday, American and African scientists are collaborating to devise climate-resilient, nutritious crops.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on international efforts to significantly increase yields in Africa, including by mapping and improving the quality of topsoil.\u00a0 We\u2019re employing satellite photography technology to discover new water resources \u2013 as we recently did in Niger, where five new aquifers have been found, containing over 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.\u00a0 And we\u2019re harnessing public sector financing tools to unlock private sector investment that will expand infrastructure, agribusiness, and trade.\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to meet with AU Chairman Faki to discuss the partnership between the United States and the African Union.\u00a0 We\u2019ll talk about how the United States can help the AU realize its Agenda 2063 to build an integrated, prosperous, and peaceful Africa.\u00a0 And how the United States can best support the AU\u2019s regional economic integration goals as the African Continental Free Trade Area gets up and running.\u00a0 And this is something that\u2019s going to make a huge difference as African economies become increasingly integrated, that will increase trade and investment among them, but it will also attract even more investment and trade outside of Africa.\u00a0 We have had to date in Africa the abnormal situation where African countries are doing more trade and investment with countries outside of the continent than they do among themselves.\u00a0 When the free trade area gets up and running, that will change and I think it will be a very powerful tool for economic growth.\u00a0 I\u2019ll also convey our continued support for African representation in multilateral institutions, to include the United Nations Security Council and the G20.\nAfrican-led solutions are increasingly making the difference on the challenges of the 21st century.\u00a0 One of the most powerful testaments to the importance of African leadership has been the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement to end the conflict and suffering in northern Ethiopia.\nThe conflict was absolutely devastating.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands killed.\u00a0 Widespread sexual violence against women.\u00a0 Millions forced to flee their homes.\u00a0 Many left in need of food and shelter, medicine.\u00a0 Hospitals, schools, and businesses were shelled and destroyed.\nThe Cessation of Hostilities Agreement is a major achievement and step forward, saving lives and changing lives.\u00a0 The guns are silent.\nAs the fighting has stopped, human rights violations declined.\u00a0 Humanitarian assistance is flowing, finally reaching nearly all communities in need, services are being restored in the Tigray Region, the TPLF is disarming, Eritrean and other non-federal forces are departing.\u00a0 The dedicated diplomacy of the mediators from the African Union, from Kenya, from South Africa, supported by the United States, was essential to securing this agreement.\u00a0 And the AU monitoring mechanism is a key to its full implementation.\nPrime Minister Abiy and the Ethiopian federal government and Tigrayan regional leaders should be commended for reaching this agreement and the significant progress in delivering on their commitments.\u00a0 These efforts have created the foundation to rebuild the communities that have suffered so in Tigray, Amhara, and the Afar regions.\u00a0 They need the help and support.\nI strongly urged the inclusion as well of women in decision-making roles as the agreement is implemented \u2013 especially in light of gender-based violence that was perpetrated during the conflict.\nToday, I first met with Prime Minister Abiy, and then with the signatories to the agreement \u2013 the heads of delegation of the Government of Ethiopia and the TPLF \u2013 to underscore our support for peace as well as the dividends it can yield.\u00a0 And those dividends are important.\u00a0 People need to see that peace brings concrete dividends in their lives.\u00a0 That starts, of course, with the cessation of violence, but we want to build positive things on top of that.\nWe welcome the commitments that the parties have made to acknowledging the atrocities committed and their devastating consequences.\u00a0 For our part, the United States acknowledges the human rights violations and repression committed during the past three decades \u2013 actions which sowed the seeds of future conflict.\u00a0 We and others were insufficiently vocal about those abuses in the past.\nRecognizing the atrocities committed by all parties is an essential step to achieving a sustainable peace.\u00a0 We urge Ethiopians to follow through on their commitments to each other to implement an inclusive and comprehensive transitional justice process that includes both reconciliation and accountability.\u00a0 Overcoming poisonous grievances and ethnic divisions is the only way to break the cycle of political and ethnic violence in the north, in Oromia, or anywhere else.\u00a0 As a partner in that effort, the United States is providing both technical and financial support.\nBuilding lasting peace is being made more complicated by the acute economic challenges that Ethiopia faces resulting from the conflict, resulting from drought, resulting from food insecurity.\nAs I conveyed to Prime Minister Abiy, the United States \u2013 as Ethiopia\u2019s largest bilateral donor, providing over $3 billion in humanitarian assistance since 2020 \u2013 we will continue to be there for Ethiopians.\nWe\u2019ll keep partnering on food security.\u00a0 Today I announced an additional $331 million in emergency food and humanitarian assistance that will reach millions of people, millions of Ethiopians affected by conflict, affected by drought.\nWe\u2019ll keep working together on public health, building on our many years of partnership to combat HIV/AIDS, and continue to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that we\u2019re all prepared for future pandemics.\nWe\u2019ll continue to support Ethiopia\u2019s economic development, investing hundreds of millions in health, economic growth, education, democracy, and food security every year.\nAnd we\u2019ll continue to support migrants and refugees, and victims of human rights abuse.\nIn all (inaudible), our mission is to build a strong partnership between the United States and Ethiopia that ensures we can meet the aspirations of (inaudible).\nSo I look forward to an important week of engagement with our partners on the continent, including the engagements that we had today, building on a stretch of high-level visits from the administration since the Africa Leaders Summit: Treasury Secretary Yellen, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, First Lady Dr. Biden, and soon Vice President Harris, as she visits Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia later this month.\nSo with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Daphne Psaledakis with Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 There\u2019s been reports of continued atrocities since the November ceasefire.\u00a0 Eritrean troops still remain in border areas, and Fano Amhara militia still remain in western Tigray.\u00a0 Are you concerned that (inaudible)?\u00a0 It\u2019s not working.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I got you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Are you concerned that reported continued rapes and the presence of these troops could impede an effective implementation of the deal?\u00a0 And what do you need to see from Ethiopia in terms of addressing accusations of atrocities during the conflict to reinstate AGOA trade benefits?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 As I said, what we\u2019ve seen since the agreement was reached (inaudible) has been very significant progress on all the necessary lines of effort and necessary commitments, and by and large the guns are silent, humanitarian assistance is flowing, services are being restored.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the TPLF disarm its heavy weapons.\u00a0 And we are seeing external forces moving out of Tigray, to include the Eritreans.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s not complete.\u00a0 It\u2019s a process.\u00a0 But we continue to see significant movement in the right direction to fulfilling the commitments that were made in the agreement.\nAs to human rights concerns and abuses, I just had an opportunity to meet with human rights advocates and experts a short while ago here in Addis, and these are people who are themselves present or their organizations are present in Tigray, and this includes the United Nations.\u00a0 And what they reported to me is a very significant drop in human rights violations and abuses in Tigray.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also heard that from other sources.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve been eliminated, and indeed, we are \u2013 we strongly urge all parties to the conflict to do everything possible to ensure that they cease entirely.\u00a0 But again, we\u2019ve seen what was described to me by independent experts as a very significant diminution in human rights violations.\nWith regard to our own engagement and assistance as the work continues, as this process of implementing the agreement continues, to include making sure that there are no ongoing, proceeding violations of human rights, to include making sure that the transitional justice process is stood up and moving forward in an inclusive and credible way, then our own ability to continue to move forward on our engagement with Ethiopia \u2013 to include economic engagement \u2013 will also move forward.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s next go to Million Beyene with The Addis Standard.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Recently (inaudible) and that is the State Department has shelved a (inaudible) designating violent human rights violations in Tigray as genocide, and why is that shelved?\u00a0 And is there any (inaudible)?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nAnd (inaudible) campaign to (inaudible)?\u00a0 And will they discuss (inaudible) principles?\u00a0 I mean for the human rights and protect the UN investigation, the UN investigator\u2019s office (inaudible).\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 Let me make sure I got your question correct (inaudible).\u00a0 I think I did.\nFirst, let me be clear that the United States, first of all, has regularly spoken out about human rights violations and abuses committed against civilians and has called for accountability for those responsible.\u00a0 A year ago I addressed this myself when I said that all parties to the conflict had committed atrocities.\u00a0 Significantly, the signatories to the cessation of hostilities agreement acknowledged the atrocities committed and the devastating impact that they\u2019ve had.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re very focused on making sure that that\u2019s stopped and ceases.\nThe reports that we have including just today from experts in the field show a very significant drop in human rights violations in Tigray.\u00a0 That\u2019s significant and important, but obviously we want to see it get to \u2013 as in anyplace else \u2013 get to zero and that all parties remain committed to not engaging in any kind of abuse.\nGoing forward, what\u2019s very important is something else I mentioned: the commitment that exists to a process of transitional justice, and that includes both reconciliation and accountability.\u00a0 And what I heard today from everyone I spoke to was a commitment to that process.\u00a0 So we will be watching that as it moves forward, and this is something, again, that\u2019s vital not just for us or for any other country.\u00a0 It\u2019s first and foremost vital to all Ethiopians, because having that kind of transitional justice, building reconciliation, though, and building accountability, is the only way, in our judgment, to make sure that the peace that\u2019s been achieved in Tigray is sustained.\u00a0 Getting at grievances, getting to justice, bringing people together \u2013 that is the way to make sure that peace lasts and that people can move on with their lives and the country can really move forward.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s next go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if I can get your reaction \u2013 these are sort of two broader questions \u2013 wondering if I can get your reaction to the U.S.-Russia drone collision.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering what you make of Russia\u2019s motives here, their statements about the U.S. being directly involved in combat operations and the Russians potentially wanting to retrieve the debris.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a risk here that this widens the war further.\nAnd second, just on the recent Iran-Saudi agreement that was brokered in part by China, do you view this as a sign of China sort of striding more confidently onto the diplomatic world stage sort of post-COVID isolation?\u00a0 Is that \u2013 especially combined with their Ukraine peace proposal and the foreign minister\u2019s recent comments about U.S. containment, is this a worry?\u00a0 Is this sort of new posture a worry for the U.S.?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, with regard to the drone, the incident is being investigated and we\u2019ll look to that investigation to draw any conclusions about what the intent might be \u2013 might have been, what the actions were.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019ll be in close coordination with allies and partners at the conclusion of the investigation.\u00a0 I can\u2019t speak at this point to the motive or to intent.\u00a0 But what I can say very clearly is this was a reckless and unsafe action.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll let the investigation proceed.\nWith regard to the agreement reached between Saudi Arabia and Iran with China\u2019s involvement, from our perspective, anything that can help reduce tensions, avoid conflict, and curb in any way dangerous or destabilizing actions by Iran is a good thing.\u00a0 And as you know, in this particular case, the Saudis and the Iranians have been talking for some time going back a couple of years, including in Baghdad and in Oman.\u00a0 And to the extent that China facilitated conclusion of this agreement to restore diplomatic relations, that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s valuable that countries, where they can, take action, take responsibility for advancing security, for advancing peaceful relations.\u00a0 And if this agreement actually bears out, and particularly if Iran follows through on the commitments that it\u2019s apparently made, again, that would be positive.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Bilal Abdulmalik, Ethiopian Press Agency.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Many Ethiopians believe that U.S. decision to revoke Ethiopia\u2019s privilege for AGOA is a politically motivated one.\u00a0 And after such progress, the U.S. still hasn\u2019t shown an interest to reverse the decision (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So as you know, the United States suspended Ethiopia from the AGOA trade preference program effective January last year, 2022, due to gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u00a0 And we did this as required by law.\u00a0 It\u2019s in law and we follow the law.\u00a0 Ethiopia has clear benchmarks for a pathway toward reinstatement.\u00a0 The administration will continue to work closely with the government to achieve that objective, which we share.\u00a0 And as I noted earlier, with the cessation of hostilities agreement, and particularly with its implementation, that\u2019s extremely important in moving down that path, and my hope and expectation is that will continue.\nJust for your information, the AGOA program itself is actually administered by the U.S. Trade Representative, and what they do is they have an annual review that brings together other parts of our government, looking at the eligibility requirements.\u00a0 But there will be that process.\u00a0 We\u2019ll participate.\u00a0 We actually hosted a ministerial meeting of AGOA during the Africa Leaders Summit in December, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to planning AGOA (inaudible) next year.\nBut the bottom line is certainly we share the aspiration of Ethiopia returning to AGOA.\u00a0 And as it continues to implement the cessation of hostilities agreement, it will \u2013 it\u2019s clearly moving in the right direction.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Please take a seat.\u00a0 And it is a special honor for me to be able to say, welcome to the White House.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And welcome especially to the 2023 International Women of Courage Awards Ceremony to all of you participating here in person and tuning in from around the world.\nFor 17 years now, U.S. secretaries of state have recognized International Women of Courage who are leading the charge for progress around the world.\u00a0 This year, for the first time, we honor the awardees here\u00a0at the White House \u2013 and that really is a reflection of just how highly President Biden, the First Lady, and this administration prioritize gender equality and human rights.\nDr. Biden, thank you for bringing us here today.\u00a0 But thank you more than that for everything that you\u2019re doing every single day to be such a remarkable role model to so many women around the world, and for your incredibly tireless efforts to lift up the voices of brave women everywhere around the world.\nMRS BIDEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So we\u2019re joined today by ambassadors from across the globe, who are essential partners in all of our efforts to make sure that women and girls can reach their full potential.\nWe have senior leaders from across the United States Government here: Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, our champion, our voice, at the United Nations.\u00a0 Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks.\u00a0 Under Secretary of State Uzra Zeya, our advocate for human rights.\u00a0 Jen Klein, Kat Fotovat, who are leaders of our global gender policy.\u00a0 And of course White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, also such a powerful voice for our country and for this administration around the world.\u00a0 And I also want to point out our team from the Bureau for Educational and Cultural Affairs.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with so many of you every single day in the work that you\u2019re doing.\nWe\u2019re also joined by members of the State Department\u2019s Locally Employed Staff.\u00a0 They\u2019re literally the lifeblood of our missions in every country in the world.\u00a0 To be here today, some of them have traveled from more than a dozen countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, and the Middle East.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you today as well.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd in the audience we have several previous winners of the International Women of Courage Award, who are continuing their inspiring work.\u00a0 And the First Lady and I had an opportunity to greet them, to be able to say in person what we were not able to do the last couple of years, which is:\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0and thank you for the incredible work that you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd, of course, last but not least, our guests of honor, this year\u2019s International Women of Courage.\u00a0 Welcome to all of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWhen Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice launched this initiative in 2007, she did so to honor women creating brighter futures \u2013 for themselves, for their communities, and for generations to come.\nSince then, this award has recognized more than 180 women from over 80 countries around the world.\nAnd that includes this year\u2019s honorees: 11 truly extraordinary people.\nAs you\u2019ll hear, these women are reporting on Russian atrocities in Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019re fighting for equal opportunities for women and girls in Mongolia.\u00a0 They\u2019re defending democracy in the Central African Republic.\u00a0 They\u2019re protecting indigenous land in Costa Rica.\u00a0 They\u2019re advocating for the rights of refugees, people with disabilities, the LGBTQI+ community.\nBecause of their work, and even as they do it every single day, they are faced with extraordinary challenges that, as you learn about them, read about them, are humbling.\u00a0 They, their loved ones in many cases, have endured harassment.\u00a0 They\u2019ve endured violence.\u00a0 Some have been imprisoned.\u00a0 Others have been subject of misinformation and online attacks day in, day out.\u00a0 And yet each and every one has refused to be intimidated.\nIn every region, there are other women doing this work who we can\u2019t name individually \u2013 in some cases because the attention would put them at even greater risk.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve found a new way to honor them.\nThis year, we\u2019re launching a group award, named after a pioneer and champion of equality, the great Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.\u00a0 We have \u2013 (applause) \u2013 we have several members of the Albright family here today to help us celebrate.\u00a0 I like to think I\u2019m an extended member of that family.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 For me, as I\u2019ve told our friends, I hear Madeleine Albright\u2019s voice in my head on a regular basis; the clarity with which she spoke and what she said continues to resonate and continues to inspire me in the work that I and my team are doing.\u00a0 But you honor us with your presence today.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\nAround the world, women \u2013 in all of their diversity \u2013 are often the ones on the front lines of change.\u00a0 And yet, at the same time, they face still greater obstacles to their political participation; they experience gender-based violence and human rights abuses; they hold less economic and social power.\u00a0 We are committed to changing that.\nDefending the rights of women and girls is rooted in our democratic values of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.\u00a0 And when we advance equality and defend the rights of women, we improve life for everyone.\u00a0 When peace is forged with the participation and the leadership of women, it\u2019s more likely to last.\u00a0 We know this from experience.\u00a0 Closing the gender gap in the global workforce would add $28 trillion to the global economy.\u00a0 And as Secretary Albright once said, we simply cannot build the future that we want without the contribution of women.\nThat\u2019s why President Biden has made gender equality and women\u2019s rights a priority of our foreign policy.\u00a0 Some of you know we recently launched the first-ever, cross-government Strategy on Women\u2019s Global Economic Security, to try to help reduce the enduring wage gap, to improve access to well-paying jobs, to dismantle barriers to women\u2019s economic participation.\u00a0 In December, the United States also updated our strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based violence globally, including new efforts to expand access to programs for historically marginalized communities.\nWe\u2019re also learning from \u2013 and teaming up with \u2013 governments, civil society, the private sector in other countries to work toward gender equality together, including, of course, the women that we\u2019re honoring today.\u00a0 One of those women \u2013 Hadeel Abdel Aziz \u2013 noted that, when it comes to advancing this struggle, success is \u201cnot about one big act\u201d \u2013 \u201cnot about one big act of heroism, but \u2026 one hundred small battles.\u201d\nTo our honorees, the United States is proud to be by your side, as you and others wage those hundred small battles, day in, day out.\u00a0 And we will be there and be there with you for the long haul.\nThat includes, of course, the First Lady of the United States, Dr. Jill Biden.\u00a0 The First Lady.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The First Lady delivered remarks.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights at the U.S. Department of State Uzra Zeya.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUNDER SECRETARY ZEYA:\u00a0 It takes courage to seek justice when the powerful stand against you.\nLaws can protect the innocent or persecute the oppressed.\u00a0 And when the rule of law becomes a tool of tyranny, or when the structures in place simply fail to live up to the promise of equality, fairness, and humanity, we appeal to a higher ideal: justice.\nThe women we honor today have worked tirelessly to ensure that their nations\u2019 legal systems protect all people, no matter their gender, beliefs, or background.\u00a0 And when those systems cannot \u2013 or will not \u2013 protect every citizen, they have fought to transform them.\u00a0 They have broken barriers, risen to new heights, and inspired other young women to follow their lead.\nBecause without women\u2019s rights, perspectives, and participation, there can be no justice.\u00a0 But when we all have the opportunity to shape our laws, we create systems that truly serve us all.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nAnd now, Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken will present the awards.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs the first woman to lead the Central African Republic\u2019s Constitutional Court, Dani\u00e8le Darlan became known as the \u201cwoman of iron\u201d for her refusal to be intimidated.\u00a0 She\u2019s spent her career working to ensure the law delivers justice to all, no matter their background.\u00a0 And in the face of enormous pressure to allow the president to rewrite the constitution to give himself an illegal third term, she refused, sacrificing her career to safeguard the rule of law.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs founder and executive director of Jordan\u2019s Justice Center for Legal Aid, Hadeel Abdel Aziz provides legal services to thousands of people every year who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to a lawyer.\u00a0 She works to educate people about their rights so that they know how to protect themselves and are empowered to do so.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDuring political unrest in Kazakhstan, which resulted in deaths and credible reports of torture, longtime civil rights advocate Bakhytzhan Toregozhina used phone calls to expose human rights violations during an internet blackout.\u00a0 She then founded a coalition to document violations and provide legal and mental health support to victims of torture and abuse.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPlease join me once more in congratulating these incredible women.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDEPUTY SECRETARY HICKS:\u00a0 It takes courage to seek peace when you are the target of violence.\nWhen wars are waged, when authoritarians seek to consolidate power, when conflict uproots and displaces families, women and girls shoulder many of the costs and consequences.\nThose who wish to harm and turn their violence on women and girls often do so because women and girls serve as a society\u2019s source of strength and a beacon of hope.\nIt\u2019s because when women use their voices to speak out against authoritarianism, their leadership can create lasting democratic change.\nWhen women use their voices to stand up for what\u2019s right against overwhelming odds, their voices can reverberate around the world.\nAnd when women have a seat at the table, they hold the power to lead their communities toward peace and prosperity.\nAnd that\u2019s the truth.\nStudies show that when women participate in peace negotiations, these talks are more likely to come to a just settlement and result in lasting stability.\nPeace is possible when we support the women working to make it a reality \u2013 by stopping conflicts before they begin, by addressing the root causes of discrimination and violence, and by working to end wars that have already begun and mitigating their harm.\nSo today, we salute several women leaders who are exhibiting extraordinary courage to seek peace when they themselves are the targets of violence; women who are using their strength to pursue gender equity and equality in the face of extreme cruelty and hate; women who are fighting for dignity and freedom for not just themselves but for others.\nIn our awardees, we see that our capacity for understanding and healing is stronger than the forces that try to tear us apart \u2013 and we are reminded that women belong everywhere the decisions are made.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nOn behalf of Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken, I\u2019m honored to present awards to the following women.\nIn Mongolia, Brigadier General Bolor Ganbold is the first female staff officer in her country to be assigned to a United Nations peacekeeping operation \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and the first female general to serve in the Mongolian armed forces.\u00a0 Brigadier Ganbold has served in peacekeeping missions around the world, and she has advocated for gender equality in peacekeeping forces and her country\u2019s military, so that women and girls can be properly protected during and after conflicts.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn Costa Rica, Doris R\u00edos has dedicated her life to fighting for indigenous women\u2019s rights to life and dignity and for the reclamation of indigenous lands.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 In the face of threats of violence and attacks against her and her family, she has created a seat at the table for indigenous women to make the world more peaceful and just.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn Argentina, Alba Rueda is a transgender woman who was kicked out of classrooms, barred for sitting for exams, refused job opportunities, subjected to violence, and rejected by her family.\u00a0 But in the face of these challenges, she worked to end violence and discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community in Argentina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAfter women were barred from schools in Afghanistan, Zakira Hekmat secretly finished high school and won a scholarship to study in T\u00fcrkiye, eventually becoming a doctor.\u00a0 After seeing the difficulty refugees faced, she founded the Afghan Refugee Solidarity Association to advocate for the rights of all refugees and women.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt is my privilege and honor \u2013 to honor each of you for your important contributions to human rights and for making the world a more peaceful place.\nCongratulations, and thank you for your courage.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome White House Press Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS JEAN-PIERRE:\u00a0 It takes courage to speak when those in power want to stay \u2013 want you to stay silent.\nIn a world where lies and distortion are easy to sell, one of the most powerful weapons that we have is the truth.\nBecause corruption thrives in darkness, dictators and authoritarians seek to control criticism and define the stories that we tell.\u00a0 They threaten journalists and those who speak out, so they can control knowledge and hide their crimes \u2013 selling their people false stories of peace and success.\nBut when we illuminate the shadows, we can expose the damage they create \u2013 lighting a path forward for those trapped in the dark with the knowledge and the strength to rise and demand change.\nThis group of journalists, broadcasters, and war correspondents spread truth, courage, and empower other women and girls to use their voices for democracy, freedom, and justice.\n(A video was played.)\nAnd once again, Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken will present the awards.\nThrough her independent YouTube news channel, Roha TV, veteran Ethiopian journalist Meaza Mohammed shares stories of those who are often silenced.\u00a0 Despite three arrests in under one year, she continued to raise her voice, advocating for survivors of gender-based violence and urging accountability for crimes committed against them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWhile helping evacuate women and children from areas affected by war, Ukrainian military veteran Yuliia Paievska secretly documented Russian forces-committed atrocities during the 2022 siege of Mariupol.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 She smuggled a memory card to the Associated Press in a tampon, and was forced to destroy another with her teeth before being captured by Russian forces and tortured for information.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Since her release, she has continued to raise her voice for her people, pushing for peace and independence for Ukraine.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs a broadcaster journalist, Ras Adiba Radzi became a household name.\u00a0 After a car accident and brutal assault permanently paralyzed her from the waist down, she used her platform to advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities \u2013 (applause) \u2013 first as a reporter, and now as a senator in Malaysia\u2019s parliament and the first female chair of the national Malaysian news agency, Bernama.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWhile Polish journalist Bianka Zalewska was combating Russian misinformation in 2014, her car was shot, causing accident that broke her spine.\u00a0 Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, and in the face of intimidation and death threats, she continues her work documenting war crimes, lifting up stories of refugees, and training other journalists to effectively counter misinformation.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPlease join me in a round of applause for all of our awardees.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD:\u00a0 Hello, everyone.\u00a0 It really is a privilege to present this new award \u2013 one that honors our first female Secretary of State, the late Madeleine Albright.\nSecretary Albright showed so many women, including myself, how to lead with moral clarity and with courage.\nHer legacy lives on in those still fighting for gender equality and universal human rights.\nIt is fitting that this award recognizes not just one woman, but the bravery, the fortitude, and collaboration of a whole movement.\nIt speaks to the outsized impact of Secretary Albright\u2019s example and life of service.\nWhen the Albright family \u2013 who is here with us today \u2013 learned about this award, they asked that another trailblazing leader \u2013 one who knew Secretary Albright well \u2013 be part of this ceremony: Secretary Condoleezza Rice.\nSecretary Rice created the International Women of Courage award in 2007, and though she couldn\u2019t join us today, she wanted to take part in this very special ceremony.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nAnd I wish they could be here to hear your applause.\nI\u2019m proud to present the Madeleine K. Albright Honorary Group International Women of Courage Award.\nThis inaugural award goes to women and girls in Iran, who \u2013 in the wake of the brutal killing of Mahsa Amini \u2013 have inspired us all.\nAll Mahsa wanted was to live a normal and happy life.\u00a0 She dreamed of starting a family after finishing her studies.\nBut these hopes and dreams were crushed.\u00a0 They were crushed by the tyranny of Iran\u2019s so-called \u201cmorality police.\u201d\nThe Iranian Government probably thought this would just be another footnote in a long record of violence and discrimination against women.\nBut this time \u2013 this time it was different.\nThe Iranian people \u2013 led by women \u2013 took to the streets in peaceful protest.\nThey followed in the footsteps of brave women before them, who sacrificed so much in the name of freedom.\u00a0 Through neighborhoods and classrooms, out of apartment buildings and car windows, the protesters chanted throughout Iran and around the world, creating a global chorus demanding gender equality and human rights.\nBut for all the hope this movement represents, we must never forget how the Iranian regime has responded.\nThey have tortured peaceful protesters.\u00a0 They have arrested tens of thousands of people.\u00a0 They have badly injured and killed Iranians in bloody crackdowns.\nThe international community must continue to condemn the regime\u2019s repression and violence.\nAnd we must back up our words with action.\nThat\u2019s why the United States led a successful effort to remove Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women.\nAnd it\u2019s why we are working to hold those complicit in these abuses accountable.\nTo all the women and girls across Iran \u2013 know this:\u00a0 We will continue to stand with you in your fight for women, for life, and for freedom.\nSo everyone, please join me in recognizing the courageous women and girls in Iran.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you.\nI now have the honor of introducing another courageous woman who has been an unwavering champion for vulnerable populations in Malaysia.\nWhen a car accident and a brutal assault paralyzed Senator Ras Adiba Radzi from the waist down, she dedicated her life to advocacy.\nTo raise awareness, Malaysians across the country saw her on TV, in parliament, and at the Paralympics.\u00a0 They heard her commentary.\u00a0 They heard her poetry.\u00a0 They heard her fierce call for justice.\nIn May 2020, she became Malaysia\u2019s representative for people with disabilities \u2013 and later that year, she was appointed the first female chair of the Malaysian National News Agency.\nSenator Ras Adiba Radzi embodies \u2013 she embodies what it means to live a life in service to others.\u00a0 Please join me in welcoming her to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS RADZI:\u00a0\u00a0Assalamu alaikum, or peace be upon you.\nI\u2019m Senator Ras Adiba Radzi, a representative of the 2023 International Women of Courage Award.\u00a0 Before I begin, I would like to thank the First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, the Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, and the U.S. Department of State for giving me the opportunity to speak today.\nI\u2019d have to say that I\u2019m thoroughly impressed by the amazing work done by my fellow finalists in their respective countries.\u00a0 Let\u2019s give them a big hand.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Among others, I am joined by women who are fighting against gender-based violence, for the rights of indigenous persons, and for the rule of law.\nHonorable guests, I was born able-bodied and became permanently paralyzed from the waist down after several incidents.\u00a0 I became a spinal-cord-injured person following a car accident in 1995, a brutal assault a year later, and finally in 2002 when I fell after climbing a ladder.\nSince then, I have committed my life to fighting for the rights of persons with disabilities in my country, Malaysia.\u00a0 I witnessed discrimination and stigma as persons with disabilities and then on my team and I fought and fought and fought.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, I have been working tirelessly to create awareness on the importance of accessibility in infrastructure, disability inclusion, job opportunities, inclusive education, housing, and upholding our rights, among others.\nI and my team then founded an association to empower persons with disabilities called OKU Sentral.\u00a0 In May 2020, the Malaysian king, His Majesty the King Al-Sultan Abdullah, appointed me as a senator in the upper house parliament of Malaysia to represent persons with disabilities.\u00a0 In November 2020, I was appointed the first female chair of the Malaysian National News Agency, BERNAMA, after 53 years of its establishment.\nDistinguished guests, in the area of sustainable development, all of us here aim to create a world which is inclusive, equitable, and sustainable, a world in which no one is left behind and opportunities be made available for all, for a secure, stable, and successful nation.\u00a0 Without the role and contribution of women, a nation will not be able to progress as it is today.\u00a0 It is vital for all parties to respect the contribution of women in all areas: economy, social, politics and culture.\u00a0 Women\u2019s involvement is crucial, as they are an important asset to a country.\nSo let\u2019s, again, give a big round of applause \u2013 and actually I feel like hugging them all \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 especially to the women here and to women across the world who have excelled in their roles and contributed towards a prosperous nation worldwide. We are at a pivotal moment for women\u2019s rights.\u00a0 For us, receiving this International Women of Courage Award is very, very much significant for our people in each of our countries.\u00a0 This will be an integral part of spreading awareness and will celebrate the activism and transformative power of women and girls.\nHonorable guests, this opportunity is indeed an honor for me to share my views and experience, especially concerning the protection and social participation of persons with disabilities in Malaysia with everyone here today. Despite the increasing awareness around persons with disabilities, there is no denial that there\u2019s discrimination in this polarized world, exists to the detriment of our disabled friends.\u00a0 It exists because of a prevailing mindset, a stereotypical way of looking at the disabled.\u00a0 What the community needs to understand and to accept is that persons with disabilities are entitled to the full range of civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights, as stated in various human rights instruments, the same as everyone else.\nOn that note, and as we speak, the Malaysian Government is in the midst of amending the Persons with Disabilities Act 2008 to have an Anti-Discrimination Act for Persons with Disabilities like the United Kingdom\u2019s and the Americans with Disability Act 1990 or ADA.\nEsteemed guests, raising awareness of basic human rights and the right to be free of discrimination among women, children, and persons with disabilities is the fundamental aspect in which we must continue to work on.\u00a0 Without such awareness, it is extremely difficult to bring about justice and change.\u00a0 The increasing number of hate crimes, racist remarks, and instances of ableist behavior shows that we must act quickly to protect the most vulnerable communities.\nHence, I would like to take this opportunity to call on the 195 governments of the day in the world to ensure that the marginalized and vulnerable groups \u2013 women, children, including persons with disabilities \u2013 are not left out and rise to the clarion call of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda: leave no one behind.\nBefore I end my speech, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the late Judith Heumann, a leader in the disability community, advocating for persons with disabilities and has been the mother of the disability rights movement since the \u201970s.\u00a0 We will miss her terribly.\u00a0 But myself and the rest of us, I promise you, will continue to be her voice.\u00a0 As she puts it, we are leaders of inclusiveness and community, of love, equity, and justice.\nHonorable guests, me standing here today \u2013 in my standing wheelchair \u2013 means a whole lot, especially for my countrymen, Malaysia.\u00a0 So I\u2019d like to say in Malay\u00a0sejuta doa mencapai bintang, which means a million prayers has now reached the skies.\nTerima kasih\u00a0or thank you for this honor, and from the bottom of my heart,\u00a0assalamu alaikum.\u00a0\u00a0(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome Acting Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women\u2019s Issues at the U.S. Department of State Kat Fotovat.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR FOTOVAT:\u00a0\u00a0What an honor it is to close out such a historic day, such a historic event.\u00a0 Happy International Women\u2019s Day to all those around the world and to our amazing Women of Courage we honor today.\u00a0 What an incredible ceremony.\nI must say, I am rendered nearly speechless by the senator\u2019s remarks.\u00a0 Your resilience, determination, and grit in the fact of extreme adversity and your resolve to continue to fight for women\u2019s rights as human rights, to achieve a better future for us, is both humbling and energizing.\nI couldn\u2019t also help but think of my dear friend and personal hero Judy Heumann, whose funeral I attended just this morning.\u00a0 Judy was a leader of the international disability rights movement who said, \u201cI simply refused to accept what I was told about who I could be.\u00a0 And I was willing to make a fuss about it.\u201d\u00a0 Through your work, senator, and the work of all of our awardees, Judy\u2019s legacy of defending the rights and communities facing discrimination will live on.\u00a0 You and all of our International Women of Courage awardees are truly inspirational for your courage and, as Judy noted, to make a fuss about it.\nI\u2019m so honored to be here at the White House today to join First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Secretary Blinken, and the other distinguished speakers who joined us to pay tribute to the recipients of the Secretary of State 2023 International Women of Courage Awards.\u00a0 The IWOC Award is truly a centerpiece and guiding force behind my office\u2019s work to lead the Department of State\u2019s efforts to promote the rights and empowerment of women and girls worldwide, and it is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and assistance.\nToday, our awardees join a truly incredible group of more than 180 women from more than 80 countries who have received the International Women of Courage Award since 2007\u00a0in recognition of the exceptional courage, strength, and leadership all of you have shown, advocating for peace, justice, human rights, and gender equity and equality, often at great personal risk and sacrifice.\u00a0 I hope this award will elevate your advocacy work and bring greater international attention to the issues that you are fighting for.\nEvery day, as my colleagues and I carry out our mission, working with our partners to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, advance women\u2019s economic security, and promote the women, peace, and security agenda across the globe, we draw inspiration from fearless women\u2019s rights champions like the courageous women who are \u2013 we are gathered here to honor today, and also from their advocates, defenders, their family members, government allies, civil society leaders, and journalists who are also in this room today championing gender equity and equality, not just in words but in action.\nToday, on International Women\u2019s Day, the U.S. Government reaffirms our commitment to the safety and full participation of women and girls in decision-making at all levels and as foundational to peace, stability, and economic growth of all nations.\nI\u2019d also like to quote Secretary Albright, who said, \u201cIt took me a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nTo our 2023 Courage Awards, thank you again for using your voices and being the voice for those who can\u2019t use theirs.\u00a0 Let us all commit to using our voices to amplify those facing oppression, crisis, and in conflict in places like Iran, Ukraine, and Afghanistan, and all over the world.\nCongratulations\u00a0to our awardees, and thank you for all you have done to give women and girls everywhere a fighting chance.\u00a0 We stand with you and for you.\u00a0 And thank you, everyone here today, joining us to celebrate these truly amazing and courageous women.\u00a0 Happy International Women\u2019s Day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So good morning.\u00a0 Let me also welcome you to the business end of the Raisina Dialogue after yesterday\u2019s inauguration.\u00a0 For us at ORF and at the Raisina Dialogue, this is a very special day.\u00a0 Many years ago, 2017 if I recall, we toyed with the idea of bringing the admirals from Quad together.\u00a0 I can see the Pacific Command table here, and the Pacific Command was instrumental partner in trying to cajole others to join in to having and discussing the possibilities of Quad being an actor, being a player, being a contributor to the world at whole.\u00a0 Let me tell you, all capitals are very shy, and everyone was asking us at that time should we probably involve another country, someone else, so that it doesn\u2019t look like Quad, that doesn\u2019t feel like Quad, we can try and dilute it a little.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0from\u00a0that\u00a0time many years ago to today when we have the Quad Squad sitting here, we have come a long way.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0we are thrilled and thank you all of you very \u2013 for joining us, and it\u2019s a fantastic day for Raisina.\u00a0 So let me start with Minister Wong.\u00a0 Minister Wong, you\u2019ve just stepped out of a meeting.\u00a0 You had a formal meeting this morning\u00a0of\u00a0\u2013 with your colleagues.\u00a0 Let me ask you: How does this group add to your agenda?\u00a0 You are now writing Australian foreign policy future.\u00a0 How does this meeting help in your individual agenda in Australia?\u00a0 And\u00a0certainly\u00a0since you are focused on the Pacific and ASEAN, how can Quad be a complementary actor, a supportive actor, perhaps even a contributor to your own assessment and ambitions in that region?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0Well, can I start with a complementarity point because I think that answers the first part of your question?\u00a0 I mean, the complementarity of this configuration with the architecture of the region, some of which you referenced, I think is demonstrated from Australia\u2019s perspective by our geography and by our interests.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nSo\u00a0in terms of our geography, we are the smallest economy here.\u00a0 We\u2019re the most \u2013\u00a0southern most\u00a0economy here.\u00a0 We are bounded on one side by the Indian Ocean and the other side by the Pacific, as it,\u00a0Asia \u2013\u00a0ASEAN in particular, to\u00a0our north the countries of ASEAN.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0for us, our interests lie in a world which is being reshaped and a region which is being reshaped in working through this and the architecture of the region to ensure a region which I describe as stable, peaceful, secure, and respectful of sovereignty.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0our geography and our interests lead to complementarity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I also believe that there is a tangible complementarity in the sense that there are things that we engage with Pacific Island nations on, things with which we engage with the ASEAN \u2013 countries of the ASEAN region on, issues on which we engage in this grouping, and they are all aligned with our interests in economic development, in prosperity, in stability, and in the protection of sovereignty.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Since you\u2019re also in the very first year of your \u2013 of the new role that you\u2019ve assumed, and to the Indian audience that\u2019s hearing you, what is Australia\u2019s assessment of India\u2019s role in the region, in your life?\u00a0 And by inference, perhaps also where are we headed in the bilateral?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0I mean, India is \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0And can I request you to bring the mike closer to you?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0Right.\u00a0 I could answer the question in power terms and in influence terms.\u00a0 I could talk about the extent to which India is a critical power, a great power in the region, that there is no reshaping of the Indo-Pacific with the attributes that Australia would seek without India.\u00a0 I\u2019d also make the point \u2013 and I think we\u2019ve seen that in not only in how Jai engages with the world and his narrative around it, but also Prime Minister Modi.\u00a0 India is a civilizational power \u2013 brings a different perspective to some of the challenges of these times.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m going to come back to you, Minister Wong, but let me now turn to Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 One of the big conversations in India and other parts of the Indo-Pacific certainly is around how distracted is America with the conflict in Europe and how committed is it to continuing to engage in this region.\u00a0 Is Quad an interim consultative group even as the real action unfolds with your old allies and in the old world?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think the very fact not only of our presence here today but our presence and engagement day-in, day-out, including through the Quad and the work that we\u2019re doing not only during the meetings that we have but in between, is powerful evidence of the fact that, as you might say, we can run and chew gum at the same time.\u00a0 And for us the future is so much in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our engagement throughout the region,\u00a0both through the Quad and in other ways,\u00a0is as comprehensive and as deep as any time I can remember.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I think what we talked about yesterday\u00a0in the course of\u00a0the G20 was also illustrative of this, because even as we\u2019re rightly focused on what is happening in Ukraine as a result of the Russian aggression, not just because it matters to Ukrainians and to Ukraine and to Europe, but because it matters to the entire world.\u00a0 The principles that underlie the entire international system that are necessary for trying to keep peace, the stability that grew out of two world wars are being challenged, being aggressed along with Ukraine.\u00a0 And part of the reason that countries way beyond Europe are also so focused on this and are working to support Ukraine and deal with the challenge is because they know it could have an effect here.\u00a0 If we allow with impunity Russia to do what it\u2019s doing in Ukraine, then that\u2019s a message to\u00a0wouldbe\u00a0aggressors everywhere that they may be able to get away with it too.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut having said that, you saw\u00a0yesterday\u00a0and you see today in this meeting of the Quad an equally intense focus on the issues that are having an impact on the lives of\u00a0all of\u00a0our fellow citizens where the Quad is a force, I believe, for good, positive, affirmative action.\u00a0 What\u2019s in so many ways important about it is this: first, we start with the proposition that virtually none of the challenges that our people are facing and that people around the world are facing can be effectively dealt with by any one country acting alone, whether it\u2019s the United States, whether it\u2019s India, whether it\u2019s Japan, whether it\u2019s Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd given that basic premise, it makes sense for us to start by finding likeminded groups of countries with which to tackle these challenges.\u00a0 And the great power of the Quad is you have four likeminded countries united in their basic values, united in their basic interests, bringing different strengths, different experiences, different comparative weights to tackling these problems.\u00a0 And not only tackling for\u00a0ourselves, but\u00a0actually creating\u00a0a\u00a0global commons\u00a0good, particularly for other countries in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years\u00a0in particular is\u00a0translated that into very practical projects, very practical \u2013 in a sense \u2013 offerings, so that we\u2019re creating for other countries in the region a positive choice and a positive partner.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that \u2013 obviously we did this on vaccines under \u2013 during COVID.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing it on infrastructure for some time.\u00a0 We are now engaged very much in working together to help countries deal with humanitarian situations, disasters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd of course, we\u2019re working on things that are\u00a0really critical\u00a0in ways that may not be so obvious to countries throughout the region, which is what\u2019s called maritime domain awareness: giving countries the capacity, the tools, to have a full picture of everything that\u2019s happening in their maritime space, which is affecting the lives of many of their citizens; for example, illegal fishing.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0I think not only are we not distracted; on the contrary, we\u2019re more deeply engaged than ever, and the Quad is one of the most critical vehicles for that engagement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Secretary, our bilateral relationships, India-U.S. bilateral relationships, have taken a step forward with this latest critical and emerging technologies agreement, a lot of excitement, a lot of coverage.\u00a0 Can the Quad elevate itself to collaborate on critical defense technologies, or is that going to be the \u2013 preserved for AUKUS and for the old partners?\u00a0 Does Quad have a vision for also working together on building the defense for future?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019d say two things.\u00a0 First, of course this is not a military grouping.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that kind of alliance.\u00a0 But one of the things that we are doing through the Quad is trying to bring together not only governments but academia and other experts to look at where we might\u00a0collaborate together\u00a0on new technology, on innovation, and whether that has benefits in other areas remains to be seen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut clearly, our four countries\u00a0in particular are\u00a0very well-placed to increase in a variety of ways our collaboration on emerging technology and on innovation, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll also do through the Quad.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Minister Hayashi, is Quad relevant for Japan\u2019s maritime security concerns?\u00a0 How is it important for what\u2019s unfolding in East China Sea?\u00a0 Do you think it is a feel-good talk shop consultative group, or do you think it has the potential to be able to put together something that will be of use to you when things get rough?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Thank you, thank you.\u00a0 Like Tony said, this Quad is not for security issues nor military issues, but practical cooperation like everybody said.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0since your question is about might and security, this is not directly for the security, but through\u00a0those cooperation\u00a0and including four\u00a0of\u00a0us, and then the\u00a0(inaudible) Blue Pacific areas like Pacific Island countries and ASEAN\u00a0and also\u00a0South Asia.\u00a0\u00a0This understanding and mutual understanding and cooperation, then the \u2013 there will make some combined will to cherish the same value\u00a0like\u00a0democracy, freedom, and that will eventually help to have more security assurance environment for all of us.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Okay, it\u2019s not a security actor.\u00a0 The other important area that\u00a0Japan\u00a0is focused on is connectivity, and it is investing in infrastructure across the region.\u00a0 Do you think Quad can have an agenda for connectivity and infrastructure?\u00a0 Do you think it could be an actor and contribute to that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Yes, through our bilateral ODAs\u00a0and also\u00a0through some international institutions,\u00a0we\u2019ve\u00a0been already in many decades doing some infrastructure\u00a0and also\u00a0economic cooperation in these areas.\u00a0 But on the top of that this Quad is not only bilateral like Japan and some countries, but this is\u00a0a\u00a0Quad\u00a0as a whole will\u00a0be coordinating all those efforts of four countries so that we can do much better than just one plus one plus one is four.\u00a0 One plus one plus one plus one is four, but\u00a0the\u00a0one plus one plus one plus one could be six, seven or eight by coordinating and listening.\u00a0 We have now eight ears to listen to all those needs of the\u00a0countries, and\u00a0communicate and coordinating in the Quad like we did in this morning.\u00a0 We can listen\u00a0more\u00a0and we can do more.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Eight ears, but you also have four tongues, and we\u00a0have to\u00a0be watchful there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut let me ask you the last final question for this round to you, Minister Hayashi.\u00a0 The China factor.\u00a0 Many of us have a very strong economic relationship \u2013 Japan certainly does \u2013 with China.\u00a0 China disapproves of the Quad, and in some sense, you\u00a0have to\u00a0navigate that as well.\u00a0 How does Japan do that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0like we said, like I said, this not a military but this is just practical\u00a0cooperation\u00a0and we don\u2019t\u00a0trying\u00a0to exclude anybody.\u00a0 This is an open architecture.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0one thing we would like to say is to just abide by the law, of international law, international institutions.\u00a0 And\u00a0as long as\u00a0even China\u00a0abide\u00a0by the rule of the international norm\u00a0and also\u00a0act like \u2013 act under the international institutions, standards, and laws, then this is not conflicting issues between China and the Quad.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Let me turn to you, Minister Jaishankar, and perhaps you can enlighten us.\u00a0 Why was Quad in some ways dead on arrival 10 to 15 years ago when the first avatar was being discussed, debated, even considered, to today India hosting the Quad panel discussion at Raisina Dialogue?\u00a0 What changed, why did it change, and how does this really reflect how you assess the importance of the region and the group in the region?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS\u00a0MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Well, Samir, I don\u2019t think it was dead on arrival.\u00a0 It was dead a few months after arrival, and there\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s important to understand why, because by some coincidence I happen to be associated with different phases of the Quad.\u00a0 I take the Quad back to Boxing Day 2004 when the Indian Ocean tsunami happened.\u00a0 It so happened at that time I was the country coordinator for our external coordination and response.\u00a0 Then in 2006 when Prime Minister Abe came to India, he\u00a0before coming had this idea that the Quad could be an effective way of dealing with the challenges.\u00a0 There was\u00a0actually a\u00a0Quad meeting \u2013 if my memory serves me right \u2013 in Manila in 2007, and then, as you say, it didn\u2019t work out.\u00a0 If you ask\u00a0me\u00a0why didn\u2019t it work out as opposed to what happened 10 years later \u2013 because it was revived 10 years later, 2017, at the level of\u00a0under secretaries, vice ministers; I was foreign secretary then \u2013 \u201917 it was revived, then \u201919 it became a foreign\u00a0ministers\u00a0level.\u00a0 And when the Biden administration came in in \u201921, it became a summit level.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0what\u2019s the difference between \u201917, \u201919, \u201921, as opposed to 2007?\u00a0 One, I think there was greater strategic clarity on the part of all the countries concerned.\u00a0 Two, our own inter-state relations changed during this period.\u00a0 If I were to look at India\u2019s ties with the U.S., it became much deeper; with Japan\u00a0also\u00a0it grew; and I think the real big change has been in the last decade with Australia.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0in a way, Quad is working in 2023 partly, as I said, because we have greater strategic clarity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI also think we have leaderships with a greater sense of purpose who are less encumbered by baggage.\u00a0 But to me, a big difference is\u00a0actually our\u00a0inter-state relationship, which has today become so much more confident and so much deeper.\u00a0 So, in fact, the one point I would differ with Minister Hayashi \u2013 actually, I hope one day it will be 1,111, the one-one-one-one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 When you walked in, all of you seemed quite at ease, and there was a bit of a relaxed feel, vibe to it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 There\u2019s always a relaxed feel when we meet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0what did you discuss inside the room?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 A lot of things, but if my colleagues would indulge me, we\u00a0actually today\u00a0captured some of our discussions in the form of a statement.\u00a0 I think that statement would have been put out or will be put out.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0if you ask me what were the new things which came out today, we agreed on a counterterrorism working group; we agreed on cooperating more closely with the Indian Ocean Rim Association; we agreed that there would be a \u2013 we had earlier worked out a HADR Quad initiative, so the standard operating procedures for that, which I think the military people would obviously see as a prerequisite for their cooperation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI think we coordinated on the UN to make sure that the processes of the UN are respected and the workings of the UN sort of stay true to its spirit.\u00a0 I was personally happy that there was a stronger expression of support from all of us collectively to the reform of the UN, to the fact that there would be intergovernmental negotiations on the reform.\u00a0 I also see that on \u2013 when it comes to sustainable development goals, which all of us are committed to, we believe that they should be pursued comprehensively, not cherrypicked for political convenience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe will be doing our maritime security working group very shortly in Washington, and we discussed \u2013 among other things, one of the outcomes we agreed on was that the listings of terrorists \u2013 the counterterrorism side listings \u2013 should not be politicized.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0these were some of the outcomes.\u00a0 So, I mean, there were a lot of things which I can\u2019t tell you, so \u2013 but this is the public side of what we can tell you.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0I thought collectively I should be putting it out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 And how do you respond to this common refrain that most politicians seem to indulge in from the Quad countries that this is not against anyone, we are not a security grouping, we are not a military grouping.\u00a0 Why are we apologetic?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t think \u2013 look, we are not apologetic.\u00a0 I do believe \u2013 because I keep reminding people of 2004, because to me, if your origins are in common good, there\u2019s a lot \u2013 there\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0innate virtue in your existence, okay?\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0we do stand for something.\u00a0 What I would not like to be defined as is standing against something or somebody, because that diminishes me.\u00a0 That makes it out as though some other people are the center of the world and I\u2019m only there to be for them or against them.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think \u2013 actually, I think I\u2019m the center of the world, but that\u2019s a different matter.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Okay, so I\u2019m going to turn to \u2013 as is custom here, I\u2019m going to turn to our young fellows.\u00a0 We have 48 young fellows from 33 countries who are spending two weeks with us, and typically we go to a couple of them for every session to hear their thoughts, their questions for all of you.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0I\u2019ll turn to \u2013 first to Teesta and then to\u00a0Kirtbir.\u00a0 Teesta, introduce yourself very briefly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning, ministers.\u00a0 My name is Teesta Prakash and I\u2019m from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra, and my question to you is:\u00a0 How do we build a regional consensus in the Indo-Pacific given the four Quad countries sit on the periphery of the Indo-Pacific?\u00a0 How do we then include Southeast Asia?\u00a0 How do we bring the Pacific Islands with us to really sort of create a regional narrative for what is a second \u2013 not a security, perhaps, but an economic architecture?\u00a0 How do we bring the region along with the four Quad countries?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 And can I just add to that \u2013 because all of you have also invoked the term \u2013 look, all of you have started speaking like each other, and that worries me.\u00a0 All of you\u00a0say\u00a0\u201cASEAN centrality.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 It\u00a0actually makes\u00a0me happy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 You\u00a0say\u00a0\u201cASEAN centrality,\u201d and we keep thinking what\u00a0does that really mean.\u00a0 Does it mean that beautiful flower arrangement in the middle of the room when four of you are sitting?\u00a0 What does it really mean?\u00a0 So \u2013 sorry, the second question,\u00a0Kirtbir.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Let me go to the second question and then I\u2019ll come to you.\u00a0 Can we take a second question?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks, Samir and panelists.\u00a0 I\u2019m\u00a0Kirtbir\u00a0Chahal.\u00a0 I work for the British Government.\u00a0 Similar question to narrative, but how do you think the Quad can reconcile their strategic interests in and their competing visions for the Indo-Pacific?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd given the Quad are already discussing supply chain resilience and economic resilience more broadly, are Quad members likely to increase market access for each other to further strengthen that economic cooperation and truly move in the same direction?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 So now we will turn to the panelists.\u00a0 First one was to you, ma\u2019am, so over to you, Minister Wong.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0 Well, I might \u2013 I think the nub of the first question goes really to complementarity.\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to not be provoked by the flower arrangement analogy just for the moment.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But it goes to complementarity, and I think if we can start where \u2013 perhaps where Jai started, which is think about what we are for, not what we are against.\u00a0 What are we for?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI think\u00a0where we are very likeminded is we have a view about the attributes of the region we inhabit, and that region \u2013 and people will use different words; some say open and inclusive; some might say stable, secure, free of \u2013 where sovereignty is respected \u2013 but the point is we do have a view about that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe see the Quad, I would say, as a bit of a lighthouse.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0 That was for you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0 But we conceive it as enabling choices, and I think it enables choices in two ways.\u00a0 It enables choices by these countries working for a region with the attributes that enable choices, and it also enables choices by virtue of the practical work that we seek to do together; sometimes through all four in the work streams that Jai described; sometimes collaboration, whether it\u2019s in the Pacific, where Australia and Japan or Australia and India might work together in a particular country \u2013 this project is a good one for you to do, this is a project we\u2019ll do, this is what we\u2019ve done, but that sort of practical cooperation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I don\u2019t feel the dissonance that I know some commentators feel and that is underpinning a couple of the questions as between the different architectures, because as an Australian, the region in which we live demands the engagement at multiple levels in multiple contexts.\u00a0 We have \u2013 we are the first dialogue partner of ASEAN, so our commitment to ASEAN centrality is historic and real, but it is also geographic.\u00a0 And we do not see our engagement with our friends and partners up here on the stage as doing anything other than enhancing that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, ASEAN centrality.\u00a0 India also has its own neighbors who it\u00a0has to\u00a0take into account\u00a0\u2013 their views, their conditions.\u00a0 Is there a time to \u2013 just taking this question forward, are we creating enough mechanisms to engage with these countries?\u00a0 We are four big countries in the region, in the periphery, as Teesta mentioned, so what is the mechanism to reach out, to take them along, to sometimes respond to anxieties?\u00a0 You are going to create ripples.\u00a0 And perhaps also the second question of\u00a0Kirtbir\u00a0on connectivity and congruence within the Quad.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, let me start with coming back to the first question and just adding to what Penny said I think very eloquently.\u00a0 Our proposition is not to say to countries in the region, \u201cYou have to choose.\u201d\u00a0 Our proposition is to offer a choice, to offer an affirmative alternative.\u00a0 And the more we\u2019re able to do that \u2013 and do that in practical ways \u2013 I think the more cohesion you\u2019re going to see throughout the region.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve already discussed in\u00a0a number of\u00a0very practical areas that\u00a0actually answer\u00a0the needs of countries in different parts of the region, that\u2019s exactly what the Quad is doing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSecond, to Penny\u2019s point \u2013 and I think this is very important \u2013 we really look at this as variable geometry, which is to say there are different collections of countries \u2013 some in formal alliances, some in looser partnerships, some working together on a bilateral basis, some in slightly larger groupings \u2013 and the idea really is to make sure that we\u2019re fit for purpose for any\u00a0particular challenge.\u00a0 And so it may be that the Quad can focus on certain things where the\u00a0particular attributes\u00a0of our countries brought together make sense.\u00a0 There are other places where different groupings of countries, whether in existing alliances or new partnerships that we form, make the most sense because it addresses the\u00a0particular interests\u00a0or\u00a0particular attributes\u00a0that those countries can bring to the table.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I think you\u00a0have to\u00a0think of it that way.\u00a0 This is not a rigid thing, and that\u2019s I think the mindset that the four of us have, although now maybe it\u2019s the five of us.\u00a0 I think, Samir, you\u2019re now an honorary member.\u00a0 Maybe \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 sort of the fifth Beatle, as it were.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re taking.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd the other thing I think it\u2019s important to understand is this is an ongoing conversation, and one of the strengths that we have is \u2013 and we just had a meeting over breakfast, but it\u2019s just picking up the conversation that\u2019s happening virtually all the time in some fashion among the four of us or among some subset of the four of us.\u00a0 And that also gives it great power because there\u2019s tremendous continuity, and what we\u2019re working on most now is translating the vision that we brought to this into very concrete, practical things that address very concrete, practical needs of countries throughout the region.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Would you guys have a WhatsApp group?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Okay, I\u2019m sorry, that was not a question.\u00a0 Minister Hayashi, your responses to ASEAN and \u2014\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 It all has been said.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to add anything on those comments already made, but is this a group or what?\u00a0 This is a kind of \u2013 not a band like the Beatles, the member is\u00a0fixed\u00a0and they always play together in 10 years, but this is more like a, more kind of soft group, so that even within the Beatles, Paul McCartney can release the album by solo.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And \u2013 so yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo those are the things that could be a band, but everybody is really one harmonization with (inaudible) 50th anniversary for ASEAN.\u00a0 So that information we can share with four of us here so that any idea relating to that could be \u2013 I can absorb from those three friends here.\u00a0 So those are the situation we are facing, and it\u2019s very nice to talk over these issues surrounding the area, because we have a trust between four of us and a trust for \u2013 like I said at the beginning \u2013 the same values and same values such as democracy, freedom, and everything.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0without worrying about those big conditions, we can\u00a0really freely\u00a0talk within this and communicate.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the only things that I would like to add.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Dr. Jaishankar?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Which part, the Beatles part, or the \u2013 (laughter).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Go ahead.\u00a0 I mean, you always come up with interesting inputs, but the two questions that were posed: ASEAN in our context, perhaps India\u2019s own neighbors; and, of course, the whole challenge of offering choices, as Secretary Blinken mentioned.\u00a0 Are we in \u2013 are we able to give countries more agency by offering more choices?\u00a0 Or are we still sending them to the same shop?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 No, I think we do offer more choices.\u00a0 We do collectively offer something different.\u00a0 My own sense over this\u00a0last \u2013 especially after 2017, when I look at individual countries in Southeast Asia, or I\u2019ve just come back from\u00a0actually the\u00a0Pacific Islands \u2013 that countries are interested.\u00a0 Many of them by the way are themselves looking at Indo-Pacific as a changing theater, what \u2013 how should they define their interests, advance their interests.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0my sense is that the interest in the Quad, the enthusiasm for it, the willingness to work with it are growing.\u00a0 But at the end of the day, the Quad is the Quad.\u00a0 The Beatles didn\u2019t take \u2013 they did keep Pete Best out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0the serious point is that when we look at what can we do \u2013 and I\u2019m, again, using maritime security as the easiest example \u2013 that there was a time after 2004 when we all worked together.\u00a0 We understood the value of what today we call the LEMOA, that \u2013 the moment we get logistics access to each other that somewhere our ability to operate\u00a0actually multiplies.\u00a0 And in the initial years, it was difficult.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0when we talk about the changing world, among the changes is we ourselves have changed.\u00a0 Our attitude towards the world has changed.\u00a0 Our understanding and comfort levels with each other has also changed.\u00a0 I do remember a period when, even in our own system \u2013 and I would say frankly in each one of our systems \u2013 because it was something we hadn\u2019t done before, there was that hesitation.\u00a0 And what we are discovering, I mean, really with almost every Quad meeting \u2013 we have this kind of rolling conversation, and it\u2019s not a WhatsApp group.\u00a0 We have this rolling conversation, and people keep throwing up ideas.\u00a0 Some work; some don\u2019t; some are realized more practically, more quickly.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a kind of \u2013 I would say a very easy, practical arrangement that this has come about.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m very uncomfortable with sharp definitions: you do this, you don\u2019t do this, you are for this, you are against this.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s four countries who have decided that by working together that they would naturally advance each other \u2013 our own national interests but also do much good for the world.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0my final question to the panelists as we conclude, you started off responding to the tsunami, a major humanitarian actor at that time.\u00a0 Today, we are facing two or three big crises at this\u00a0particular moment: food, debt, climate.\u00a0 Is Quad doing enough?\u00a0 What should it be doing better?\u00a0 Let me start with Secretary Blinken and then come down the panel and close with you, Dr. Jaishankar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say\u00a0on\u00a0one level we\u2019re never doing enough because the demand is extraordinary.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re living in a time where there is a greater multiplicity of challenges than at any time at least that I\u2019ve been engaged in these issues over 30 years \u2013 more complicated, more interconnected.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0the demand is huge and maybe the demand exceeds even the supply that we can bring.\u00a0 But precisely to the point that Jai was just making, one of the things that we\u2019re, I think, getting pretty good at is adapting quickly and looking quickly at what are the challenges that we really\u00a0have to\u00a0engage and seeing how we can make the Quad a useful vehicle for doing that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn each of the areas you described, we are\u00a0actually working\u00a0together,\u00a0taking action, certainly exchanging ideas; and as I said, in many cases trying to turn to those into concrete initiatives.\u00a0 But the demand is\u00a0great\u00a0and we\u00a0have to\u00a0respond to it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s interesting right now in this very moment, you have Quad countries that are also chairing in this moment the G7, the G20, APEC; and that too gives us an ability to amplify \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0To coordinate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 and as we\u2019re working and coordinating among each other, that also has the benefit of strengthening and making more cohesive the agendas of these other groups.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Minister Hayashi.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, like Tony said, demand is always more than we can supply, I think, as a Quad.\u00a0 But like in case of Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, right after \u2013 that was 24th of February, but in March, we had a summit video conference on Ukraine issues and concurred that we cannot accept this to destroy the international norm such as never change the status quo by force.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0like those case shows that we can always communicate and confirm that we \u2013 from \u2013 we are on the same page for those issues, and then that makes\u00a0more smooth\u00a0carrying out of the \u2013 every\u00a0measures\u00a0we can take.\u00a0 So that\u2019s still working in that way too.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Minister Wong.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0I think one of the greatest strengths of this grouping is by virtue of what we do together, it enhances our capacity for collaboration.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0you \u2013 we could \u2013 obviously there are existing work streams; they are\u00a0practical\u00a0and they are real.\u00a0 As both Tony and Yogi have said, we could always do more in that the need in a world that is increasingly disordered, as your conference explicates, is always greater.\u00a0 But this group does have a capacity to collaborate quite flexibly in addition to what we might have announced and what we\u2019ll try and deliver on.\u00a0 And I think for me as a foreign minister in the smallest of the Quad members, that is extremely useful.\u00a0 It \u2013 and it is a real strength in this collaboration.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Jaishankar, final words.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0\u00a0Look, I obviously concur with my colleagues, and I think the more we do with each other, then more possibilities\u00a0open up.\u00a0 To me right now, there are three big issues that the world needs to address and the Quad needs to address \u2013 and Quad can address, can make a difference: one, more reliable and resilient supply chains; two, the whole \u2013 the digital challenge \u2013 trust and transparency when it comes to technologies, how do we deliver more secure digital existence; and third, connectivity.\u00a0 And I do see these as three big issues which in different ways the Quad needs to do together\u00a0and also\u00a0do with other countries, and I do expect that to be a greater part of our agenda.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0thank you very much for this very frank, friendly conversation this morning.\u00a0 I think that might be the good attribute for Quad: frank, friendly, and flexible.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s what Minister Wong said \u2013 flexible.\u00a0 So frank, friendly, flexible, and fun could be the takeaways from this wonderful conversation.\u00a0 Please join me in applauding the esteemed guests for their contributions.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good evening, everyone, and apologies for doing this so late.\u00a0 I hope I\u2019m not disrupting people\u2019s dinner plans.\nWe just finished a marathon day at the G20.\u00a0 We came together to focus on solving some of the most consequential problems affecting people of our nations and the world.\u00a0 And let me begin by thanking our host, India, for setting out an ambitious agenda for this meeting, and for its presidency of the G20.\nWe met here in Delhi roughly one year after President Putin launched his war of aggression on Ukraine, and one week after 141 countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly for a resolution that expressed the support for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, in accordance with the United Nations charter and its principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and deplores the human rights and humanitarian consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 Not a single G20 member voted with Russia to oppose that resolution.\nThe chair\u2019s statement by India today reaffirmed the declaration issued by the G20 leaders last year in Bali, which \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cstrongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 Russia and China were the only two countries that made clear that they would not sign on to that text.\u00a0 Eighteen members of the G20 also reaffirmed that it is \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cessential to uphold international law and the multilateral system. \u00a0This includes defending all of the purposes and principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nations and adhering to international humanitarian law,\u201d end quote.\nEvery G20 member \u2013 and virtually every country, period \u2013 continues to bear the cost of Russia\u2019s war of aggression, a war that President Putin could end tomorrow, if he chose to do so.\u00a0 The United States didn\u2019t want this war.\u00a0 We worked hard to prevent it.\u00a0 Like most countries, we want to focus on the fundamental challenges affecting the daily lives of our people. So even as we stand with Ukraine while it defends itself, as any nation would do in that position, we\u2019re also determined to keep working with other countries to deliver solutions to these shared challenges.\nAnd that is exactly what we did today at the G20.\u00a0 These challenges include the unprecedented food security crisis around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to do two things at once \u2013 get food to the hungry now, but also help countries build up their agricultural productivity and resilience so that they\u2019re less vulnerable to future shocks.\u00a0 The United States is leading on both fronts.\u00a0 In addition to funding more than half of the World Food Program\u2019s entire budget, we\u2019ve contributed $13.5 billion to fight hunger over the last year alone, and we\u2019ve committed more than $11 billion over the next five years to boost countries\u2019 resilience and nutrition.\nAfrican countries in particular have told us time and again that, more than aid, what they want is help building the sustainable capacity to feed their own people, and we\u2019re teaming up to do just that.\u00a0 Now the unprecedented levels of food insecurity have been driven primarily by climate, by COVID, and by conflicts, but the crisis has been worsened intentionally by President Putin, who\u2019s weaponized the hunger of people across the globe.\nThanks in large part to UN Secretary-General Guterres and T\u00fcrkiye, the Black Sea Grain Initiative loosened Russia\u2019s stranglehold on Ukraine\u2019s ports, allowing more than 22 million metric tons of grain and other food \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of eight billion loaves of bread \u2013 to leave Ukraine\u2019s ports through global markets.\u00a0 And that\u2019s lowered the price of food for people everywhere.\nToday, Russia is again slow walking the export of food from Ukraine.\u00a0 And with the Black Sea Initiative set to expire on March 18th, Russia has refused to commit to renewing it.\u00a0 The message that countries sent at today\u2019s meeting is clear \u2013 extend the Black Sea Grain Initiative and strengthen it and do that without delay.\nWe also discussed ways to counter the proliferation and trafficking of illicit synthetic drugs, like fentanyl and methamphetamine.\u00a0 In the United States alone, fentanyl killed more than 70,000 people last year.\u00a0 It\u2019s the number-one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49.\u00a0 No country can tackle this problem alone.\u00a0 Disrupting supply chains of precursors, preventing the diversion of legal chemicals to illegal uses, dismantling the transnational criminal groups that foster corruption and profit off of others\u2019 suffering, these are challenges that demand a coordinated global effort.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that, for the first time, G20 ministers called for a strong, international cooperation to counter illicit synthetic drugs, and it\u2019s why I proposed to my fellow ministers today at the G20 that we create a focused line of effort to bring together governments, international and regional organizations, private sectors, and others to tackle this problem.\u00a0 This is a law enforcement and security issue, but it\u2019s fundamentally a public health issue and an increasingly global one.\nToday, we also discussed other challenges, where people around the globe expect our countries to work together, like addressing the climate crisis, helping communities adapt to the inevitable changes it\u2019s causing, strengthening global health security, so that we\u2019re better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future health emergencies.\nI also had the opportunity to speak on the margins of today\u2019s meetings with counterparts from Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and, of course, India.\u00a0 And let me first commend the Indian presidency and Foreign Minister Jaishankar for securing G20 consensus on a broad set of agreements, reflected in the Chair Summary and Outcome Document.\u00a0 That\u2019s a first for G20 foreign ministers.\nNow Minister Jaishankar and I speak so frequently that we just pick up right where we left off, working to elevate our Strategic Partnership in concrete ways, supporting India\u2019s very ambitious G20 agenda, advancing the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, which President Biden and Prime Minister Modi launched at the G20 Summit in Bali last May, engaging our shared commitment to human rights and democratic values.\nTomorrow the foreign minister and I will join our counterparts from Japan and Australia for a meeting of the Quad, where key areas of focus will include protecting the free and unrestricted movement of goods and people across our seas, and boosting cooperation against \u2013 around humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the importance of which has been brought once again into sharp relief by the devastating earthquakes in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria.\nOur engagement with the Quad and the G20 are just a few of the examples of how the United States is weaving together alliances and partnerships to enhance our capacity to deliver for our citizens.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I began this trip in Central Asia, where I joined my counterparts for the C5+1 ministerial.\u00a0 The more of these partnerships that we build, strengthen, and stitch together, the more we\u2019re able to effectively tackle transnational challenges that affect our people, broaden opportunities for Americans, bolster our security, and advance our interests.\nAnd what we\u2019re seeing in Delhi, in Astana, in Tashkent, and beyond is that countries want to partner with the United States, because they see us showing up to solve shared problems, fostering inclusive economic growth, investing in our own competitiveness, and standing up for the international rules of the road that benefit all countries, including the right of every country to choose its own path, free from violence, coercion, and threats.\nLastly, I spoke briefly with Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Lavrov on the margins of our G20 meeting today.\u00a0 I urged Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision, and return to implementing the New START Treaty, which places verifiable limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation.\u00a0 Mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s also what people around the world expect from us, as nuclear powers.\u00a0 I told the foreign minister that, no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship, the United States will always be ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did, even at the height of the Cold War.\nI also raised the wrongful detention of Paul Whelan, as I have on many previous occasions.\u00a0 The United States has put forward a serious proposal.\u00a0 Moscow should accept it.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined to bring Paul and every other American citizen who is unjustly detained around the world home.\u00a0 We won\u2019t rest until we do.\nFinally, I told the foreign minister what I and so many others said last week at the United Nations, and what so many G20 foreign ministers said today: end this war of aggression; engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace.\u00a0 President Zelenskyy has put forward a 10-point plan for a just and durable peace.\u00a0 The United States stand ready to support Ukraine through diplomacy to end the war on this basis.\u00a0 President Putin, however, has demonstrated zero interest in engaging, saying there\u2019s nothing to even talk about unless and until Ukraine accepts \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d while doubling down on his brutalization of Ukraine.\nIndependent of what Russia does, we showed here in Delhi what we will do: deliver results on the problems most affecting our peoples\u2019 lives.\u00a0 Our hosts are committed to doing this over the course of their G20 presidency.\u00a0 For that, and for their leadership and hospitality, I\u2019d like to close by expressing my gratitude to India.\nAnd with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 There\u2019s been rising concerns in recent years about democratic backsliding and human rights issues in India, including the rights of religious minorities, and recently with a move against the news organization the BBC.\u00a0 Did you raise U.S. concerns about these issues with your Indian counterpart today, and are you concerned at all that the situation might worsen heading into next year\u2019s federal election in India?\nAnd secondly, Reuters has reported that the U.S. is speaking with allies about potential sanctions for China if it sends lethal aid to Russia for use in Ukraine, as you\u2019ve warned about in the past.\u00a0 Can you comment at all on those discussions and more broadly about your conversations with counterparts today relating to China\u2019s relationship with Moscow?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, on India, we\u2019re the world\u2019s two biggest democracies.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to an enduring project, both of us \u2013 in our case, as our founders put it, striving to form a more perfect union.\u00a0 That\u2019s part of our national ethos.\u00a0 It\u2019s a project for both of us, India and the United States, in different but also complementary ways.\nSo we have to work together to show that our democracies can actually deliver on our peoples\u2019 needs, and we have to continue to hold ourselves to our core values, including respect for universal human rights, like freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, which makes our democracy stronger.\u00a0 So we regularly engage with our Indian counterparts to encourage the Indian Government to uphold its own commitments to protect human rights, just as we look to ourselves to do the same thing.\u00a0 And in most conversations that I have with my counterpart, Foreign Minister Jaishankar, this is an issue that we discussed, again, as we did today.\nWith regard to China and its support for Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, as we\u2019ve said from the start \u2013 and as President Biden made very clear to President Xi going back to the very beginning of the Russian aggression \u2013 were China to engage in material, lethal support for Russia\u2019s aggression or were to engage in the systematic evasion of sanctions to help Russia, that would be a serious problem for our countries.\nWhen I saw Senior Foreign Policy Official Wang Yi in the margins of the Munich meetings just a week or so ago, I raised with him our very real concern that based on information we have, China is considering supplying lethal military assistance to Russia.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not seen it do that yet, but we\u2019ve seen it considering that proposition.\u00a0 And what I shared with him again was that this would be a serious problem for us in our relationship with China, and I made clear that there would be consequences for engaging in those actions.\nSo I\u2019m not going to detail what they would be, but of course we have sanctions authorities of various kinds that would certainly be one of the things that we and others would look at.\u00a0 And I say others because this concern that China is considering providing lethal military assistance to Russia, this is a shared concern.\u00a0 And many other partners have raised this, and not just raised this with us, but \u2013 it\u2019s my understanding \u2013 have raised it directly with China, including here today in Delhi.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Let\u2019s next go to Maha Siddiqui with NDTV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, even though there\u2019s been an outcome statement and the chair summary, in two successive ministerial meetings we\u2019ve not seen consensus in the form of a joint communique.\u00a0 Do you see that as a set back in the run up to the summit in September, and were you perhaps able to communicate this to your Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov when you met him on the sidelines today?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So I think what we\u2019ve seen here, as I mentioned, is actually a first, which is an outcomes document which reflects shared agreements on a number of issues by all of the foreign ministers represented here today.\u00a0 And in the particular case of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, you have virtually everyone in the G20 signing onto what had already been stated in Bali \u2013 and the two holdouts of course were Russia and China.\u00a0 So I think we see broad consensus across the G20 to work together, to act together, and to make commitments together.\nPrime Minister Modi said today that we should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those that we can.\u00a0 And I think what we saw today is a very good reflection of what the prime minister said \u2013 that is work and agreement on a whole series of lines of effort that the G20 will take to address the issues of greatest concern to people around the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s been the focus of the United States.\nWe want to make sure that, even as we and dozens of countries around the world are standing up for the basic principles at the heart of the UN Charter that are being trampled on by Russia and its aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re at the same time also working every single day to address the concerns of people around the world on the issues that are really affecting their lives \u2013 whether it is food insecurity, whether it\u2019s climate change, whether it\u2019s creating economic opportunity, building global health resilience, et cetera.\u00a0 All of those things we\u2019ve advanced on yet again here at the G20, and my full expectation is that, when the leaders get together, you\u2019ll see further very concrete outcomes that reflect that consensus.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Simon Lewis, Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Just to follow up a little bit on what you just discussed on the G20 today, Prime Minister Modi also mentioned in his comments today that multilateralism is in crisis and talked about the architecture of global governance having failed.\u00a0 I wonder if you agreed with that assessment.\u00a0 And since the G20 failed once again to reach a consensus, putting a slightly finer point on it, can this forum still function with Russia as a member?\u00a0 And just to add on your conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I wondered why was it that you felt that this was the moment to raise those issues with the foreign minister.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, [Simon].\u00a0 First, I\u2019d say that of course Prime Minister Modi is right that there are real challenges to the multilateral system, and those challenges in many ways are coming directly from Russia, which has been violating the very principles that lie at the heart of that system and that the system was designed to uphold.\u00a0 And so that is a challenge.\u00a0 And we see that playing out as well, for example, with the United Nations Security Council, where we have two countries in particular that tend to block the attempted actions of the council to address some of the most urgent global concerns.\nOn the other hand, what we\u2019ve seen, I think, speaking very powerfully and eloquently, is the multilateral system in a variety of ways.\u00a0 Three quarters of it coming together at the UN General Assembly to condemn Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine and to insist on a just and durable peace \u2013 that\u2019s the multilateral system.\u00a0 And we see it here today at the G20 thanks to India\u2019s leadership.\u00a0 As I said just a moment ago, even as we\u2019re focused on making sure that Russia can\u2019t succeed in its aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re equally focused on engaging and solving problems that affect people around the world and that they expect us to be focused on, and we\u2019re doing that through the G20.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that through other multilateral organizations, everything from the G7 and numerous other organizations, including other organizations that are within the UN system.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working together on food security, on energy security, on climate, on global health.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019re delivering results.\nSo all of this is to say that, yes, of course, there are real challenges.\u00a0 The prime minister\u2019s right.\u00a0 But I think we\u2019ve demonstrated, including here today in Delhi, that we can find workarounds.\u00a0 And those workarounds, when we have an outlier, can be found in the outcomes document that hopefully has been distributed to everyone.\u00a0 And again, it demonstrates real consensus and real commitment to work together to tackle issues that are affecting people in their daily lives.\u00a0 And as I said a moment ago, I\u2019m also convinced that when the leaders get together to finalize some of these commitments, you\u2019ll see very strong results.\u00a0 And again, from the perspective of the United States, this is exactly what our people expect of us and what the world expects of us.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Suhasini Haidar,\u00a0The Hindu.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, I want you to just follow up on two of your answers already.\u00a0 You just said that you expect strong results when the leader summit happens at the G20.\u00a0 Just how do you see that happening?\u00a0 How do you see the road ahead for the G20 process given that now the document actually names Russia and China as holding up the consensus as well as not agreeing to the previous G20 statement that they had signed on to?\u00a0 They say, of course, that they have their reasons for doing that, but do you really think a joint statement can be forged in the next few months?\u00a0 Do you think the G20 process itself is in peril?\nAnd if I could do a follow-up on Iain\u2019s question about the restrictions on a number of agencies, including NGOs, I wanted to ask specifically about restrictions on American agencies, apart from climate change NGOs as well as human rights NGOs \u2013 specifically about funding restrictions placed on American agencies earlier like the Ford Foundation but now like the National Endowment for Democracy, the Center for Disease Control, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and others.\u00a0 Is that something that you raised with your Indian counterparts?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So two things.\u00a0 First, you\u2019re \u2013 just to make sure that I understand, you\u2019re referring to restrictions that India would place \u2013 would have placed on these organizations.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken up these questions in the past and we have discussed the importance of NGOs and civil society being able to function effectively and freely wherever they are in our own country and here in India.\u00a0 So to the extent that issues have come up related to NGOs, we\u2019ve discussed them directly with our Indian counterparts.\nAs to projecting to the leaders\u2019 summit, first of all, I don\u2019t want to spoil the show.\u00a0 We\u2019ll let the leaders do their work and show the results.\u00a0 But whether that\u2019s reflected in a joint statement, whether it\u2019s reflected in a chair statement that shows that the overwhelming majority of the G20 countries agreed to work together on a course of action, honestly I don\u2019t think that makes a big difference.\u00a0 If there are going to be an outlier country or two, when you have 18 of the 20 agreed on what needs to be done and committed to working together to do it, again, that is effective multilateralism in action \u2013 effective in actually addressing the world\u2019s concerns.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s what you saw today, and I am absolutely convinced that you\u2019ll see that when the leaders get together one way or another\u2026\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everybody.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Have a good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

all my gratitude to the president, to the acting foreign minister, and to all the people I\u2019ve had an opportunity to meet with over the course of this day for what\u2019s been an extraordinarily warm welcome.\nThe partnership between our countries dates back to Uzbekistan\u2019s independence.\u00a0 It\u2019s grown much closer in recent years.\u00a0 Across all of my engagements here, what I come away with is a mutual and enthusiastic commitment to strengthening that partnership even further.\nThat starts with deepening our ties with Uzbekistan\u2019s young people.\u00a0 Over the past five years, the United States has invested $25 million in English-language education, teaming up with the government to train 15,000 Uzbekistani English teachers, providing English-language textbooks to some 10,000 schools.\u00a0 And I had an opportunity to witness some of the work that we\u2019re doing today sitting in on a class with some really extraordinary young people who are only three or four months into English-language education and already sounded incredibly fluent.\nThis is about more than just learning a language.\u00a0 It\u2019s about empowering rising generations of Uzbeks to use their new skills to compete for jobs in markets that demand English proficiency, enabling connections with English speakers across the region and the world, opening doors to exchange programs in the United States, which can create new opportunities for people in both of our countries.\nAnother way that we\u2019re expanding opportunity is by supporting the full implementation of President Mirziyoyev\u2019s reform agenda.\u00a0 The progress that Uzbekistan has made on labor rights shows just how transformative that agenda can be.\u00a0 For 11 years, more than 300 companies banned Uzbek cotton from their products due to the use of child and forced labor.\u00a0 In partnership with national and international labor groups and human rights organizations, the government worked to eradicate this pervasive practice, not only passing a new labor code, but ensuring that it was enforced.\u00a0 Last year, the International Labor Organization determined that Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton sector was free of child and forced labor.\u00a0 This is a historic achievement and it\u2019s a model for countries around the world facing similar challenges.\nIt\u2019s already making a tangible difference in the lives of Uzbek workers, farmers, businesses.\u00a0 Wages are up.\u00a0 Private investment is increasing.\u00a0 People of all ages, including children, are no longer being forced to pick cotton in abusive conditions.\u00a0 We look forward to working with the government to promote similar efforts in other sectors, as well as to fully implement the president\u2019s reform agenda.\u00a0 That includes delivering on commitments to defend religious freedom and press freedom and strengthen protections for vulnerable populations \u2013 issues that I discussed today with the president.\nI also underscored the importance of Uzbekistan fully and transparently investigating allegations of human rights violations committed by law enforcement officers during the July 2020 \u2013 2022 unrest and holding accountable those responsible.\nIn addition to strengthening the U.S.-Uzbekistan relationship, we\u2019re also working together to deepen regional integration.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Saidov and I just came, as you know, from the C5+1 meeting in Astana, where I announced a new commitment to work with Congress to provide an additional $25 million to catalyze economic growth in Central Asia.\u00a0 That brings our total investment in the region since our meeting on the margins of the UN General Assembly last September to more than $66 million.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on diversifying trade routes, fostering greater private investment, providing job training.\nAnd let me emphasize that so much of the work that we\u2019re doing in these \u2013 in these programs and with the investments we\u2019re making from our government really serve as a catalyst for increasing private sector investment.\u00a0 I think the opportunities that the private sector is already engaged in are significant and everything I\u2019m seeing suggests that there is growing enthusiasm, interest, focus on investing here and investing in other countries in Central Asia.\nIt\u2019s also how we provide the support that matters.\u00a0 The United States is making these and other investments in Central Asia openly, transparently, in a way that empowers people across the region to shape their own future, and that meets high labor, human rights, environmental standards.\u00a0 That\u2019s how investment should work.\nWe\u2019ll have a chance to build on these efforts next month in Samarkand when the United States sends a high-level delegation from across our government to a meeting of the U.S.-Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework.\nSo the bottom line is this.\u00a0 A more connected, a more cooperative Central Asia will be better able to determine its own future and deliver for its people\u2019s needs.\u00a0 The United States is committed to supporting that vision.\u00a0 One of the things that we\u2019ve learned over many, many years is that the investments that we make in these partnerships benefit our partners, but they also benefit us, creating potentially new markets for our own products, our own investments, creating new opportunities to partner with countries in meeting global challenges where Central Asia can make a real difference, and just developing new friendships that benefit our country across so many different aspects of our society in many different ways.\nAnd that\u2019s fundamentally why I\u2019ve come here, and I want to emphasize that this is not just a matter of one visit; it\u2019s the work that we\u2019re doing day in, day out, including through our embassies, through our engagement with the private sector, through engagements with civil society and other groups.\u00a0 And we\u2019re in it for the long haul.\nIn our meetings today, I also had a chance to thank the government for its generous aid to the people of Afghanistan, from electricity to emergency humanitarian assistance, especially to women and girls.\u00a0 And we applaud Uzbekistan for repatriating more than 400 family members of terrorist foreign fighters from Syria and Iraq whose reintegration the United States will continue to support.\nFinally, this visit to the region comes against the backdrop of the one-year anniversary of Putin\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 This continues to be a cause for hardship for people around the world, including here in Central Asia.\u00a0 The second- and third-order consequences of this aggression continue to be felt.\u00a0 Indeed, few regions have been more acutely affected than Central Asia, including Uzbekistan, where people continue to shoulder increased food and energy prices.\u00a0 As always, this is hitting the most vulnerable the hardest.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the United States has provided more than $16 million in emergency food aid to this region since President Putin launched his aggression against Ukraine.\nThis hardship makes Uzbekistan\u2019s generosity even more remarkable.\u00a0 The government, the people of Uzbekistan have stepped up to provide food and medical assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0 They continue to host tens of thousands of Russian citizens who fled their country after President Putin launched his war.\nRussia\u2019s invasion has also fostered deep concern across the region.\u00a0 After all, if a powerful country is willing to try to erase the borders of a sovereign neighbor by force, what\u2019s to stop it from doing the same to others?\u00a0 Countries across Central Asia understand this.\u00a0 So does the United States, and so do partners and allies around the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve been committed and remain committed to standing for the sovereignty, the territorial integrity, the independence not only of Ukraine, but for countries across Central Asia and, indeed, around the world.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll go to our first question from Ed Wong of\u00a0The New York Times.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Hey, Ed.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 He\u2019ll survive without the microphone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to follow up on your comments on the Ukraine war.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mm-hmm.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 First, you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re somewhat skeptical of Moscow\u2019s talk of possible negotiations, and you say that the main aim of the U.S. Government right now and European allies is to help Ukraine on the battlefield, yet many of the non-aligned or neutral countries that you\u2019re meeting with this week here and also at the G20 say that they would like to see peace talks open sometime soon, and I expect that pressure will increase.\u00a0 How do you address that?\u00a0 And some have even favorably looked at China\u2019s talking points on that, and I know you\u2019re skeptical of that.\nSecond, at the G20, Russia and China will both be sending their foreign ministers.\u00a0 Do you plan to talk to them one on one or talk to them in a group setting, and what do you plan to say to them about the Ukraine war?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Second \u2013 second part of the question first.\u00a0 No plans to see either at the G20, although I suspect that we\u2019ll certainly be in group sessions of one kind or another together.\nSo the first thing to say is this:\u00a0 No one wants peace more urgently than the people of Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019re the victims every single day of Russia\u2019s aggression, and if they could have peace yesterday, they\u2019d take it and so would we and so would countries around the world who are suffering, as I said, from the second- and third-order effects of Putin\u2019s aggression.\nNow, we all know the simple truth that the war could end tomorrow \u2013 it could end today \u2013 if President Putin so decided.\u00a0 He started it; he can stop it.\u00a0 It\u2019s, on one level, as simple as that.\u00a0 And we should never lose sight of that fact.\u00a0 No one should lose sight of the fact that we have an aggressor and we have a victim, and to have any kind of equivalence between the two, including suggesting who is more committed to peace, I think, is profoundly wrong.\nSecond, if Russia, President Putin, were genuinely prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy necessary to end the aggression, of course we\u2019d be the first to work on that and to engage.\u00a0 But there is zero evidence of that.\u00a0 To the contrary, the evidence is all in the other direction.\u00a0 Just listen to President Putin\u2019s own words.\u00a0 To cite just one example, he said recently, and publicly, that unless and until Ukraine recognizes what he called \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d there\u2019s nothing to even talk about.\u00a0 In other words, unless and until Ukraine accepts the fact that Russia has seized their territory and gets to keep it, they won\u2019t even talk.\u00a0 That\u2019s obviously a nonstarter and it should be a nonstarter not just for Ukraine or for us, but for countries around the world.\u00a0 And I think that certainly resonates here in this region, where every single Central Asian country feels very strongly about their territorial integrity, their sovereignty, their independence \u2013 all of which, of course, were very, very hard-won.\nSo the real \u2013 the real question is whether Russia will get to a point where it is genuinely prepared to end its aggression and to do so in a way that is consistent with the United Nations Charter and these very principles.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I think what you \u2013 what you hear around the world, and you saw reflected in the resolution that was passed at the UN General Assembly by 141 countries, is the strong desire for peace, but for a just and durable peace, just in that it\u2019s consistent with the principles of the UN Charter in terms of territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence, and durable, as I\u2019ve said before, so that we don\u2019t leave things in a place where Russia gets to simply repeat this exercise a year or two years or three years later \u2013 it rests, it rearms, and it reattacks.\u00a0 So I think that\u2019s what we need to be focused on.\nIn terms of the proposal that China put forth, as I\u2019ve said and as others in the government have said, look, there are some positive elements there, including things that China itself has said several times in the past \u2013 very similar to elements that are in Ukraine\u2019s own proposal that President Zelenskyy put out some time ago.\u00a0 But if China was genuinely serious about this, the very first principle it put out \u2013 sovereignty \u2013 it would have been spending all of the last year working in support of the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s full sovereignty.\u00a0 And of course it\u2019s been doing the opposite in terms of its own efforts to advance Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war, blocking and tackling for Russia in international organizations, and, as we\u2019ve made clear recently, now contemplating the provision of lethal military assistance to Russia for its aggression against Ukraine.\nSo China can\u2019t have it both ways.\u00a0 It can\u2019t be putting itself out as a force for peace in public while it, one way or another, continues to fuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Davlat Umarov from Gazeta.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Gazeta\u2019s website.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, during your visit in \u2013 oh, I\u2019m really sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, during your visit in Kazakhstan you mentioned that U.S. is trying to demonstrate its commitments to Central Asian countries as a steadfast partner.\u00a0 You announced even today about additional $25 million to the initiative and also as well as licensing the companies that are working with sanctioned Russian companies.\u00a0 In that regard, I\u2019d like to ask:\u00a0 What are the expectations of the United States from countries of the region, and in particular from Uzbekistan, to be ensured in their commitment as reliable partners, keeping in mind the ongoing war in Ukraine and close ties of the region with Russia and China?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Well, first, what we have been trying to demonstrate throughout this visit, but again, more than that, every single day in our engagement with countries throughout the region \u2013 and by the way, the meeting that we had in Kazakhstan of the C5+1, I think that\u2019s the fourth meeting that I\u2019ve participated in with my colleagues \u2013 but every single day we\u2019re engaged to build the strongest possible partnerships with all of the Central Asian countries.\u00a0 And it starts with our enduring support for their sovereignty, for their independence, for their territorial integrity, and our determination that each be able to determine their own futures consistent with those principles.\nWhat I think we also know very well is that Central Asia is in a complicated part of the world with longstanding relationships with different countries based on history, based on geography, and that\u2019s something that we well understand.\u00a0 But I think we also see each of these countries looking to multiply and deepen their relationships and partnerships with other countries around the world.\u00a0 And in that, the United States wants to be a steadfast partner and a partner that works with them to create new opportunities for people in this region and new opportunities for us to work together.\nNow, as I said earlier, we\u2019re also very well aware of the consequences that the Russian aggression against Ukraine has had for people in Central Asia, and I\u2019d say two things about that.\u00a0 First, the immediate consequences have been, in one way or another, a rise in energy and in food prices, and then, more generally, inflation.\nNow, there\u2019s a simple reason for that.\u00a0 Putin has tried to weaponize energy in his effort to subjugate Ukraine, and in weaponizing energy and trying to hold it back, deny it from different places \u2013 that has contributed to rising prices.\u00a0 We\u2019ve worked very hard to make sure that there was enough energy on world markets to keep prices down.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come directly to the assistance of the \u2013 of countries that were directly targeted by Putin using the energy weapon, but these effects, again, have been felt here in Central Asia as well, and we\u2019re working to mitigate them.\nFood \u2013 Putin also weaponized food.\u00a0 He blocked the breadbasket of the world, Ukraine, from exporting a lot of its grain and food products.\u00a0 And it was only because of the very good work by the United Nations and T\u00fcrkiye that we were able to establish this Black Sea grain corridor that allowed food once again to \u2013 grain and other products to come out of Ukraine and to reach world markets.\u00a0 The majority of that is going to countries in the developing world and in the Global South, but even countries that aren\u2019t directly receiving it are benefiting from the fact that with more Ukrainian food products on the market, the more prices are held in check and are lower.\nSecond part of the equation is this: sanctions, export controls that are being imposed by dozens of countries \u2013 not just the United States \u2013 on Russia.\u00a0 And again, to step back \u2013 it\u2019s not as if we woke up one day and said, oh, let\u2019s impose sanctions and export controls on Russia.\u00a0 The reason for those sanctions and export controls is because of the Russian aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 And countries came together both to support Ukraine in defending itself from the Russian aggression, but also to try to impose costs and pressure on Russia to get it to change its conduct, to stop the aggression, and to make it more difficult for Russia to continue that aggression.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what this is all about.\nBut we\u2019re looking at this very closely.\u00a0 We appreciate the work that countries have done to help prevent the evasion of sanctions, because Russia is looking for ways to nonetheless acquire products and otherwise engage in sanctioned activity.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working closely with governments throughout the region, helping them understand exactly what the sanctions require and, as necessary, looking to see what we can do to mitigate the negative effects that they\u2019re feeling.\u00a0 And this includes, in some cases, issuing licenses for trade where that makes sense, and we\u2019ve been engaged in that \u2013 in that process as well.\nFinally \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry for going on so long, but it\u2019s important \u2013 a big part of the work that we\u2019re doing here is to help the region diversify trade relationships, to build new partnerships and relationships with other countries, including with the United States, so they\u2019re not dependent on any one country or any one source for trade and investment, and at the same time to increase trade and investment within Central Asia itself.\u00a0 There\u2019s a very strong potential market here, and the more connectivity we have among the countries of Central Asia, the more collaboration we have, the stronger that market\u2019s going to be, the more investment it\u2019s going to attract from outside of Central Asia.\nSo we\u2019re working on all of that.\u00a0 And as I noted yesterday and again today, we\u2019ve made some significant new investments to try to do that \u2013 to increase and strengthen the climate, the environment for private sector investment, to strengthen connectivity among these countries, and to help them diversify their trade and investment relationships.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Next we\u2019ll go to Barbara Usher with the BBC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I wanted to follow up on that, what you\u2019ve just been talking about, with a different angle.\u00a0 You say that you\u2019re not asking Central Asian countries to choose between the U.S. and Russia or between the U.S. and China, but you are asking them to divert trade routes away from Russia and China.\u00a0 So isn\u2019t this a new version of the Great Game, which has historical resonance here, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware?\nAnd if I might add briefly, you spoke quite positively about the reforms of the president.\u00a0 Did you also perhaps advise him against trying to change the constitution so that he can extend his term?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Barbara.\u00a0 I think what many countries have recognized, both in Central Asia and beyond, for a variety of reasons in recent years, is that there is tremendous benefit in having a multiplicity of partners when it comes to \u2013 when it comes to trade, when it comes to investment, when it comes to supply chains of one kind or another.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen what disruptions in any one partnership and connection can do, and those disruptions might come from anything from conflict to COVID to climate change.\nSo this experience, I think, is causing countries to look very hard at where they may have dependencies, and it\u2019s in their interest, I think, to find ways to diversify, multiply, expand their relationships, their partnerships, including when it comes to trade and investment.\u00a0 And of course that doesn\u2019t \u2013 that doesn\u2019t need to be something that\u2019s zero-sum.\u00a0 These things can be additive, and countries will benefit tremendously from the increased investment that they\u2019re getting, the increased opportunity that that\u2019s creating.\nSo that\u2019s the recognition that we\u2019re seeing and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to support, to help, and to be a strong partner in helping to achieve.\u00a0 And it really runs the spectrum of things that we\u2019re engaged in with countries here.\u00a0 I mentioned a little while ago the work we\u2019re doing here in Uzbekistan on English-language training.\u00a0 It so happens that at this moment in history \u2013 it was different before; I\u2019m sure at some point in the future it\u2019ll be different \u2013 but right now English happens to be the primary currency for international engagement, whether that\u2019s for businesses, whether that\u2019s for governments and diplomacy, whether that\u2019s for people-to-people connections, whether that\u2019s for the internet.\nAnd so it\u2019s a profound advantage for countries and in some ways even a necessity to build up the proficiency, especially among young people, in the English language, and that\u2019s going to make people much more able to be competitive in a global economic environment, a global world in which, as I said, English is right now the main connective tissue.\u00a0 So that\u2019s just one way in which we\u2019re helping to put countries in a position where they can very effectively diversify their contacts, their connections, their work with other countries.\nWhen it comes to the reform agenda that the president has put forward here, we talked about that at some length today during our meeting.\u00a0 We applauded the steps that had been taken.\u00a0 I noted as well the importance not only of having the strong vision but of fully implementing it, and of course that remains an important work in progress.\u00a0 We talked about the importance of media freedom, having a strong space for civil society, and we did discuss briefly as well the constitutional reform process.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Nikita Makarenko.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Blinken, we feel an enormous pressure from Russian propaganda here, and it really shapes minds of our people, so we, our local media, try to struggle with it.\u00a0 Is there any plans the United States going to help us in this struggle?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, thank you.\u00a0 Well, I think it only underscores the importance of having a strong, vibrant, and well-resourced local media.\u00a0 And one of the things that we discussed today, including with the president, was the importance of that, the need for that in part to be able to deal with misinformation coming from Russia or from any other source.\u00a0 So we have programs, as you know, to support independent media but also in our own engagements with other governments urging them to do what\u2019s necessary to create the right environment in which media can grow, can flourish, and can bring a diversity of voices and a diversity of views to the public.\nAnd with that information, let people make up their minds about what\u2019s right and wrong, what\u2019s good policy and what\u2019s bad policy, what\u2019s an appropriate direction or not.\u00a0 But it\u2019s certainly true that Russia has built up a very strong and long-enduring propaganda and misinformation system that is felt here and is felt in other parts of the world.\u00a0 And the best answer to that, of course, is the strongest possible environment for genuinely free, independent, open media to bring the facts to people and let them make up their minds.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0One more question.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) We are about to start the press conference.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to give the floor to the Secretary of State of the United States, Antony Blinken, and the minister of foreign affairs of Kazakhstan, Mukhtar Tileuberdi.\u00a0 You can pose your questions after we give the floor to our speakers.\u00a0 The floor goes to Mukhtar Tileuberdi, the foreign minister of Kazakhstan.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Distinguished Secretary of State, Mr. Antony Blinken, distinguished members of the American delegation, and media representatives, today I am pleased to receive my friend, the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan on his first official visit to Astana.\u00a0 So far we have met at various international events in Washington, D.C., and today we are here hosting him at his official visit. Welcome to Kazakhstan.\nBefore noon, during the first half of the day, we had a very productive series of meetings with the U.S. delegation, and the State Secretary also held a meeting with the president of our country, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in the course of friendly and constructive talks.\u00a0 They discussed salient issues of bilateral and multilateral agenda, as well as prospects of the Kazakhstan-American cooperation.\u00a0 I am glad to note that cooperation with the United States is developing in the spirit of an enhanced strategic partnership.\u00a0 This is confirmed by the revival of political dialogue, trade, economic, and investment cooperation.\nMutual trade turnover between Kazakhstan and the United States exceeded 3 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, and this figure is 37.2 percent higher compared to the results of the previous year.\u00a0 Export is growing because the U.S. is one of the largest investors in Kazakhstan\u2019s economy since 1993.\u00a0 The total inflow of foreign direct investments from the U.S. to Kazakhstan exceeded 62 billion U.S. dollars, and in the first three quarters of 2022 the volume of American investments increased by 58.8 percent compared to the corresponding period of 2021.\u00a0 About 590 enterprises with the participation of the American capital function are present in Kazakhstan, and more U.S. companies are showing they\u2019re interested in the Kazakh market.\nWe have just finished the C5+1 ministerial meeting of the foreign ministers of the Central Asian countries and the U.S., and the participation of my colleagues from the Central Asian states clearly shows our joint political efforts to strengthen regional ties in a complex international situation.\u00a0 Kazakhstan highly appreciates the commitment of the United States to strengthen cooperation with the Central Asian region.\u00a0 Our country continues a balanced multilateral foreign policy, in accordance with its diplomatic priorities and Central Asia, and the United States remain our major partners.\nFor us, as the host country, this makes the C5+1 format a \u2013 relevant to mechanism of regional cooperation.\u00a0 The C5+1 mechanism has established itself as an effective regional diplomatic platform for promoting economic cooperation, security, as well as sustainable development in Central Asia.\u00a0 During the event, a wide range of issues were discussed, including cooperation on food security, combating terrorism, energy, environment, as well as other pressing issues.\nReturning to the topic of bilateral cooperation, I would like to note that the Secretary of State firmly supports the political and economic reforms initiated by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev aimed at ensuring the democratization and the rule of law.\u00a0 I would like to thank the American side for its intent to further consolidate our bilateral relations.\nThank you for your attention.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to give the floor to the State Secretary of the U.S., Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Mukhtar, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for today.\u00a0 Thank you for \u2013 as you very aptly described today, a very good day both bilaterally as well as with our C5+1 colleagues.\u00a0 And it\u2019s always good to be with you, and it\u2019s particularly good to be here in Kazakhstan.\u00a0 When we hosted your delegation in Washington last May, well, the weather was just a little bit milder than it is today.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s fair to say that the temperature outside is more than made up for by the warmth that you and President Tokayev have shown us on this trip.\u00a0 And I especially want to thank the president for his terrific hospitality, for the generosity of his time, and for the very good conversation that we had.\nI\u2019m here to underscore that the strong partnership, and in particular the enhanced strategic partnership between the United States and Kazakhstan, is moving forward strongly.\u00a0 Ever since being the first nation to recognize Kazakhstan in December of 1991, the United States has been firmly committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of Kazakhstan \u2013 and countries across the region.\u00a0 In our discussions today, I reaffirmed the United States\u2019 unwavering support for Kazakhstan, like all nations, to freely determine its future, especially as we mark one year since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a failed attempt to deny its people that very freedom.\nWe applaud Kazakhstan for continuing to host more than 200,000 Russian citizens who fled their country after President Putin launched his war.\u00a0 And I want to thank the people of Kazakhstan for generously providing food, clothing, medicine, other humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, including setting up those yurts of invincibility in Kyiv and Bucha, where Ukrainians can find warmth and respite from the war.\nI also reiterated that the United States strongly endorses the reform agenda that President Tokayev announced last March.\u00a0 We look forward to seeing the additional concrete steps Kazakhstan will take to realize that agenda, expanding public participation in the political process, increasing government accountability, curbing corruption, introducing presidential term limits, protecting human rights.\u00a0 Those reforms are an important reason why foreign investors, including from the United States, are increasingly turning to Kazakhstan.\u00a0 American businesses were among the first to invest here, injecting more than $50 billion into the Kazakh economy going back to 1991.\nWe are eager to bolster our economic cooperation, not only to strengthen the development and opportunity within Kazakhstan but also to strengthen linkages across Central Asia, promoting the diversification of energy and export, among other investments that will benefit Kazakhstan\u2019s people in very tangible ways.\u00a0 Kazakhstan also continues to be a valued partner on key global issues: reducing the spread of nuclear weapons by dismantling Soviet-era missiles; contributing to vital peacekeeping operations from Lebanon to Mali; exploring the galaxy through space cooperation; repatriating and rehabilitating more than 600 foreign terrorist fighters and their families.\nWe\u2019re grateful to Kazakhstan for its leadership in Central Asia and for hosting the C5+1 Ministerial today \u2013 this is the fourth one that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to participate in as Secretary \u2013 demonstrating our commitment to be a reliable partner to all countries in the region.\u00a0 We discussed with our fellow ministers from Kazakhstan, from Kyrgyzstan, from Tajikistan, from Turkmenistan, from Uzbekistan concrete ways to continue to advance our shared economic, energy, environmental, and security goals.\u00a0 The C5+1 is an increasingly important platform.\u00a0 Central Asian governments are strongest when they work together to address common challenges and to shape their own future.\u00a0 The United States aspires to be steadfast partners in those efforts.\nWe\u2019re working to do our part to try deliver solutions to the shared challenges that are affecting our people, from developing clean energy to contributing \u2013 excuse me \u2013 to combatting diseases like COVID, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis.\u00a0 Back in September, with food and gas prices surging due to Russia\u2019s war of aggression in Ukraine, the U.S. committed $16.5 billion toward food and security here in this region.\u00a0 We also set up the Economic Resilience Initiative for Central Asia \u2013 $25 million to expand regional trade routes, establish new export markets, attract and leverage greater private sector investment, providing people with practical skills for the modern job market.\nToday, I\u2019m announcing an additional $25 million for that initiative, a total of $50 million to build up the regional economy, and especially to make sure that people have the skills they need to succeed in this global economy.\u00a0 To further empower and connect the people of Central Asia, we\u2019re launching an effort to increase English language proficiency for more than 1,000 young professionals in government and across civil society.\nSo we\u2019ve had a very productive day of conversations and new initiatives that we hope will build on those discussions to the benefit of our partners in Central Asia.\u00a0 We sat around the table behind you with our colleagues from the C5+1, and I have a notebook filled with very good, concrete ideas about how we can further deepen our collaboration and address, in practical ways, the challenges that we\u2019re facing.\nI mentioned space exploration a few moments ago, so let me just close by noting that seven astronauts are currently orbiting above us in the International Space Station.\u00a0 They hail from different countries, they speak different languages, but many of these astronauts journeyed to the stars together from Kazakhstan, and they will land here in Kazakhstan when they return to earth.\u00a0 To me, that\u2019s a wonderful symbol of how this country can be a launching pad for our collective progress on earth, through the partnership between the United States and Kazakhstan, across Central Asia, around the globe.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much, dear colleagues.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s high time for you to pose your questions.\u00a0 Please raise your hands, introduce yourselves, and name a person that you would like to address your question to.\u00a0 Please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good evening.\u00a0 My name is Zhanna Alpysbayeva.\u00a0 I am from Atameken Business Channel.\u00a0 I have the following question:\u00a0 The West declared about the need related to bypassing the sanctions.\u00a0 In your opinion, what\u2019s the importance of secondary sovereign sanctions for Kazakhstan, and in which case those sanctions can be imposed here as well?\u00a0\u00a0 Because \u2013 because of these sanctions imposed on Russia, the economies of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan are suffering as well.\u00a0 What are the compensations for our countries?\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Whom you are addressing your question to?\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) To the Secretary of State.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, let me start by saying this:\u00a0 The sanctions that dozens of countries around the world are imposing on Russia, as well as the export controls, didn\u2019t just materialize out of thin air.\u00a0 Countries came together to impose them because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, its aggression against not only Ukraine but against the very principles at the heart of the international system and the United Nations Charter: territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty \u2013 principles that matter deeply to countries in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan.\nAnd so in response to what Russia did, countries around the world, including the United States have been supporting Ukraine in its efforts to defend itself against the Russian aggression, but also to try to put what pressure we can on Russia, to impose costs on Russia so that it stops the aggression, pulls its troops out, and restores Ukraine\u2019s full sovereignty.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is about.\u00a0 So it\u2019s important to put it in that context.\nWe are watching compliance with sanctions very closely, and we\u2019re having an ongoing discussion with a number of countries, including our C5 partners, on the economic spillover effect, because we\u2019re very conscious that this Russian aggression has had real consequences \u2013 not just for Ukraine and not only for the principles I mentioned, but in very concrete ways for countries around the world, including here in Central Asia.\u00a0 We\u2019re issuing licenses that make sense, we\u2019re sharing information with our partners, and we\u2019re supporting the C5 countries in their efforts to diversify their own trade relationships.\nSo for example, licenses have been granted for companies or entities in countries that are engaged with sanctioned Russian companies so that they have time to wind down those activities and cut their ties with Russia.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 We understand that sometimes you need time to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t harm your business.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do our part to strengthen the region and improve the lives of people living in Central Asia, ourselves in concrete ways \u2013 I mentioned a few of them with some of the initiatives that we\u2019ve engaged in.\u00a0 As I said, I announced $25 million through the Economic Resilience Initiative for Central Asia, expanding regional trade routes, so that gives new opportunities, new places for countries to engage and to trade, new export markets so that they\u2019re not reliant just on one country, and then attracting private sector investment.\u00a0 And today, as I mentioned, I\u2019m announcing an additional $25 million to that effort, bringing the total to $50 million.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying we\u2019re very conscious of the spillover consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing everything we can to minimize them, to mitigate them, and create new opportunities, different opportunities for partners here in Central Asia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) If you don\u2019t mind, I would like to add and say that the Government of Kazakhstan and the leadership of the United States established the mechanism of regular consultations on this matter in order to avoid the negative consequences for the economy of Kazakhstan and in order to prevent a possible secondary sanctions.\u00a0 We have national coordinators appointed on both sides, and they are in touch with each other, and we are really thankful to the American side for informing us about possible cases of the imposition of secondary sanctions as early as possible.\nTherefore, I would like to say that for the time being, there is no single Kazakh company or there is not a single Kazakh sector that has been imposed secondary sanctions.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 Who wants to pose our next question?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Vivian Salama from\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 Thank you so much, Foreign Minister, for having us.\u00a0 You actually just answered my first question, so I\u2019m going to mix it up a little bit.\u00a0 Are you concerned at all about how deeply entrenched your economy is with Russia, that it would take too long for, say, new allies, new partners like the U.S. and Europe to be able to sort of fill that void moving forward?\nAnd Mr. Secretary, you also just answered my first question, but I do have a second one for you regarding the potential Chinese lethal aid assistance to Russia.\u00a0 There have been a number of public statements from you and your \u2013 a number of members of President Biden\u2019s cabinet expressing concern about China\u2019s deliberations.\u00a0 Can you elaborate a bit on what the U.S. and its allies are doing to persuade Beijing away from such a move, and what consequences it could face if it delivers on any such aid?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to say that indeed Kazakhstan has very historic ties with both \u2013 with Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 Our economies interconnected for long, long time, and that\u2019s why definitely all this situation is quite heavy for us, for our economy, and we trying to avoid any negative effects from the sanctions.\u00a0 You can understand that Kazakhstan is a member of Eurasian Economic Union, and we don\u2019t have any custom borders between Kazakhstan, Russia, and other members of this union.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why definitely it\u2019s sometimes very difficult to manage how we can provide this free trade by products and services between our borders.\u00a0 But at the same time, we trying to evade any possibilities \u2013 to avoid any possibilities for evasion of sanctions by Russian or even by any foreign companies.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Vivian, as you know, this is something that I raised directly with China\u2019s senior foreign policy official, Wang Yi, when I saw him on the margins of the Munich Security Conference last week.\u00a0 And the backdrop here, of course, goes back to even before Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 Just a few weeks before that, you\u2019ll remember that President Xi and President Putin had a summit meeting in which they talked about a partnership with no limits.\u00a0 And that, of course, in the context of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was a real concern, including the concern that such a partnership might lead China to materially support Russia in its aggression, including with lethal military support and/or with efforts to systematically evade the sanctions that were being imposed on Russia for the aggression against Ukraine.\nAnd as I\u2019ve mentioned going back to, I think, the first conversation between President Biden and President Xi after the Russian aggression, President Biden raised this concern and made very clear to President Xi that were Russia to engage in lethal material support for Russia in the aggression against Ukraine or the systematic evasion of sanctions, this would be a serious problem in our relationship.\nSo we\u2019ve been watching it very carefully from day one.\u00a0 And the reason that I raised this not only with Wang Yi last week but also publicly, along with other colleagues in the administration, is because of concern we have based on information that we have that China is considering moving beyond the nonlethal support that some of its companies have been providing to actually lethal material support for Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine.\nAnd what I can share with you is that we did very clearly warn China about the implications and consequences of going through with providing such support.\u00a0 We will not hesitate, for example, to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions or otherwise engage in supporting the Russian war effort.\nBeyond that, what I heard very clearly from countries around the world that I\u2019ve been engaged with over the past 10 days, since these concerns have first been raised and shared with many countries, is that this is not only something that would be a serious problem for China and its relationship with us, but a serious problem with its relationship with countries around the world.\nAnd let me just add this:\u00a0 China can\u2019t have it both ways when it comes to the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 It can\u2019t be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand while actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has started with the other hand.\nSo I hope that China will take what we said very seriously \u2013 but not only what we said, what many other countries around the world are saying \u2013 and refrain from any further consideration of materially supporting Russia in the war effort.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 Next question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) My name is Yerbolatov.\u00a0 I have a question to be posed to the Secretary of State.\u00a0 So you said \u2013 you know that we are celebrating the one year anniversary of the war of Russia against Ukraine.\u00a0 And if we take into account the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation, is there a threat to peace and security in Central Asia in this regard, taking into account the aggression of Russia against Ukraine?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 The concern that we have is not simply the aggression against Ukraine itself and the horrific things that are being done to its people, but, as I said before, the assault on the very principles that are at the heart of the international system, the heart of the United Nations Charter, that we believe are necessary to keep peace, security, stability around the world, including here \u2013 the principles of territorial integrity, of sovereignty, of independence.\nAnd a big part of the reason why it was so important for countries to stand up against the Russian aggression is not only to help Ukraine defend itself but also to defend those principles.\u00a0 Because if we allow them to be violated with impunity, then that does open up the prospect that Russia itself will continue \u2013 will consider further aggression against other countries if it sets its sight on them, or other countries will learn the wrong lesson and would-be aggressors in every part of the world will say, \u201cWell, if Russia can get away with this, then we can too.\u201d\u00a0 And that\u2019s a recipe for a world of conflict, a world of instability, a world that I don\u2019t think any of us want to live in.\nSo that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so important for so many countries to stand up and say, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t accept this.\u201d\u00a0 I can\u2019t speak to any specific ideas, plans that Russia may have anywhere else.\u00a0 I think its focus is very much on Ukraine.\u00a0 But I can say that had we failed to stand up in support of the principles that Russia was violating by invading Ukraine, that would have created I think a greater prospect that Russian aggression would point in other directions.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 Due to the lack of time, we have one final question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I was going to ask a question that was quite similar to my colleague\u2019s, if I \u2013 Mr. Secretary, if I could ask little bit more, the idea that you had of \u2013 you said repeatedly here that territorial integrity, independent sovereignty of all the Central Asian nations.\u00a0 Do you see that being at risk at all?\u00a0 I know you just mentioned that you don\u2019t see anything specific from Russia, but what are the types of the things that the U.S. could provide, or the security guarantees, if you want to put it that way, diplomatic support?\u00a0 What can the U.S. do to ensure that those values are held?\nAnd if I could ask the foreign minister a bit of the same thing.\u00a0 You mentioned historic ties both with Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 To what extent do you feel any threat, any risk from what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, not just on the economic front but also the security front?\u00a0 Thanks very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Shaun, thank you very much.\u00a0 One of the things that we\u2019re working on in very practical ways is to demonstrate that the United States is a steadfast partner for countries in Central Asia.\u00a0 Our support for their independence, for their sovereignty, for their territorial integrity is real, but it\u2019s particularly manifested in two ways.\u00a0 One, it\u2019s manifested in helping them in different ways develop the strongest possible capacities for their own security, their growing economic prosperity, and the strength and resilience of their societies.\u00a0 That\u2019s the best way to make sure that going forward these countries can determine their own futures consistent with those principles.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing that on a bilateral basis, and we\u2019re doing that, as you mentioned, in the C5+1.\nOne of the things that we\u2019ve seen in Ukraine is that its own resilience to the Russian aggression of course starts with the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people, the extraordinary efforts of its military.\u00a0 But I think it goes beyond that.\u00a0 I think what we\u2019re seeing as well is a resilient society that\u2019s resilient also because it has stronger and stronger institutions, not only within government \u2013 those are usually important \u2013 but also beyond it, including a vibrant free press, including a strong civil society.\u00a0 Each of those things is part of Ukraine\u2019s success story in dealing with Russia\u2019s aggression and in creating a country that\u2019s resilient to the aggression, that can deal with it, and that will bounce back from it.\nAnd so it\u2019s a long way of saying that our partnerships here, the work we\u2019re doing here is also to help our friends in Central Asia build these kinds of strong, resilient societies with strong institutions, with ever greater capacity for their people, with more and more investment coming in from the United States and from other countries, with greater connections among them because these governments ultimately are going to be even stronger when they\u2019re working together to meet common challenges.\u00a0 And I think that creates the kind of region where their ability to uphold their own territorial integrity, their own sovereignty, their own independence will be that much stronger.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 I just mention that definitely Kazakhstan doesn\u2019t allow to use its territory for evasion sanctions, but it doesn\u2019t mean that for today we have or feel any threats or risks from Russian Federation.\nAs I answered to the first question, Kazakhstan is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, Collective Security Treaty Organization, Commonwealth of Independent States, with other states and countries surrounding Russia.\u00a0 So our relationship we consider as an alliance in the framework of all these multilateral structures.\nAnd for bilateral cooperation, relationship, we have solid legal base that \u2013 which is more important that we have the completed delimitation process, the state border between Kazakhstan and Russia, and as you know is the longest land border in the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s over \u2013 more than 7,500 kilometers.\u00a0 Now we are in the process of demarcation.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost 70 percent of this border completed.\u00a0 We have regular consultations between the government and federal states on the different issues.\u00a0 And as you know, Kazakhstan will continue its multi-vector foreign policy.\u00a0 It means that we are trying to keep the system of the check and balances and to develop the mutually beneficial cooperation, relationship with all the countries of the world.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Dear colleagues, our press conference is over.\u00a0Thank you for your attention.\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mr.\u00a0 President, Mr.\u00a0 Secretary-General, fellow council members:\nOne year and one week ago \u2013 on February 17th, 2022 \u2013 I warned this council that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine.\nI said that Russia would manufacture a pretext, and then use missiles, tanks, soldiers, cyber attacks to strike pre-identified targets, including Kyiv, with the aim of toppling Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government.\nRussia\u2019s representative \u2013 the same representative who will speak today \u2013 called these, and I quote, \u201cgroundless accusations.\u201d\nSeven days later, on February 24th, 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\nDue to fierce resistance by Ukraine\u2019s defenders, President Putin failed in his primary objective to conquer Ukraine, end its existence as an independent country, and absorb it into Russia.\nThen, he dusted off his Crimea playbook from 2014: He called snap referenda in four occupied parts of Ukraine, deported Ukrainians, bussed in Russians, held sham votes at gunpoint, and then manipulated the results to claim near unanimous support for joining the Russian Federation.\nWhen President Putin couldn\u2019t break the Ukrainian military, he intensified efforts to break Ukrainians\u2019 spirit.\u00a0 Over the last year, Russia has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian men, women, and children; uprooted more than 13 million people from their homes; destroyed more than half of the country\u2019s energy grid; bombed more than 700 hospitals, 2,600 schools; and abducted at least 6,000 Ukrainian children \u2013 some as young as four months old \u2013 and relocated them to Russia.\nAnd yet, the spirit of the Ukrainians remains unbroken; if anything, it\u2019s stronger than ever.\nWhen Ukraine launched a counteroffensive that retook large swaths of its territory, President Putin conscripted an additional 300,000 men \u2013 throwing more and more of Russia\u2019s young people into a meat grinder of his own making.\u00a0 And he unleashed the Wagner Group \u2013 mercenaries who have committed atrocities from Africa to the Middle East, and now, in Ukraine.\nOf course, that\u2019s not the whole story of the last year.\nThere is also the story of Ukraine\u2019s people.\u00a0 Vastly outnumbered, they have fought bravely to defend their nation, their freedom, the right to determine their own future.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve demonstrated inspiring unity in helping one another endure Moscow\u2019s relentless assault.\nTeachers and community members give classes in bunkers to children. \u00a0City workers improvise patches to restore heat and power and water to residents.\u00a0 Neighbors set up soup kitchens to feed the hungry.\nThere\u2019s also the story of how the international community has come together.\nThe vast majority of member-states have voted multiple times to condemn Russia\u2019s violations of the UN Charter and reject its illegal attempt to seize Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 Yesterday, 141 countries voted in the General Assembly for a resolution that reaffirms the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, denounces Russia\u2019s atrocities, expresses support for a just and comprehensive peace, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nWhen President Putin tried to weaponize hunger \u2013 exploiting the worst global food crisis since the creation of the UN \u2013 the international community responded swiftly.\nSince the United States chaired a Food Security meeting last May, more than 100 countries have signed onto a set of concrete commitments to alleviate hunger.\u00a0 Thanks in large part to the Secretary-General Guterres and T\u00fcrkiye, the Black Sea Grain Initiative loosened Russia\u2019s stranglehold on Ukraine\u2019s ports and brought down the cost of grain for the world.\u00a0 Now, as Moscow again tries to throttle its output, we have to ensure that that initiative is extended and expanded.\nWhen President Putin tried to weaponize energy, we redirected natural gas supplies from across the world, so that countries Russia targeted could keep their people warm in the winter.\u00a0 And Europe took extraordinary steps to end its dependence on Russian energy.\nNo country has endured greater hardship from Russia\u2019s war than Ukraine, but almost every country has felt the pain.\u00a0 And yet, nations around the world continue to stand with Ukraine.\u00a0 Because we all recognize that if we abandon Ukraine, we abandon the UN Charter itself, and the principles and rules that make all countries safer and more secure.\nNo seizing land by force.\nNo erasing another country\u2019s borders.\nNo targeting civilians in war.\nNo wars of aggression.\nIf we do not defend these basic principles, we invite a world in which might makes right, the strong dominate the weak.\u00a0 That\u2019s the world this body was created to end.\u00a0 And members of this council have a unique responsibility to make sure that we do not return to it.\u00a0 We can do that in three ways.\nFirst, we must push for a just and durable peace.\nNow I expect that many countries will call for peace today.\nNo one wants peace more than the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 And the United States has long made clear \u2013 even before this war \u2013 that we\u2019re prepared to engage in any meaningful diplomatic effort to stop Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nBut history teaches us that it\u2019s the nature of peace that matters.\nFor peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence.\nFor peace to be durable, it must ensure that Russia can\u2019t simply rest, rearm, and relaunch the war in a few months or a few years.\nAny peace that legitimizes Russia\u2019s seizure of land by force will weaken the charter and send a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they can invade countries and get away with it.\nPresident Zelenskyy has put forward a ten-point plan for a just and durable peace.\u00a0 President Putin, by contrast, has made clear that there is nothing to talk about until Ukraine accepts, and I quote, \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d while doubling down on his brutal tactics.\nMembers of this council have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that any peace is just and durable.\nCouncil members should not be fooled by calls for a temporary or unconditional ceasefire.\u00a0 Russia will use any pause in fighting to consolidate control over the territory it\u2019s illegally seized and replenish its forces for further attacks.\u00a0 That\u2019s what happened when Russia\u2019s first assault on Ukraine froze in 2015.\u00a0 Look at what followed.\nAnd members of this council should not fall into the false equivalency of calling on both sides to stop fighting, or calling on other nations to stop supporting Ukraine in the name of peace.\nNo member of this council should call for peace while supporting Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and on the UN Charter.\nIn this war, there is an aggressor and there is a victim.\nRussia fights for conquest.\u00a0 Ukraine fights for its freedom.\nIf Russia stops fighting and leaves Ukraine, the war ends.\u00a0 If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.\nThe fact remains: \u00a0One man \u2013 Vladimir Putin \u2013 started this war; one man can end it.\nSecond, even as we work to end Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, members of this council must continue to address other challenges to international peace and security.\nWe hear the concerns of countries who worry that standing with Ukraine and holding Russia accountable is diverting focus and resources from others in need.\nTo those countries, I would say, simply, look at our actions.\nAnd when you hear Russia and its defenders accuse the countries who support Ukraine of ignoring the rest of the world \u2013 I say look at Moscow\u2019s actions.\nCompare the numbers.\u00a0 In addition to the $13.5 billion in food aid that the United States contributed to fight hunger over the last year, we also fund more than 40 percent of the World Food Program\u2019s budget.\u00a0 Russia contributes less than 1 percent of that budget.\nThat\u2019s not an outlier.\u00a0 Based on the latest UN figures, the United States donates over nine times as much as Russia to UN peacekeeping.\u00a0 We donate 390 times as much as Russia to UNICEF.\u00a0 We give nearly a thousand times as much as Russia to the UN Refugee Agency.\nThird, we must reaffirm our commitment to upholding what the UN Charter calls, and I quote, \u201cthe dignity and worth of the human person.\u201d\nWe must continue to compile evidence of Russia\u2019s ongoing and widespread atrocities, including executions; torture; rape and sexual violence; the deportation of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to Russia.\nWe must continue to document Russia\u2019s war crimes and crimes against humanity, and share this evidence with investigators and prosecutors, so that one day, the perpetrators can be held accountable.\nDay after day of Russia\u2019s atrocities, it\u2019s easy to become numb to the horror, to lose our ability to feel shock and outrage.\u00a0 But we can never let the crimes Russia is committing become our new normal.\nBucha is not normal.\u00a0 Mariupol is not normal.\u00a0 Irpin is not normal.\u00a0 Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal.\u00a0 Stealing Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to people in Russia is not normal.\nWe must not let President Putin\u2019s callous indifference to human life become our own.\nWe must force ourselves to remember that behind every atrocity in this wretched war, in conflicts around the world, is a human being.\nI recently visited an exhibit of artwork made by Ukrainian children affected by the war.\nOne painting I saw was made by a ten-year-old girl named Veronika.\u00a0 Last April, Russian forces shelled her home in Vuhledar, killing her whole family.\u00a0 When first responders dug her from the rubble, a piece of shrapnel was lodged in her skull.\u00a0 Her left thumb had been ripped off.\u00a0 Doctors saved her life, but the attack left her right hand mostly paralyzed, and she can\u2019t see out of her left eye.\nIn her painting, Veronika drew herself in a bright pink and orange dress, holding a bouquet of flowers.\u00a0 A building stands next to her.\u00a0 When asked who lived there, she said it was a place where all the people she knew who had been killed in the war could be safe.\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u2026\u201d That\u2019s how the UN Charter begins.\nFellow members of this council: \u00a0Now is the time to meet that promise.\u00a0 There are so many people in Ukraine who want the same thing as that little girl, Veronika: a world where they can live in peace, in their own country, and keep the people they love safe.\nWe have the power, we have the responsibility to create that world, today and for generations to come.\u00a0 We cannot \u2013 we will not \u2013 let one country destroy it.\nThank you.\n",

another expression, a continual expression, of the unbreakable bond between Israel and the United States.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the great alliances of modern history.\u00a0 We share common interests, which are growing by the day.\u00a0 We share common values; two strong democracies which will remain, I assure you, two strong democracies.\nThis alliance is something that President Biden is committed to.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known him for 40 years.\u00a0 He\u2019s a true friend of Israel, a true champion of this alliance, as are you.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure that all of Israel know your own contribution in helping us with missile defense in times of peril.\u00a0 You\u2019ve actually helped us during one crisis in record time and then did so again; and you\u2019ve also just helped us push back on the attempts to delegitimize Israel in the United Nations.\u00a0 And we\u2019re grateful for that and for your continual friendship.\nYour visit comes at an important time.\u00a0 It\u2019s a time where many in the international community \u2013 I would say most of the international community \u2013 have seen the true face of Iran.\u00a0 They\u2019ve seen the barbarism of this regime against its own people.\u00a0 They\u2019ve seen how it exports aggression beyond its border and beyond the Middle East, and I think there is a common consensus that this regime must not acquire nuclear weapons.\nWe\u2019ve had very good discussions on forging a common policy on trying to work together to thwart the danger.\u00a0 I can repeat again something that you\u2019ve heard me say many times:\u00a0 Our policy, and my policy, is to do everything within Israel\u2019s power to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.\u00a0 And that will remain so.\u00a0 But obviously, the fact that we and the United States are working together is something that is important for this common goal as well.\nIn addition to thwarting the danger, we also see an opportunity to seize opportunities, the opportunities of expanding the circle of peace.\u00a0 We intend to deepen the peace that we\u2019ve already made in the Abraham Accords.\u00a0 We discussed some of the initiatives that we are considering doing together, but also to perhaps achieve dramatic breakthroughs that I think could be both historic and enormously significant in our common efforts to bring prosperity, security, and peace to this part of the world and to \u2013 and beyond.\nSo with this in mind, I have to tell you that I also believe that expanding the circle of peace \u2013 working to close, finally, the file of the Arab-Israeli conflict \u2013 I think would also help us achieve a workable solution with our Palestinian neighbors.\u00a0 And for all these reasons, I welcome you once again to Jerusalem.\u00a0 Welcome.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Prime Minister, thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to see you, and I want to thank you for what has been, as always, a very productive, very candid, and I think important discussion that covered a lot of issues.\nJust as I did upon arrival in Israel, I had a chance to express directly to the prime minister my condolences and that of the United States Government for the seven Israelis who were killed in the horrific terrorist attack early this week outside their synagogue.\u00a0 President Biden called the prime minister immediately after the attack to underscore the United States\u2019 steadfast support for Israel and its people, a message that I reaffirmed in the meeting we just had.\nIn the context of this attack and escalating violence, it\u2019s important that the Government and people of Israel know America\u2019s commitment to their security remains ironclad.\u00a0 That commitment is backed up by nearly 75 years of United States support.\u00a0 America\u2019s commitment has never wavered.\u00a0 It never will.\u00a0 And today the prime minister and I discussed ways that we can continue to strengthen our partnership and our shared security interests.\nWe agree that Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon, and we discussed deepening cooperation to confront and counter Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region and beyond.\u00a0 Just as Iran has long supported terrorists that attack Israelis and others, the regime is now providing drones that Russia is using to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians.\nIn turn, Russia is providing sophisticated weaponries to Iran.\u00a0 It\u2019s a two-way street.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s ongoing atrocities only underscore the importance of providing support for all of Ukraine\u2019s needs \u2013 humanitarian, economic, and security \u2013 as it bravely defends its people and its very right to exist, a topic that we also discussed today.\nNow, one of the most effective ways to make Israel more secure is to continue to build bridges in the region and even well beyond the region.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019ve worked relentlessly to deepen and broaden the Abraham Accords and other normalization agreements between Israel and Arab states.\u00a0 Earlier this month, a large delegation from across the United States Government joined representatives from Israel, from Bahrain, from Egypt, from Morocco, from the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi for the first meeting of the Negev Forum Working Groups.\u00a0 This was the largest gathering of Israel and Arab officials since the 1991 Madrid Conference.\nThese groups are focusing on issues affecting the lives and livelihoods of all of our people \u2013 food and water security, clean energy, health care, education and coexistence, tourism, regional security.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of a comprehensive effort to enable collaboration not only between our governments but also our businesses, entrepreneurs, civil societies, young people.\nThe prime minister has spoken about our ability to do big things together.\u00a0 Well, Israel\u2019s greater integration in the region is very much one of them.\u00a0 A few years ago this kind of cooperation would have been unimaginable.\u00a0 Today it is genuinely fostering new opportunities for people across the participating countries to connect, to collaborate, to learn, from teaming up on cancer research, to launching new startups in green energy and drought-resistant agriculture, to competing in real sports and e-sports.\nEach of these interactions helps chip away at enduring biases and mistrust, and this never would have happened without the leadership of the prime minister.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined to keep building on that progress, on new issues with new countries, as we work to strengthen the circle of peace.\nThese efforts are not a substitute for progress between Israelis and Palestinians, but as we advance Israel\u2019s integration, we can do so in ways that improve the daily lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.\u00a0 And that\u2019s crucial to moving toward our enduring goal of Palestinians and Israelis enjoying equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, justice, and dignity.\u00a0 President Biden remains fully committed to that goal.\nWe continue to believe that the best way to achieve it is through preserving and then realizing the vision of two states.\u00a0 As I said to the prime minister, anything that moves us away from that vision is, in our judgment, detrimental to Israel\u2019s long-term security and its long-term identity as a Jewish and democratic state.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re urging all sides now to take urgent steps to restore calm, to de-escalate.\u00a0 We want to make sure that there\u2019s an environment in which we can, I hope, at some point create the conditions where we can start to restore a sense of security for Israelis and Palestinians alike, which of course is sorely lacking.\nWe also remain committed to supporting religious coexistence and diversity, including in Jerusalem.\u00a0 We continue to support upholding the historic status quo at Jerusalem\u2019s holy places, including the Temple Mount Haram al-Sharif.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to the prime minister for his repeated expressions of support for that position.\nOne of the things that makes the partnership between us so strong is that it goes well beyond any one American or Israeli government.\u00a0 Few people understand that better than President Biden, who\u2019s worked closely with every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir, and Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has worked closely with his share of American presidents.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:\u00a0 Quite a few.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Throughout the relationship between our countries, what we come back to time and again is that it is rooted both in shared interests and in shared values.\u00a0 That includes our support for core democratic principles and institutions, including respect for human rights, the equal administration of justice for all, the equal rights of minority groups, the rule of law, free press, a robust civil society \u2013 and the vibrancy of Israel\u2019s civil society has been on full display of late.\nThe commitment of people in both our countries to make their voices heard, to defend their rights, is one of the unique strengths of our democracies.\u00a0 Another is a recognition that building consensus for new proposals is the most effective way to ensure they\u2019re embraced and that they endure.\u00a0 Our fellow democracies can also make us stronger.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the United States and Israel have done for each other over many decades, by holding ourselves to the mutual standards we\u2019ve established; and by speaking frankly and respectfully, as friends do, when we agree and when we do not.\nThe discussion that the prime minister and I had today was no exception.\u00a0 That conversation will continue, including with other members of Israel\u2019s Government and civil society, as part of a perpetual process to defend and bolster the pillars of our democracy, which we are both committed to.\nSo Mr. Prime Minister, again, thank you so much for your hospitality, for the very good conversation, and for the enduring partnership between our countries.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:\u00a0 Thank you.\n",

		"content": "\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:\u00a0\u00a0(Via translation) Good evening.\nI\u2019m glad to welcome my dear friend Secretary Blinken once again in Egypt.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to receive him here at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\u00a0 We value the friendly relations between our countries and we are keen on enhancing these relations on the basis of mutual respect and interests.\u00a0\u00a0The variety of issues that have been tackled during our discussions reflected the clear rapprochement regarding our strategic interests and showed also our matching visions towards several issues, and also showed great potential to develop our strategic partnership in many fields.\nSecretary Blinken was received this morning by President Sisi, and during the meeting, they tackled the bilateral relations between the two countries, the strategic nature of these relations, and the consistency in visions of the two countries whether in regards to developing the strategic relations or international and regional issues.\u00a0 We greatly depend on the cooperation between Egypt and the United States to achieve stability in the Middle East, and to push forward the development efforts according to the principles of international legitimacy and according to the mutual interests that we\u2019re working to enhance.\nThe Middle East region took up a large part of the discussions of Secretary Blinken with the president or in our wider discussions as the Palestinian issue was discussed, and the importance of achieving stability and preventing escalation to find the right political framework to reach a permanent, comprehensive, and just solution for the Palestinian issue on the basis of the two-state solution.\u00a0\u00a0For sure, the latest developments were unfortunate and we are working on containing the situation and reaching calm bearing into consideration the interests of all parties and the stability of the region.\nOur meeting also discussed the GERD issue and the importance of continuing the joint action to preserve the interests of all three parties according to international law and legitimate rights to preserve water resources and ensure Egypt\u2019s water security.\u00a0 We also tackled the issues of Libya, and Sudan, and the importance of joint action to face all the challenges that we both work to overcome, like combating terrorism and extremism, which are considered top priorities.\nWe are working together to convene the joint economic committee this year on the occasion of 100 years of relations, and this has increasing importance in light of the current economic conditions and the pressures facing not only Egypt but also facing many other developing countries.\u00a0 We are looking forward to more U.S. investments and joint actions to face these challenges and overcome these difficulties.\nI welcome again Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to be meeting and I consider him a friend.\u00a0\u00a0Our meetings are always fruitful and help in enhancing our mutual interests, and we will keep in contact during the coming period to achieve our mutual interests.\u00a0 The floor is yours, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first of all, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 And Mr. Shoukry, Sameh, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your wonderful hospitality today, but thank you for the friendship and partnership over many, many years.\u00a0 As the minister said, we have known each other for a long time going back to the days when the minister was ambassador to Washington, and I very much value the relationship that we have that we\u2019ve built over many years.\u00a0 And I also want to express appreciation to the president for receiving us today and for the time that we were able to spend together and the very good conversation that we had.\nWe\u2019ve had an opportunity to come together many times over the last months and last couple of years, including most recently at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, COP27 of course here in Egypt, the Negev Forum and \u2013 in Washington and Cairo separately.\u00a0 And this regular engagement is a reflection of how much our countries, both of us, value the strategic partnership between us, and how important it is to the region and, indeed, to the entire world.\u00a0 Both the United States and Egypt are firmly committed to deepening that bilateral relationship.\nA key priority in that relationship is building on the longstanding economic cooperation that we\u2019ve had to the mutual benefit of Americans and Egyptians.\u00a0 Through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we are supporting a $600 million project to build an undersea telecommunications cable that will connect Singapore to France through Egypt and the Horn of Africa, delivering high-speed, reliable, secure connections for people across the continents, including Egyptians.\nEgypt has some of the best solar and wind energy potential in the world.\u00a0 We recently sent a green economy trade mission to ensure that American companies are competing in this country\u2019s renewable energy market.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to establishing and moving forward, as you heard the minister say, on the Joint Economic Commission to actually build even greater cooperation on economic and commercial issues.\u00a0 And the goal in all of this, as we discussed today, including with the president, is to produce concrete results, to produce real, new opportunities for people \u2013 jobs, livelihoods, a better future.\u00a0 That\u2019s the common objective.\nWe\u2019re also partnering very closely on the climate crisis, which is also its own opportunity to create good paying jobs for our people.\u00a0 We conveyed the appreciation for Egypt\u2019s leadership during the COP27, as well as the national commitments that it made, including a pledge to quadruple its renewable energy share through the NWFE and adopt an ambitious 2050 emissions reductions target.\u00a0 We in the United States are very proud to support these efforts, including through a new public-private partnership that aims to raise $50 million to preserve the extraordinary Red Sea coral reef.\nThe climate crisis further underscores the importance of a swift diplomatic resolution to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.\u00a0 We have heard clearly from Egyptian leadership that this is an existential concern for Egypt.\u00a0 We appreciate that fact.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to working toward a settlement that advances the interests of all parties, that supports the water security, the economic development, and the livelihood of Egyptians, and also their neighbors in Sudan and in Ethiopia.\u00a0 Like all difficult discussions, that process is best served by a spirit of flexibility and compromise from all sides, but we fully recognize and appreciate the quite literally existential issues \u2013 interests that Egypt has in water.\nThroughout its history, Egypt has spearheaded efforts to address some of the world\u2019s most complex challenges and promoted a more peaceful, a more secure, and a more prosperous region.\u00a0 It continues to play that role, and that role remains as critical \u2013 maybe even more critical than it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 Egypt\u2019s engagement in the Negev Forum is helping to accelerate cooperation between Israel and its neighbors, contributing to a more integrated and ultimately more prosperous region.\nJust a few weeks ago, we had delegations from the Government of the United States and Egypt joining those from Israel, Bahrain, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi for the first meeting of the working groups under the Negev Forum, where we\u2019re working together on some of the most important issues affecting the lives and livelihoods of people in all of our countries \u2013 food security, clean water technology, health care, regional security.\u00a0 This was the largest gathering of representatives from Arab countries in Israel since the Madrid process.\nEgypt has also consistently played a critical role in de-escalating tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, including helping to broker a ceasefire when violence escalated in 2021, and then again last year in 2022.\u00a0 Today, as we see a new and horrifying surge in violence, I discussed with President Sisi and with the foreign minister how we can work together, as always, to reduce tensions, to restore calm.\nEgypt\u2019s leadership has been critical in addressing the ongoing crisis in Libya; you heard the minister address that as well.\u00a0 Holding elections this year is the only viable path to a durable solution and to ensuring that the Libyans people \u2013 the Libyan people, excuse me, actually have the right to choose their own leaders.\u00a0 The progress on a constitutional basis for elections announced in Egypt earlier this month was an important step forward in that direction.\u00a0 Now, we stand behind the work of the United Nations special representative in forging a credible roadmap to swift and early elections in Libya.\nWe also discussed our ongoing efforts to support the Sudanese-led political process that\u2019s aimed at restoring Sudan\u2019s transition to democracy.\u00a0 Sudan\u2019s future depends on forging a government that meets its people\u2019s demand for freedom, for peace, for justice.\u00a0 And the stability that will come with that in turn will bring economic and security benefits to people across the region.\nHuman Rights was also, as it is, a top item on our agenda today, as it is with partners around the world and in our conversations with many other countries.\u00a0 The United States welcomes the important steps that Egypt has taken to protect freedom of religion, to empower women.\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of a national dialogue, the release of hundreds of detainees, the reactivating of a presidential pardons committee.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to encourage the Egyptian Government to take further actions to pursue concrete progress, including further releases of prisoners, reforms to pretrial detention, and other law enforcement practices; protecting the essential work of civil society, including journalists, human rights defenders; and making sure that all Egyptians can freely express themselves without any fear of reprisal.\u00a0 That\u2019s the message I shared when I met with leading Egyptian human rights defenders yesterday.\nMaking tangible and lasting improvements on human rights is essential to strengthening even more our bilateral relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s a priority for members of our Congress from both of our parties.\u00a0 And it\u2019s fundamentally in the interest of the Egyptian people, which is why I know the President is pursuing these efforts.\nFinally, we discussed Russia\u2019s brutal war on Ukraine.\u00a0 Egypt\u2019s votes in the United Nations to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion and reject Moscow\u2019s attempts to illegally annex parts of Ukraine have been a powerful demonstration of support for the principles that are at the heart of the United Nations Charter, to which both of our countries adhere, including the right of every nation to have its territorial integrity respected, its sovereignty respected.\u00a0 When Egypt stands up for the shared principles, countries around the world take notice.\nRussia\u2019s war, of course, is exacting severe costs on people here in Egypt, half a world away.\u00a0 Egypt is the biggest importer of wheat in the world, and up to 85 percent of its supplies have traditionally come from Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working to mitigate the damage that\u2019s been done, the economic strain that\u2019s been imposed on Egypt by supporting its long-term capacity to produce its own food, including a $50 million investment to help support smallholder farmers, which builds on the more than $1.4 billion that we provided to the Egyptian agricultural sector over recent decades.\u00a0 As well, we\u2019re addressing assistance to help try to meet the more immediate, urgent concerns, again, that have been dramatically exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\nLast year, our countries marked more than \u2013 marked, excuse me, a hundred years of bilateral relations.\u00a0 We are proud of this shared history, but ultimately it is our shared future that we\u2019re focused on and that our discussions today and everyday focus on.\u00a0 Yesterday I got a chance to meet with some young Egyptian leaders who are shaping that future in virtually every arena \u2013 from journalism to business, from medicine to high technology.\u00a0 And seeing their dynamism, their energy, their vision gives me great confidence that the future of Egypt and the future of our relationship is bright, is strong, and will carry us forward.\nWith that, I thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via translation) Minister Sameh Shoukry.\u00a0 U.S.- Egyptian relations are strategic and extend over many decades. The current economic crisis in the world is very tough, and Egypt has been affected in many areas.\u00a0\u00a0However, there is a feeling among many Egyptians that U.S. economic aid is not up to the standard of the relationship as the United States is the biggest economy.\u00a0 Did you feel during today\u2019s meetings that there will be a change in the level and amount of support?\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken pointed out the projects that will be implemented in the energy field and other types of funding.\u00a0\u00a0Would you summarize to us what has been agreed upon?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:\u00a0 (Via translation) Thank you.\u00a0 Egypt values the economic aspect of the U.S.-Egyptian relationship and the development that we have achieved during the last four decades in this regard, starting from the economic aid which was provided and which was reduced due to U.S. needs, and how Egypt responded to that.\u00a0 We are looking forward to more cooperation and contribution from the United States as it has well-known capabilities and, for sure, the projects mentioned by Mr. Secretary are very important, but they are projects limited to technical aspects.\nHowever, the crisis that we\u2019re facing, and other developing countries are currently facing as well \u2013 such as high inflation, food security and energy security pressure, and high prices \u2013 are all issues that need more cooperation within the framework of the strategic relationship, and there is a need to make use more of U.S. potential, whether through working with international financing institutions or through the bilateral relations.\nI felt that Secretary Blinken understood and appreciated these economic pressures, and there is a desire to contribute to alleviating these pressures.\u00a0 And we hope the coming meetings of the joint economic committee will help create a framework and effective mechanisms that are useful to us, and this is not just limited to the fruitful cooperation between the private sectors in both countries as Egypt host many U.S. company.\u00a0 The U.S. administration also has mechanisms regarding\u00a0the export guarantee and other U.S. resources that may relieve the burden on the Egyptian people and the Egyptian economy in this critical time.\nWe have great ambition and our partner should help us cherish this ambition within the framework of the strategic relation and mutual benefit. The stability of Egypt and its strength contribute to realizing the mutual interests of both countries and reaping benefits for both sides.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Good to see you, Mr. Secretary, again.\u00a0 Prime Minister Netanyahu, in his cabinet meeting, threatened to deport Palestinian families of perpetrators of attack against Israel and stripping them of their nationality.\u00a0 Israel has been demolishing Palestinian homes as well.\u00a0 Do you see this as a collective punishment?\u00a0 Is it a violation of international law, and will it lead to escalation?\n(In Arabic.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Okay.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, just very quickly, on the last question \u2013 because I just wanted to add very quickly to that on the economic relationship and the work we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 You\u2019re right, of course, that there\u2019s a long history here.\u00a0 Over the course of the last decades, the United States has provided about $30 billion in economic assistance to Egypt.\u00a0 But what we\u2019re focused on now is the current challenge and also the current opportunity.\nThe current challenge is this:\u00a0 Egypt, like a number of other countries, many of us, is being buffeted by an almost perfect storm of events that are having a direct and clear impact on the day-in, day-out lives of the Egyptian people.\u00a0 Global inflation is having a big impact.\u00a0 Rising food prices, energy prices \u2013 much of this exacerbated by events happening half a world away, as I mentioned.\u00a0 The Russian aggression against Ukraine has had an impact on both of those.\u00a0 The effort to rebound from COVID, disruptions to the global supply chain \u2013 so many of these things coming together in a perfect storm and having a real impact on people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 We\u2019re very conscious of that, concerned about that, and working closely together to help address that.\u00a0 I mentioned some of the ways we\u2019re working to address food insecurity.\u00a0 There\u2019s much that we\u2019re doing on energy as well.\nBut I would just highlight both the \u2013 some of the projects that I mentioned that are already underway, including the undersea cable, which is significant, but also the work of this Joint Economic Commission, which we\u2019re standing up and, as the minister and I agreed, really needs to focus on concrete, tangible things that can produce opportunity for people.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have a lot more to say about that in the weeks ahead, but it\u2019s important and it\u2019s a sign of the commitment we have to working together to strengthen our economic relationship, to provide more investment, more trade.\u00a0 I would say also that the work that Egypt is doing, including under the new IMF program in terms of the reforms that it\u2019s making, is very important for the long-term economic success of Egypt.\nWith regard to the question on Israel, I\u2019ll have a lot more to say in Israel when I\u2019m there and on the West Bank over the next day or so.\u00a0 I want to have an opportunity to hear from everyone concerned, and I\u2019ll be doing that.\u00a0 There is no question that this is a very difficult moment. We\u2019ve seen the horrific terrorist attacks in recent days.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen over many months rising violence that is affecting so many.\u00a0 As you heard very clearly, the condemnation from the United States of the terrorist attacks \u2013 the President, the Vice President, myself.\u00a0 And we deplore overall the loss of innocent civilian life.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be reiterating that message and encouraging the parties to take steps to calm things down, to de-escalate tensions.\u00a0 We, like Egypt, continue to stand behind the importance of working toward a two-state solution.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have more to say about that as well.\nAnd I would just note that throughout all of this, Egypt has played a very important role.\u00a0 As I mentioned, Cairo\u2019s efforts last year and the year before to help diffuse two crises was instrumental in successfully diffusing them.\u00a0 And Egypt, like us, is a stalwart believer in the negotiated two-state solution, the only path to a lasting resolution to the conflict and, critically, equal measures of democracy, opportunity, and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via translation) Omar from Sky News Arabia.\u00a0 A question to the Egyptian foreign minister:\u00a0 From Minister Blinken\u2019s words and what was issued yesterday by the U.S. State Department, which was an affirmation of Egypt\u2019s role in calming and stabilizing the region \u2013 so after meeting President Sisi, I mean, did a reaffirmation of this matter happen?\u00a0 Did you discuss with the U.S. side a possible Egyptian role or a partnership between Egypt and Cairo and Washington in this file?\u00a0 Can we hear in the coming days what can be described as an initiative that unites the efforts of Cairo and Washington in this context, especially since Minister Blinken will go today and tomorrow to Palestine and Israel?\u00a0 Will he carry this perception?\u00a0 Can there be a role for Egypt in this context?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:\u00a0\u00a0(Via translation) Certainly there is an extended and continuous partnership between Egypt and the United States to deal with all regional issues, especially the Palestinian cause, and to work not only to calm things down and not escalate tensions, but also to find an appropriate political path in accordance with the rules of international legitimacy and in accordance with international consensus on the need to reach a permanent and comprehensive solution through a negotiation process, a political path based on the principle of a two-state solution, Egypt\u2019s efforts, whether in cooperation with the United States and its other partners, or within the framework of its bilateral relations with all parties \u2013 whether it is the Palestinian National Authority, Israel, Jordan, the Arab countries \u2013 to always work towards achieving stability and achieving interests for all.\nThe parties coexist together to get out of this crisis and its destructive effects on the security and stability of the peoples of the entire region, and the broad prospects for resolving this crisis and a permanent solution and the establishment of the Palestinian state to completely change the map of the region or unleash its capabilities and capabilities.\u00a0 Certainly cooperation with the United States and coordination in that is necessary and important, and we do this and play supportive roles for each other, and we also formulate a vision in which there is a lot of consensus on the steps which we take considering the two parties to the conflict and any initiatives that are crystallized through consultations and agreement on the best ways to achieve our common goal.\nRegarding the question from Al Arabiya, I imagine that it is important to deal with all issues with one standard, but rather we are talking about the importance of not taking unilateral measures, not taking escalatory measures that inflame feelings and are outside the scope of international laws and legitimacy.\u00a0 It is always important that we have credibility by dealing with all measures according to a single criterion and in accordance with considerations of principles established in international law, in international covenants, and rules also related to human rights, all of which are interrelated and cannot be in isolation from each other.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, first, does the U.S. see the attack attributed to Israel on a defense factory in Isfahan as harmful or helpful to its broader goal of containing Iran?\u00a0 And second, the Biden administration has repeatedly raised with Egyptian officials the cases of political prisoners, including Alaa Abdel Fattah, Mohamed El-Baqer, and Mohammed Oxygen. Why do you think Egypt hasn\u2019t listened to the U.S. and other governments\u2019 calls to release them?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have much to say with regard to what\u2019s been reported in Iran.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen the reports and I really don\u2019t have anything to add to them at this time.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say more generally, though, that for the United States as well as for many of our partners in the region, it is very important that we continue to deal with and work against, as necessary, the various actions that Iran is engaged in throughout the region \u2013 and beyond the region \u2013 that threaten peace and security and human life.\nWe see that in the region with its support for terrorism.\u00a0 We see that for its support for destabilizing actions in a variety of countries.\u00a0 And now, of course, we\u2019re seeing that in a very different part of the world with its support for Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, with the provision of drones and potentially other military technology.\u00a0 And of course, we see what\u2019s happening on the streets of Iran as people are simply trying to stand up to be able to voice their views and are not being allowed to do so.\u00a0 So this is something that\u2019s part of the conversation that we\u2019re having across the region, including here in Egypt, as well as, of course, in Israel and with other partners.\nWith regard to human rights individual cases, I have raised in the past and again raised today individuals.\u00a0 That\u2019s important.\u00a0 So too, though, are \u2013 is progress on systemic change, and I mentioned the issue of pretrial detentions.\u00a0 I also again want to point to the fact that Egypt has taken important strides in recent years.\u00a0 I mentioned the protection of religious freedom, the empowerment of women, steps now to stand up a national dialogue, to revive the pardons committee, to also move forward with some releases.\u00a0 But the concerns that we have remain, and in the spirit of candor and the spirit of partnership that we have, we express those very clearly.\u00a0 I can\u2019t answer for you why the government does or does not do certain things.\u00a0 Those are its prerogatives.\u00a0 But we share our views, our concerns, and we look to Egypt to continue to take action.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(In Arabic.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, my friend.\n\n",

We look forward to continuing to work closely together in stabilizing this region and promoting our bilateral relationship for the best interests of both Egypt and the United States. We\u2019ve always had similar views of many of the issues related to the region and international issues.

And I will keep it very short because I know we\u2019ll have an opportunity to speak to our colleagues a little bit later, but simply to say it\u2019s very good to be here, very good to be with you. We had good conversations at the Africa Leaders Summit in Washington. I was very much appreciative of the time we were able to spend with the president this morning. And simply, to your point, this is a vital partnership for us. Egypt has been and remains a force for peace and stability and security in a region that certainly needs even more of that. And our work together in so many different areas to advance peace and security is more important than ever, as well as the bilateral relationship itself and the work that we\u2019re doing together. So I look forward to continuing the discussions, and we\u2019ll have a chance to share more with our colleagues in a little while. Thank you.\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It\u2019s really wonderful to be here in this truly historic institution that has brought Egyptians and Americans together for so many years \u2013 continues to do that, continues to build such strong bonds between our people, and especially our young people \u2013 and has been training Egyptians and Americans alike, and it\u2019s something we place great value on.\nAnd yes, this is my first \u2013 literally the first stop in Egypt over the next two or three days in Egypt.\u00a0 I\u2019m then heading to Israel, the West Bank.\u00a0 But I wanted to start here for a couple of reasons.\u00a0 So the main reason is this:\u00a0 As we\u2019re looking at the partnership between the United States and Egypt, the strategic partnership that is of great consequence to the United States, we know that going forward that partnership ultimately is going to be built and sustained and strengthened by the people here today and the people that you represent.\u00a0 Sixty percent of the population in Egypt, of course, is 25 years old or younger.\u00a0 So this is an incredibly dynamic and youthful place.\u00a0 It\u2019s important for us not just to engage government to government, as important as that is, but to engage with every sector of society, and again, especially the rising generation of Egyptians because, quite literally, you will be the ones making this country and you will be the ones who are carrying forward the relationship with the United States.\nSo that was important for me, for us to get a chance really to hear from you, I hope as much as you may hear from me.\u00a0 We want to know what\u2019s on your minds, what you\u2019re thinking about, what you\u2019re concerned about, and how you\u2019re looking at things.\u00a0 Because for me, the most important thing is this:\u00a0 Just because we\u2019ve done something one way for the last 50 years doesn\u2019t mean we need to do it the same way for the next 50 years.\nAnd for those of us in positions of responsibility, it\u2019s vitally important that we\u2019re constantly asking ourselves questions, having \u2013 hearing questions from others, and particularly thinking about new and different ways to do things \u2013 things that you\u2019re all engaged in in so many different ways, whether it\u2019s dealing with climate change \u2013 and I know we\u2019ll want to talk about that, especially coming off of COP; whether it\u2019s finding ways to build genuinely sustainable economic growth that empowers every sector of society, notably women; whether it\u2019s looking at the challenges that we\u2019re facing globally that affect Egyptians and Americans as well, from global health to the challenges of food insecurity.\u00a0 All of these things I know are front and center in your own concern and your own thinking.\u00a0 But we want to know, we want to understand how we can best partner together and also to, again, listen to\u00a0 your ideas, listen to your thoughts.\nOne of the things we established recently was a council of advisors for the ambassador \u2013 a youth council.\u00a0 But what\u2019s so important about it is \u2013 and I know some of you have participated \u2013 what\u2019s really important about it is it\u2019s not just designed to advise our team and our ambassador on so-called youth issues; it\u2019s designed to advise him and the team on every issue of concern to both of our societies, because your voices, your views, your perspectives, your ideas, your insights are by definition going to be different than the ones that we have, that people who are a little bit older like me may have, and we need to be constantly getting that input and getting that advice, getting those ideas.\nSo that\u2019s really why I wanted to start here.\u00a0 I think this is the most vital place for making sure that we are thinking together, we are working together, as Egyptians, as Americans, but also as global citizens, which our two countries have to be given the importance (inaudible).\nSo in a nutshell that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u00a0 You said we have an incredibly diverse group.\nMS AZM:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I know that.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen everyone\u2019s backgrounds and biography, and it\u2019s kind of intimidating.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll do the best we can with that.\u00a0 And I\u2019m really eager to have a conversation.\u00a0 So with that.\nMS AZM:\u00a0\u00a0Actually, this is a statement of Egyptian future.\u00a0 They represent really the Egyptian future that \u2013 of youth, 20 or 30 years ahead of us, and you will lead \u2013 be leading this country at one point.\nAt this point, I would like to ask my fellow colleagues from the press to please leave with Mr. Jacob.\u00a0 I know it\u2019s a frustration.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 This is how it is.\u00a0 Please, if you can leave now so we can resume our discussion.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Katie, for the introduction, and for so much more.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be \u2013 have more to say about that later.\u00a0 I want to welcome my old friend back \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0That\u2019s right.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 to the Institute of Politics.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you remember, Mr. Secretary, when I called you in the winter of 2016 to talk to you about this.\u00a0 I distinctly remember, but I may be representing this, that I said:\u00a0 I think this job will be a stepping stone to secretary of state \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 being a fellow at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0It was a stepping stone to employment after the Obama administration, so I\u2019m grateful for that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0(Laughter.)\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 But before we get to the weightier issues at hand, because of this occasion, what did that fellowship mean to you?\u00a0 What did you take away from it?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first, I took away that this is just an extraordinary community.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had some chance to spend time on university and college campuses over the years, and I think it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve never been more impressed with a group of students that I had the opportunity to spend some time with back in 2017 \u2013 just extraordinary.\u00a0 So it\u2019s good to be with all of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0You guys can applaud for yourselves, it\u2019s okay.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Although I have to say it was also just a little bit intimidating, because I asked myself at that age \u2013 and it\u2019s not \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 not a good \u2013 not a good answer.\u00a0 But also \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0You were playing rock and roll, I think.\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, or trying to, anyway.\u00a0 But what I so admire about what you\u2019ve done, Ax, and the entire team here, is help build a remarkable community, a community that\u2019s giving back in a big way.\u00a0 The numbers I saw said that you\u2019ve managed over the years to place 26-, 2700 people into internships in public service.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what we need, so I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Good, because we\u2019re going to talk to you about some State Department internships after this.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Oh, good.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We now have paid internships for the first time in history, so \u2013 (applause).\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0I call that a cheap applause line.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Actually, a costly applause line.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0This isn\u2019t just the anniversary of the founding of the Institute of Politics, but it\u2019s also the two-year anniversary of the Biden administration.\u00a0 Talk to me about these two years from your perspective as Secretary of State.\u00a0 What has gone well?\u00a0 What are you proudest of?\u00a0 What are the things where you look back and say, gee, I wish we had done that a little bit better, or differently, I should say?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So I think two years in, what it\u2019s safe to say from my perspective, at least, is that we\u2019re in a better place in the world than we were.\u00a0 The first instruction that I got from President Biden on taking the job was:\u00a0 Get out there, re-energize, rejuvenate, re-engage our alliances, our partnerships, our work in international organizations.\u00a0 And the reason he was so determined that we do that is that, if you\u2019re looking around at all of the issues that are actually having an impact on the lives of pretty much everyone in this room \u2013 whether it\u2019s the impact of a global pandemic; whether it\u2019s climate change; whether it\u2019s the effect that all of these new technologies are having on our lives, the stuff that we carry in our pockets every single day; whether it\u2019s drugs, the fentanyl crisis \u2013 we can\u2019t deal effectively with a single one of these issues unless we\u2019re actually finding ways to cooperate and coordinate and work with other countries.\nWe\u2019re \u2013 on climate change we\u2019re 15 percent or so of global emissions.\u00a0 If we do everything right at home, we\u2019ve still got to bring along the other 85 percent.\u00a0 COVID, which we all know all too well, we can do everything right at home \u2013 if there\u2019s another variant circulating out there somewhere, it could still come back and bite us.\u00a0 I could go down the list.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve done that, and in ways big and small, rolling up our sleeves every single day, we\u2019re re-engaged.\nThe other thing he said was this:\u00a0 We have to be out there not only to cooperate and coordinate with other countries \u2013 we have to be out there and at the table.\u00a0 Because when we\u2019re not, when America\u2019s disengaged, one of two things happens.\u00a0 Either someone else tries to take our place, and probably not in a way that advances our own interests and values, or maybe just as bad, no one does, and we know the world doesn\u2019t organize itself, and in the absence of anyone taking on that role you tend to have a vacuum that may be filled by bad things before it\u2019s filled by good things.\nSo the bottom line is this:\u00a0 We are re-engaged, we\u2019re out there, we\u2019re leading again, and we\u2019re doing it with other countries in ways that are building coalitions to tackle these problems.\u00a0 Now, there are a huge number of disruptors out there, and we have to find ways to effectively address them.\u00a0 We have geopolitical disruptors in the form of great power competition that\u2019s emerged again, particularly with Russia and with China in different ways, and we have these transnational disruptors, the ones we\u2019ve just referenced, that are having a big impact on people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 But we\u2019re in a better place to address them.\nLast thing is this.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been really smart about something else.\u00a0 Our strength at home is directly tied to our standing around the world.\u00a0 When we\u2019re making smart investments in ourselves \u2013 as we did with infrastructure; as we did with the CHIPS Act to make sure that we remain the leader in making semiconductors here in the United States; as we did with the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which is the biggest single investment made to deal with climate change in the history of this country \u2013 when we\u2019re making those investments at home, it\u2019s actually having an impact on our standing around the world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got partners, countries coming up to us and saying:\u00a0 We see what you\u2019re doing to make yourselves stronger at home.\u00a0 We want to work with you; we want to partner with you.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I want to ask you about two aspects of that.\u00a0 One is what \u2013 there\u2019s such a gap between the \u2013 your description of the meaning of foreign policy and public perceptions of it.\u00a0 I just saw a list of issues that people thought were most important, and I think \u2013 foreign policy was on it, and I think it was dead last among all the issues.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 You ask people how much money \u2013 when you ask about waste in a focus group, they say, \u201cWell, there\u2019s all that foreign aid.\u201d\u00a0 Well, how much do you think it is?\u00a0 \u201cTwenty-five percent of the budget.\u201d\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s less than one.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 So how do you engage \u2013 I mean, you just made the case, but doesn\u2019t there need to be sort of an active effort to engage the American people?\u00a0 Because we\u2019re living in an age in which people are feeling very much inward \u2013 so how do you sell foreign policy in an environment like this, and isn\u2019t that important?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to do a better job in connecting the dots.\u00a0 One of the reasons that I wanted to be here today was to do that.\u00a0 One of the reasons that the President asked me to speak to the Conference of Mayors in Washington just a couple of days ago was to do that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 One example, among others.\u00a0 The number one killer of Americans between the age of 18 and 49: fentanyl.\u00a0 Last year we lost more than 100,000 Americans to drug overdoses; 70 percent of those were from synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\u00a0 Well, there\u2019s a lot that we can do and we are doing to try to reduce demand here.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot that we are doing and can do to try to disrupt the criminal organizations that are responsible for that.\nBut here\u2019s the way it works.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got chemicals that are produced halfway around the world, mostly in China right now \u2013 perfectly legal.\u00a0 They are then sent somewhere else, maybe to Mexico.\u00a0 They\u2019re diverted to a criminal organization.\u00a0 It then uses those chemicals to make a synthetic opioid.\u00a0 You get pill presses that put them together.\u00a0 They get sent over the border one way or another.\u00a0 And you can make hundreds of thousands of pills in a room the size of this stage.\u00a0 Last year in the United States we seized \u2013 we seized \u2013 because keep in mind what we seize does not reflect what\u2019s out there; we don\u2019t even know exactly what\u2019s out there \u2013 we seized enough fentanyl in this country to kill every single American.\nSo how do you connect the dots?\u00a0 Well, one of the things that we\u2019re doing is trying to organize other countries to make sure that at least when perfectly legal chemicals are being shipped, people know who they\u2019re shipping them to; that we\u2019re sharing information to make sure that if front companies get set up, they\u2019re identified; that things are labeled properly; that you know your customer.\u00a0 And that\u2019s one of the ways our foreign policy \u2013 because it requires working with China, it requires working with India, it requires working with Mexico, and more and more countries that are being affected \u2013 that\u2019s just one example of how what we\u2019re doing around the world has a direct impact on people \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Let me come at this from a different perspective, which is the perspective of the world.\u00a0 I mean, one thing that\u2019s clear when you talk to leaders from around the world or diplomats from around the world, as you do on a daily basis, is how much the American example and American actions mean to particularly other democracies.\u00a0 And the thing you hear is:\u00a0 Yeah, we trust Biden and we think things have \u2013 we appreciate the agreement and the outreach and so on, but how do we know that that\u2019s going to be the case two years from now, or even six years from now?\u00a0 And they watch what happened on January 6th.\u00a0 They watched \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 They watch other sort of elements of our democracy that are less attractive and less reassuring.\u00a0 And they say:\u00a0 Can we count on the country?\u00a0 I mean, you must hear that all the time.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0You get some of that.\u00a0 Look, the President said it himself \u2013 I think pretty early on he was talking to one of his counterparts who said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad America\u2019s back,\u201d and then he said, \u201cbut for how long?\u201d\u00a0 So sure, you hear that, and I can say two things.\u00a0 First, we have to deal with the here and now, what we can do in this moment, in the time that we have.\u00a0 And my premise is this:\u00a0 If we demonstrate by the policies we pursue and the way we pursue them that we\u2019re actually delivering results, that we\u2019re actually getting things done, that we\u2019re actually making life a little bit safer, a little bit more secure, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more healthy for our fellow citizens, then hopefully they\u2019ll continue to support that approach.\u00a0 And I say the same things to colleagues around the world who are looking at how they\u2019re going to work with us.\nSecond, there\u2019s something incredibly powerful about our own recent history, which I\u2019ve shared with others in conversation.\u00a0 One of the things that we still do as a country and that sets us apart is when we have problems here at home, we still deal with them openly, transparently.\u00a0 We don\u2019t try to sweep them under the rug, pretend they don\u2019t exist no matter how painful it is, no matter how ugly it is.\u00a0 And that\u2019s actually a very powerful example, because when we\u2019re asking other countries to do the same thing we can actually say:\u00a0 We\u2019re doing it.\u00a0 You need, we hope, to confront your own problems; we\u2019re actually demonstrating that you can do that and do it in an open and transparent way.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 You talked about alliances.\u00a0 Obviously the place where it has been most dramatically reflected is in Ukraine, a situation that you couldn\u2019t have foreseen when you became Secretary of State.\u00a0 The question comes up \u2013 and the failure just in the last 24 hours to come to an agreement on whether tanks, the German tanks, can be shared with the Ukrainians \u2013 the question comes up:\u00a0 How much time do you have there before the coalition frays?\u00a0 Putin is obviously playing a waiting game, and the Russians have great tolerance for suffering and he seems intent to try and wait this out.\u00a0 What are you telling the Ukrainians and what is your sense of where this goes and how quickly it has to move before this thing kind of frays?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 First I\u2019d say that from almost day one, we\u2019ve seen a lot of premature reports of the demise of the coalition.\u00a0 And on the contrary, not only has it held together, it\u2019s grown consistently stronger.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll come to the specific issue you raised.\u00a0 But time and again we\u2019ve seen dozens of countries come together to try to make sure that Ukraine is getting what it needs when it needs it to defend itself, to push back against the Russian aggression, to take back the land that was seized, the humanitarian support, the economic support.\u00a0 We just did another so-called drawdown of military equipment for Ukraine, more than $2.5 billion.\u00a0 We\u2019re up to almost $30 billion in military support, about $60 billion in total support.\u00a0 The Europeans have done much the same.\nBut what I\u2019m finding is this:\u00a0 The center is very much holding, in two ways.\u00a0 Just before Christmas I had a chance to speak to the entire Senate \u2013 and something that your successor, Senator Heitkamp, knows so well \u2013 and I found talking to Republicans and Democrats alike in both the Senate and then the House that the center is still very, very much there.\u00a0 Similarly, if you go around the European countries \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 The House, by the way, a little less so.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 No, but even so.\u00a0 I had a chance to spend some time with the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mike McCaul \u2013 very strong supporter of the efforts in Ukraine.\u00a0 So I think the center is very much holding, and in Europe as well.\nNow, on the weapons, let me say this:\u00a0 Every step along the way, starting from before the Russian aggression, we tried to make sure the Ukrainians had in their hands what they needed, what they could use to effectively push back against any Russian aggression.\u00a0 Before the war started, we saw the storm clouds.\u00a0 We tried to warn the world.\u00a0 We tried to prevent it.\u00a0 But even as we were doing that, we tried to make sure the Ukrainians were prepared.\u00a0 We did drawdowns of our equipment \u2013 Stingers and Javelins \u2013 going back to Labor Day a year ago and then again before Christmas.\u00a0 So they had in their hands what they needed when the Russians went to Kyiv, and they were able to repel it.\nAll along the way, we\u2019ve tried to make sure that as the war moved, as the Russians shifted what they were doing and where they were doing it, the Ukrainians had what they needed.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve seen a succession of different weapons systems go to the Ukrainians.\u00a0 There are \u2013 the discussions that we have with allies and partners, and including ourselves, is not only what weapons do they need but they need to be trained on them, so we\u2019ve got to do that; they need to be able to maintain them; and they\u2019ve got to be able to use them effectively.\u00a0 All of that goes into these decisions.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So it\u2019s an ongoing process.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 But everybody seems to agree \u2013 all the military, including our own, leaders seem to agree that they need tanks now.\u00a0 The British just sent them.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t get them out of this meeting yesterday.\u00a0 How does this get resolved?\u00a0 Because this seems to be essential to the spring fighting that everybody predicts is going to happen.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We just sent Ukraine a large number of Bradley Fighting Vehicles, which are basically light tanks.\u00a0 The French have done some \u2013 done the same.\u00a0 The British have actually sent them combat tanks.\u00a0 Others are looking to do that.\u00a0 This is a \u2013 it\u2019s an ongoing process that we\u2019ll continue to work.\u00a0 But again, we have to make sure that for each system we send \u2013 and these are sovereign decisions for each country to make \u2013 different countries have contributed different things at different times, but all told what it adds up to is a Ukrainian fighting force that first of all starts with the courage and resilience of the fighting force and Ukrainian people, but because of what we\u2019ve been able to provide them has done as well as it\u2019s done.\nAnd on the Russians, let me just say this to the first part of your question:\u00a0 This is not a static thing.\u00a0 You say Putin is going to try to wait them out.\u00a0 He\u2019s not waiting them out in a situation where every single day he\u2019s not doing extraordinary damage that he\u2019s inflicting on his own people and his own military.\u00a0 That military has suffered horrific losses and continues to do so every single day.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the sanctions, the export controls that we\u2019ve imposed on Russia are dramatically, dramatically undercutting its ability over time not only to continue the war, but to advance Russia\u2019s economy, to allow it to pursue energy extraction.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to have an increasingly profound and heavy effect on Russia going forward.\nI wish that wasn\u2019t the case.\u00a0 This is a tragedy brought about by Putin.\u00a0 The question that one would really love to ask the Russians, if we could speak more directly and clearly to them, is:\u00a0 How is what Putin is doing in Ukraine \u2013 how has that changed your life for the better?\u00a0 How has it done a single thing that makes you better off?\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 He \u2013 in addition to the price that Russia is paying, he\u2019s inflicting a tremendous amount of heartache and damage on Ukraine.\u00a0 And it seems like with each assault and each attack, from a political standpoint, it makes it harder for President Zelenskyy to reach any sort of negotiated settlement other than the exit of Russia from the country.\u00a0 And one also wonders what Russian-held ground would be like given the hostility that people feel for them.\u00a0 But where do you think this ends?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, fundamentally this has to be a decision for Ukraine to make.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah, I knew you would say that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 But I mean, I\u2019m just \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I probably should kick myself for asking.\u00a0 But I mean, General Milley said he thought the fighting would go \u2013 would go on, that it ultimately would be a negotiation \u2013 it would have to be, that every war ends with a negotiation.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Right.\n\nAXELROD:\u00a0But it seems like it gets harder and harder, given how much destruction is being inflicted on the Ukrainians.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, it does, and of course Zelenskyy has to be responsive to public opinion.\u00a0 He is a democratically elected president; he has to represent the Ukrainian people.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0What\u2019s your sense of him, by the way?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Oh, he\u2019s extraordinary.\u00a0 I got to know him a bit before the Russian aggression.\u00a0 I was over in Ukraine several times before the Russians went in, spent time with him.\u00a0 In fact, when we had the intelligence that we shared with the world about what Russia was planning, one of my responsibilities at the President\u2019s request was to go see President Zelenskyy and share with him what we had, basically to tell him, \u201cWe think your country\u2019s going to be attacked,\u201d which was a pretty sobering moment.\u00a0 But \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Publicly he was he was pushing back on that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, there\u2019s a reason for that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0He didn\u2019t want people to flee.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0He didn\u2019t want people to flee, he didn\u2019t want investment to flee, because he was afraid that the more the possibility of conflict was talked up, the more his economy would be talked down.\u00a0 I understand that.\u00a0 But meanwhile, he was making the preparations that were necessary, and you saw that in what the Ukrainians were able to do, with our assistance, in repelling the attack against Kyiv.\u00a0 And by the way, Putin has already lost in terms of what he was trying to accomplish.\u00a0 What he was trying to accomplish was to erase Ukraine\u2019s identity.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Topple him and \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And \u2013 topple him, erase Ukraine as an independent country, subsume it into Russia.\u00a0 That has failed; that can\u2019t succeed.\u00a0 Now, where this settles is a profound question, and what damage is done in between now and then, we don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I was at \u2013 just earlier today in Chicago, I was in \u2013 at Ukraine Village and went to the modern art museum.\u00a0 They have an exhibit now on \u2013 of drawings, paintings by the children of war, by young Ukrainian children.\u00a0 And it shows their experience of the war through these drawings and paintings, and these are kids from \u2013 I don\u2019t know, age 2, 3 up to 10, 11, 12, teenagers.\nAnd this gets to another really important point.\u00a0 You walk in, you look at this, and I think the first reaction you have, if you have children, is:\u00a0 These could be my kids.\u00a0 What if this was my kid?\nAnd what Putin is trying to do with the daily assault is to anesthetize all of us, to normalize this, for people to basically say, \u201cOkay, this is happening,\u201d and we just accept it as somehow normal, acceptable.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we really have to avoid.\u00a0 We have to make sure that we collectively continue to make clear that no, this is not normal, this is not acceptable.\u00a0 And if we allow this to go forward with impunity in Ukraine, then we open a Pandora\u2019s box where would-be aggressors around the world will say:\u00a0 Hmm, I can get away with it, I can get go ahead, seize another country\u2019s territory by force, erase its borders, kill its people destroy its infrastructure, and nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 That\u2019s why this is important and is bigger than Ukraine itself.\u00a0 It goes beyond that, and it\u2019s why we have to stick with it.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0You were asked recently about what the greatest global challenge was, and it wasn\u2019t from Russia, it was from China.\u00a0 You\u2019re headed there in a few weeks.\u00a0 The President saw President Xi in Bali.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s right.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Talk about China, where \u2013 the China that you\u2019re going to visit right now, not necessarily the same China from a year ago before the COVID debacle, before their economy was ground to a halt.\u00a0 What are you hoping to accomplish there?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So the President and President Xi had a very good, constructive, long conversation in Bali on the margins of this G20 meeting toward the end of last year, and I think the most important thing in the immediate for us is this:\u00a0 This is the most consequential and complex relationship of any that we have in the world.\u00a0 And by the way, the same is true \u2013 I think many other countries could say the same about the relationship with China.\u00a0 We\u2019re in a competition.\u00a0 We have, I think, a moment in time, which we can also talk about, where we\u2019re no longer in the post-Cold War era.\u00a0 There\u2019s a competition on to shape what comes next.\nChina is a leading competitor, and in many ways, the vision that they have for what the world should be and where it should go is not the same as the one we have.\u00a0 But competition is one thing, conflict is another, and it\u2019s strongly in our interest to make sure that even as we compete very, very vigorously, we avoid competition veering into conflict.\u00a0 One of the ways you do that is making sure that you actually have good lines of communication, that you\u2019re talking, that you\u2019re engaging, that you\u2019re putting some guardrails on the relationship, that you\u2019re putting a floor underneath it.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the President and President Xi were doing in Bali.\u00a0 That\u2019s the conversation they asked me to continue.\nSo that\u2019s a big part of what we\u2019re going to try to do.\u00a0 The other thing is this.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Well, that question can be very much shaped by issues like Taiwan \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s right.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 and China\u2019s posture toward Taiwan.\u00a0 We saw what happened in Hong Kong.\u00a0 Do you think that you have a deeper understanding of their intentions, and do they have a deeper understanding of what the U.S.\u2019s reaction would be to that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think \u2013 I think they do, especially from the last conversation between the presidents.\u00a0 And again, that\u2019s something that I think it\u2019s important to continue to pursue.\nLook, two things.\u00a0 On Taiwan, what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years is, I think, China make a decision that it was no longer comfortable with the status quo, a status quo that had prevailed for decades, that had actually been successful in terms of the relationship between our countries in managing what is a difficult situation.\u00a0 But they\u2019d made a decision that that status quo was no longer acceptable, and we\u2019ve seen them over the last few years \u2013 not the last few months, the last few years \u2013 ratchet up the pressure on Taiwan \u2013 military pressure, economic pressure, trying to cut off its ties to countries around the world, to international organizations.\u00a0 And from our perspective, that status quo has worked and it\u2019s vital to what\u2019s important to us, which is maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\nWhat we\u2019ve said to China is this.\u00a0 They say this is a sovereign issue for us; our response is this is an interest to the United States and to countries around the world.\u00a0 Because if peace and stability is disrupted across the strait, if something happens as a result of the actions you take, 50 percent of every container ship that is moving around the world every day goes through the Taiwan Strait; 70 percent or more of the computer chips manufactured in the world at the higher ends are manufactured on Taiwan.\u00a0 If that gets disrupted, the entire world economy will suffer.\u00a0 Every country in the world has an interest in making sure that peace and stability remains in the strait and that differences are resolved peacefully, not through pressure, not through coercion, and certainly not through the use of force.\u00a0 So it\u2019s very important that they understand that even as we listen to their concerns.\nOn COVID, it\u2019s also profoundly in our interest that China succeed in dealing with COVID.\u00a0 First, we do not want to see people suffering anywhere from the disease.\u00a0 Second, for its own \u2013 for the sake of its own economy, and as a result, for the sake of economies around the world, it\u2019s important that they be able to recover and recover successfully.\u00a0 And third, if COVID is out of control anywhere, as I said earlier, you may get new variants.\u00a0 Those variants are going to travel around the world.\u00a0 They may come back here and we may find ourselves in trouble again.\u00a0 So it\u2019s both the right thing on a human, moral level and the smart thing to want to make sure that they succeed.\u00a0 We can\u2019t make those decisions for them.\u00a0 I hope that they do.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 And you feel that the temperature has been lowered to some degree?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I think so, because again, when you\u2019re talking and engaging, it tends to have that effect.\u00a0 There\u2019s something else that\u2019s going on.\u00a0 One of the things that I\u2019m hearing around the world \u2013 and I think the Chinese are hearing the same thing \u2013 is there\u2019s a demand signal.\u00a0 The rest of the world expects us to manage this relationship responsibly.\u00a0 They know that the way we manage it\u2019s actually going to affect them too.\u00a0 They know that if we\u2019re not finding ways and areas where we can, where it\u2019s in our interest to cooperate, they will lose out on some of the benefits.\u00a0 We need, for example, to see China play a leadership role in dealing with climate change.\u00a0 We need to see them play a leadership role in dealing with global health, along with us and other countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s in our interest to do so, but also that\u2019s what other countries are saying to us.\u00a0 So we\u2019re trying to be responsive to that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see if Beijing can do the same thing.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 You mentioned the world in which we live today.\u00a0 I think about the young Tony Blinken \u2013 younger Tony Blinken \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 who walked into the White House National Security Council as a junior aide years ago in the Clinton administration, and that was right after the Berlin Wall had fallen, the Soviet Union had collapsed, the U.S. was sort of a colossus astride the world \u2013 a unipower, as it were; superpower \u2013 and trade and globalization were seen as ways to lift economies around the world, and also as tools of diplomacy.\u00a0 We\u2019re \u2013 it seems like we\u2019re in a much different place.\u00a0 There was the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the administration in which you were the deputy secretary of state was going to be a way of creating an alliance of nations as a hedge against Chinese economic aggression, and that failed, and you don\u2019t hear much about trade anymore.\u00a0 Globalization \u2013 we just had this Davos, the annual thing, Davos, which feels very much now like sort of Disneyland for the elites.\u00a0 It\u2019s sort of like still fun to go but it\u2019s a little dated.\nSo talk about how the world has changed and what that means for the U.S.\u00a0 What is the challenge in this new world that we find?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So I guess I\u2019d say two things.\u00a0 First, let\u2019s not be too hard on ourselves in terms of that moment in time and what we thought about it, because we got a lot of the big things right even as we got a lot of small things wrong.\u00a0 We managed to get through the Cold War without getting another world war.\u00a0 We managed to see the world lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty during that period.\u00a0 All of that was good.\u00a0 And if you actually did a freeze frame before COVID hit, in the aggregate, even \u2013 so even as recently as three years ago, in the aggregate, I think it\u2019s fair to say the world was actually safer, more prosperous, healthier than it had been probably at any time in human history.\u00a0 This is kind of the Steven Pinker view of the world, but I think a lot of that is borne out.\nBut what we collectively, I think, missed were a few things.\u00a0 One is we missed that even as inequities between nations were actually shrinking, they were growing within them, and that\u2019s had profound effects.\u00a0 And we see that play out here.\u00a0 We see that play out around the world.\u00a0 I think we had a faith that economic integration was going to bring other countries into much more positive relations with every other country.\u00a0 That hasn\u2019t borne itself out.\u00a0 We thought that economic liberalization would lead to political liberalization.\u00a0 That \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Well, I mean, I think these things are connected, right, because that \u2013 the great economic polarization that we saw, winners and losers as a result of trade, as a result of globalization, created a backlash.\u00a0 And we see it in populist movements around the world, including the U.S.\u00a0 We saw it in Brexit.\u00a0 We saw it \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it in a lot of different places.\nWhat do we do about that?\u00a0 What do we do to give people a sense that they actually have a stake in the economic systems of our countries and that it\u2019s not just the global elite that are benefiting from them?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, in the first instance, I come back to what I started with a few minutes ago, which is to say it starts at home and it starts with making smart investments in ourselves, investments that are actually going to deliver better results and better lives and livelihoods for our own people.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been making those investments and I think they\u2019re going to start to pay out in the next few years.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah, it also starts with a recognition that there were people and regions \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Oh, absolutely.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 \u2014 that were losers in this deal.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 Which is one of the reasons, for example, we want to make sure we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the incredibly positive power for many years of the internet, but of course if it\u2019s not widely shared that positive power is not going to be there for everyone.\u00a0 So rural connectivity has been a huge piece of this.\u00a0 And of course we also know the downsides of connectivity for everyone that we also have to grapple with.\u00a0 I guess \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 There is enough connectivity that it has helped fuel some of these populist movements.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 So we have \u2013 that\u2019s a whole other subject.\u00a0 But I think you\u2019re exactly right.\u00a0 There has to be and I think there has been an awakening to the fact that in different ways too many people have been left out, left behind.\u00a0 But also, look, I think there are a lot of profound things that have happened.\nThis is \u2013 the President talks about this as an inflection point in world history that comes along every six or seven generations \u2013 not every decade but six or seven generations.\u00a0 And so much has been said and written about this, but one of the things I feel profoundly \u2013 you asked me what\u2019s changed since I was first in government \u2013 when I started in government in the early 1990s the information environment was this:\u00a0 You, if you were working at the White House or anywhere else for that matter, at 6:30 at night you turned off your \u2013 turned on your TV if you had one in your office and you watched the network news, one of three channels.\u00a0 When you woke up in the morning, you opened your front door and you picked up\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nNow, of course, we\u2019re on an intravenous feed of information every single day, every single millisecond of the day.\u00a0 And that has created a number of things, including for those of us who are in government this incredible pressure, which you know so well from being at the heart of things at the White House, this incredible pressure to be reactive almost immediately to everything that\u2019s going on.\u00a0 Having the discipline to not to do that, to actually sit back, step back, think through what you\u2019re doing \u2013 that\u2019s more difficult than it\u2019s ever been, but it\u2019s also more imperative.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I should say parenthetically here I\u2019m not going to ask you about the whole documents thing because I know you won\u2019t answer, so I just wanted to put a pin in there.\nA lot of the young people here care deeply about the issue of human rights.\u00a0 And I know you and I know your family history and I know how passionate you are about human rights, and yet there is always this tension between wanting to lead on human rights and the strategic imperatives of the country.\u00a0 So we think of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\u00a0 You just met with the foreign minister from T\u00fcrkiye, who wants F-16 fighters, something that the administration supports and some members of Congress don\u2019t on human rights grounds.\u00a0 How do you navigate that?\u00a0 How do you say we are the guarantors of human rights at the same time that \u2013 but there are times when we can\u2019t?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 President Biden wanted to make sure that one of the things we did was to put human rights back at the heart of our foreign policy, but it\u2019s not and can\u2019t be the totality of our foreign policy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see a zero-sum choice between values on the one hand and interests on the other.\u00a0 Human rights are a profound value for us, but they\u2019re also a strong interest because we know that countries that actually respect the human rights of their citizens in a multiplicity of ways are going to be much better actors on the global stage with us, for us, and for the things that we care about.\nSo one of the things that we have to do in every relationship that we have is figure out the right balance of interests at any given time.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to advance all of them.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Is that painful?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s painful, but sometimes it works in interesting ways that may not be so evident.\u00a0 You mentioned Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Well, we spent a lot of time trying to recalibrate that relationship to make sure that it\u2019s working better than it has been to actually address our interests.\u00a0 One of those interests is human rights.\u00a0 One of the benefits of what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years is we\u2019ve gotten the Saudis engaged in a much more productive way and positive way in trying to end the war in Yemen.\u00a0 This is, when we took office, arguably was the worst humanitarian situation in the world, and the abuse of human rights of the people of Yemen was probably near the top of the list.\nAs a result of the kind of engagement that we pursued \u2013 okay, the conflict is certainly not over, but it\u2019s in a much better place than it\u2019s been.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a ceasefire that\u2019s now endured for many, many months.\u00a0 People are not being killed the way they were before.\u00a0 Rights are in a better place than they were.\nSo you have to think about these things, I think, in ways that are you getting practical results.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 It can be unsatisfying.\u00a0 You know there are a lot of \u2013 there are some journalists here who \u2013 and others who remember the Jamal Khashoggi massacre.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s \u2013 it was jarring to see the President fist bump the guy who apparently was the mastermind of that murder.\u00a0 But you\u2019re saying that\u2019s \u2013 this is \u2013 this is what I\u2019m trying to get at \u2013 I\u2019m not being judgmental about that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 No, no, these are \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I\u2019m saying, these are hard decisions.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to meet the Chinese.\u00a0 They have essentially a gulag where the Uyghurs \u2013 a million Uyghurs are being \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We \u2013 no, you\u2019re right.\u00a0 These \u2013 there are hard decisions; there are challenging balances to try to get right.\u00a0 But again, in the case of Saudi Arabia, I think there \u2013 I think it\u2019s fair to say that there are Yemenis who would probably not be alive today had we not found a way to engage and bring the Saudis along in a way that\u2019s at least produced, for now, a ceasefire.\nSimilarly, as we\u2019re looking at these challenges we have with China, the profound abuses being committed against people in Xinjiang, we\u2019ve stood up, we\u2019ve spoken out, we\u2019ve encouraged and gotten other countries to do the same thing, and we put a spotlight on it.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve taken concrete actions in terms of sanctions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken concrete actions in terms of, in many places, trying to make sure, for example, that we\u2019re not importing products that are produced through slave labor.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 But it\u2019s a balancing act.\u00a0 You can\u2019t \u2013 I realize you\u2019re a diplomat, so you\u2019re \u2013 there are things you can say and things that you can\u2019t say.\u00a0 But I must say it must be frustrating at times that you have to make these balancing judgments, because I know your passion for \u2013 for people.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 If there weren\u2019t frustrations on a daily basis, we\u2019d be out of a job.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 We all \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It would be great to be able to go out of business because the world is perfect, everything\u2019s going well.\u00a0 But it\u2019s the nature of the job.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 One other thing I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask you about \u2013 because I asked you at the beginning what went well, what could have done better.\u00a0 You\u2019re about \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re about to go through some bracing hearings about the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0 And let\u2019s stipulate that \u2013 I think a lot of Americans would say yeah, it is a good thing that we are not there anymore \u2013 concern about what\u2019s happened to human rights there \u2013 but the withdrawal remains a question.\u00a0 And as always in Washington, there\u2019s a lot of fingers pointing in different directions, some of them at the State Department.\u00a0 Do you look back at that and say \u2013 and ask the sort of after-action, \u201cWhat should we have done differently?\u201d\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 You always look back at what you\u2019ve done and try to ask that question.\u00a0 And one of the things that we did is we\u2019ve actually \u2013 we\u2019re taking a hard look at that.\u00a0 And we commissioned a study by one of our leading retired diplomats to do just that, and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be, I\u2019m sure, talking about in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0 We want to make sure that in any instance, especially one as challenging, as fraught as that, that we learn whatever lessons are to be learned and that we apply them going forward, and we\u2019ve already started to do that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 But you acknowledge it was fraught?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So I\u2019d say a few things.\u00a0 First, to your point, President Biden ended the longest war in American history, and the result of that is that there will not be future generations of Americans going off to fight and die in Afghanistan.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s a good thing, and I think that\u2019s something that most Americans support.\nSecond, many of the predictions \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 And I was there in 2009; he\u2019s very consistent in his view.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We both heard it together then.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Second, many of the predictions, at least until now, of some of the terrible things that might result have not borne out.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not seen an upsurge in terrorism coming out of Afghanistan \u2013 in fact, we\u2019ve demonstrated that to the extent that terrorists and there and being harbored there, we\u2019re able to actually get at them, as we were able to do with Zawahiri.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t seen to date a mass refugee exodus \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Been hard for women and girls there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 But \u2013 that\u2019s what I was coming to.\u00a0 We have also seen the Taliban being either unable or unwilling to make good on things it\u2019s said it would do and that the international community, not just the United States, said we expected of them, starting with making sure that they were actually protecting the rights of all Afghans, including women and girls.\u00a0 That has been a dramatic step backwards, and we\u2019re working to deal with that as best we can now.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to go to questions.\u00a0 I do want to ask you this.\u00a0 There are a lot of people here who are considering what they want to do with their lives.\u00a0 And there was a period of time in the last decade when joining the Foreign Service became less attractive.\u00a0 And talk \u2013 I want to give you a couple of minutes to make a sales pitch here for why people should consider that work, that form of service.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So I\u2019ve had an incredible opportunity in my own life to do a bunch of different things.\u00a0 I was a journalist for a while.\u00a0 I was a lawyer for a while, for one year, 10 months, two weeks, three days, and five hours.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 That good, huh?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, that good.\u00a0 But for those of you who intend to go into the law, it\u2019s great.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I dabbled in movies, et cetera.\u00a0 And then, after a long, circuitous journey, I wound up in government, working for President Clinton.\u00a0 And for the past 30 years, that\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019ve done, with a couple of periods of time out of government because elections happen and things change.\nAnd what I can tell you is this: There are so many different ways to find fulfillment, to find happiness, to find a sense of purpose in life \u2013 in the private sector, in NGOs, in academia, you name it.\u00a0 For me, at least, having had these different experiences, there is something unique about serving in government, and that something unique is right there behind us, and it\u2019s behind me every single day, either figuratively or literally.\u00a0 And it may sound corny, but for me at least, knowing that I\u2019m there with the American flag behind me every day is something that I haven\u2019t really found in any other pursuit that I\u2019ve engaged in.\nSo I really commend it to folks to find a way, and it doesn\u2019t have to be in Washington in the federal government.\u00a0 I think public service in some fashion, serving your community, if not serving your country \u2013 there\u2019s something about that that just is unique in the fulfillment that you get from it, even with the frustrations that come along with it.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We just had the largest entering class at the State Department that we\u2019ve had in more than a decade, so I am incredibly proud of that \u2013 (applause).\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And \u2013 but here\u2019s the thing.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the thing:\u00a0 It needs constant renewal.\u00a0 One of my missions is to make sure, to the extent I can have anything to say about it, is that we continue to attract the most talented, most dedicated people that we possibly can.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I want to see happen.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the reasons, David, that we\u2019re spending time not only in dealing with all of these external problems, but also trying to make our own institution as strong as it can be and an attractive place to work.\nWe\u2019re in a competition for talent.\u00a0 We know that.\u00a0 So we have to make sure that our department is a place that people want to work.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in a number of ways that probably time doesn\u2019t allow me to get into.\u00a0 But as it happens, our diplomat in residence, Susan Falatko, is right here today.\u00a0 I think she may even be at a table outside.\u00a0 If you\u2019d like some information about the State Department, we welcome you stopping by and grabbing it or looking at the website.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I hope you do.\u00a0 I hope you do.\nWe\u2019ve got to take some questions.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have to, but we want to.\u00a0 I shouldn\u2019t say it like that.\u00a0 And as usual, I\u2019ve snarfed up more than my share of time.\u00a0 Where is the staff member \u2013 where are staff members with the microphones?\u00a0 All right, you choose somebody.\u00a0 Choose somebody.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to do it and make everybody else mad.\u00a0 Just pick somebody who wants to ask a question \u2013 a student, though, would be preferable.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Hi, can everybody hear me?\u00a0 I\u2019m in the middle last row, David, if you can\u2019t see me.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Okay.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I really enjoyed listening to Secretary Blinken and David talk about the role of the U.S. on the global stage. \u00a0My name is Andre.\u00a0 I\u2019m a first year in the college and I\u2019m from Hong Kong, so I\u2019m particularly concerned with where Hong Kong stands on the table of priorities currently at the State Department.\nAnd I understand that there are many international constraints in its balancing act, but domestically the U.S. can do much more boldly to protect Hong Kongers.\u00a0 In 2021, President Biden issued a deferred enforced departure order for Hong Kongers in the U.S.\u00a0 Currently that\u2019s expiring in a little less than three weeks.\u00a0 That means Hong Kongers living in the U.S. still live in uncertainty whether they have to go back to Hong Kong, to a city where it\u2019s not their home anymore, and join the ranks of more than 1,200 political prisoners.\nSo my concern is:\u00a0 Why is the administration not more proactive on looking for longer-term solutions for Hong Kongers despite the presence of many bipartisan efforts in the past, especially in Congress, to give Hong Kongers more options?\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah, yeah \u2013 I don\u2019t want to cut you off, because it\u2019s such a profound question, but I want to give you a chance to answer maybe yet another question as well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good, yeah.\u00a0 First of all, thank you for sharing that.\u00a0 And let me first of all assure you that we are working on this and we are engaged with Congress on this.\nSecond, I think the experience of Hong Kong in recent years has been one of the most sobering reality makers for people around the world that we\u2019ve seen, and what has happened in terms of the reversal of Hong Kong\u2019s democracy through the actions that the \u2013 that Beijing has taken.\u00a0 What has happened in terms of in effect gutting the notion of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d has had I think a profound effect not only for people in Hong Kong but beyond, and I think one of the reasons that you\u2019re seeing people focused on Taiwan so much right now is precisely because of the experience that Hong Kong has gone through over the last few years.\nWe continue to look for ways to see what we and others can do to make a difference, both in making sure that we\u2019re helping and supporting those who are in very difficult circumstances as a result of the change in Hong Kong.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking very hard at the effect this is having on Hong Kong itself, and there are lots of things that are happening, competing pressures that are changing the entire nature of Hong Kong, which is deeply, deeply, deeply disturbing.\u00a0 But I want to assure you that in terms of the needs of people who are in jeopardy as a result of what\u2019s happened, this is something that we\u2019re very actively focused on.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 It seems like this is one of those frustrating issues where imperatives collide.\nOne more question.\u00a0 Yeah, don\u2019t \u2013 address yourself to the people with the \u2013 who have all the power with the microphones.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Hi, my names is James and I\u2019m a second year in the college, and what I want to ask about is the way in which that you answered the question, saying that the Biden administration and its foreign policy is leading both with having strategic interests as well as human rights as the forefront.\u00a0 And I was \u2013 really wanted to direct the question toward the United States\u2019 relationship with Israel, and especially in these \u2013 this past few weeks, Prime Minister Netanyahu not adhering to the rule of law, and especially this week having a deadline really to fire the minister that was supposed to be expelled by the supreme court.\nSo I was wondering, in which \u2013 how will the United States\u2019 relationship with Israel change, especially noting that they are a strategic partner in the Middle East \u2013 but also, democracy is very important in the region; and having a partner that adheres to democracy \u2013 in which ways will the Biden administration further that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So thank you.\u00a0 A lot to be said about this.\u00a0 In the interest of time, let me just say this.\u00a0 First, we have a relationship with Israel that has been built over many, many decades, through many different administrations in both the United States and in Israel.\u00a0 There are certain things that are foundational, including a commitment to Israel\u2019s security, and that is not going to change.\u00a0 One of the benefits of a relationship as close as the one that we have is that we can speak very directly and very clearly to each other in private as well as in public when we do have differences, including differences in approach in things that are happening inside of Israel, just as we\u2019ve heard Israelis make very clear their differences about some of the policies that we\u2019ve pursued over the years.\u00a0 And that also is not going to change.\nSo one of the things that I\u2019ve said is we\u2019re very much focused, not on the particular personalities of any one Israeli government but on the policies that that government pursues, and we\u2019re very much engaged with them now.\u00a0 But we have to also give a chance for things to play out.\u00a0 Some of the things that you mentioned are very recent developments that have not yet run their course, so let\u2019s see how things actually evolve.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Let me just ask one follow-up to that, which was a good question.\u00a0 Given the coalition that Prime Minister Netanyahu has had to put together, the most right wing coalition in the history of the country, what has been \u2013 what have you communicated \u2013 I guess this is stupid question because you won\u2019t answer, but have you \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 what has been communicated about red lines?\u00a0 And are their red lines in terms of settlements, in terms of human rights, in terms of issues of concern, democratic rights within the State of Israel?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0David, I\u2019m tempted to say, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Yes \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 we\u2019ve known each other a long time.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0But in fact, a couple of months ago I had an opportunity to speak to the relationship and the various issues in the relationship.\u00a0 I got a chance to talk to folks at J\u00a0Street in Washington.\u00a0 And besides making clear our enduring commitment to Israel\u2019s security and laying out how we\u2019re doing that, I also made clear that we continue to believe deeply in and are committed to two states, and to make sure, to the best of our ability, that we\u2019re pursuing policies that allow Israelis and Palestinians alike to know equal measures of democracy, dignity, opportunity.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been very clear in the past; we\u2019ll remain very clear in the future about our views on settlements and their expansion, on demolitions, and on violence, including from the settler community, directed at Palestinians or Israeli Arabs \u2013 just as we were very clear, of course, about incitement, certainly about terrorism, et cetera.\nSo I think there\u2019s a very clear consistency in our policy that we\u2019ve laid out before the new government came in, and that we\u2019ll continue to engage on in the weeks and months ahead.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 I guess the thing that we have to \u2013 that we\u2019ll discover is how much that clarity of message is received.\u00a0 But let me just say, Mr. Secretary, my friend, Tony, we are so proud to claim you as an alum of the Institute of Politics.\u00a0 The Institute of Politics is what it is because people like you with a wealth of experience are willing to share their time and the lessons of their experience with the leaders of tomorrow.\u00a0 And so the fact that you came back here today and took time in your busy schedule to be with us as we marked our own occasion means the world to me.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0David, thank you.\u00a0 And I feel a real attachment, not only to you personally because we\u2019re such good friends and colleagues over many years, but to the IOP and to the University of Chicago.\u00a0 It was a great experience for me, so being back is a wonderful thing.\u00a0 I had some just extraordinary colleagues who were here as fellows at the same time, so I\u2019m really grateful for that.\nLast night \u2013 I\u2019ve got \u2013 as you know, I\u2019ve got little kids.\u00a0 I have a soon-to-be three-year-old daughter and a soon-to-be four-year-old son.\u00a0 And my wife was putting our daughter to bed, and as she was putting her to bed, my daughter said, \u201cOh, should we wait for daddy?\u201d\u00a0 And my wife said, \u201cNo, no, he \u2013 actually he\u2019s in Chicago tonight and he\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0 And she looked at my wife with real concern and said, \u201cDo they have beds in Chicago?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I\u2019m gonna go back tonight and report that yes, they do.\u00a0 And they have an incredible Institute of Politics.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s one of our \u2013 it\u2019s one of our great virtues.\u00a0 So \u2013 thank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Hey, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 So the secret is that this entire trip to Chicago was actually an excuse to come here to Eli\u2019s.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I shared that with the Schulmans.\nIt is actually wonderful to be here.\u00a0 This is an iconic place, an iconic product, and it\u2019s been a real pleasure to meet the family that\u2019s behind this and the entire team here.\u00a0 And it\u2019s iconic in two ways.\u00a0 It\u2019s iconic because \u2013 and I\u2019m not supposed to advertise products, but, boy, is that incredible cheesecake, and I think that\u2019s something well-known to people around the world as well as, of course, the United States; but also iconic because what Eli\u2019s has done over decades is to create a family that is making this extraordinary product.\u00a0 Thirty percent of the team here is a refugee coming from some other distant part of the world, coming to the United States and making their future here.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing to see as you walk down the line and talk to people who are coming from all over the world, coming to the United States as their beacon of hope, and then making their future here.\nAs Marc Schulman told me and would tell you, this is not a work of charity to bring people here to work at Eli\u2019s; it\u2019s actually smart, good business because this team with their energy, with their ingenuity, with their drive, with their determination, it\u2019s a core part of the business.\u00a0 It\u2019s what makes it such a success.\u00a0 As Marc was saying, it is all about the people, and I could see that even in the brief time that I was on the floor here talking to people and hearing their passion, their gratitude for what the Schulman family has done to bring them in, but also our gratitude to them for now being the next generation of Americans who are carrying our story forward.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is all about.\nIt doesn\u2019t just happen, though, magically.\u00a0 It takes the extraordinary commitment of a great company.\u00a0 It takes the incredible work of our resettlement agencies to help connect refugees with places of work.\u00a0 And here RefugeeOne has been such an amazing partner to Eli\u2019s and to so many others; we\u2019re grateful for that.\u00a0 And ultimately, it takes individual Americans who want to carry on the extraordinary tradition that we have as a country in welcoming people from around the world to become part of our country, part of our future.\nWe just announced at the State Department a new program to tap into that energy, to tap into that desire that we\u2019re finding around the country to help, to support people coming to the United States.\u00a0 The Welcome Corps is now a way for individuals, organizations, various groups, alongside the resettlement agencies that are already there, to themselves help welcome refugees to this country, to help them get on their \u2013 get on their feet, to connect them with jobs, to help get their kids to school, to help them figure out how to sign up for the various services that they\u2019re entitled to as refugees.\nAnd what I\u2019m hearing and what I\u2019m seeing and feeling as I talk to people from across our country is an absolute energy, desire to help, to be part of this ongoing story that is our country.\u00a0 Welcome Corps is now a new way to do that.\u00a0 So we\u2019re incredibly excited about that, and I\u2019m incredibly excited about the fact that I\u2019m actually going home not empty-handed but with a couple of cheesecakes too.\u00a0 Thank you. \u00a0(Applause.)\nAnd it\u2019s great to be here with Congressman Quigley as well.\u00a0 He represents this district and has been such a strong supporter of everything that\u2019s going on here.\u00a0 Congressman?\nMR QUIGLEY:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you for coming to Chicago.\u00a0 I told the Secretary and Marc earlier that when I come to Eli\u2019s with the food and the spirit of the place, I\u2019m not sure whether to put my hand over my heart or my stomach.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Somehow those two are intertwined.\nOne of the favorite days I have every year is being at a ceremony swearing in new U.S. citizens.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 It is Frank Capra-esque in a world sometimes of a harder \u2013 a harder place.\u00a0 And it means the world to me.\u00a0 And when I speak to them, I always quote Walt Whitman, who talked about when there\u2019s life going on and that you may contribute a verse.\u00a0 And the thing that strikes me about every class being sworn in is they have a verse in mind.\u00a0 Right?\nJust this last August, I welcomed at North Park Village some refugees who had been brought up here and unceremoniously dropped off.\u00a0 And when we met them, what struck me is they had just been treated rather coldly.\u00a0 They had just gone through extraordinary efforts to get here.\u00a0 But they were still upbeat, optimistic, in a good mood, grateful.\u00a0 And what they were messaging to me was they just wanted a chance.\u00a0 They just wanted to contribute their verse.\nSo let\u2019s keep that in mind in the tough days that come ahead, and that which gives us optimism and hope for this country and all that we are, strong, and the reasons, and who we are as a country \u2013 and the Statue of Liberty is not holding up a stop sign.\u00a0 And we need to work toward that end.\u00a0 Thank you so much.

		"speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State",
		"audience": "Ukrainian Cultural Center",
		"location": "Chicago, Illinois",
		"date": "January 20, 2023",
		"content": "\n\nSENATOR DURBIN:\u00a0 We live in a dangerous world, and there is probably no more dangerous place than Ukraine at this moment.\u00a0 The people of Ukraine are fighting for their lives.\u00a0 With this unjust, ruthless invasion by Vladimir Putin and the Russian troops, they have faced 11 months of devastation, death, and destruction, and yet they have shown uncommon courage.\u00a0 They are standing up for values that really define them and now define America as well, and that is why this administration and our country have made a major commitment to help the Ukrainian people and to engage the NATO Alliance at a level that hasn\u2019t been seen ever in history.\u00a0 I think it is a successful effort and it is one that is inspired by the people of Ukraine.\nOne of the leaders in that effort for the United States is our Secretary of State Tony Blinken.\u00a0 I am honored to have him visit Chicago today, and he has come to ground zero when it comes to Ukrainian support in America: Ukrainian Village in the city of Chicago.\u00a0 We just had a very productive and positive meeting to discuss what is happening in Ukraine and what we can do to give more strength to our relationship and support in the future.\nIt is my honor to introduce the Secretary of State Tony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Senator, Dick, thank you so much.\u00a0 It\u2019s really wonderful for me to be in Chicago today, to be here in Ukrainian Village.\u00a0 As the Senator said, we have been dealing with the \u2013 for the last almost year now with this Russian aggression against Ukraine, but not only against Ukraine and its people and the country, but an aggression against the very principles that are so important into making sure that we can actually uphold peace and security around the world.\u00a0 And if we did not stand up against this Russian aggression, as we\u2019ve been doing, we would be opening a pandora\u2019s box around the world for would-be aggressors everywhere to think that they can simply go into another country, seize its territory, kill its people, and get away with that with impunity.\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re determined that that not happen.\nAnd thanks to extraordinary leadership that we\u2019ve seen from Senator Durbin and other colleagues in Congress, the Biden administration along with Congress has provided historic support to Ukraine to make sure that Ukrainians have what they need to defend themselves, to deal with the humanitarian catastrophe that is being unleased on them by Russian aggression, to support their economy, as well as to put pressure on Russia to end the aggression \u2013 and in doing so, at the same time, bringing dozens of countries together around the world, all in support of the same objectives.\nBut at the heart of so much of what we\u2019re doing is work that\u2019s been done \u2013 being done by communities across our country also in support of Ukraine, and no more so than right here in Chicago, Ukrainian Village, which, as the Senator said, is really the beating heart of the Ukrainian American community.\nWe had an opportunity this morning to do two things.\u00a0 We were across the street at the museum of modern art, where we saw an extraordinary exhibition of artworks from Ukrainian children \u2013 the children of war \u2013 that\u2019s on display here.\u00a0 And you\u2019re seeing the war, the brutality, the inhumanity through the eyes of children, as expressed by their extraordinary, extraordinary art.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s a powerful reminder to each and every one of us that this war, this aggression is not an abstraction.\u00a0 It\u2019s having an impact on real people\u2019s lives; it\u2019s affecting, tearing apart the lives of children.\u00a0 And if you go to that exhibit and look at these extraordinary drawings and paintings, I think the first thing you think about is:\u00a0 What if this were my kids?\u00a0 This could be my kids.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a reminder of why it is so important that we sustain our support for Ukraine until the aggression ends.\nSecond, as Senator Durbin said, we just had an opportunity to meet with an extraordinary group of Ukrainian Americans, the diaspora community that in so many ways are doing what\u2019s vital to supporting Ukraine, both in terms of mobilizing support going to Ukraine but also supporting Ukrainians who have had to flee their country in the wake of this aggression and come to the United States, supporting their efforts to come here, integrate here, be able to find jobs, send their kids to school, and so forth.\nThis community-led effort is, maybe more than anything else, the profound expression of what our country\u2019s all about: supporting each other, but also supporting others in times of need.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing, and we were grateful to be able to get some of the feedback, the input from the community to hear about what they\u2019re doing and to hear what else we can do to support their efforts.\nSo I can\u2019t really, Dick, thank you enough for having us here today, connecting us to this community.\u00a0 It\u2019s an ongoing \u2013 ongoing dialogue, an ongoing effort, and I think there\u2019s a great determination to see it through to success.\nThanks.\nSENATOR DURBIN:\u00a0 Thanks.\n\n",

everyone.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for that introduction.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to see you in person.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen you on TV a few times.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd to all of you, it\u2019s just wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 I want to thank the mayor again for his leadership of the U.S. conference.\u00a0 And thank you to Tom Cochran \u2013 I was just backstage with him \u2013 and the entire team for having me here with you this morning.\nSo in Washington, we have an old bad joke about the worst words that someone can say that you all know very well: I\u2019m from the federal government; I\u2019m here to help.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well, this group, on the other hand, gets to say, \u201cI\u2019m the mayor \u2013 I really do help.\u201d\u00a0 And I know the difference.\nFor more than nine decades, the U.S. Conference of Mayors has harnessed the incredible power of American cities to advance a stronger and more secure America.\nIn the earliest days of the Depression \u2013 when millions were unemployed, bread lines stretched for blocks, banks had run dry \u2013 America\u2019s mayors forged this coalition to secure the first-ever direct assistance package to cities.\u00a0 If you go back and look at their campaign, the mayors were united, they were committed, and they were relentless \u2013 so relentless, in fact, that when President Hoover later threatened to veto the bill, they marched to the Oval Office and didn\u2019t leave until he pledged his support.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t remind President Biden that I shared that story with you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIn the decades since, this group has come together again and again to meet America\u2019s needs: advocating for civil rights, supporting the vulnerable, taking in refugees fleeing conflict, tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and fighting violent crime in our neighborhoods.\nToday, on the defining priorities of our time, America\u2019s mayors continue to lead the way \u2013 and to deliver results for our people.\nWe know that cities are the engines of opportunity and ingenuity in the United States.\u00a0 They\u2019re where challenges tend to emerge first, and solutions are often forged quickest.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been able to see some of that firsthand in my own travels over the last couple of years.\nThe great vitality of cities is why President Biden asked four mayors to join his cabinet.\u00a0 It\u2019s why whenever I visit our cities and meet their leaders, I tend to leave more optimistic and more confident about America\u2019s future \u2013 our best days are genuinely ahead of us.\nNow, I realize it may be a little unusual for the Secretary of State to address the Conference of Mayors.\u00a0 And as you heard from Mayor Suarez \u2013 and I\u2019m told this is accurate \u2013 I have been \u2013 I will be the first Secretary of State to do so.\u00a0 But I wanted to be here to spend time with the leaders who are probably closest to our communities.\u00a0 And the reason for that is, it\u2019s a key part of fulfilling a pledge that President Biden made at the beginning of this administration.\u00a0 As he put it:\u00a0 \u201cEvery action that we take in our conduct abroad, we [have to] take with American working families in [our] mind[s].\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s the instruction that I got on my first day on the job.\nWhen he took office, the President asked me to prioritize the issues that most directly affect our fellow Americans, and he asked the same of our entire national security team.\nWe have tried to take that charge seriously.\nIt\u2019s guided our work on acute challenges, like the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 We know \u2013 we\u2019ve experienced this firsthand: viruses have no respect for borders.\u00a0 So to combat COVID-19 at home, we need to slow the spread everywhere.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve supported the donation of over 680 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to over 116 countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s why we partnered with dozens of countries, with the World Health Organization, with regional organizations to deliver on what we call a Global Action Plan to increase vaccinations, to strengthen health supply chains, to combat misinformation and disinformation that\u2019s aiding the virus\u2019s spread \u2013 accelerating the work that mayors are doing here at home.\nAnd it\u2019s why we\u2019re doing everything we can to ensure that the world is better prepared to prevent, to detect, to respond to future epidemics because we know they\u2019re coming \u2013 including by working to establish a State Department bureau on global health security and diplomacy to make sure that my agency is as organized as it can be to deal with this in the future.\nAnother immediate challenge is, of course, the climate crisis, which America\u2019s mayors know \u2013 and see firsthand \u2013 there is a clear, present, and growing danger. \u00a0Now, maybe you live in Florida, which last fall was hit by Hurricane Ian, one of the worst disasters in a century.\u00a0 Or the Midwest, where farmlands keep flooding, pushing up food prices for everyone.\u00a0 Or out West, where wildfires get worse every single year, and historic storms just slammed the coast.\nNow, I know mayors aren\u2019t just witnessing climate change \u2013 you are helping to lead the fight against it.\u00a0 When Washington pulled back from the Paris Agreement, it was America\u2019s mayors and governors who stepped up.\u00a0 As the effects of climate change came to your doorsteps, you found the solutions to keep people safe, to transition to clean energy, to cut emissions, to conserve ecosystems.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve worked with counterparts from around the world to share lessons and to raise one another\u2019s ambitions.\nYour leadership is vital, and it\u2019s going to be even more so in the years ahead.\u00a0 And so will the role of American diplomacy \u2013 because, just as with pandemics, we simply can\u2019t solve this problem on our own.\u00a0 Our country accounts for about 15 percent of global emissions, so even if we did everything right here at home, we\u2019ve got to bring the other 85 percent along.\nNow, we\u2019ve rallied three quarters of all countries to support something called the Global Methane Pledge to cut emissions by 30 percent by 2030, emissions coming from the flaring of gas.\u00a0 If that succeeds, it would be the equivalent of taking every ship out of the seas and every plane out of the skies in terms of emissions.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with 139 other nations to phase down hydrofluorocarbons, a greenhouse gas used in refrigerators and heat pumps and air conditioning.\u00a0 That step alone could avoid as much as half a degree Celsius of warming by the end of the century.\nAnd we\u2019re leading the Subnational Climate Action Leaders\u2019 Exchange.\u00a0 This is a new initiative to help cities, states, and regions develop and implement net-zero climate resilient targets and roadmaps.\u00a0 These actions advance our climate goals around the world, but they also spur job creation here at home.\u00a0 And as you\u2019ve often heard the President say: when I think about climate change, I think about jobs.\u00a0 This connection is real; we can make it even more powerful.\nWe\u2019re also currently negotiating a global agreement to end plastic pollution by 2040.\u00a0 In the U.S., cities are going to be crucial to that effort.\u00a0 We know that cities like Seattle and Phoenix are on the cutting edge of the quest to reduce, to reuse, to recycle plastic.\u00a0 And we\u2019re hoping to work with the Conference of Mayors to help create an agreement that mayors here and around the globe can successfully implement.\nOur focus on delivering for the American people is also shaping our work on longer-term strategic challenges, like the global technology revolution that\u2019s quite literally changing how we live and how we work.\u00a0 We need to make sure that critical and emerging technologies \u2013 and all of their applications, from artificial intelligence to biotechnology \u2013 actually protect our privacy, our security, our democracy, even as they usher in incredible opportunities in your communities here at home.\nSo we\u2019re forging new partnerships to bring our closest economic partners and fellow democracies together to try to shape, uphold, and promote common rules of the road to do just that.\u00a0 A lot of these rules get shaped in windowless conference rooms around the world, sometimes in the United Nations system.\u00a0 That\u2019s where it\u2019s actually happening.\u00a0 That\u2019s where decisions are made that actually affect the way that everyone gets to use this technology.\nSo it\u2019s important \u2013 more than important, it\u2019s vital \u2013 that the United States be at the table \u2013 in fact, be at the head of the table \u2013 when all of those rules are being laid out.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got a new bureau at the State Department for Cyberspace and Digital Policy.\u00a0 We have a new office for the special envoy for critical and emerging technologies to make sure that we will be well positioned to lead on these issues, that we will be at the table, that we will be at the head of the table.\nWe\u2019re also leading a concerted diplomatic push to make our supply chains more secure and more resilient.\u00a0 Now, just a few years ago, if you said supply chain I think people\u2019s eyes would glaze over.\u00a0 It still maybe creates that effect.\u00a0 It\u2019s kind of a wonky phrase.\u00a0 It\u2019s used mostly by economists and trade experts.\u00a0 But I think now most of our fellow citizens have experienced firsthand what it means when a supply chain is disrupted.\u00a0 If you look at the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, for example, it is manufactured between 11 sites across five countries, with inputs coming from many, many places.\u00a0 If that gets disrupted, we know what happens.\nSo we\u2019re mobilizing our partnerships to strengthen the supply chains that affect the availability and affordability of everything from cars to basic medical supplies.\u00a0 We\u2019re forging new partnerships to diversify supply chains for critical minerals so that we can both lower the costs and reduce dangerous dependencies, especially on autocratic countries, because economic security is national security.\u00a0 We know that and we live that every day at the State Department.\nWe\u2019re also using our diplomatic toolkit to protect American workers and try to level the playing field on which they compete, because if they\u2019re giving \u2013 given a level playing field, they will outcompete anyone.\u00a0 In the administration\u2019s first year together with partners across the U.S. Government, we rallied 130 countries to sign on to a global minimum tax for the world\u2019s biggest corporations.\nThat agreement will help end the race to the bottom on corporate taxes.\u00a0 It\u2019s a major step toward making sure that multinational corporations invest here in America, eliminating the incentive to shift job creation and profits abroad chasing the lowest taxes.\u00a0 It\u2019ll make America more competitive and ensure that our government and all of you have the resources to invest in our roads, in our bridges, in the educational systems that give opportunity to the next generation.\nWe\u2019ve also set up new partnerships like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity to try to shape the economic rules of the road for the future and create more opportunities for your citizens.\nFinally, we\u2019re focused on a crisis that I think everyone in this room knows all too well: fentanyl.\u00a0 The fentanyl overdose epidemic is the number-one killer of Americans age 18 to 49.\u00a0 That is a mind-boggling fact, and it\u2019s worth repeating \u2013 the number-one killer in this country of Americans 18 to 49: synthetic opioids, fentanyl.\u00a0 At the State Department, I\u2019ve made clear that we have to bring to bear the full power of American diplomacy to this challenge. \u00a0So we\u2019re working with international partners and with the private sector to try to disrupt the synthetic drug supply chain and prevent the diversion of chemicals from legitimate purposes to the production of synthetic drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamines.\nAnd we\u2019re committed to working with you to create and execute solutions that can actually make a difference in your communities.\nSo public health, climate, supply chains, the future of technology, economic security \u2013 these are the issues that our diplomats, your diplomats are working on day-in and day-out.\u00a0 It\u2019s what we mean when we talk about a foreign policy for the middle class.\u00a0 It\u2019s what we mean when we say that the line between foreign and domestic policy is more blurred than it\u2019s ever been.\nAnd just as what we\u2019re doing abroad has a major impact at home, what we\u2019re doing at home matters profoundly to our success around the world.\u00a0 That is more true than ever at a time when we see geopolitical competition has reached its most intense point since the end of the Cold War.\nHistoric investments like the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \u2013 these are actually critical to our standing and to our influence around the world.\u00a0 I feel this every single day.\u00a0 When those laws were passed, it literally added lift to our diplomacy around the world.\u00a0 It created American jobs, revitalizing our industries, recharging our innovation base, better positioning us to compete with rivals, demonstrating the power of democracy \u2013 when it gets it right \u2013 to deliver for its people.\nIt\u2019s precisely because foreign and domestic policy are so inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing that, in our judgment, we need to try to deepen the partnership between institutions like mine and yours.\nAnd that\u2019s why the State Department launched a new subnational diplomacy unit.\u00a0 I\u2019m thrilled to have Ambassador Nina Hachigian here.\u00a0 She\u2019s serving as our envoy to all of our cities and states.\nNina comes to us from Los Angeles, where she served as the first deputy mayor for international affairs.\u00a0 Before that, she was our ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and she worked with me on the National Security Council way back in the Clinton administration.\u00a0 I know that she is extremely excited to be working with all of you.\nLast November, Nina traveled to Richmond, Virginia, where she met with Mayor Stoney and representatives from the business community.\u00a0 And she heard something that we\u2019ve been hearing in many parts of our country: more needs to be done to create good-paying jobs.\u00a0 Cities are eager for help attracting more foreign direct investment and creating more markets for exports.\nBut that\u2019s not all.\u00a0 Nina and her team also heard that cities are looking to the federal government for help tackling other issues that affect their ability to expand inclusive economic opportunity and to grow businesses \u2013 like how to fix supply-chain issues, how to navigate complex global tax regimes, or how to support woman- and minority-owned businesses as they compete around the world.\nWe can help.\u00a0 These are issues that we work on every day.\u00a0 And with the subnational diplomacy unit, mayors now have an address at the State Department when they need help.\nThe subnational team will also strengthen partnerships between America\u2019s mayors and the world.\u00a0 U.S. mayors are already leading in the global arena \u2013 last fall at COP27, where the Mayors Conference hosted sessions on climate migration, social justice, and financing.\nSo we\u2019re here to accelerate that engagement, to support it, including by connecting you with our partners beyond our borders, like fellow mayors, as well as national governments, businesses, multilateral organizations.\u00a0 We know that they have a lot to learn from you.\nSo I\u2019m here really to tell you that this subnational diplomacy unit, this new office at our department, is your tool.\u00a0 And I very much hope that you\u2019ll use it.\nNow, it\u2019s also far from the only part of the State Department that\u2019s focused on our cities.\u00a0 I\u2019ve made clear to every part of my team that it\u2019s on all of us to connect our states, to connect our cities with our foreign policy.\u00a0 And I want to encourage you to work with us in this mission.\nJoin us, for example, at the City Summit of the Americas in late April, which will bring mayors, governors, and community leaders together to help shape our hemisphere\u2019s priorities to make sure that our work on democracy, on public health, on climate, on migration, on digital technologies and more actually benefit citizens at the local level.\u00a0 That is fundamentally what this is all about.\nJoin us in initiatives like the Open Government Partnership.\u00a0 Sign onto the Global Mayors Declaration for Democracy to defend the rule of law, to empower our citizens, to help fight corruption.\nKeep welcoming people from around the world to travel, to study, to work, to live in your cities, which is foundational to our own economic growth, to our competitiveness, and to middle class prosperity.\nAnd help us learn.\u00a0 Help us learn from your successes and ensure that others do as well.\u00a0 The answers to so many of the challenges that our world faces can be found right here in American cities.\nCities like Boston, which figured out that tracking COVID-19 in wastewater is one of the best ways to anticipate its spread, and then set up a system to test the water, neighborhood by neighborhood, to calibrate the city\u2019s pandemic response and stop the spread.\nAnd cities like Carmel, Indiana, home to over 140 roundabouts, which significantly reduced traffic fatalities and also mean that cars emit fewer tons of carbon emissions every single year.\nSolutions are found in cities like San Diego, which is using geospatial data to determine which communities are most in need of digital connectivity and has set up open, public Wi-Fi hotspots, free tech support, free computer and internet skills classes where they\u2019re needed most.\nThree cities, three examples of innovation that are making a difference for their residents.\u00a0 Three opportunities the federal government and the rest of the world need to learn from.\u00a0 Three reasons why our foreign policy needs cities as partners.\nTogether as partners, my hope is that we can get to work, and get to work for the American people.\u00a0 That\u2019s our common responsibility; we\u2019re determined to do it with you.\u00a0 Thank you so much for having me this morning.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0 James, my friend, we\u2019ve been around the world together on many occasions already \u2013 everywhere from New York to M\u00fcnster to Bucharest, just in recent months.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a special pleasure to have you here at the State Department for the first time in your current role, and we\u2019re adding another chapter to a very long history of this Special Relationship at a time when it could not be more important and could not be more vibrant.\nIn each of these engagements, our shared work to confront the threats posed by President Putin\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine was at the top of the agenda, as it was today.\u00a0 Both President Biden and Prime Minister Sunak have committed to standing with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\u00a0 And our teams are in lockstep as we coordinate our efforts both with one another and also with our many allies and partners.\nWe remain committed to sustaining our security assistance to Ukraine as it defends its people against Russia\u2019s brutal attacks, like the one we saw just this weekend on an apartment building in Dnipro on Saturday \u2013 far from the front lines.\u00a0 The senseless attack was launched from a missile designed to sink ships and killed dozens of people, wounded scores more.\u00a0 The youngest was just three years old.\nWe applaud the prime minister\u2019s commitment over the weekend to send Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems to Ukraine, elements that will continue to reinforce and add to what the United States has provided, including in our most recent drawdown.\nWe remain united in strengthening our humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people, especially as President Putin continues to weaponize winter by attacking Ukraine\u2019s electricity grid.\u00a0 Through the G7, we\u2019re working with the United Kingdom and other partners to help Ukraine repair, restore, and defend that grid.\nAnd we joined in applying economic pressure through coordinated sanctions and export controls on Moscow, holding President Putin and his enablers accountable, imposing costs designed to deprive Russia of the resources it needs to keep fueling its war machine.\nWe\u2019re undertaking these efforts and more to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position when a negotiating table emerges so that there can be a just and durable peace.\u00a0 That is our common objective.\nAt the same time the Russian military attacks Ukraine\u2019s energy supplies, Putin is using energy to try to punish countries that support Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together in several ways to ensure that these efforts fail as well.\u00a0 We\u2019re increasing the supply of liquified natural gas from the United States and the United Kingdom.\u00a0 We\u2019ve improved information sharing on ways to strengthen the market for energy smart appliances.\u00a0 We\u2019re investing and developing and deploying new clean energy technologies all across Europe.\nIn the face of these challenges, it\u2019s striking that many citizens of the United Kingdom and across the continent are rationing their energy use, taking quicker showers, lowering their heat.\u00a0 They understand the stakes of this war and they, too, stand in solidarity with Ukraine.\nThe foreign secretary and I also had an opportunity to discuss Iran.\u00a0 We stand with the British Government in condemning Iran\u2019s execution of Iranian-British dual national Alireza Akbari, which was politically motivated and unjust.\u00a0 It fits a pattern of abuse by the regime: detentions, torture, forced confessions, unjust executions.\nWe\u2019ll continue to work with the United Kingdom and our other allies and partners to hold Iran\u2019s leadership accountable for these and other abuses.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep standing with the brave Iranians who are standing up for their own basic rights led by young women \u2013 all of this in the face of extraordinary repression.\nWe discussed matters as well related to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 We welcome the United Kingdom\u2019s commitment to deepening its engagement in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We look forward to continuing our close consultation on a host of issues in the region, including maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\nWe also support the United Kingdom\u2019s increased focus on national security risks to the sensitive technology sectors.\u00a0 In recent days, the United Kingdom has denied export licenses to research laboratories funded by foreign defense companies and blocked the transfer of sensitive intellectual property.\nOur conversation also touched on Northern Ireland.\u00a0 I affirm President Biden\u2019s unequivocal support for the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, which over the past 25 years has been integral to preserving peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Northern Ireland.\u00a0 The United States believes that there must be a negotiated settlement to the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol that\u2019s acceptable to all sides.\u00a0 And we\u2019re heartened that in recent days the United Kingdom and the European Union have made substantive progress towards the negotiated solution.\nLast month, we appointed Joe Kennedy as our new Special Envoy to Northern Ireland for Economic Affairs.\u00a0 A career public servant, Joe will draw on his extensive experience to support economic growth in Northern Ireland and to deepen our nation\u2019s people\u2011to\u2011people ties with all communities.\nThis September will mark an important occasion in our own Special Relationship \u2013 the 75th anniversary of the UK-U.S. Fulbright Program.\u00a0 It\u2019s supported over those years more than 27,000 students, scholars, professionals \u2013 spanning disciplines from art and science, to history, to mathematics \u2013 as they travel between our countries and learn from and grow with one another.\nThat bond between our people is the beating heart of this relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s carried us through challenging times.\u00a0 It\u2019s created opportunities and innovation to the benefit of both of our people, and, I might add, for the world.\u00a0 I know that it will keep us connected closer than ever this year and in the years to come.\nAnd with that, James, over to you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Tony, thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m delighted to pay my first official visit to Washington as foreign secretary.\u00a0 As you\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve had plenty of opportunities to meet and work together over the last few months since my appointment in multilateral fora, where we reinforce often our respective positions.\u00a0 And I am incredibly grateful to Secretary Blinken for this opportunity to discuss a wide range of foreign policy issues and to reaffirm the unbreakable friendship and enduring alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\nNow, as it happens, we are meeting on the 80th anniversary of the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, where Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt \u2013 and their respective military chiefs, General Alanbrooke and General Marshall \u2013 planned the liberation of Europe and planned the victory over aggression.\nAnd as Secretary Blinken said, the main subject of our talks today was Ukraine\u2019s current struggle against aggression in our time.\u00a0 From the onset of this crisis, Britain and America have worked hand in glove to help our Ukrainian friends defend their homeland against Putin\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s heroic armed forces have liberated thousands of square miles, and I have no doubt they can win in their battle for freedom.\u00a0 As you will have seen, Britain has decided to accelerate our support, including the supply to Ukraine of main battle tanks, heavy artillery, and other military systems.\nSecretary Blinken and I are hugely encouraged not just by the unity between our two countries, but the transatlantic unity between the United States and Europe and the support from nations on every continent.\u00a0 Almost a year after Russia\u2019s attack against Ukraine, which broke the fundamental principles of international law \u2013 and we see them committing acts of barbarism wherever they advance \u2013 what we see is dozens of countries supplying Ukraine with weapons and enforcing sanctions against Russia.\u00a0 And I pay particular tribute to the United States of America, the largest military and economic donor to our friends in Ukraine, reinforcing this country\u2019s longstanding to \u2013 longstanding commitment to protecting freedom and opposing tyranny wherever it rears its ugly head.\nAnd whilst three-quarters of the entire membership of the United Nations voted to condemn this invasion, we should remember that never in living memory has Russia been more isolated and the Atlantic Alliance more united.\u00a0 If Putin believed that the world would succumb to Ukraine fatigue and lose the will to resist his ambitions, then that was, once again, another colossal misjudgment on his part.\nAs Tony said, we also discussed the situation in Iran, where the regime has committed a cowardly and shameful act by executing a British-Iranian dual national Alireza Akbari.\u00a0 I\u2019m very grateful to the United States of America for publicly condemning the execution and for Secretary Blinken expressing his condolences in our meeting a few moments ago.\u00a0 And also, our two countries stand with the brave and dignified people of Iran as they demand their rights to live free of terror and oppression.\u00a0 And the UK has sanctioned involved with the execution of Mr. Akbari and those involved in the oppression of their own people, including the Iranian prosecutor general.\nFor years, Iran\u2019s leadership have inflicted bloodshed on their regional neighbors by arming and supporting military extremists and militias.\u00a0 Now Iran has gone further and supplied Russian with the drones that were used to kill civilians in Ukraine.\u00a0 And the UK will join with the U.S. and other allies to hold the Iranian regime to account for the violations of the rights of their own people and by making themselves accomplices to Putin\u2019s assault on Ukraine.\nAnother threat to the international peace and security comes from Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which has never been more advanced.\u00a0 And the U.S. and the UK are determined that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon.\nWe also discussed China\u2019s growing assertiveness on the world stage, which poses a systematic challenge to many of our values and interests, and we recognize the need to manage competition with China, including through diplomacy and engagement.\u00a0 And we spoke of the need to enhance, with our allies and friends, our respective economic security, and we also need to take a long view, strengthen our resilience, and reduce strategic dependencies.\nBut nor can we ignore China or the need to engage with it, given China\u2019s significance on every issue in world affairs, ranging from economic stability to climate change.\nBritain and America share a steadfast commitment to peace and security in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And the AUKUS partnership \u2013 a decade-long project to provide a nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarine capability to Australia \u2013 is only possible because of the unique bond of trust between us.\nWe also spoke about Northern Ireland and our negotiations with the EU and our efforts to resolve the issues of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\u00a0 And we recognize the interest that the President of the United States has on this \u2013 on this issue, and his desire, which is shared of course by us, to see the institutions of the Northern Ireland back up and running.\nIn all these areas, and indeed many others, Britain and America are working in concert in the greatest tradition of our alliance.\u00a0 And I thank you, Secretary Blinken, once again for the opportunity to discuss these issues here in Washington.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much, gentlemen.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, first I do want to ask you both about Ukraine.\u00a0 But first let me just ask you, because while you were at the State Department, not at the White House and the Vice President\u2019s Office, you were for two years the managing director of the Penn Biden Center, and just ask if you were aware of any reason why classified documents would have been packed and brought there while you were there, and whether you would be available for an interview if the special counsel requests.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 The short answer is no.\u00a0 Just as you heard from President Biden about a week ago, I was surprised to learn that there were any government records taken to the Penn Biden Center.\u00a0 I had no knowledge of it at the time.\u00a0 The White House of course has indicated that the administration is cooperating fully with the review that the Justice Department has undertaken, and I of course would cooperate fully with that review myself.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 On Ukraine, the world has been horrified by what happened in Dnipro over the weekend.\u00a0 And this brutal attack only reinforces President Zelenskyy\u2019s requests for more weapons, including long-range missiles from the United States, tanks, fighter jets, attack \u2013 obviously Apaches, whatever else they need.\u00a0 The secretary, the foreign secretary, has said that we need to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d and give them what it takes to win.\u00a0 Why has the United States not provided more of these long-range weapons, more of these systems?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Secretary, the U.S. has said that they were concerned about \u2013 that they are concerned about Russia\u2019s response by provoking a further escalation.\u00a0 Is that not a concern for Great Britain, or do you think that that is overstated and that there is a greater need, as you have certainly expressed by your own actions?\nThank you both.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to kick it off.\u00a0 Andrea, thank you.\nFirst, I think it\u2019s important to say that as this aggression has evolved, so too has our assistance to Ukraine \u2013 making sure that it has what it needs to meet the aggression head on.\u00a0 And as I said before, that started long before the Russian aggression.\u00a0 When we saw the storm clouds gathering in the months before the aggression, we initiated what we call drawdowns of our own military equipment to Ukraine to make sure that it had on hand what it would need if Russia went through with the aggression.\u00a0 So Stingers, Javelins \u2013 all of those were provided initially around Labor Day a year ago, and then again before Christmas. \u00a0So this is months before the Russian aggression.\nThe result of that was that when Russia went in, when they attacked, the Ukrainians had on hand what they needed to repel the effort to take Kyiv, to take the whole country.\u00a0 And then of course, the war has evolved.\u00a0 The aggression has evolved; it moved to the south and the east, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s been.\nBut if you look at the trajectory from Stingers, to Javelins, to HIMARS, to Bradley Fighting Vehicles, to Patriot missile batteries, we have continuously provided what Ukraine needs.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing it in a way to make sure that it\u2019s responsive to what\u2019s actually happening on the battlefield as well as projecting where it might go, making sure as well that the Ukrainians are trained on the systems that were provided, that they have the ability to maintain the systems, because if they\u2019re not trained and the systems can\u2019t be maintained, it\u2019s not going to do you very much good for very long.\nSo all of these things taken together have been critical to the success that Ukraine has had to date.\u00a0 It starts with their own courage and resilience, but it\u2019s certainly been strongly supported by our two countries and many other countries, and we continue to adapt along the way.\nNow, all of that totals for, on the part of the United States, some $25 billion in security assistance to Ukraine over less than a year.\u00a0 And I would anticipate that you\u2019ll hear more announcements in the days to come.\u00a0 There\u2019ll be a meeting again at the end of the week of the so-called Ramstein group that Secretary Austin put together to make sure that we\u2019re coordinating security assistance among many countries.\u00a0 So stay tuned for more on that.\nBut the bottom line is we are determined to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to succeed on the battlefield.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve said, the fastest way to bring this war to a just and durable end, to get to diplomacy, to get to a negotiation, is to give Ukraine a strong hand on the battlefield.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say just because I have the opportunity to address this.\u00a0 There had been a narrative that the Russians were trying to push for many weeks and many months that they\u2019re interested in diplomacy in Ukraine and we are not.\u00a0 That of course is entirely false, but I think you only have to look at Putin\u2019s own words in a recent conversation with President Erdo\u011fan of T\u00fcrkiye in which he says unless and until Ukraine accepts the new territorial realities, as he put it, there\u2019s nothing to negotiate.\u00a0 In other words, unless and until Ukraine acknowledges and accepts the fact that territory that Russia has seized by force, it\u2019s not getting back, there\u2019s nothing to negotiate. That of course is in and of itself a nonstarter.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Andrea, look, I said in my opening remarks and I\u2019m going to reinforce it here: we should never lose sight of the fact that United States of America is the single largest donor of military and economic aid to support Ukraine\u2019s self-defense of any country in the world, and the UK is very proud to be number two in that pecking order.\nAnd it\u2019s very easy to get focused on individual equipment types, and of course tanks are the headline of today.\u00a0 But in our package of military support there were heavy artillery, the AS-90 system and the M-109 system, the 155-caliber guns, as well as 105-caliber guns, as well as 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, millions of rounds of small arms ammunition.\u00a0 That was part of the package that we put forward.\nBut we should also recognize the importance of the Patriot missile system.\u00a0 This is an incredibly sophisticated and important piece of air defense equipment.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the horrors that Ukraine is having to endure because of air attacks, and so those air defense missile systems, the 50-plus Bradley armored fighting vehicles that were recently announced, these are really significant, meaningful donations to the military effort.\nFrom the UK\u2019s point of view, we certainly value the longstanding commitments that the United States of America has made.\u00a0 The contributions that we are making in the UK both in terms of equipment and training, we do so standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States of America, as we have done throughout this.\u00a0 I was at the United Nations Security Council meeting literally sitting next door to Secretary Blinken when we together warned the world of what Putin was about to do.\u00a0 We knew what his intention was, we provided that warning to the world, and we have both physically and metaphorically been shoulder-to-shoulder in our condemnation of Putin\u2019s actions and our support to Ukraine ever since.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s really important the American people recognize what is \u2013 what their own government in doing in support of freedom and in opposition to this aggression and oppression.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Nick Allen.\u00a0 Nick Allen of The Telegraph.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks very much.\u00a0 A question for each of you, please.\nFor Secretary Blinken, another question on tanks.\u00a0 Germany suggested today that it won\u2019t allow tanks to be sent to Ukraine unless the U.S. sends them first.\u00a0 What\u2019s your response to that?\nAnd for the foreign secretary, did you pledge today that the Northern Ireland Protocol issue will be resolved by the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, and did you discuss whether President Biden will visit the UK in April?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So on the question of tanks, and for that matter any weapons system, these are sovereign decisions for each country to make.\u00a0 I would note that what Germany has done to date has been quite extraordinary, and we\u2019ve just had the recent announcement that they\u2019ll send infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine and a Patriot missile battery.\u00a0 And that follows a long line of other steps that they\u2019ve taken that I suspect most of us would not have thought, if not possible, certainly probable just a year ago.\u00a0 But these are fundamentally decisions for each country to make as something that we respect.\nWe\u2019ve seen incredible solidarity among countries around the world to support Ukraine.\u00a0 And as I mentioned, Secretary Austin is going to be hosting another meeting of all of the countries that are involved in providing support to Ukraine at the end of this week, and I would expect further announcements to come out of that meeting.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to the Northern Ireland Protocol and the negotiations with the European Commission, I did update Secretary Blinken on that.\u00a0 Those negotiations \u2013 as I have said publicly and Maro\u0161\u00a0\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d has also said publicly \u2013 have been negotiated \u2013 have been conducted in good faith, with a genuine desire to get resolution to these important issues.\nAnd of course we always welcome the \u2013 visits from senior members of the United States Government, including of course the President himself.\u00a0 But I want to make it absolutely clear that our desire to get resolution on the issues of the Northern Ireland Protocol are because we want to see the institutions of the Good Friday \u2013 Belfast Good Friday Agreement up and running.\u00a0 We want to see devolved government in Northern Ireland in Stormont back up and running.\u00a0 We want to see a free flow of trade within the UK internal market whilst respecting the desire of the European Union to protect its single market.\nAnd we do these things because they are the right things to do, not because we are trying to hit a particular date or anniversary.\u00a0 We want to get these things resolved as soon as possible so that the people of Northern Ireland can enjoy full economic freedom, can enjoy the relief packages that the UK Government has put in place to address some of the issues of, for example, energy prices that have increased as a direct result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 We do these things for those reasons, and of course, as I say, we recognize the President and I think the whole of the U.S. Government\u2019s desire to see this resolution.\u00a0 It mirrors our desire to get these things resolved, and indeed, I believe very strongly mirrors the European Commission\u2019s desire to get these things resolved.\u00a0 And we will continue working hard and in that good spirit of cooperation.\nI\u2019d make the point that I have tried to keep our negotiations discreet, and I think that discretion has actually helped us get some things over the line, so you will understand that my intention is to continue keeping those \u2013 the details of those negotiations discreet.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Courtney McBride, Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 You\u2019ve highlighted the evolution of security assistance to Ukraine from the U.S., the UK, and various allies and partners and said that you\u2019re doing things that were not previously thought possible.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious about what changed, what was the motivating factor that actually spurred that beyond just adapting to the changes in the battlefield environment, and also what obstacles remain both individually and collectively to get Ukraine to the point of that swift and decisive victory for which the foreign secretary has been advocating.\nAnd then finally, on NATO accession for Sweden and Finland, which you\u2019ve both said would be additive for the Alliance, what role are your countries playing in trying to expedite that process?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I don\u2019t think anything has changed.\u00a0 As I said from day one and before day one, we have sought to make sure to the best of our ability and to the best ability of many other friends and partners who are determined to support Ukraine that we were getting to the Ukrainians what they needed when they needed it to deal with the situation they were facing on the ground.\u00a0 And as we discussed just a few minutes ago, that \u2013 what they\u2019ve been facing has evolved.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s changed.\nAnd so we\u2019ve tried to make sure that we\u2019re as responsive as quickly as possible to the evolutions on the battlefield, not only where it is geographically but the kinds of things that the Russians are doing, as well as the kinds of things that the Ukrainians need to do to regain the territory that\u2019s been taken from them by force.\u00a0 So I think that\u2019s been the evolution.\nAnd again, what you\u2019ve seen in \u2013 just in recent weeks, not only from the United States and the United Kingdom but from many other countries, is a continued commitment to make sure that the Ukrainians do have what they need.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve seen countries in Europe provide everything from fighting vehicles to light tanks, air defenses, ammunition, artillery.\u00a0 All of that continues to come forward to the Ukrainians.\nWe\u2019re now in winter.\u00a0 There continues to be ferocious fighting, particularly along the eastern front.\u00a0 I anticipate that that will, unfortunately, go on for some time.\u00a0 But we are determined together, as well as with many others, to make sure, as I said, that the Ukrainians have what they need to recapture, regain what they\u2019ve lost and to deal with the Russian aggression.\u00a0 So that hasn\u2019t changed.\nWith regard to Finland and Sweden and NATO, there\u2019s been a process, an ongoing process involving T\u00fcrkiye, Finland, and Sweden, and I think that process has been very productive in addressing some of the concerns that T\u00fcrkiye has raised about its own security, and both Finland and Sweden have taken significant steps to address those concerns.\u00a0 And we anticipate that this process will move forward in the weeks and months ahead.\nThere\u2019s a strong consensus among NATO countries for bringing Finland and Sweden into the Alliance.\u00a0 You\u2019ve seen that in the extraordinary rapid signing of the protocols, the ratification now by 28 of 30 NATO members of Finland and Sweden\u2019s accession, and we look to the process that\u2019s ongoing between T\u00fcrkiye, Finland, and Sweden to move this forward and move it forward expeditiously.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, really, all I can do is find myself reinforcing the points that Secretary Blinken has made.\u00a0 I mean, in your question you said other than the evolution of the battle, what has changed \u2013 I mean, it really is as simple as that.\u00a0 At the start of this conflict, when the Ukrainians were defending themselves against heavy armor attacks in urban locations in and around Kyiv and Irpin and other places, what they needed were those small, portable, hand-held anti-tank missile systems, because in the congested real estate of urban warfare, those were the most effective weapon systems that they could have utilized against tanks.\u00a0 And the NLAW systems that we provide \u2013 manufactured in Northern Ireland, by the way \u2013 as well as the Javelins systems that the United States of America provided, and others, were absolutely instrumental in helping the Ukrainians defend themselves in those urban areas.\nAs the battle then moved to more attacks from the air, the air defense systems that we have subsequently provided became key, and now we see more conflict in open spaces, in open ground in the east and the south, which therefore necessitates more maneuverist equipment \u2013 the ability to fight and maneuver simultaneously.\u00a0 That has very much been the evolution of the response.\nAs Secretary Blinken has said, the Ramstein process where we sit with our international friends, the members of the NATO Alliance, to discuss what we can provide \u2013 what equipment is available, what equipment is ready to go on stream, what equipment the Ukrainians need \u2013 is essential.\u00a0 Then it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s about providing the right equipment at the right time so they conduct the right kind of fighting.\u00a0 And of course the work that the UK has done and the U.S. is doing in terms of training Ukrainian troops so that they can be more effective with the equipment and ammunition that we are providing them, that they can utilize our donations most effectively and maintain the equipment most effectively, is also important.\u00a0 And that process will continue and we will evolve our support just as the battle evolves.\nAnd all I can do is echo the words that Secretary Blinken said about Sweden and Finland.\u00a0 I have absolutely no doubt they will be incredibly effective allies.\u00a0 And I would make the point that in both those countries, they had a longstanding posture of not formally affiliating with NATO.\u00a0 That changed as a direct result of Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 His actions were designed to break NATO as a defensive Alliance, and what he did instead was strengthen NATO as a defensive Alliance.\u00a0 Add that to the charge sheet of strategic-level miscalculations that Putin has been making throughout this endeavor.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Robert Moore of ITV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks for taking these questions.\u00a0 I wanted to follow up with a question about Iran following the killing of Mr. Akbari.\u00a0 I mean, you\u2019ve both said here today and, Foreign Secretary, you said in the House of Commons that you will hold Iran to account.\u00a0 Can you be specific about what you mean given that these sanctions that you refer to have been in place for some time?\u00a0 And I wonder more broadly where this leaves our Iran policy. \u00a0Do we regard leaders in Tehran as legitimate interlocutors in terms of the nuclear talks?\u00a0 Are they dead in the water or are they on life support or can they be potentially kept going even following the killing of Mr. Akbari, even following Iran\u2019s provision of so much weaponry to Russia?\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 The execution of Mr. Akbari was a politically motivated act, and we acted swiftly to sanction the people involved with it, including the prosecutor general.\u00a0 We have already sanctioned members of the so-called morality police and of the members of the Iranian judiciary who have been involved with the crackdown of the legitimate protests of the Iranian people.\nI would make the point that there have been around 500 fatalities because of the crackdown from the Iranian regime against their own people; 18,000 people arrested by the Iranian regime.\u00a0 And the point that I would make is the leadership of Iran is a decision for the Iranian people, but I would just make the simple observation that the Iranian people are telling their government that they are not at all happy with the situation that they are living under and the limitations and privations.\u00a0 And it is in the hands of the Iranian Government to make those changes.\u00a0 They call \u2013 they call for us, for the U.S., for us, and our friends to lift sanctions.\u00a0 And the point that we have made is that if they want to see those sanctions removed, they have to fundamentally change their behavior.\u00a0 Sadly, we\u2019re not seeing any indication that they are ready to do so, and unfortunately that is as true with our efforts to prevent them acquiring a nuclear weapon as it is in the crackdown on the protesters and the persecution of their own people.\nIt is in the gift of the Iranian leadership to bring about change.\u00a0 We will continue to act in response to their behaviors, and you\u2019ll have to excuse me, I\u2019m not going to speculate about what further measures we might take.\u00a0 But I said at the dispatch box just before flying to the U.S. that we do not limit ourselves to the response that I have already announced.\nBut we will continue to speak to Iran where we\u2019re able to and we hope that at some point soon they will listen properly to what we\u2019re saying, because I don\u2019t believe that a country with a multi-thousand-year history of sophistication and art really wants to have the international reputation of ugliness and brutality that Iran currently has.\u00a0 They are betraying their heritage.\u00a0 They are objectifying \u2013 sorry, they are oppressing their own people.\u00a0 And the simple message I would put across is that they should change \u2013 not for our benefit, not because of what we say or do, but because their own people are demanding that they do so.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And really, I can only strongly echo what the foreign secretary has said.\u00a0 We were appalled by the execution of Mr. Akbari, just as we\u2019ve been appalled by everything we\u2019ve been seeing on the streets of Iran over the last months since these protests began \u2013 mass arrests, sham trials, the executions, the use of sexual violence as a tool for protest suppression.\u00a0 We, the United Kingdom \u2013 but not just us \u2013 countries around the world are watching this, seeing this, and share the revulsion that we have.\u00a0 And these abuses will not go without consequence.\u00a0 Together with many other countries, we\u2019ve been moving forward with a variety of unilateral actions, multilateral measures, using UN mechanisms to try to hold Iran to account.\u00a0 And that\u2019s played out in a number of different places in a number of different ways, and it will continue as long as necessary.\nWith regard to the JCPOA, the Iranians killed the opportunity to come back to that agreement swiftly many months ago.\u00a0 There was an opportunity on the table that they rejected, an opportunity that was approved by all who were involved \u2013 the Europeans, the United States, Russia and China even at the time.\u00a0 And so the JCPOA has not been on the agenda as a practical matter for many months now.\u00a0 It\u2019s not our focus.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on what\u2019s happening in Iran.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on what Iran is doing in terms of the provision of weapons to Russia to use against innocent people and the entire energy grid in Ukraine.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re focused on its other destabilizing activities throughout the region.\nWhat is also very much in our focus is the President\u2019s commitment, President Biden\u2019s commitment that Iran never acquire a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 Now, we continue to believe that the most effective way to do that is through diplomacy, and we saw the results and success of diplomacy when it comes to the original JCPOA, which put Iran\u2019s nuclear program in a box.\u00a0 And it was a terrible mistake to have torn up that agreement and walked away from it, and now we\u2019re dealing with the results.\u00a0 The results include, as the foreign secretary said, Iran making very significant progress on its nuclear program, and that represents an additional challenge to the other things that Iran has engaged in.\u00a0 But, as I said, the JCPOA right now is not on the table.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is that when it comes to diplomacy in general, you tend to spend a chunk of your diplomacy engaging with countries with whom you have profound disagreements or worse, including outright adversaries.\u00a0 That\u2019s the nature of what we do.\u00a0 And the one thing that\u2019s clear is that engaging in diplomacy, including with those who are engaged in outrageous actions, is sometimes necessary to try to advance our interests, and it never takes the word \u201cno\u201d from our vocabulary.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, gentlemen.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 That concludes the press conference.\n",

joined today by leaders from the United States and Japan to sign a framework agreement that recognizes our nations\u2019 mutual interest in peaceful exploration.\u00a0 The Framework Agreement Between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America for Cooperation in Space Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, For Peaceful Purposes covers a broad portfolio of joint activities between our nations, including exploration, science, aeronautics, technology, and much more.\nFirst, I\u2019d like to welcome NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to deliver a few words.\nMR NELSON:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Jackie.\u00a0 Is the microphone coming through?\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Welcome, everybody, and on behalf of the deputy administrator, Colonel Pam Melroy, on behalf of our entire workforce at NASA, which is a group of wizards \u2013 they make the impossible possible, as you have seen in some of the extraordinary things that have happened just in the last year \u2013 on behalf of all of these, I want to welcome you, Mr. Prime Minister here, your delegation.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to have you, the foreign minister, Mr. Ambassador.\u00a0 It\u2019s also our JAXA President Yamakawa, and it\u2019s great to have our astronauts, Aki and Anne.\u00a0 So thank you all.\nAnd of course, JAXA\u2019s Koichi Wakata, a very experienced astronaut, is on the International Space Station as we speak, and he has flown with us five times already.\u00a0 I also want to thank the Secretary of State.\u00a0 I want to thank my old buddy, Ambassador Emanuel, who I\u2019ll get to see in just a few weeks in Japan, and I want to thank all of you for being here.\nThe principles of diplomacy, democracy, and discovery are the core cornerstones of the U.S.-Japan alliance.\u00a0 Our nations are both spacefaring nations, nations poised to unlock the secrets of the universe.\u00a0 And today, we are once again reaffirming that Japan and the U.S. explore openly, explore peacefully, and explore together.\u00a0 And this framework that will be signed by the Secretary of State and the foreign minister, this framework deepens our partnership.\nSpace unites us.\u00a0 In this era of space exploration, every announcement and advancement is not an achievement for just a single country \u2013 it is a victory for all of humanity.\u00a0 And that is how the U.S. chooses to lead in this effort with Japan and others in the 21st century, on Earth and in the heavens.\nDeputy Administrator Melroy and I are looking forward to visiting Japan next month, and we are going to be there to grow the bond between NASA and JAXA.\u00a0 Our space programs have storied histories of barriers overcome and new worlds understood, and so today we chart a new chapter in a continuing adventure together as allies and partners.\u00a0 Welcome.\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Administrator.\u00a0 Next, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio will deliver remarks.\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Well, hello, everyone here.\u00a0 I am Fumio Kishida, prime minister of Japan.\u00a0 I am truly pleased that the framework agreement on Japan-U.S. space cooperation is being signed today.\nThe U.S.-Japan space cooperation has entered a new era with the Artemis project and many projects, including lunar activities, are already in the works by Japanese and U.S. astronauts.\u00a0 But I strongly hope that this agreement will robustly promote our space cooperation even further and also further expand the field of cooperation under the Japan-U.S. alliance, which has become stronger than ever under the leadership of President Biden, Vice President Harris, and myself.\nAllow me to commend the efforts of everyone from both sides in developing this Framework Agreement, and I am committed to continuing to working lockstep with the United States to deepen this collaboration.\nArigato gozaimasu.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Prime Minister.\u00a0 Next we will hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 And good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 It\u2019s especially wonderful to be here at NASA.\u00a0 I take a point of \u2013 as you would say in the Senate \u2013 personal privilege to say how good it is to be with the administrator.\u00a0 I can\u2019t help but thinking of him as senator for the many years that I had the honor of working, in effect, for him as staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee.\u00a0 So, Mr. Administrator, it\u2019s wonderful to be here with you and with the women and men of NASA at Headquarters together with friends from JAXA.\u00a0 And I realize that I\u2019m actually sharing this podium with three people who have been to space \u2013 the administration[i]\u00a0included.\nMr. Prime Minister, it\u2019s an honor to sit with you, with my friend Foreign Minister Hayashi, and with our ambassadors as well.\u00a0 This week, our governments have been holding incredibly productive and wide-ranging meetings that underscore that on virtually every issue of consequence to our people in Japan and the United States alike, we are stronger together.\nOur bilateral partnership is among the strongest in the world \u2013 in part because we\u2019re always adapting it to meet the evolving challenges of our time.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the case on everything from advancing security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, to bolstering our economic and energy security, to defending the rights at the core of the United Nations Charter.\nWe\u2019re also expanding the horizons of our partnership in a very literal way: through space cooperation.\u00a0 And here I also want to thank Vice President Harris for her leadership as chair of the National Space Council.\nFor decades now, Japan and the United States have worked together to extend humanity\u2019s reach in space.\u00a0 We\u2019ve long collaborated to support the International Space Station.\u00a0 We were two of the first signatories of the Artemis Accord that the prime minister referred to.\u00a0 We\u2019re partners in the Artemis Program, which will return astronauts to the lunar surface \u2013 including the first woman and the first person of color.\u00a0 We just signed a new arrangement to support the Lunar Gateway, which will prepare for future missions to Mars.\nThe Framework Agreement that we\u2019re about to sign will take our cooperation to new heights.\u00a0 It\u2019ll strengthen our partnership in areas like research on space technology and transportation, robotic lunar surface missions, climate-related missions, and our shared ambition to see a Japanese astronaut on the lunar surface.\nIn the last century, the space race electrified the world \u2013 seizing the imaginations of millions of people, awed by the men and women who dared to go into the unknown.\u00a0 It inspired generations of scientists, researchers, innovators, dreamers.\u00a0 And it paved the way for countless technological advances \u2013 in computers, satellites, GPS, camera lenses, medical equipment, and so much more.\u00a0 And these advances have improved the daily lives of people across the planet.\nNow, we\u2019re entering a new chapter of space exploration.\u00a0 And our ambitions are no less soaring than in President Kennedy\u2019s time, when he declared his commitment to \u201clanding a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth\u201d within the decade.\u00a0 And our achievements, I believe, will be no less impressive, or important, for the benefit of humankind.\nBut even more than in the past, we will reach new frontiers through an approach that is fundamentally collaborative.\nWe\u2019ve seen what international space collaboration can achieve.\u00a0 Just in the last two years, it put a rover on Mars and launched the most powerful space telescope ever, the James Webb Space Telescope.\u00a0 Just this week, that telescope confirmed the existence of an exoplanet for the first time \u2013 an Earth-sized planet located 41 light-years away from us.\u00a0 With Japan, our countries will soon make similar incredible discoveries, as we prepare to send a probe to Mars\u2019s moons, explore the South pole of our Moon, and more.\nAgreements like the one that we\u2019re signing today help create and strengthen the partnerships that are at the heart of this extraordinary progress.\u00a0 We need to harness the world\u2019s collective vision and all of our strengths to reach these new horizons.\nMajor General Bill Anders, a member of Apollo 8 \u2013 the first human spaceflight to reach the Moon \u2013 said, and I quote, \u201cWe came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.\u201d\nHe understood that one of space exploration\u2019s greatest powers \u2013 maybe one of its greatest gifts \u2013 is to bind people together, across continents, across oceans, in pursuit of knowledge, in pursuit of understanding.\nIt\u2019s in that spirit that the United States and Japan take this step.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0 And now for the main event.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and Japan\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs Hayashi Yoshimasa will sign the Framework Agreement for the United States and Japan.\nFor our participants on stage, please rise to join Secretary Blinken and Minister Hayashi.\n(The Framework Agreement was signed.)\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Please be seated.\nNext we will hear from Minister Hayashi.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 This is my honor to sign this historic agreement for Japan-U.S. Space Cooperation with my dear friend Tony here.\u00a0 With the exploration and the use of outer space growing increasingly active, the signing of this agreement is of extreme significance.\u00a0 I understand that as part of Artemis program, Japan and the U.S. are planning development of lunar exploration vehicles, lunar activities by Japanese and American astronauts.\u00a0 And so with the conclusion of this agreement between our two countries, numerous cooperative projects \u2013 including the above-mentioned plans \u2013 will be conducted efficiently under this agreement.\nI sincerely hope that Japan-U.S. space cooperation will further deepen based on this agreement, and it will benefit the future of all mankind.\u00a0 I anticipate more activities by both of our countries\u2019 experts working on space.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0 Thank you, Minister.\nAnd last but not least, Ambassador Rahm Emanuel, the floor is yours.\nAMBASSADOR EMANUEL:\u00a0 I think this is on.\u00a0 I got this.\u00a0 It\u2019s all right.\nWhen you\u2019re the fifth and final speaker, you\u2019re reminded of what Lyndon Johnson once said, which is that everything that needs to be said has been said; it just hasn\u2019t been said by everybody that needs to say it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMr. Prime Minister, thank you for your visit here.\u00a0 To my good friend \u2013 he\u2019s Administrator Nelson, but I have to call him Senator Nelson; he always was a senator as we worked together.\u00a0 And to Tony and to Hayashi-san, it\u2019s a pleasure to see you here.\nIt\u2019s been \u2013 this is a historic week in the United States and Japan relationship.\u00a0 And I cannot think of a more fitting way to conclude the prime minister\u2019s visit, for his heroic leadership, but to have this signing that symbolizes not just the exploration of space but the partnership and the friendship between the United States and Japan doing something in a peaceful way.\nWhen I think about back in May when the President was in Japan and launched the idea that we would have an incredible space partnership between Japan and the United States \u2013 he did it at the Kantei, pledged that there would be a Japanese astronaut as part of Artemis to go to the moon.\u00a0 A few months later, we signed the Gateway Agreement.\u00a0 A few months later, we signed this agreement, the Framework Agreement that initiates and lays out the roadmap for the next 10 years.\u00a0 And then in a couple of weeks we\u2019ll have Administrator Nelson in Japan.\u00a0 It\u2019s been quite a busy and active but productive nine months in the relationship.\nAnd I don\u2019t know about the rest of you \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m a little cynical \u2013 but when you see the pictures from the Webb program, if you had to close your mind eye and think, \u201cWhat does the heavens looks like?\u201d, those are the photos.\u00a0 It\u2019s the barrier of what \u2013 the sublime and the beginnings of what science looks like, and it captures the imagination.\u00a0 So whether it\u2019s a child from Tokyo or Topeka, a child from Chicago or Chiba, or a child from New Orleans or Nagoya \u2013 I just wanted to prove that I knew the cities of Japan \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and the United States \u2013 I\u2019m sure a lot of you didn\u2019t think I knew a city outside of Chicago.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR NELSON:\u00a0 But you included \u2014\nAMBASSADOR EMANUEL:\u00a0 Yeah, yeah, but I left everything out of Florida, just for the record.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nYou want them to feel a part of what we\u2019re exploring rather than apart from what we\u2019re exploring.\u00a0 Today is the beginning of another day, a different future, one of peace, one of prosperity, and one of partnership.\u00a0 This is a new beginning.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0 Thank you, Ambassador.\u00a0 Today you\u2019ve witnessed a bit of history with the signing of this latest agreement between our two nations.\u00a0 Thank you and\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to all of those who have worked so hard to make this agreement a reality, and thank you to our participants and guests.\u00a0 I hope you have a great day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n[i] \u2026Administrator [back to i]\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Very good to see you all.\u00a0 And let me say first, Secretary Austin and I just concluded a very productive and wide-ranging discussion with our colleagues \u2013 Foreign Minister Hayashi, Defense Minister Hamada \u2013 and this of course is ahead of President Biden hosting Prime Minister Kishida at the White House on Friday.\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of the U.S.-Japan Alliance.\u00a0 For more than seven decades, it\u2019s been the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 ensuring the security, the liberty, the prosperity of our people and people across the region.\nOne of the Alliance\u2019s enduring sources of strength is our ability to adapt it to meet the evolving challenges as well as the opportunities before us.\nJapan\u2019s new national security strategy, national defense strategy, and defense buildup program reflect the scale and scope of that transformation.\nThese new strategies make clear Japan\u2019s commitment to invest in enhancing its capabilities, to take on new roles, and foster even closer defense cooperation with the United States and our mutual partners.\u00a0 We applaud Japan\u2019s pledge to double defense spending by 2027.\nJapan\u2019s strategies align closely with our own National Security Strategy \u2013 both in the key challenges we identify as well as in how to effectively address them.\nWe\u2019re committed to upholding shared values of democracy and human rights, defending the international rule of law, continuing to lead the world in tackling global challenges that no one country can solve alone, like the climate crisis and deadly viruses.\nWe agree that the PRC is the greatest shared strategic challenge that we and our allies and partners face.\nWe stand together with Ukraine against President Putin\u2019s war, which threatens the principles at the heart of the international rules-based order \u2013 including that all nations should be able to chart their own path, and have their sovereignty, their independence, their territorial integrity respected.\nIn the face of these and other challenges, today we discussed ways to deepen our coordination, including on allied command and control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, joint and shared usage of facilities, and increased bilateral exercises.\nMore than ever before, we\u2019re buttressing the U.S.-Japan Alliance through deeper cooperation with other allies and partners, through both regional and multilateral bodies.\nIn the face of the DPRK\u2019s unlawful and reckless missile launches \u2013 including the launch of a long-range ballistic missile over Japan in October \u2013 we\u2019re deepening our trilateral cooperation with the Republic of Korea to deter and, if necessary, defend against aggression.\u00a0 That\u2019s a pledge the leaders of our three countries underscored in their November trilateral summit.\nToday we held our first formal dialogue in this 2+2 format on extended deterrence \u2013 namely, to enhance the capability and credibility of our allied defense against a wide range of threats.\nIn June of 2022, Prime Minister Kishida became the first Japanese leader to attend a NATO summit.\u00a0 Japan is spearheading the NATO Asia Pacific partners\u2019 group \u2013 demonstrating the growing synergy between our Atlantic and Pacific alliances.\nWe\u2019re working together with our G7 partners to impose coordinated sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, and to help Ukraine repair, restore, and defend its embattled energy grid.\u00a0 We look forward to Japan\u2019s leadership in driving an ambitious agenda on these and other priorities during its presidency of the G7 this year, culminating in the Hiroshima Summit.\nJapan has also stepped up to help our European friends diversify their LNG supply in response to President Putin\u2019s weaponization of energy.\nWe\u2019re working to advance peace and security through regional bodies like ASEAN, whose centrality is vital to the Indo-Pacific; and through the Quad, including by working with India and Australia to expand what we call maritime domain awareness, basically giving our partners a better ability to detect and respond to challenges in their territorial waters like illegal fishing, trafficking, climate-related disasters.\nAt the United Nations, we\u2019re rallying member states to defend the rights at the core of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 It\u2019s been less than two weeks since Japan took its non-permanent seat at the Security Council; already we see its leadership on key priorities, like peacebuilding, Afghanistan, and the ministerial that the foreign minister will chair tomorrow on the rule of law.\nAnd because our National Security Strategy is so bound up in our economic and energy security, we\u2019re strengthening our cooperation in these spheres as well.\u00a0 In May we joined a dozen other economies that represent 40 percent of global GDP to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which sets out a roadmap to help our economies grow faster and fairer, so that all of our people can reach their full potential.\nLast month we kicked off the first Japan-U.S. Energy Security Dialogue; tomorrow our governments will co-host the Fifth Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Tokyo.\nWe\u2019re constantly expanding the horizons of our cooperation \u2013 beyond even our planet.\u00a0 Later this week, the foreign minister and I will sign a new agreement on U.S.-Japan cooperation in space.\u00a0 This agreement has been a decade in the making; it covers everything from joint research to working together to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon.\nThe bottom line is this: We and our people are always stronger and more secure together.\u00a0 Today we\u2019ve taken yet another step toward tightening already incredibly strong bonds.\nWith that, Yogi, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, Minister Hamada, and I have just come out of the Japan-U.S. 2+2 meeting, which we had in person, where we engaged in extremely meaningful exchange of views.\u00a0 During the past year since the previous 2+2 meeting, Russia\u2019s aggression of Ukraine, an event that shakes the foundation of international order, occurred, placing the international community at historical crossroads.\u00a0 In the midst of elevated severity in the security environment, today\u2019s Japan-U.S. 2+2 took place at a timing shortly after the release of strategic documents by both countries.\nToday\u2019s meeting delivered three major outcomes, and let me go through them one by one.\nFirst, based on the strategic documents of our two countries, we were able to hold in-depth discussions to confirm the alignment of the recognition on both sides over the regional strategic environment thoroughly and in detail.\u00a0 Specifically, first of all on China, China presents an unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge.\u00a0 Its foreign policy to recreate international order to serve its self-interest is a grave concern for the Japan-U.S. Alliance and for the whole of the international community.\nUpon confirming such shared recognition, we confirmed that Japan and the U.S. will continue to be united in raising objections against China\u2019s attempts to change status quo in the East China Sea, including its behavior that seeks to undermine long years of administration by Japan of the Senkaku Islands.\nWe also confirmed our strong opposition against unlawful claims and coercive and provocative efforts and actions by China in the South China Sea.\u00a0 We reaffirmed that the basic positions of our two countries over Taiwan remains unchanged, and confirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits, which is an essential element for the safety and prosperity of the international community.\u00a0 At the same time, we concurred that there have not been any changes to our policies to strengthen communication with China, including in the area of security.\nOn Russia, we reaffirmed our notion that aggression of Ukraine shakes the foundation of international order; accused Russia for its reckless nuclear rhetoric and attacks against civilian infrastructure; and concurred to continue our strong support to Ukraine.\u00a0 In addition, we shared our concern over the enhanced military cooperation between China and Russia.\nFurther, on North Korea, we strongly accused them for the launch of ballistic missiles during the past year at unprecedented frequency, and reaffirmed our unwavering commitment towards the complete denuclearization of North Korea based on UN Security Council resolutions.\nWith our positions perfectly aligned, we agreed to continue to work closely together in responding to the North Korea issue, including the pursuit of immediate resolution of the abduction issue.\u00a0 And we agreed about deepening the trilateral cooperation between the three countries.\nSecondly, we affirmed the further endeavors to bolster the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance in view of the new strategies based on the increasingly severe security environment.\u00a0 I welcomed the U.S. resolve to optimize the force posture in the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, and we decided to continue close consultation how to further optimize the U.S. force posture in Japan, including the readjustment of the USFJ realignment announced this time.\nExtended deterrence was one of the agenda, and there was in-depth discussions at the ministerial level.\u00a0 Spending some time having discussed that, we reaffirmed the strong U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan, underpinned by the full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear.\u00a0 Furthermore, there was an affirmation of strong support by the U.S. on the new security policy of Japan in that it will fundamentally reinforce the deterrence capability of the Alliance.\nIn addition, we agreed on the importance of deepening our cooperation in the areas of space and cyber, the promotion of technological cooperation, the further strengthening of information security.\u00a0 The fact that we were able to agree on the announcement of the applicability of Article\u00a0V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty on attacks on others in outer space was a significant achievement in terms of the reinforcement of deterrence capability of the Alliance as a whole.\nThirdly, we once again affirmed the importance of the reduction of the impact on the local communities, including Okinawa.\u00a0 We also reaffirmed that in order to avoid the continued use of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, the relocation to Henoko is the only solution.\nFurthermore, I once again requested the U.S. side on safe operations with utmost consideration to the impact on the local communities; appropriate responses to incidents and accidents, including sharing information in a timely manner; and on environmental issues, and confirmed our close coordination.\nThe joint announcement \u2013 the joint statement issued as a result of this 2+2 is a presentation of the vision of a modernized Alliance (inaudible) posture to win in the new era of strategic competition.\u00a0 The vision will be executed speedily, and together with Minister Hamada, Secretary Blinken, and Secretary Austin, we will constantly bolster the Japan-U.S. Alliance.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks to everyone for being here.\u00a0 At the outset, let me thank my friend and colleague, Secretary Blinken, for hosting today\u2019s U.S.-Japan 2+2 Ministerial Meeting.\u00a0 Thanks, Tony.\nMinister Hamada, Minister Hayashi, I want to underscore my support for the bold decisions that Japan has made in your 2022 national security strategy, your national defense strategy, and your defense buildup program.\u00a0 There is clear strategic alignment between the visions of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida.\u00a0 It is a shared commitment to uphold the rules-based international order and to strengthen resilient partnerships around the globe.\u00a0 And the essential U.S.-Japan Alliance is at the center of these efforts.\u00a0 Our respective defense strategies provide a strong foundation for our ongoing work to modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance.\u00a0 In addition, Japan\u2019s commitments to substantially increase its defense spending and to invest in defense institutions and infrastructure and capabilities will accelerate our Alliance\u2019s efforts.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019re meeting at such a consequential time, as Japan strengthens its own defense and further contributes to regional peace and stability.\nToday we welcomed an historic Alliance decision to optimize U.S. force posture in Japan by forward stationing more versatile, mobile, and resilient capabilities.\u00a0 These actions will bolster deterrence in the region and allow us to defend Japan and its people more effectively.\u00a0 In an increase \u2013 in an increasingly challenging security environment, we\u2019ve decided that the 12th Artillery Regiment would remain in Japan and be reorganized into the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment by 2025.\u00a0 We will equip this new formation with advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as anti-ship and transportation capabilities that are relevant to the current and future threat environments.\u00a0 These posture updates adhere to the basic tenets of the 2012 realignment plan, and they will strengthen our Alliance\u2019s ability to maintain regional peace and stability.\nWe also discussed updating our Alliance\u2019s roles and missions so that Japan can more actively contribute to regional security alongside the United States and other likeminded partners.\u00a0 And so in our meeting today we strongly endorsed Japan\u2019s decision to acquire a counterstrike capability, and we affirmed that close coordination on employing this capability will strengthen the U.S.-Japan Alliance.\u00a0 We also discussed a number of key issues including our shared interest in peace and stability in the East and South China Seas and around Taiwan and our commitment to \u2013 to the denuclearization of North Korea, and our efforts to increase multilateral cooperation with the Republic of Korea, Australia, and other likeminded partners and our growing cooperation across all domains, including space and cyber.\nNow, as you\u2019ve heard me say before, the People\u2019s Republic of China is a pacing challenge for the Department of Defense.\u00a0 Japan and the United States remain united in our concern over China\u2019s destabilizing actions, and I want to reaffirm the United States ironclad commitment to defend Japan with the full range of capabilities, including nuclear, and underscore that Article V of the mutual security treaty applies to the Senkaku Islands.\u00a0 And tomorrow Minister Hamada and I will sign new arrangements that will increase opportunities for the Japanese and the United States defense enterprises to closely cooperate on advanced technologies as well as increased linkages between our respective industrial bases.\u00a0 And our close consultations today have advanced our Alliance\u2019s efforts to address common challenges ahead of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s meeting at the White House this week.\nI\u2019ll close by reiterating that the U.S.-Japan Alliance remains a cornerstone of our Indo-Pacific strategy, and it\u2019s critical to upholding a free and open regional order.\u00a0 Our Alliance is stronger than ever, building on a foundation of teamwork, trust, and shared values that has underpinned our relationship for decades.\u00a0 And so there is no challenge that we can overcome if we continue to work shoulder to shoulder.\u00a0 Thank you.\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) At the outset, I extend my deepest appreciation to Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, and members of the U.S. side for having organized this meeting.\u00a0 My three colleagues have already mentioned the severity of the security environment surrounding us.\u00a0 As we live in this age of intense competition, in order to sustain a new rules-based international order and free and open Indo-Pacific, the role that the Japan-U.S. Alliance must play has never been so enormous.\u00a0 The national security and defense strategies of our two countries that have been prepared most recently are highly consistent at a degree never seen before and will serve as a strong infrastructure for our bilateral cooperation.\nWhat is noteworthy is the importance attached to the \u2013 attached by both countries to integrate all means and approaches to deter a situation from occurring.\u00a0 Alignment of our positions as such has been significant.\u00a0 At the same time, strategies don\u2019t end by just preparing them.\u00a0 In light of the severity of the security environment, both Japan and the U.S. is expected to put their strategies into action swiftly and steadily.\nBased on the new strategy, in order to expeditiously achieve the fundamental reinforcement of Japan\u2019s defense capabilities, I am committed to making maximum efforts to gain new capabilities, including counterstrike capability and to enhanced persistent warfare capability.\u00a0 I am much encouraged by the strong support shown by Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken as I shared with them such resolve.\u00a0 Japan and the U.S. must properly engage in discussions on strengthening partnership.\nDuring today\u2019s consultations, we agreed on the need to realize division of roles and missions assuming the fundamental reinforcement of Japan\u2019s defense capabilities.\u00a0 The four of us agreed to promote initiatives in extensive areas, including effective operation of counterstrike capability based on bilateral cooperation, strengthening collaboration in space and cyber, and deepening cooperation in equipment and technology.\nWe also agreed to deepen cooperation with partners, including Australia, ROK, ASEAN, and Europe, to expand partnership and based on our Alliance, because in the increasingly important extended deterrence in the region, I have listened to the extensive viewpoints of the U.S. from Secretary Austin.\u00a0 Based on that, in order for the U.S. extended deterrence to be even more reliable and resilient, we discussed what the two countries need to do in order to optimize the U.S. force posture in Japan.\u00a0 The current realignment plan was coordinated in 2012, but in order to deal with the increasingly severe security environment, both Japan and the U.S. have decided to readjust the plan while maintaining the fundamental principles.\nKeeping the 3rd Marines Division command and the 12th Marines Littoral Regiment in Okinawa will allow the forward-deployed U.S. force posture to have more versatile capabilities, be more resilient and more mobile.\u00a0 This effort will significantly strengthen the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and at the same time it will demonstrate the robust commitment of the U.S. to the defense of Japan.\u00a0 In order to execute these plans, we will coordinate closely with the U.S. side.\nI also mentioned that for the stable stationing and activities of USFJ, the understanding by the local community such as Okinawa is crucial.\u00a0 We will continue to work on the reduction of impact on Okinawa.\u00a0 It was extremely significant that, at a timing so soon after the two countries had formulated the strategic documents that will guide the future national security and defense policies, that the four ministers responsible for defense and foreign policy got together and had the opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions on how to implement their respective strategy.\u00a0 I shall continue the discussions in order to bolster our Alliance.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We will alternate questions per side.\u00a0 We will start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi there.\u00a0 Good evening.\u00a0 Thanks for this.\u00a0 Can I follow up on a couple of things that you just announced?\u00a0 Speaking about the Marine littoral regiment, both of the defense \u2013 both the Defense Secretary and defense minister spoke of the increasing \u2013 the increasingly challenging security environment.\u00a0 Can you be more specific in what you\u2019re responding to?\u00a0 Is this specifically China?\u00a0 Is these \u2013 are these contingencies in Taiwan or potentially in the Senkaku Islands, North Korea?\u00a0 And also you mentioned the impact in Okinawa.\u00a0 Is there any concern that this could aggravate tensions locally in Okinawa?\u00a0 Will this result in a net increase in the forces there?\u00a0 And if you don\u2019t mind, could I also ask about space?\u00a0 There have been some reports that space will now be included as part of the defense partnership.\u00a0 Could you comment on that?\nAnd for \u2013 on the American side, if you don\u2019t mind \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind a couple of questions that are a little bit off topic.\u00a0 To Secretary Austin, the situation in Ukraine \u2013 Soledar.\u00a0 There have been lots of reports the Wagner Group has claimed to control it, and there\u2019s been another shake-up in the Russian military command.\u00a0 What do you make of this?\u00a0 Do you think that it\u2019s fallen?\u00a0 What significance do you see?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, a couple of days ago \u2013 you were just in Latin America yesterday, but a couple of days ago in Brazil there was, of course, the unrest.\u00a0 Former President Bolsonaro remains in the United States.\u00a0 There have been some calls from the Democratic Party to make a persona non grata.\u00a0 How tenable is it to \u2013 for him to stay in Florida despite what happened a couple of days ago in Brasilia?\u00a0 Thanks very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 You want to start?\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0So I lost count \u2013 I lost count on a number of questions, but we\u2019ll try to knock them down.\u00a0 If we miss one, then we\u2019ll double back.\nFirst, let me begin with the question you asked on Soledar and whether or not it\u2019s fallen to the Russians.\u00a0 At this point, we can\u2019t corroborate that reporting.\u00a0 Of course, I\u2019ve seen some of that reporting, but you know that this has been a very fluid, dynamic environment, dynamic fight in that area.\u00a0 It\u2019s gone back and forth a number of times, and it really is some pretty brutal fighting.\u00a0 But the Ukrainians have acquitted themselves very, very \u2013 in a very impressive fashion as a \u2013 they\u2019ve fought a very \u2013 continue to fight a very determined fight.\nWe are focused on doing everything we can to help make sure that the Ukrainians have the capabilities that they need to be successful in their efforts to defend their sovereign territory.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been \u2013 we talk \u2013 I talk to my counterpart routinely.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to conduct another Ukraine Contact Group \u2013 Defense Contact Group meeting next week in Germany, where we\u2019ll get another \u2013 we\u2019ll get 50 or so ministers of defense together to talk about what Ukraine\u2019s needs are now and what they need to be successful going forward.\nSo you\u2019ve heard us say over and over again that we\u2019re going to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, and from everything that I can see from our allies and partners, they feel the same way.\u00a0 So we remain united in our efforts.\nOn the Marine littoral regiment, we believe that this brings \u2013 this capability brings a tremendous capability to the Alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019re replacing an artillery regiment with an outfit that\u2019s more lethal, more agile, more capable.\u00a0 And as you have seen from what\u2019s been published on this particular formation, it consists of a combat element, which is a battalion-size element; a long-range fires element, which allows us to \u2013 gives us an anti-ship capability, which I think is very, very important; and also a logistical element that helps sustain the overall regiment there.\nSo I think this is going to contribute in a major way in our efforts to help defend Japan, and also promote a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And that\u2019s really our focus.\u00a0 Japan \u2013 we share a common vision with Japan to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, and all the things that we\u2019re doing points towards that direction.\nSo I\u2019m going to stop there and allow Minister Hamada to comment, if you\u2019d like.\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding the current topic, our position is, in Okinawa, that there are realignment in many other comments referred to.\u00a0 With regard to these aspects, we understand \u2013 and together with the U.S. forces, including the coordination, our discussion will have to take place.\u00a0 But at any rate, regarding the matters in Okinawa, that there is the relationship with the local communities, and we will have to continue our effort to explain in order to overcome these challenges.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Shaun, just to respond, I think, to a couple of other questions you asked.\u00a0 First, in terms of the security environment that we\u2019re dealing with, there\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s no secret that it is a more challenging one, and we see different challenges to the status quo coming from different countries \u2013 including China, including the DPRK, including of course Russia.\u00a0 Even though that aggression against Ukraine is happening in Europe, it has profound implications for countries around the world, including in Asia \u2013 because this is not only a challenge to Ukraine and the lives and livelihoods of its people, it\u2019s a challenge to the entire international rules-based order and the very principles that underlie that order that are so important in every part of the world: sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, the right to shape your own future.\u00a0 That\u2019s why Japan, from day one, has been such a strong partner with us and many other countries in seeking to uphold that order, whether it comes to Russia\u2019s aggression or in any other areas.\nYou asked about our cooperation in space.\u00a0 Well, there\u2019s cooperation in cyberspace and there\u2019s cooperation in outer space.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be putting out a statement, if it\u2019s not already out, that reflects the additional steps that we\u2019ve taken.\u00a0 But this is very significant.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to deepen our cooperation across every realm \u2013 land, sea, air, and yes, space, cyber and outer.\nThe outer space component of this is important to the security and prosperity of our Alliance.\u00a0 We agreed, as you\u2019ve heard, that attacks to, from, or within space present a clear challenge, and we affirmed that depending on the nature of those attacks, this could lead to the invocation of Article\u00a0V of our Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.\u00a0 That is significant.\u00a0 We\u2019ll sign, as I mentioned, a space agreement a little bit later this week at NASA.\nOn cyber, we have emphasized the foundational importance of cyber security and information security for our Alliance.\u00a0 We agreed there as well to deepen our collaboration.\u00a0 This is a challenge that we both face, other countries face; it\u2019s important that we work on it together.\u00a0 We\u2019re all learning lessons in dealing with the challenges that come in cyberspace.\u00a0 Being able to share best practices, being able to support one another, is more important than ever.\nWe\u2019re also committed in that light to bolstering technology cooperation as well as making joint investments in emerging technologies to try to further sharpen the competitive edge of the Alliance.\nLast question, as I heard it, with regard to Brazil.\u00a0 As President Biden told President Lula, we stand with the people of Brazil.\u00a0 We stand with Brazil\u2019s democracy and its institutions.\u00a0 The President will have an opportunity to confer directly and closely with President Lula when he visits Washington in early February, and the President looks very much forward to that.\nPresident Lula has called for an investigation of the events of January 8th.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to get ahead of that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not received any specific requests from Brazilian authorities.\u00a0 Of course, if and when we do, we\u2019ll work expeditiously to respond, as we always do.\nAnd then with regard to individuals, we\u2019re talking now about people who are private citizens.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard various public statements that have been made by those individuals about their plans, but we really don\u2019t have anything to add, and it\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment on any individual\u2019s visa status.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Next, from the Japanese press, Miki-san of\u00a0Nikkei\u00a0newspaper company.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) My name is Miki of\u00a0Nihon Keizai Shimbun\u00a0company.\u00a0 I have a question to both foreign and defense ministers of Japan and the United States.\u00a0 In East Asia, there are concerns of unilateral change of status quo by force, and there are those who point out the Taiwan contingency risk.\u00a0 You\u2019ve mentioned the southwest defense bolstering, but what agreement have you reached in the 2+2 to upgrade the response and deterrence capability?\u00a0 And how will you go about in terms of integrated operations between SDF and U.S. forces?\nAnd in the renewed national security strategies, both countries positioned China as being a challenge for the international community.\u00a0 How do you assess the risk in terms of security by China in East Asia, and how will you respond?\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) First of all, on Nansei Islands, with severity of the security environment surrounding Japan increasing, in order to reinforce the defense of our nation, including the Nansei Islands, strengthening the deterrence and response capabilities of our Alliance is an urgent mission.\u00a0 At today\u2019s 2+2, we concurred on the decisive importance of joint initiatives at peacetime to deter armed attack against \u2013 and attacks that undermine regional stability.\nBased on such shared recognition, the joint statement issued today refers to concrete initiatives \u2013 for example, in the area including the Nansei Islands, joint use of Japan-U.S. facilities will be expanded and joint exercises and training will be increased.\nOn Taiwan, I refrain from responding to a hypothetical question on contingency in Taiwan.\u00a0 It has been the consistent policy of Japan that peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is important not only for Japan\u2019s security, but also for the stability of the international community at large, and that we hope to see Taiwan-related issues be resolved peacefully through dialogue.\nNow, on China, as explicitly mentioned in the new national security strategy, present external posture and military orientation of China are grave concerns for Japan and the international community.\u00a0 As we strive to secure peace and stability of Japan and the international community and strengthen international order based on rule of law, China presents an unprecedented and the greatest challenge.\u00a0 At the same time, Japan and China both bear important responsibility for regional and global peace and prosperity.\u00a0 Establishment of a constructive and stable relationship by Japan and China is essential for peace and stability of the international community, including the Indo-Pacific.\nDefense Minister?\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Yes.\u00a0 As mentioned by Minister Hayashi, that is our position.\u00a0 Based upon the mutual recognition of Japan and the United States in the area including Nansei Islands, we will expand the joint use of facilities of Japan and the United States, and we\u2019ve committed to increase joint exercises and joint trainings.\u00a0 In such form, we will upgrade the deterrence and response capabilities of our Alliance, which is necessary, and we will continue to work in close coordination with the United States following today\u2019s meeting.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I have little to add because my colleagues have covered it so well.\u00a0 Suffice to say that first, we are united in ways that, at least in my experience over the last 30 years, we\u2019ve never been before.\u00a0 There\u2019s greater convergence in our approach, greater alignment in our approach \u2013 both in terms of the way we see the challenges and how we propose to respond to them \u2013 than ever before.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s very significant, and you\u2019ve heard both ministers speak to it.\u00a0 The statements that we\u2019re putting out \u2013 or we\u2019ve already put out this afternoon \u2013 will reflect in detail that alignment, that convergence between Japan and the United States.\nWhen it comes to Taiwan, I think it\u2019s very important to note that what we\u2019ve seen from China in recent years \u2013 not recent months, recent years \u2013 is, unfortunately, an effort to undermine the longstanding status quo, a status quo that\u2019s maintain peace and stability for decades.\u00a0 We, on the other hand, want to sustain that status quo; we want to bolster it.\u00a0 We oppose any unilateral change to the status quo by either side.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue for a calm, resolute approach to uphold peace and stability.\u00a0 Japan in the United States are united in that effort.\nAs you\u2019ve heard us say, our Alliance is a cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And the steps that we announced today will strengthen the Alliance\u2019s ability to uphold the rules-based order that we are both very much committed to.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0I think that my colleagues have \u2013 did a \u2013 have done a tremendous job of outlining the key points here, and so I won\u2019t plow that ground again.\u00a0 But I would just say that we really do remain committed to enhancing resiliency and interoperability between U.S. and Japanese forces and deepening the operational cooperation.\u00a0 So the things that we touched upon today, especially the agreement to increase bilateral exercises and training, I think are a real powerful statement of that commitment.\u00a0 So I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on these issues going forward.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Our next question goes to Ryo Kiyomiya from\u00a0Asahi Shimbun.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much.\u00a0 I\u2019m Ryo Kiyomiya from\u00a0Asahi Shimbun, Washington, D.C. bureau.\u00a0 I have questions for each of you.\u00a0 First, Secretary Austin, while U.S. and Japan share the concern about the \u2013 China\u2019s military aggression, how can the U.S. manage the relationship with China and avoid miscalculation leading to the contingencies?\u00a0 And last October you said that you don\u2019t see an imminent invasion of Taiwan by China.\u00a0 Do you still hold that view?\nAnd also, if I may, Japan decided to establish our self-defense force joint headquarter.\u00a0 From your perspective, what would be the ideal Alliance command and control relationship between U.S. and Japan to enhance interoperability and readiness?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, regarding U.S.-China relations, how do you plan to manage and build the relationship with China during your upcoming engagement with China?\u00a0 And also, what kind of role do you expect Japan to play in diplomacy to manage this relationship?\nAnd finally, to Minister Hamada and Minister Hayashi, there is a growing sense of risk about China\u2019s invasion of Taiwan.\u00a0 In the previous 2+2 meeting, U.S. and Japan welcomed the robust progress on bilateral planning for contingencies.\u00a0 How would you evaluate the current progress on bilateral planning for contingencies so far with the U.S.?\u00a0 Also, from the perspective of deterring China\u2019s aggression, how do you evaluate the recent U.S. announcement of reorganization of Marines in Okinawa into the Marine littoral regiment?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0Okay, thank you.\u00a0 I think your first question was: how do we avoid miscalculation?\u00a0 You\u2019ve heard me say a number of times that it\u2019s absolutely critical that leaders of great powers maintain open lines of communication and be able to talk with each other.\u00a0 In that way, we can avoid miscalculation wherever possible.\u00a0 And you see us continuing to try to ensure that we keep those lines open, and I would invite my colleagues in China to meet us halfway there and work hard to keep those lines of communication open.\u00a0 And that is the primary and best way to avoid that miscalculation.\u00a0 Of course, I believe that our forces are trained and disciplined, and to the degree that they\u2019re going to do everything within their power to avoid any kind of misunderstanding or miscalculation.\u00a0 But again, that dialogue is enormously important.\nSo \u2013 and then your second question was regarding whether or not China is \u2013 whether or not an invasion of Taiwan by China is imminent.\u00a0 I won\u2019t second-guess Mr. Xi, but what I will tell you, what we\u2019re seeing recently, is some very provocative behavior on the part of China\u2019s forces and their attempt to re-establish a new normal.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve seen increased activity in \u2013 aerial activity in the straits.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen increased surface vessel activity around Taiwan.\u00a0 And again, we believe that they endeavor to establish a new normal, but whether or not that means that an invasion is imminent, I seriously doubt that.\nSo we will continue to watch and we will continue to work with our allies and partners to do everything that we can to ensure that we promote peace and stability in the strait and in the region overall.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And just quickly to \u2013 more broadly to add to that on China, as you know, President Biden, President Xi had a very open, candid conversation during the last G20 meeting in Bali, and they spoke about our intentions.\u00a0 President Biden shared our intentions and our priorities, and we got some sense of that from President Xi as well.\u00a0 As the Secretary of Defense just said, these lines of communication, starting with the presidents but also including many of us, are vitally important \u2013 vitally important to keep open and, I would hope, to deepen, because, as the Secretary of Defense said, what we don\u2019t want is for any misunderstanding to veer into conflict.\nI will have an opportunity to travel to China in the coming weeks to follow up on the President\u2019s discussions precisely to move forward on those lines of communication between us.\u00a0 We \u2013 both of our countries, Japan and the United States \u2013 have complex and consequential relationships with China, and there are clearly aspects of intense competition between us.\u00a0 There are aspects as well of cooperation, and it\u2019s important to see if we can pursue those.\u00a0 We hear from countries around the world the desire for the United States, China, Japan to manage this relationship responsibly and, if there are areas where we can cooperate that would be to the benefit not only of our own people but of people around the world, whether it\u2019s in climate, whether it\u2019s in global health, whether it\u2019s in dealing with drugs, we should pursue them.\nBut we are going to compete vigorously.\u00a0 The President\u2019s been very clear about that.\u00a0 We\u2019re not looking for conflict.\u00a0 We\u2019ll manage the competition responsibly, but we will compete vigorously.\u00a0 And we will seek to keep these lines of communication open and do all that we can to establish guardrails to prevent competition, as I said, from veering into conflict.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) First of all, U.S.\u2019s commitment and optimization of the posture in the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, is very much welcome.\u00a0 And including the recoordination of the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in order to optimize posture of USFJ, we decided to continue our close consultations.\u00a0 And this may not be a direct response to your question \u2013 I may have misunderstood your question \u2013 but if your question is implying on guideline, there was no discussion over U.S.-Japan guidelines.\u00a0 Regarding the necessity of review of the Japan-U.S. guidelines, of course, it is being constantly studied.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t assume that it will be immediately necessary.\u00a0 Thank you.\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) On the U.S.-Japan bilateral planning, in 2015, based upon the guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation, the Japan-U.S. governments are to prepare and renew bilateral planning.\u00a0 And we very much welcomed the steadfast progress of this task.\u00a0 And in order to respond to the very severe security environment in Japan, by maintaining the remaining Marine Corps in Okinawa after the realignment decision was made to keep the 3rd Division of the Marine Corps and the 12th Regiment of the Marine Corps and agreed to realign into MLR by 2025, we believe that this will bolster the USFJ posture in Japan.\u00a0 And this also is a demonstration of the unwavering commitment of the United States towards the defense of Japan.\u00a0 And together with the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities of Japan, this will significantly elevate the deterrence and response capabilities of our Alliance against attacks \u2013 armed attacks \u2013 to Japan.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) This will be the last question.\u00a0 Tajima-san,\u00a0Asahi Shimbun\u00a0newspaper.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Tajima,\u00a0Asahi Shimbun.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 During this meeting, I believe the new national security strategy and the new defense strategy were the main topics, so I asked Minister Hayashi and Minister Hamada \u2013 so the reinforcement of defense, including counterstrike capability and the meaning and the goal of significant increase of defense expense, how did you explain to the U.S. side, please?\nAnd then, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin, if I may, the strengthening of Japan\u2019s defense capability, what is your assessment?\u00a0 And the new strategies of both countries have been evidence coming forward \u2013 the deterrence and the response capability of the two countries.\u00a0 How do you intend to elevate?\u00a0 Earlier Minister Hayashi referred to the guideline, about the possibility of the need to revise the guideline.\u00a0 What is your view?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Please allow me to start.\u00a0 At the 2+2 today, the \u2013 based on the new strategy, we affirmed the future activities in order to bolster the defense response capabilities of the Alliance under the new strategy in light of the increasingly severe security environment.\u00a0 I mentioned that the fundamental reinforcement of Japan\u2019s defense capability will lead to further effective exercise of U.S. capabilities, and that in turn would mean a further reinforcement of the deterrence response capabilities of the bilateral Alliance and would play a huge role for the peace and stability of the region.\u00a0 The U.S. in response expressed firm support.\nAs I mentioned earlier, as a result of the 2+2, the joint statement to be released, this presents a vision of the Alliance in the new era of strategic competition.\u00a0 The plans will be implemented speedily, and together with Minister Hamada, Secretary Blinken, and Secretary Austin, we will constantly bolster the bilateral Alliance.\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) If I may, regarding the fundamental reinforcement of Japan\u2019s defense in order to speedily realize about the significant increased defense, we will acquire new capabilities, including war sustainability and counterstrike capability, and I expressed my very strong commitment.\u00a0 As Minister Hayashi just mentioned, the U.S. side mentioned that they will strongly support Japan\u2019s new strategy, that it is a major evolution of the bilateral Alliance.\nBased on today\u2019s discussion, in this most severe and complex security environment after the war, we will fundamentally reinforce the defense capability, including the counterstrike capability.\u00a0 And together, in order to make the U.S. Alliance be a contribution to peace, stability, and prosperity of the region and the world, we will continue to work with Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, and Minister Hayashi to strengthen the Alliance.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you for the question.\u00a0 It\u2019s very simple:\u00a0 We heartily welcome the new strategies, especially because there is, as I said and we\u2019ve all said, remarkable convergence between our strategy \u2013 strategies \u2013 and Japan\u2019s.\u00a0 We applaud the commitment to increased investment; to enhanced roles, missions, and capabilities that you\u2019ve heard; to closer cooperation not only between the United States and Japan, but as well with other allies and other partners on a bilateral basis but also on a trilateral and multilateral basis.\u00a0 We already have a strong foundation.\u00a0 That\u2019s only going to grow.\nAs we read them, these new documents really reshape the Alliance\u2019s ability to promote peace and protect the rules-based order in the region but also beyond, around the world.\u00a0 I think what you\u2019re seeing in real time is an Alliance that is modernizing, and the United States and Japan are working in lock step to be prepared for the emerging challenges in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.\nSo we could not be more pleased with the work that we\u2019re doing together, but also, and I have to say for Japan\u2019s extraordinary leadership, I know President Biden will have an opportunity to share that appreciation with Prime Minister Kishida when he welcomes him here to Washington later this week.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 I certainly agree with Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 There is clear strategic alignment between the visions of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida.\u00a0 You see that reflected in the strategies as you put them side by side.\u00a0 We are all focused on maintaining a rules-based international order and promoting peace and stability in the region.\nSo what you\u2019ve heard us talk about today \u2013 the things that we discussed in the meeting \u2013 really bring that strategy to life.\u00a0 Optimizing force posture, agreeing to increase our bilateral exercises and training events \u2013 all of those things are real good indicators that all of us are committed to making sure that, as Prime Minister Hamada has said previously, we don\u2019t just write strategies, we do the things necessary to be able to execute them.\u00a0 And this is work that\u2019s never finished, okay, so we will continue to work to optimize force posture and increase interoperability so that we maintain a credible deterrent force.\u00a0 And I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to do that, what I would call hard government work.\u00a0 But thank you very much.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 That concludes the press conference.\n# # #\n\n",

Affairs of Canada M\u00e9lanie Joly.\n(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) M\u00e9lanie Joly.\u00a0 We are thankful for the presence of Marcelo Ebrard\u00a0Casaub\u00f3n, minister to foreign affairs in Mexico,\u00a0and most especially, the attendance of the negotiators of this very important declaration that is the decisive action of these three countries to go forward to promote \u2013 in promoting the anti-racism, inclusive, and equal societies, most especially democratic societies.\u00a0 And so let us listen to the message of Madam Minister of Foreign Affairs from Canada M\u00e9lanie Joly.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for this kind presentation.\nThank you so much for being with us today and thank you for addressing these important topics on inclusivity, inclusion (inaudible).\n(In English) Everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, no matter their race, religion, gender identity, or orientation.\u00a0 As leaders from Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, we have a responsibility to combat discrimination and hate in all its forms.\u00a0 Today we are committing to doing just that.\u00a0 By signing the declaration for racial equity and inclusion, we are pledging to uproot deep and longstanding inequalities.\u00a0 We know we can\u2019t change the past, but we can work towards a more just and inclusive future.\nThis declaration is a historic step in our work to eradicate deep and \u2013 deep-seated injustice.\u00a0 Diversity is a fact, but inclusion is a choice.\u00a0 How we choose to incorporate the diversity of our communities can mean the difference between a stagnant and thriving country and continent.\u00a0 While we have certainly made progress, systemic racism and bigotry is still a daily reality for many.\u00a0 It\u2019s dehumanizing, humiliating, and above all else \u2013 above all else, unacceptable and it has no place in society.\nThat is why Canada has been taking action.\u00a0 As we are engaged on the path of reconciliation, we have continued to tackle systemic inequities and discrimination against indigenous peoples of Canada.\u00a0 We sat also down and listened to marginalized communities, incorporating their recommendations in the new Canadian anti-racism strategy.\nThe work to rid our societies of intolerance will not be easy, but it will be necessary.\u00a0 Canada is by no means immune to intolerance.\u00a0 Anti-indigenous, anti-black, anti-Asian, and anti-Semitic hate have sharply risen.\u00a0 Muslim communities in Canada have experienced several horrific, deadly Islamophobic attacks in recent years.\u00a0 That is why we must take further action.\u00a0 In our upcoming action on combating hate, we will address this head on.\n(Via interpreter) With both our friends, Mexico and the United States, Canada is committed to work together and to accept all people as they are without any violence, without any bias, and together.\u00a0 Together we will use our leadership and use our platforms to change our attitudes and behaviors.\nMerci.\u00a0 Gracias.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR VELASCO:\u00a0\u00a0Merci beaucoup, Madame Joly.\n(Via interpreter) And now, Secretary Blinken.\n(In English) Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Gracias,\u00a0Roberto, and\u00a0buenas noches a todos.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be here, to be here with some really extraordinary colleagues as well.\u00a0 I\u2019m really honored to be seated here with my friends Marcelo and M\u00e9lanie to sign what is an important declaration.\u00a0 And you heard M\u00e9lanie address it so eloquently. \u00a0It goes to a common ideal that is at the core of our democracies: that we\u2019re all better off when every individual in our societies enjoys equal rights and equal opportunities.\u00a0 And it reflects a fundamental recognition that if we want to improve the lives of our citizens, it\u2019s in our interest to ensure that all communities and individuals can reach their full potential \u2013 not just within our own countries, but across North America, across our hemisphere, across the world.\nLike everything that we\u2019re focused on at this summit, we\u2019re more effective at delivering on this goal when we work together.\u00a0 That is the entire premise of the North America Leaders\u2019 Summit.\u00a0 It\u2019s animating the work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 And the declaration that we\u2019re signing today sets out three ways that we\u2019re going to do that, so let me just briefly touch on them.\nFirst, the fight for greater equity and inclusion begins at home.\u00a0 It begins in Canada, it begins in Mexico, it begins in the United States.\u00a0 In every nation, members of marginalized groups face discrimination.\u00a0 They face barriers that prevent them from participating fully in society.\u00a0 It\u2019s a daily reality for people from indigenous communities and communities of African descent, women and girls, LGBTQI+ people, people with disabilities, religious minorities and others, including in the United States.\nWith this declaration, each of our nations acknowledges the responsibility to work with fierce urgency to knock down these enduring barriers and to try to stamp out the prejudice at their root.\nOn his very first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities through the federal government, bringing our entire government together in an effort to address these challenges.\nThe willingness of each of our three countries to acknowledge that we all have significant work to do to root out discrimination and inequity at home shows that we\u2019re willing to ask the same of ourselves as we\u2019re asking of others.\u00a0 And that\u2019s vital to our legitimacy when it comes to pursuing the declaration\u2019s second commitment: redoubling our collaboration to advance equity and racial justice around the world.\u00a0 The United States, Mexico, and Canada have long worked together on this goal. \u00a0It\u2019s at the heart of the commitment that our democracies made to uphold the Inter-American Democratic Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nAt the State Department we\u2019re committed to integrating this work across the entirety of our foreign policy.\u00a0 Last June, I had the opportunity to establish our first special representative for racial equity and justice, who is charged with advancing the human rights of people from historically marginalized racial and ethnic communities around the world, and I\u2019m very grateful to have our Special Representative Cormier Smith here with us today.\u00a0 Thank you for the work that you\u2019re doing every day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBy making this a priority across our bilateral relationships, our multilateral relationships, we know it\u2019s the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also the smart thing to do.\u00a0 It\u2019s in our interest because more equal countries tend to be more stable, they tend to be more secure, they tend to be more prosperous partners.\u00a0 That\u2019s good for the United States.\nThird, we\u2019re better at advancing equity and inclusion when we draw on the knowledge, on the expertise, on the experience of leaders outside of government.\u00a0 In that spirit, we\u2019re establishing a trilateral racial equity and inclusion expert network to share knowledge, to share best practices for advancing equity and racial justice.\nThat\u2019s just one way that we\u2019ll integrate our citizens into this effort.\u00a0 In April, the United States will host the first-ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver.\u00a0 Diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility will be a key part of the discussions that we hold there, ranging from strengthening public health and good governance to fostering innovation in clean energy transitions.\u00a0 And these discussions will incorporate not only local officials but also leaders from civil society, from the private sector, from youth groups, from academia.\nWe have a lot to learn from these groups.\u00a0 Just take a look at our history.\u00a0 So much of the progress we\u2019ve made as societies has actually been driven by our citizens.\u00a0 They put a spotlight on discrimination, on inequities.\u00a0 They\u2019ve led efforts that have inspired people not only in our own countries but across borders.\nThis is, simply put, one of our greatest strengths as democracies, that we trust our people.\u00a0 We trust our citizens to help fix some of our most intractable challenges; to be part of the ongoing process of, as we like to say in the United States, trying to form a more perfect union.\u00a0 That is at the heart of our national experience, of our national enterprise \u2013 this idea that it\u2019s in the work that we do every single day to make our societies a little bit better, a little bit stronger, a little bit more inclusive.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we make progress.\nIn this, as in so much of what we do, we\u2019re fortunate to have neighbors who share our highest ideals and a steadfast commitment to keep working to make them a reality.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pleasure to be with you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR VELASCO:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) and prior to giving the mike to Minister Ebrard, we recognize the attendance of the U.S. and Canada ambassadors, Mr. Clark \u2013 Graeme Clark \u2013 and the under secretaries Brian Nichols, David Morrison, and Michael Grant, who are here in attendance, as well as the Parliamentarian Secretary Sidhu and many high officers representing both countries.\u00a0 Minister, you have the floor.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you in three languages.\nIt is a pleasure to see you here and to greet you.\u00a0 The protocol we are about to sign today, we \u2013 the method is the other way around.\u00a0 First we\u00a0suggest an agreement and then each sees to it in their own countries, but this agreement came forth because we were at the same point exactly.\u00a0 Interesting \u2013 three countries thinking exactly the same way in regard to our internal policies.\u00a0 This is quite an opportunity and we are very lucky, because you don\u2019t have to start convincing anybody about what is it we have to do.\u00a0 Rather, we should start getting organized, which we are already doing.\nIn the case of Mexico, racism is something quite relevant.\u00a0 For a long time, nobody spoke about racism in Mexico.\u00a0 Many studies have been undertaken.\u00a0 This is a very important topic.\u00a0 We have visited our history in regard to slavery \u2013 nothing said in textbooks, at \u2013 in school about slavery in Mexico.\u00a0 So you say, \u201cWas there any slavery in Mexico?\u00a0 Oh, unheard of.\u201d\u00a0 Many people came to Mexico in that regime without \u2013 without mentioning the colonial history, so racism is a current topic that has to do with the design of our society whether we like it or not.\u00a0 Racism in Mexico is a synthesis of the inequalities \u2013 gender inequalities, many other inequalities, racial inequalities \u2013 and we\u2019ve made great efforts so far to dismantle the culture of racism.\nIt\u2019s culture.\u00a0 This is no easy topic to deal with, but this is a fight we must lead to dismantle racism in Mexico.\u00a0 We have 63 live languages, 63 indigenous communities in our countries.\u00a0 President\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador requested us to make great efforts to revisit the historical sites in Mexico and the situations like the Yaquis in Mexico, where they were practically exterminated because they were defending their land and the water.\u00a0 That community survived.\u00a0 That was important.\u00a0 So what we\u2019ve done is go back \u2013 not only recognize that foe and ask forgiveness for what happened 200 years ago, but what can we do to do better in the society we currently have.\u00a0 Same thing happened with the Mayans.\nAnd I mentioned 63 languages, 63 ethnic groups.\u00a0 Recently in the U.S., our president asked us that the consulates \u2013 Mexican consulates in the U.S. \u2013 when you call them on the phone, don\u2019t force everybody to speak Spanish, because it\u2019s not their maternal language.\u00a0 If you\u2019re calling the U.S., people speak Nahuatl, and they work in the U.S.\u00a0 They speak Otomi, they speak Zapoteco.\u00a0 And for the first time in our history, we\u2019re taking phone calls in their maternal languages \u2013 well, only have three languages, but we need to cover all 63 languages.\nHence, when we see that in the U.S., the Biden administration has similar concerns based in the U.S. context, and Minister Trudeau, every time we meet, it\u2019s a great concern of his \u2013 this is no discourse, this really moves him deeply.\u00a0 And we tell the story I\u2019m telling you now.\u00a0 So let\u2019s do something together.\u00a0 So if we\u2019re doing something in, say, along the same lines, let\u2019s have a common cause.\u00a0 This is not a \u2013 this is not a random situation, because we\u2019re sharing values that are tied to and pursuing more equal societies, more inclusive, more just.\nSo, of course, I congratulate my colleagues and everybody that helped us realize that we are leading a common battle together, but we have the same cause.\u00a0 We have the same motive to go on and to go forward.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR VELASCO:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Prior to signing this document, we need to recognize the presence of the Mexican ambassadors in Washington, Moctezuma, and our designate ambassador in Canada, Carlos Joaquin, and Claudia Morales, incumbent at the national commission to prevent and eradicate discrimination.\u00a0 And now let us sign this very important partnership of North America for equality and racial justice.\n(The declaration was signed.)\n(Applause.)\nMR VELASCO:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) So the meeting stands adjourned.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 The meeting is adjourned.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Very good to see everyone here this afternoon.\nIn the first year of our administration, we focused on rebuilding and revitalizing America\u2019s alliances and partnerships, weaving them together as well in new coalitions of common purpose.\u00a0 As you all saw, we reinvigorated our engagement with NATO, with the European Union, the United Nations, the G7, ASEAN, the OECD.\u00a0 We elevated and strengthened the Quad.\u00a0 We created AUKUS, the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, among many other groupings.\nThe logic here was simple and straightforward:\u00a0 We\u2019re in a fundamentally stronger position to address the issues that actually affect the lives of the American people when we do so alongside the many countries that share our fundamental interests and values.\nIn year two, we showed why this was a smart and important investment.\u00a0 Whether we were addressing threats and risks posed by strategic competitors, combating global challenges like the climate crisis and the pandemic, or seizing opportunities to improve Americans\u2019 lives in tangible ways, our alliances and our partnerships proved the vital difference.\nWe kept up a pretty relentless pace of broadening and deepening our engagement across the world, hosting the Summit of the Americas, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the first-ever U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit, the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.\nWe drew enormous power as well as credibility from unprecedented investments in our economic strength and technological edge here at home \u2013 the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nSo, today, what I wanted to spend a few minutes doing, with your tolerance, is to highlight four of the most consequential areas where diplomacy delivered in 2022.\nFirst, we rallied the world to ensure that Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine is a strategic failure.\u00a0 Since February 24th, we\u2019ve brought together dozens of allies and partners to promote security, economic and humanitarian support to the Ukrainian people as they stand up for their country\u2019s democracy, its sovereignty, and its independence.\u00a0 Our collective support \u2013 including now an additional $1.85 billion in U.S. military assistance the President announced yesterday \u2013 has enabled Ukraine\u2019s fighters to go on the counter-offensive, liberating their people, retaking more of their territory.\nNATO has never been stronger or more united.\u00a0 The Alliance adopted a new Strategic Concept and added more forces and resources to our collective defense.\u00a0 We doubled the number of battlegroups along NATO\u2019s eastern flank.\u00a0 We\u2019ve increased deployments in the Baltics.\u00a0 We\u2019re on the cusp of adding Finland and Sweden as new members of the Alliance.\nWe worked with allies and partners to impose the strongest-ever sanctions and export controls on President Putin and those enabling his war of aggression \u2013 significantly diminishing the Russian military\u2019s access to funds, to goods, to technologies that are critical to the war effort.\u00a0 By any measure, the Russian war machine is in dire straits.\u00a0 U.S. diplomatic leadership has been indispensable in building and maintaining this unity of purpose and also this unity of action.\u00a0 Meanwhile, we brought our diplomatic muscle to bear on isolating Russia at the United Nations and other international organizations, and to reaffirming global support for the core principles of the UN Charter that President Putin is trying to shed.\nNow, we know that a tough winter lies ahead for Ukrainians, as President Putin pursues his new strategy of trying to freeze Ukrainian men, women, children, the elderly to death.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with the G7 and other allies and partners to repair, to replace, and defend Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, including bolstering its advanced air defense through precision systems like the Patriot missile battery that President Biden announced yesterday.\nWe are with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\u00a0 That\u2019s the message President Biden delivered personally to President Zelenskyy when he hosted him at the White House.\u00a0 It\u2019s a commitment backed up by robust and enthusiastic bipartisan support in Congress, which was on full display last night.\nMaintaining that support is crucial, because President Putin continues to show no interest in meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 We agree with President Zelenskyy that diplomacy is the only way to definitively end Russia\u2019s war.\u00a0 Until President Putin changes course, the best way to improve the prospects of a just and durable peace, to actually advance the prospects for meaningful diplomacy, is sustaining our strong support for Ukraine.\nSecond, we accelerated strategic convergence with our allies and partners on the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 This is crucial, for while Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, the PRC is our only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.\nBack in May, I set out our strategy to meet the challenge posed by the PRC: invest in the foundations of our strength at home; align with our partners and allies; compete with China so that we can defend our interests and realize our vision for the future.\u00a0 Our diplomacy has played a key role in carrying out that strategy.\nWe set out an affirmative approach for a free and open Indo-Pacific that draws on the views of many of our partners inside and outside the region, and that has in turn informed their own strategies.\u00a0 Together with the European Union we strengthened our complementary toolkits on key challenges posed by the PRC, from economic coercion to human rights.\u00a0 We\u2019ve deepened our cooperation on investment screening and export controls of sensitive and emerging technologies.\nFor the first time, NATO\u2019s Strategic Concept committed to address the PRC\u2019s systemic challenges to transatlantic security.\u00a0 We deepened the Alliance\u2019s coordination with Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and our other Pacific allies.\nWe\u2019re united in our commitment to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and we continue to raise concerns and take joint action around the PRC\u2019s human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, the erosion of freedom of speech and the press in Hong Kong.\nEven as we competed vigorously with the PRC, we\u2019ve worked carefully to prevent our competition from veering into conflict.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to manage this relationship responsibly, building on the candid and productive discussion President Biden and President Xi had in Bali \u2013 a conversation I look forward to advancing when I visit the PRC early next year.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to pursue cooperation on issues that demand that the United States and China work together \u2013 for the good of our people, but also for the good of people around the world.\nThird, we mobilized broad-based coalitions to deliver solutions to the shared global challenges that so many of us face, including on food security, on health, energy and climate, inclusive economic growth \u2013 challenges that have a real impact on the lives and the livelihoods of the American people, and that we cannot solve effectively alone.\nWe led the global response to an unprecedented global food security crisis \u2013 driven by COVID, climate, and conflict \u2013 worsened significantly by President Putin\u2019s war.\nIn 2022 alone, we contributed $11 billion in humanitarian and food security assistance.\u00a0 We hosted a Food Security Ministerial and summit with the African Union and the European Union to marshal the resources needed to save lives in the immediate, but also to help countries build their own capacity for resilient, sustainable agricultural production.\nWe made significant strides in ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 providing nearly $20 billion for the global response, distributing more than 670 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to over 115 countries.\nWe launched and led the Global Action Plan, which brought together dozens of countries to get shots in arms, to bolster health supply systems, to combat misinformation and disinformation.\nWe also took steps to ensure that the world is better prepared to prevent, to detect, and respond to future outbreaks.\u00a0 We worked with the G20 to create a new World Bank fund to help countries strengthen their pandemic preparedness.\u00a0 We will train 500,000 health workers over the next five years across our own hemisphere in Latin America.\u00a0 We\u2019ll invest $4 billion in health workers in Africa by 2025.\nOn climate, we leveraged historic investments at home and abroad to accelerate the clean energy transition and adapt to the effects of a warming climate.\u00a0 This is not just our responsibility; we also see it as a once-in-generations opportunity to create good-paying jobs for Americans.\nWe forged new regional partnerships to make our economies more resilient, more sustainable, more prosperous, more inclusive \u2013 including the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, whose members represent 40 percent of global GDP, and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.\nTogether with the G7, we launched the $600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGII, to develop a high-standard, transparent alternative for infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries.\nFourth, we used the power of American diplomacy to advance peace and prevent and mitigate conflict.\u00a0 Together with my counterparts from Israel, Morocco, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, I took part in the historic Negev Summit to advance integration and normalization in the Middle East.\nWe brokered a historic agreement between Israel and Lebanon to resolve their long-standing maritime boundary dispute.\u00a0 We supported African-led talks that led to the cessation of hostilities between Ethiopia and Tigrayan forces.\u00a0 We helped bring about a framework agreement to put Sudan back on the path toward civilian-led democracy.\u00a0 We helped secure \u2013 and later extend \u2013 a truce in the Yemen conflict.\nAnd we brought home unjustly detained Americans from Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Burma, Afghanistan, Haiti, and other countries.\u00a0 We will keep working every single day to bring home Americans who are wrongfully detained around the world, while taking steps to deter and prevent this abhorrent practice going forward.\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to use all of our diplomatic tools to drive these priorities, and many others \u2013 including maintaining our commitment to the people of Afghanistan, particularly those who supported the U.S. mission there over 20 years, as well as to stand up for the rights of women and girls.\nWe will also be intensely focused on coordinating international efforts to combat the scourge of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.\nNow, I focused a lot on how we\u2019ve worked with allies and partners in 2022 to confront today\u2019s biggest challenges.\u00a0 But even as we did that, we also took major steps here in this building to ensure that the State Department is positioned and empowered to meet today\u2019s challenges, and tomorrow\u2019s.\nWe launched a new Bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy.\u00a0 We notified Congress of our intent to create a new Bureau on Global Health Security and Diplomacy.\u00a0 We stood up a China House to lead the development and coordination of our policy toward the PRC.\u00a0 We expanded our diplomatic presence in the Indo-Pacific, and brought on the biggest cohort of Foreign and Civil Service officers in over a decade.\u00a0 And we made significant strides toward attracting and retaining a workforce that reflects one of our nation\u2019s greatest strengths \u2013 our diversity.\nBefore I conclude, I want to acknowledge the \u201cwe\u201d behind all of the hard-earned progress that we\u2019ve made. That starts with the individuals who make up the Department of State, particularly our Foreign and Civil Service officers, our locally employed staff.\u00a0 They\u2019re the ones who executed on this vision \u2013 day in, day out.\u00a0 And not just on the issues I highlighted today, but across every facet of our foreign policy \u2013 working together with our colleagues from across the U.S. Government, working as well with our foreign partners.\nI could not be prouder of my teammates.\u00a0 I also couldn\u2019t be more humbled by the opportunity to serve alongside them. To all of them, to their families, whose love and support and sacrifice allows them to provide this service, I simply want to say thank you.\nI also want to thank Congress for its partnership.\u00a0 By our count, the department had more than 3,200 briefings, meetings, and calls with Congress over the past year.\u00a0 I personally participated in more than 60 of those.\nI\u2019m especially grateful to members of both parties who have worked with us to confirm 91 nominees this year \u2013 a tally we hope to add to in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 Because when we have our team on the field, we deliver.\nFinally, I\u2019d like to thank all of you, the members of our press corps.\u00a0 The work that you do is indispensable to our democracy.\u00a0 And while it\u2019s not always easy answering your questions, the accurate information that you provide is a public good.\u00a0 It\u2019s as basic and as simple as that.\u00a0 It helps our citizens understand the forces that are shaping their lives.\u00a0 It empowers them to engage meaningfully in their communities, their country, the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the reasons that we fight so hard for a free and independent media around the globe, and it\u2019s why I\u2019m deeply grateful to you for the work that you do.\nWhen I first started in this job, many people were asking if America would \u2013 or even could \u2013 lead again around the world.\u00a0 Or, for that matter, whether the world wanted us to.\nIn 2022, I think we answered those questions. We showed that the United States is ready and able to lead on the fundamental challenges of our time.\u00a0 And countries around the world demonstrated why they want to be our partners in building a world that\u2019s more free, more open, more secure, and more prosperous.\nWith that, I thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to take some questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Ned.\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Merry Christmas and \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 \u2014 happy holidays, and I hope the lovely weather doesn\u2019t interfere with any travel plans that you might have.\u00a0 You \u2013 in honor of the new year I have 23 questions.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But in deference to everyone, I\u2019ll condense it to one so.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So your question\u2019s 23 parts.\u00a0 Is that it?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 No, no, no.\u00a0 Not even 23 parts.\u00a0 But you\u2019ll see.\u00a0 So in your year-end review of 2022, you mentioned a number of issues \u2013 Russia, China, Afghanistan.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t mention Iran and North Korea, which are \u2013 which were big issues this year and will continue to be, along with those other three.\u00a0 So when you talk about these challenges which we\u2019re facing, which you\u2019re going to face in the upcoming year, you often say that the ball is in their court, that you\u2019ve made a proposal, they need to respond.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if there are any \u2013 Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan \u2013 in which you could see the ball being in your court.\u00a0 In other words, any \u2013 are there any of them in which you can see the administration making fresh, new initiatives or proposing new ideas to resolve some of these problems, which are dramatic, to say the least?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank, Matt, very much.\u00a0 First, I think it\u2019s fair to say \u2013 to atrociously mix a metaphor \u2013 that the ball\u2019s been in our court and we\u2019ve been running with it, by which I mean this \u2013 take Russia, Ukraine.\u00a0 From the outset of this aggression, from even before the conflict, we were very clear, including with the Russians, that if they proceeded with the aggression we would do three things.\u00a0 We would work day in, day to support Ukraine and rally the world to do the same; we would impose severe costs on Russia for its actions; we would strengthen the Alliance that we have to defend us and defend our partners in Europe, NATO.\nWe have done and we continue to do day in, day out, exactly what we said.\u00a0 And that\u2019s not sitting back and waiting for someone to hit the ball at us.\u00a0 It is us, every single day, with our diplomacy \u2013 because this stuff doesn\u2019t just happen \u2013 making good on those commitments.\nWhen it comes to China, one of the things that we set out to do \u2013 and it\u2019s laid out in our strategy, as I said \u2013 was both to invest in ourselves, to align with our allies and partners, and then to compete vigorously where we disagree.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done and what we continue to do every single day.\u00a0 The convergence that we built, the convergence that is stronger and greater than any time that I\u2019ve seen it between the United States and Europe, the United States and Asia, and increasingly countries around the world on how to approach the challenge that China poses \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on every single day.\nAnd as I mentioned a few minutes ago, in area after area, we are more aligned than we\u2019ve been.\u00a0 We\u2019re approaching this in similar ways, often the same ways.\u00a0 And again, that is the product of active, proactive, engaged American diplomacy.\nI can go down the board.\u00a0 The common denominator here is that all of these areas we have been running with the ball.\u00a0 But it started with something that remains to me foundational, and that was the decision that we made, at the President\u2019s instruction on day one, to reinvigorate, to re-energize, to rejuvenate, to re-engage, and in some cases to reinvent these alliances and partnerships.\u00a0 The fundamental premise that we have is, one, as I\u2019ve \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard me say this a bunch of times, but it bears repeating \u2013 one, the world doesn\u2019t organize itself.\u00a0 And if we are not out there \u2013 if the United States is not out there leading, engaging, helping to do the organizing, then either someone else is going to do it or no one does it \u2013 either way, probably not good for us.\nBut second, and the flip side of the same coin, is that virtually all these problems to be effectively resolved require other countries in on the deal, require us to coordinate, to cooperate.\u00a0 That\u2019s where American diplomacy has been playing a leading role.\u00a0 Every single one of these issues \u2013 and again, when it comes to other issues that you\u2019ve mentioned \u2013 Iran, North Korea, et cetera \u2013 we\u2019ve not been sitting back.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been leaning in, but ultimately other countries have to make decisions about what they\u2019re going to do or not do.\nWe continue to believe, for example, on Iran\u2019s nuclear program that the best way to deal with this challenge, to deal with this threat is through diplomacy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been engaged in intense diplomacy.\u00a0 But if Iran is not willing or able to do what\u2019s necessary to get back into compliance, well, that\u2019s part of the equation too.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Michele.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah, I want to pick up on this issue of alliances.\u00a0 Because the Biden administration came under a lot of criticism, including from allies, for its handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0 I wonder if there were lessons learned that are \u2013 that have been useful to you in managing these alliances, now in dealing with Russia and China.\u00a0 And then also, just briefly, what, if anything, can the U.S. do now to support the women of Afghanistan?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So second part first.\u00a0 The decision that we just heard come from the Taliban on denying opportunities for women to go to universities, girls to go to school \u2013 I think what you\u2019ve already heard is a course of condemnation from around the world, and not only from us but from countries \u2013 virtually every continent, including Muslim countries, which, I think is, in and of itself, important and powerful.\u00a0 What they\u2019ve done is to try to sentence Afghan women and girls to a dark future without opportunity.\u00a0 And the bottom line is that no country is going to be able to succeed, much less thrive, if it denies half its population the opportunity to contribute.\nAnd to be clear \u2013 and we are engaged with other countries on this right now \u2013 there are going to be costs if this is not reversed, if this is not changed.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to detail them today, but we will pursue them in coordination with allies and partners.\u00a0 And I can tell you as well that any prospect that the Taliban seeks for improved relations with the world, with the international community, which is something that they want and we know that they need \u2013 that is not going to happen if they continue on this course.\nMore broadly when it comes to Afghanistan, of course, as we\u2019ve said, we have to learn the lessons of Afghanistan over the 20 years of the mission there, as well as the last year.\u00a0 I have to say \u2013 and if you go back and look at, for example, what the NATO Secretary General said and others have said, our consultation with allies and partners on Afghanistan in the moment were sustained, they were intense, and we strongly took note of everything that we heard from allies and partners in advance of the decisions that President Biden made and that we made.\u00a0 So I think this notion that we hear from some about a lack of consultation is actually not born out by the facts and also not born out by what many of our allies and partners have said.\nI\u2019ll also say this: we ended America\u2019s longest war.\u00a0 For the first time in 20 years, Americans will not be coming home from Afghanistan in a body bag or grievously injured.\u00a0 We brought more than 120,000 people out of the country.\u00a0 When it comes to Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, if we were still in Afghanistan, it would have, I think, made much more complicated the support that we\u2019ve been able to give and that others have been able to give Ukraine to resist and push back against the Russian aggression. We heard predictions that leaving Afghanistan would result in a tsunami of refugees of Afghanistan.\u00a0 That, to date, has not happened.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard that it would result in more terrorism.\u00a0 That to date has not happened.\u00a0 And on the contrary, we were able to take out one of the leading terrorists, Mr. al-Zawahiri.\nAnd so I think putting all of this in perspective is very important.\u00a0 Putting it in the perspective of 20 years, putting it in the perspective of the last year, putting in the perspective of what has happened since \u2013 that does not take away from our enduring commitment to make sure that we help those who helped us in Afghanistan.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t take away from our enduring commitment to stand up for the rights of women and girls, and more broadly for the rights of people in Afghanistan.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t take away from our enduring commitment to help as the leading provider of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.\u00a0 All that remains very much on our plates as we go forward.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Kylie.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks for doing this, Secretary.\u00a0 I wanted to point to something that you said earlier this month on Ukraine.\u00a0 You said the Biden administration is working to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to take back its territory that\u2019s been seized since February 24th.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if you had a sense in the private discussions with President Zelenskyy yesterday if that\u2019s something that Ukraine could agree to as an end state, because it does seem at odds with what Zelenskyy stated as what a just peace would look like.\nAnd then we just heard from the NSC\u2019s John Kirby that Biden\u2019s team is going to work with President Zelenskyy\u2019s team on looking at that peace proposal that they put forth.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering what the goal of that review is.\u00a0 Do you want to put forth a renewed peace plan that has the backing of the U.S. alongside Ukraine?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thanks, Kylie, very much.\u00a0 First, what\u2019s clear from all of our conversations with Ukraine, including the conversations just yesterday between President Biden and President Zelenskyy, is that we have the same objectives, the same goals: a free, an independent, a prosperous and democratic Ukraine, one that demonstrates that the principles of the United Nations Charter are being upheld, including on territorial integrity and sovereignty and independence.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something the President reiterated yesterday.\nWe\u2019ve also been very clear that fundamentally these decisions are for Ukrainians to make.\u00a0 They have to decide where they\u2019re going, how they\u2019re trying to get there, when they\u2019re trying to get there, of course with our very, very strong support.\u00a0 So fundamentally, they\u2019re the ones who are going to be making these decisions.\u00a0 What we\u2019ve heard from the Ukrainians in recent months is the intense focus on getting back territory in the east and in the south that was principally seized since February.\u00a0 That\u2019s where their focus has been.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t prejudge in any way where this goes, where it settles.\u00a0 Again, these are decisions for them to make.\nWhat we want and what many other countries around the world want is a peace, ultimately, that, as we\u2019ve said, is just and durable.\u00a0 And by \u201cjust,\u201d one that doesn\u2019t simply ratify another country seizing by force the territory of another; \u201cdurable\u201d in the sense that we want to make sure that it holds and that we\u2019re not simply putting Ukraine in a position where Russia is going to repeat what it did a month, six months, a year later.\u00a0 All of those elements are very important to what we factor in.\nWhen it comes to the peace proposal, I think here\u2019s what\u2019s important:\u00a0 President Zelenskyy has made repeatedly clear that this is going to end when it ends through diplomacy, through a negotiation, and he\u2019s put forward some ideas, some principles, some particular issues around which hopefully countries can come together to try to advance that proposition.\u00a0 But fundamentally, right now Russia has shown no interest in meaningful diplomacy, in meaningfully engaging to bring this war to an end.\u00a0 As President Biden said, that could happen tomorrow if Putin withdrew his forces, but that\u2019s not going to happen.\u00a0 And in the absence of that, we have to see some meaningful evidence that Russia is prepared to actually negotiate and negotiate, again, a just and durable peace.\u00a0 We just haven\u2019t seen that.\nIn our judgment, the best way to actually advance getting to that day is to sustain our support for Ukraine, to make sure that it does well on the battlefield; that it continues to have the support it needs to sustain itself against the Russian onslaught, including against its energy infrastructure; as well as economic support.\u00a0 That is what is most likely to speed up the day when President Putin comes to the conclusion that what he\u2019s engaged in is futile and that it\u2019s time for a genuine negotiation.\u00a0 I think President Zelenskyy\u2019s proposals are a good start at that.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking to countries around about those proposals.\u00a0 They\u2019re things that everyone should be able to \u2013 in one way or another to rally to.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But what\u2019s the goal of reviewing that peace plan they put forward, and how long will that take?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Kylie, we\u2019ll move around a bit.\u00a0 Humeyra, go ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 How long is it going to take for Biden administration officials to work with Zelenskyy\u2019s team to review that proposal that he\u2019s put forward?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, I don\u2019t want to put a timeline on anything, but I can just tell you that we\u2019re looking at what he\u2019s put forward.\u00a0 I was just on the \u2013 I was going to say on the phone \u2013 on the video with our G7 partners this morning, and this is one of the things that we talked about.\u00a0 So I think countries around the world are looking at this and they\u2019re seeing that, again, the Ukrainians want \u2013 look, no one wants peace more than President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019re the ones who are suffering from the aggression.\u00a0 But it has to be just and it has to be durable.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Humeyra.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Ned.\u00a0 Hello, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I just want to go to China.\u00a0 So at the moment, there is an uncontrolled COVID outbreak there since the reversal of their \u201cZero COVID\u201d policy, and many countries, including the United States, have expressed concern over it and they said they could help.\u00a0 I just want to zero in on that.\u00a0 Has the United States in recent weeks or since the reversal of policy offered China to provide them with vaccines?\u00a0 What was their response?\u00a0 And since the authorities there have changed the criteria to calculate COVID deaths, how accurate do you find China\u2019s official figures on casualties?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 First, let me say this.\u00a0 We want to see China get this outbreak under control for three reasons.\u00a0 First, we don\u2019t want to see people anywhere suffering from COVID.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s illness, whether it\u2019s death, we want to see that come to an end wherever it\u2019s happening, including in China.\nSecond, any time the virus is spreading or is moving around, there is the possibility that a new variant develops, that variant spreads even further, and it comes and hits us or hits other countries around the world.\u00a0 So we have a clear interest in that.\nAnd then, as we\u2019ve seen, there are clear implications for the global economy with China being shut down because of COVID.\nSo on all of those levels \u2013 a basic humanitarian level, the concern for everyone\u2019s health, as well as for the global economy \u2013 it\u2019s profoundly in our interest that China do what\u2019s necessary to get ahead of this.\u00a0 At the same time, it\u2019s also very important for all countries, including China, to focus on people getting vaccinated, making testing and treatment available, and, importantly, sharing information with the world about what they\u2019re experiencing \u2013 again, because it has implications not just for China but for the entire world.\u00a0 So we would like to see that happening.\nWe\u2019re the largest donor of vaccines, as you know.\u00a0 We\u2019re prepared to continue to support people around the world, including in China, with this and with other COVID-related health support.\u00a0 China has not asked to date for that help, but, again, we\u2019re fully prepared to provide assistance to anyone who asks for it if they think it\u2019s useful.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Farhad.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary, for taking our questions.\u00a0 You just mentioned right now that for the Iran nuclear deal, diplomacy is still the best option, while at the same time you are saying that the focus is the Iranian people asking or seeking their right.\u00a0 How can you \u2013 like, what sort of message are you sending to the Iranian people who are being repressed right now?\u00a0 And then the U.S. is going for a deal with a government that was the only government outside Russia that was yesterday mentioned by President Zelenskyy, a few meters away from here, saying that they are doing a terrorist action by providing drones.\u00a0 How can you add this up for the people of Iran?\nAnd also, what message do you have for the families of Emad Shargi, Morad Tahbaz, Siamak Namazi, and the green card holder Shahab Dalili?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So a couple of things on this.\u00a0 First, I think the world has been intensely focused on what\u2019s happening throughout Iran.\u00a0 We remain gravely concerned about Iranian authorities firing on peaceful protestors, notably on women, on children.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen mass arrests.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen sham trials.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen executions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen use of sexual violence as a tool for protest suppression.\u00a0 Not only us, the eyes of the world have seen this.\u00a0 And these human rights abuses are not going and will not go without consequence.\nWe\u2019ve been working from even before the \u2013 this repression to sanction those who are engaged in trying to repress the Iranian people, and just yesterday, I believe, we issued new sanctions, including on the prosecutor general of Iran.\u00a0 At the same time, as you\u2019ve heard me discuss, we\u2019ve been working to try to make sure that Iranians have in their hands the ability to communicate with each other, to remain connected with the outside world.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working on that and with partners, with allies, with countries around the world, including at the United Nations, we have worked to continue to hold Iran accountable and to condemn it for its actions.\nSo that is happening.\u00a0 That is ongoing.\u00a0 And that is the focus of so many countries around the world.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re intensely focused on the fact that Iran has provided UAVs to Russia to prosecute its aggression against Ukraine, and in particular, to attack civilian infrastructure.\u00a0 These Iranian drones are what is being used, among other things, to try to turn off the lights, turn off the heat, turn off the water for Ukrainians as they head into winter.\u00a0 And we\u2019re putting a spotlight on that and, again, trying to take actions wherever we can to disrupt that, including sanctioning the various UAV networks that Iran is engaged in.\nOther countries also are focused on this.\u00a0 We\u2019ve shared information at the United Nations on Iran\u2019s actions, which we see as a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231.\u00a0 We think it\u2019s a clear violation and we\u2019re urging an investigation of that.\nSo on all of these fronts as well as the many other areas where Iran is engaging in destabilizing activities, dangerous activities, support for terrorist groups, destabilizing actions throughout the region, we\u2019ve been focused and engaged.\u00a0 That also does not take away from the proposition that it is profoundly in our interest that Iran not acquire a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 And President Biden is committed to ensuring that Iran not acquire a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 We\u2019ve continued to believe that the most effective way, the most durable way to do that was through diplomacy.\nAnd when the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, was actually enforced, it did exactly what it was designed to do.\u00a0 It put Iran\u2019s nuclear program in a box.\u00a0 It was verified not only by international inspectors, it was verified by our own people, Iran\u2019s compliance with that, including by the previous administration.\u00a0 And in our judgment, it was a grievous mistake to pull out of that agreement and to let Iran\u2019s nuclear program out of the box.\u00a0 But that\u2019s the reality that we inherited and that we\u2019ve had to deal with.\nSo on the diplomacy, again, as I said, we think that\u2019s the best solution.\u00a0 But despite the efforts that we\u2019ve made, even as we\u2019ve been pushing back against Iran\u2019s other egregious actions, despite the efforts that we\u2019ve made and our partners in Europe have made, Iran has not been willing or able to do what\u2019s necessary to come back into compliance with the agreement.\u00a0 So we will continue to look and act on ways to make sure that, one way or another, Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Sean.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And the families?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Could I ask you about the Middle East, elsewhere in the Middle East?\u00a0 There\u2019s a formation of the government in Israel to \u2013 Benjamin Netanyahu is going to be the prime minister again.\u00a0 You, yourself, gave a speech to J Street where you mentioned concerns about some potential actions, such as annexation, such as settlements.\u00a0 You mentioned that you \u2013 that you\u2019re going to deal with policies, not with personalities.\u00a0 Nonetheless, some of the personalities in the government have called for measures like this.\nBut how is the United States going to deal with that?\u00a0 Is there going to be \u2013 are you going to deal with these specific players in the government who may have backgrounds that are problematic?\u00a0 And in terms of the Arab world, through the Abraham Accords \u2013 you mentioned the Negev Summit.\u00a0 To what extent can you leverage that to \u2013 perhaps to send a message to the new Israeli government?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 So first I want to extend congratulations to Prime Minister Netanyahu on announcing the formation of a new government.\u00a0 The Knesset still has to approve it, as you know, before it can be formally sworn in.\u00a0 But we look forward to working with Israel to advance both the interests and the values that have been \u2013 long been at the heart of our relationship, and also to promoting a broader approach to try to bring equal measures of security, of opportunity, of prosperity, of dignity to Israelis and Palestinians alike.\nThere\u2019s been no secret about our approach.\u00a0 And again, I reiterated that in the remarks I made to J Street just a few weeks ago.\u00a0 And as you noted, what I said then, what I repeat now, is that going forward \u2013 just as in the past previous administrations on the Israeli side, on the American side, what previous American administrations have done \u2013 we will engage with and judge our partners in Israel on the basis of the policies they pursue, not the personalities that happen to form the government.\nI think we\u2019ve demonstrated over successive Israeli governments and over successive American administrations, precisely because we have a rock-solid partnership and one that is committed to Israel\u2019s security, that we can have very candid conversations when we disagree.\u00a0 That\u2019s not going to change, either.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 May I follow up, Ned?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Courtney.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, happy holidays.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The administration has maintained its position on diplomacy with North Korea over its missile program even as Pyongyang\u2019s provocations have increased in both frequency and severity.\u00a0 And now the White House has confirmed North Korea\u2019s transfer of weapons to Wagner Group.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering, what does running with the ball look like in 2023?\u00a0 What is the outlook for the new year?\u00a0 Are you seeing it as being time to change course?\u00a0 And are \u2013 when you talk about alliances, are the U.S., Republic of Korea, and Japan agreed on how to proceed?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We\u2019re in not only close communication and coordination, I think we\u2019re in very tight synchronization with the Republic of Korea and with Japan on the approach to North Korea.\u00a0 In fact, I think that alignment\u2019s not been stronger in recent years.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working together every single day.\nAnd when it comes to running with the ball, this is not only a question of condemning what North Korea\u2019s done and continues to do \u2013 the egregious violations of UN Security Council resolutions, the provocative actions, the threat to peace and security \u2013 not only sanctioning these acts, as we continue to do, and bringing them to the United Nations, we continue to take actions to shore up our own defensive and deterrent capabilities and capacities, including working ever more closely with Japan, with Korea on exercises, on preparedness, making sure that we and they have the systems in place to deter and ultimately defend against any North Korean aggression.\u00a0 All of that is ongoing.\nAnd I\u2019d also note that the sanctions that we have put in place and that we\u2019re working to strongly enforce have put some constraints on North Korea\u2019s ability to continue to advance its missile and nuclear programs.\u00a0 Nonetheless, they are \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not going to predict or preview where this is going in 2023, except to say that quite literally every single day we are working with our allies and partners to make sure that not only are we putting pressure on North Korea to end these practices, but we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re putting in place what is needed to deter aggression directly against any of our partners, as well as against us, and if necessary defend against it.\nLet me just add that China has an important role to play in this.\u00a0 It has the strongest, deepest relationship of any country in the world with North Korea.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s in China\u2019s interest not to see these kind of provocative actions continue.\u00a0 And we have conversations with China; this is something President Xi and President Biden talked about.\u00a0 I expect I\u2019ll continue that conversation when I get to China early next year, about what we hope that China will do to try to convince North Korea to move in another direction.\nWe have said very clearly, and it remains the case, that we\u2019re open to diplomacy without any preconditions.\u00a0 We remain committed to seeing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0 To date, North Korea\u2019s not engaged on that basis, but that remains a possibility.\u00a0 And I think China can play a role in helping to move things in that direction.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 One final question.\u00a0 Missy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 The Biden administration has promised to put human rights at the center of its foreign policy, and I understand I\u2019ve heard from you and from other senior members of the Biden administration that human rights is always part of the conversation but is obviously not the only concern when the United States deals with its partners and another \u2013 any country.\u00a0 Looking back at the last two years, how well do you think the administration has done in getting the mix right and effectively using American leverage and influence to actually get results when it comes to human rights?\u00a0 And if there are any specific examples of where you think the United States has done well or not so well, that would be helpful.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 As you said, very rightly, first, it\u2019s something that President Biden felt very strongly about putting back at the center of our foreign policy, and we\u2019ve done that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in shining a spotlight on human rights abuses.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in rallying other countries to speak out, stand up, and take action against these abuses.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in the actions that we\u2019ve taken ourselves.\nAt the same time, again, as you rightly said, it\u2019s at the heart of our foreign policy; it\u2019s not the totality of our foreign policy.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the critical elements that we look at and try to advance, but in every instance we have to balance a multiplicity of interests.\u00a0 And at the same time, we have to make judgments about what is ultimately the most effective way to try and advance our commitment to human rights.\u00a0 And most of this, as with a lot of the things we do, are not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 A lot of this is turning an aircraft carrier, and it takes time and it takes relentless effort.\nI mentioned earlier that we have greater convergence than I\u2019ve seen in my experience with our closest allies and partners in Europe, as well as in Asia, on China.\u00a0 I think you see that playing out, for example, when it comes to human rights abuses that are being committed by China, whether it\u2019s in Xinjiang, Tibet, other places, including for example in growing convergence on export controls not only going to the most sensitive technologies that might help China advance its military capacity, but also technology that could be used for the surveillance of people and other tools of repression against the rights of minorities and others in China.\nSame thing in a number of other countries.\u00a0 Similarly, we\u2019ve taken steps \u2013 and others have taken steps with us \u2013 to try to help ensure that products that are made with forced labor in countries don\u2019t come into our own country or to other countries.\nThere are lots of places where we\u2019ve seen human rights abuses committed in the context of larger conflicts.\u00a0 One way to make sure that we\u2019re actually getting at the upholding of human rights and the end of abuse is to try to resolve those conflicts.\u00a0 Yemen is an example of a place where we\u2019ve invested tremendously in support of diplomacy to try to end the conflict.\u00a0 And for all of the fragility, we had a ceasefire that was extended.\u00a0 And even though it\u2019s now not been formally extended another time, in practice it\u2019s holding.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of humanitarian assistance to get to people.\u00a0 It\u2019s also seen, I think, a reduction in abuses committed against civilians.\nSimilarly in Ethiopia, where we\u2019ve labored in close partnership with African countries, including the African Union, but also including countries like Kenya, the practical effect of getting a cessation of hostilities, of getting the guns quiet, of getting humanitarian assistance into Tigray has also been to reduce, if not eliminate, the human rights abuses that were being committed as the conflict was raging.\u00a0 And we\u2019re focused now on making sure that we can get independent human rights monitors into Tigray to verify that there are no ongoing atrocities, even as we\u2019re looking for accountability for what\u2019s already taken place.\nIn Ukraine, where we see human rights abuses being committed on an almost daily basis by Russian forces, we\u2019ve put a bright spotlight on that.\u00a0 Not only have we put a spotlight on it, we\u2019ve been working overtime to help collect the evidence and gather the information of these abuses.\u00a0 We\u2019re engaged across the international community, whether it\u2019s with the UN, whether it\u2019s with the International Criminal Court, whether it\u2019s looking at other mechanisms to make sure that not only is that information and evidence gathered, but that at the end of the day there will be accountability for these human rights abuses.\u00a0 And that\u2019s one way, as we put a spotlight on it, to deter it.\nSo I think there are many other places where, in one way or another, the combination of putting a spotlight on something, taking concrete action, getting others to do the same is making a difference.\u00a0 But the reality, of course, is that we continue to see abusive practices in many places.\u00a0 We will remain relentless in trying to stop it, to put a spotlight on it.\u00a0 And there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at each case, each instance, each place on its own terms, trying to make judgements each time about how we can actually be most effective in bringing these abuses to an end.\nThank you.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I really hope everyone gets a break, has time with family, with friends, and that we see you fully energized in 2023.\u00a0 Look forward to seeing you then.\u00a0 Thanks.\n\n",

highly valued partner of the United States.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing a lot of work together these past couple of years, really working to advance the common goals that we have for our people and more broadly for the region.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working together to improve regional security, to strengthen democratic institutions, to advance inclusive economic growth.\u00a0 And I\u2019m looking forward to discussing with the minister all of those issues.\nOf course, Panama is also a critical partner for us and many other countries in the region in addressing the challenges of irregular migration.\u00a0 We are facing together what is truly an historic challenge: there are more people on the move around the world \u2013 more than 100 million \u2013 than at any time in recorded history.\u00a0 And of course, in the hemisphere that we share, we know that as well and we see that as well \u2013 whether it is from Mexico, from Haiti, from Cuba, from Guatemala, from Honduras, from El Salvador, from Nicaragua, from Venezuela, and more\u00a0\u2013 Ecuador.\u00a0 People are on the move and there is increasingly a shared sense of responsibility that we all have for managing, in a humane and orderly way, migration in our hemisphere.\u00a0 So I look forward to that discussion as well.\nBut welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to have you here.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TEWANEY:\u00a0 On behalf of the President Cortizo and Vice President Carrizo, I want to convey a very warm regards, and also from the people of Panama.\u00a0 As you said, there are many values also, common values we share, democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law.\u00a0 So that\u2019s, I think, the core base of our strong relation.\u00a0 I think we have met before when I was minister of government very briefly, and now it\u2019s my honor to officially meet you as my counterpart, my homologue.\u00a0 As you met \u2013 the team is going to be here providing some extra information you find useful for the meeting.\nBut I would like to start again with the most important part, our strong relation.\u00a0 We share, as I said, strong values, and we are aligned on some of the most important issues of our time.\u00a0 And I want to convey the message from the president and vice president that we are committed to the rules-based world order and also on the well-being of the international community and the region.\nAs many countries in the world have also experienced decreased levels of trust in their democratic institutions, Panama has been leading efforts to build citizens\u2019 trust in their government.\u00a0 And even during the most difficult times \u2013 recently, in January and July \u2013 we proved that only through dialogue and peaceful resolution we could solve our own issues.\u00a0 In fact, I myself was part of the delegation that was negotiating in Panama peace and stability, and through that negotiation, we can now say that we are stable and strong again and, as allies, we stand together as brothers and sisters.\nWe understand the challenges with regard to migration that the U.S. is facing but we are facing too.\u00a0 And we\u2019re here again to help each other.\u00a0 There are many scopes and actions that we can take in order to address the migration issue, and we are here also to convey the message that we already working with the team to find out some ways.\nAs you know, the Darien Jungle is a geographically very dense jungle, and we want to \u2013 I mean, we have spoken in the region, and we have tried to make efforts and to convey the message that the jungle of Darien is not a safe route.\u00a0 And it should never be used as a route because it\u2019s a jungle that we have the duty to protect, too.\u00a0 We are committed to the climate change.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to the environmental values also.\u00a0 We cherish that, and I\u2019m sure the U.S. too.\u00a0 So we want to keep it that way.\nWe are also committed to human rights, as I told you.\u00a0 We have been taking care of migrants, and we have given and provided the due services that they request when they\u2019re coming out from it.\u00a0 And we thank the U.S. for all the support that has been given.\u00a0 We are also trying to encourage the south and international \u2013 the regional community to understand that this solution can only \u2013 we can only reach a solution through multilateralism and regional responsibility.\u00a0 And again, we share the same thoughts about this.\u00a0 So as you can see, Panama is a very important ally for the U.S. in that sense, and we feel the U.S. is a very important ally for us in that sense too.\nSo also with regards to ADD, we have an honor in that Wilsonian sense of brotherhood, sharing moral and values.\u00a0 We have led the ADD also with the purpose to create an infrastructure in which we can cherish those values too \u2013 not only talking about this, but we feel the need to create an infrastructure in which we can spread those democratic and human right values throughout the region.\u00a0 We have started definitely with the ADD.\u00a0 It has been very successful because we live \u2013 we also believe in development, freedom, democracy.\nAnd very recently, we hope we can do the same and spread that rule in Latin America also.\u00a0 So we intend to continue with those efforts.\u00a0 Panama has always been seen and it has been respected for that role of creating, and convening, and making \u2013 composing peace in the region.\u00a0 And we want to remain as such.\nSo with those words, I would like to \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you have other points in the agenda, or we can continue the discussion.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much.\u00a0

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Good to see you all.\u00a0 So earlier this year in South Africa, I had an opportunity to set out the administration\u2019s Strategy for Africa.\u00a0 And at its core, it really can be distilled to a single word, and that word is partnership.\u00a0 The reality is that the United States and African nations cannot deliver on any of the fundamental aspirations of our people \u2013 we can\u2019t solve any of the big challenges that we face \u2013 if we don\u2019t work together.\u00a0 So our approach is about what America can do with African nations and people, not for them.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this summit, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, has really been all about.\nWe took full advantage of having so many leaders from African governments, businesses to strengthen these partnerships, as was demonstrated, I think, by the robust engagement from President Biden, Vice President Harris, and a large number of our Cabinet secretaries throughout the course of the week.\u00a0 And as you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re putting considerable new resources toward advancing our shared priorities, $55 billion over the next three years alone.\nSo let me just take a minute to sum up and highlight a few of those key areas that have come out of the summit.\u00a0 But let me start by saying the bottom line is this:\u00a0 We made significant, tangible progress across every one of our priorities this week, building on the momentum that we\u2019ve generated over the past two years.\u00a0 We committed to ensuring African countries have a prominent seat at the table.\u00a0 Wherever consequential decisions are being made, consequential issues discussed, we\u2019ve delivered on that.\u00a0 At the United Nations General Assembly in September, you heard President Biden express support for adding a permanent member from Africa to the UN Security Council.\u00a0 And this week the President announced support for the Africa Union to join the G20 as a permanent member.\nIn our strategy, we also committed to expanding broad-based economic opportunity in Africa in part by mobilizing the unmatched power of the American private sector.\u00a0 If you go back to 2021, our government has helped close more than 800 two-way trade and investment deals across 47 African countries worth $18 billion.\u00a0 During the summit just this week, President Biden announced more than $15 billion in new deals.\u00a0\u00a0 At the U.S.-African Business Forum, we brought together leaders from over 300 American and African companies with the heads of the 50 delegations, fostering new connections that will create even more opportunity.\nSeizing 21st century opportunities requires digital connectivity.\u00a0 This is vital to the free flow of ideas, information, investment.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the President announced our plan to work with Congress to invest more than $350 million toward a new initiative on digital transformation with Africa.\nToo often, international infrastructure and trade deals are opaque.\u00a0 They\u2019re coercive.\u00a0 They lead to projects that are environmentally destructive, poorly built, that import or abuse workers, that foster corruption and burden countries with unmanageable debt.\u00a0 We have a different approach.\u00a0 We offer investments that are transparent, high-quality, and sustainable for the planet.\u00a0 We empower local communities.\u00a0 We respect the rights of their people.\u00a0 We listen to their people, to their needs.\nAmerica will not dictate Africa\u2019s choices.\u00a0 Neither should anyone else.\u00a0 The right to make these choices belongs to Africans and Africans alone.\u00a0 But we will work relentlessly to expand their choices, and the agreements and investments we made this week showed that when African governments, businesses, and communities are offered the choice to partner with the United States, they will take it.\nThe U.S. Strategy for Africa also committed us to help our partners recover from the devastation wrought by COVID-19 and the unprecedented global food security crisis.\u00a0 African countries have consistently made clear that as much as emergency assistance \u2013 in fact, even more than emergency assistance \u2013 what they want is to strengthen African capabilities, institutions, technology, supply chains, and industries so that they\u2019re more resilient in the face of future shocks, and together we are building that very resilience.\nOn health security, we\u2019ve provided 231 million doses of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines to African countries free of charge.\u00a0 At the summit, President Biden committed to investing at least $4 billion by 2025 to help African countries train and equip health care workers to meet citizens\u2019 needs.\u00a0 We\u2019re also expanding the capacity of African countries to manufacture vaccines, tests, and therapeutics in Africa for Africans, and indeed, for the world beyond.\nOn food insecurity, we\u2019ve provided more than $11 billion over the last year to address global hunger and improve nutrition.\u00a0 Much of this assistance has gone to African countries, which have been disproportionately impacted by the drivers of hunger \u2013 COVID, climate, and conflict, and by President Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, which has made a serious crisis much worse.\u00a0 We\u2019re making unprecedented investments to help African countries fulfill their goal of not only being able to feed their own people but those around the world.\u00a0 Sixteen of the 20 partners in the Feed the Future program, our flagship program to reduce malnutrition and increase food security, are in Africa, where innovations like high-yield, high-nutrition crops that can endure extreme weather are putting communities on the path to greater resilience.\nNow, we know that the climate crisis is a major driver of increased food insecurity and the spread of deadly viruses.\u00a0 It\u2019s exacerbating tensions that can spark and spread deadly conflict.\u00a0 Yet as the President often points out, it\u2019s also a once-in-a-generation\u2019s opportunity to create good paying jobs for the future.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we committed to foster a just energy transition that can both meet the region\u2019s need for more reliable, affordable energy and, at the same time, create opportunities for businesses and workers in African countries and the United States as well.\nSince January of 2021, we\u2019ve dedicated massive resources toward this very goal \u2013 solar energy in Angola, wind power in Kenya, hydro-solar energy in Ghana, and a new 100 million project that the President announced to expand off-grid access to solar energy; and that\u2019s just to name a few of the initiatives and projects that we\u2019re working on.\u00a0 We\u2019re deepening the resilience of African communities to a changing climate through a $150 million adaptation fund, and this is critical, and you\u2019ve heard the President talk about this.\u00a0 We have a responsibility in the United States as, historically, the largest emitter in the world \u2013 and now still the number two emitter after China \u2013 to help countries adapt, to help them build resilience.\nAnd we are putting the resources, we\u2019re putting the technology, we\u2019re putting the technical know-how, into doing that and sharing it with our partners.\u00a0 We\u2019re teaming up with governments and NGOs to incentivize the protection of irreplaceable natural resources like the Congo Basin rainforest, which absorbs more carbon than is emitted by the entire continent of Africa.\u00a0 Finally, we committed to work with African partners to fulfill the promise of democracy.\u00a0 That includes helping strengthen its core pillars \u2013 the rule of law, human rights, a free press \u2013 as well as addressing some of the root causes of insecurity, which undermines the ability of democracies to actually deliver for their people.\nYesterday President Biden hosted a small group of leaders to discuss how we can help support free, fair, and credible elections in 2023 like the ones we saw in several places this year, including Kenya.\u00a0 As part of that discussion, the president pledged to work with Congress to provide over $165 million to support elections and good governance in Africa in the coming year.\u00a0 These will be key themes of the second Summit for Democracy coming up in March, where Zambia will be one of our co-hosts.\nWhere there are crises and conflicts, we are supporting the African leaders, the regional institutions, and citizens who are stepping up to find diplomatic solutions.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last year through our diplomatic engagement in places like Chad, Ethiopia, Sudan, and eastern DRC.\u00a0 We know African countries face real security concerns, including terrorism and transnational organized crime.\u00a0 The message we sent this week is that African nations can continue to count on the United States as a partner in building more effective and accountable security forces.\nSo if you\u2019re keeping score \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t cover everything \u2013 there are a lot of commitments there.\u00a0 And we know that commitments are only as good as our ability to deliver on them.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we asked one of our most experienced senior diplomats, Ambassador Johnnie Carson, to return to the State Department as our special representative for the U.S-Africa Leaders Summit implementation.\u00a0 With nearly four decades of experience as a diplomat, deep relationships across the region, I can think of no one better to ensure that our words are actually translated into action.\nAcross every single one of our priorities, civil society will play a critically important role, and in particular, youth.\u00a0 Today the median age in Africa is 19 years old.\u00a0 By 2030, two in five people on this planet will be African.\u00a0 And the choices that rising generations make will shape the future not just for Africa but for the entire world.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing more in Africa\u2019s emerging leaders, more than ever before.\u00a0 The Vice President announced that we plan to devote an additional $1.1 billion over the next three years to youth programs like the Mandela Washington Fellows, a number of whom took part in this summit, and, of course, the YALI Network, which provides tools, resources, and a virtual community for now more than 700,000 rising leaders across the continent.\nOf course, a big part of that is investing in women and girls because we know that when they have the opportunity to reach their full potential, when they\u2019re empowered to lead in business and government and communities and families, all of society benefits.\nThe very first gathering that I took part in this week was a meeting of rising African innovators and entrepreneurs.\u00a0 The energy, the ingenuity of this group, its eagerness to turn so many of the problems that we face into opportunities, and to do so in partnership with the United States, is truly inspiring.\u00a0 It\u2019s impossible to feel cynical in their presence because they\u2019re so energized. They\u2019re so committed to serving their communities.\u00a0 They are so full of good ideas.\u00a0 And that kind of sums up the way that we feel coming out of this summit.\nAs the President said yesterday, we\u2019re all in on Africa\u2019s future because we know that the future of African nations and the United States is a shared one.\u00a0 And in what the President\u2019s called a decisive decade, that partnership is more vital than ever.\nWith that, happy to take some questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Shaun, where are you?\u00a0 There you are.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Laughter.)\u00a0 Good to see you.\u00a0 Could I just pursue in some more detail a couple of the security issues that you mentioned?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Sure.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0DRC:\u00a0 You mentioned \u2013 you mentioned the DRC in your remarks.\u00a0 You met with President Tshisekedi.\u00a0 If not mistaken, you didn\u2019t meet with President Kagame.\u00a0 What was the reason for not meeting with him?\u00a0 Does that indicate any sort of pessimism with controlling the M23 situation in the eastern DRC?\nEthiopia:\u00a0 You did meet with Prime Minister Abiy.\u00a0 How do you see the Pretoria agreement going forward?\u00a0 The fact that you met with him, does that show that he \u2013 that Prime Minister Abiy is back in U.S. good graces?\u00a0 Could there be discussion perhaps of renewing AGOA membership for Ethiopia?\nAnd if I could just pursue AGOA a bit more broadly as well, you \u2013 the President talked about a U.S. MOU with the nascent free trade agreement of Africa.\u00a0 What does that mean for AGOA?\u00a0 I mean, should African leaders presume that AGOA is finished after 2025?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Shaun, thank you very much.\u00a0 Let me say this a little bit more broadly before addressing the specific conflicts that you point to.\u00a0 As I said a moment ago, the approach that we\u2019ve taken \u2013 actually from day one of this administration \u2013 has been to support and empower African-led solutions to challenges the continent faces, including the conflicts that you\u2019ve alluded to.\nAnd from day one \u2013 whether it\u2019s Ethiopia, eastern DRC, Somalia, Sudan \u2013 the State Department has been deeply engaged and we\u2019ve lent our support, our assistance to the African Union, to the EAC, to other regional groupings, to individual countries to try to help solve these challenges.\u00a0 That\u2019s been the approach we\u2019ve taken.\u00a0 We believe that whenever and wherever we can find African-led solutions to these challenges, we\u2019re going to be better off, they\u2019re going to be more sustainable.\u00a0 And I\u2019m proud to say that our diplomats have played, I believe, important roles in helping to move some of these forward.\nSo with regard to Rwanda and the DRC, first of all, I spoke to President Kagame on the phone just before the summit and we had a good conversation, just as I had a chance to speak here in Washington to President Tshisekedi.\u00a0 And I can say this:\u00a0 There is a two-track approach that are \u2013 and these tracks are pretty much joined \u2013 the Nairobi Process and then the efforts that Angola is leading that led to an agreement in Luanda, where all sides made commitments to, in effect, pull back and de-escalate the situation.\u00a0 And that\u2019s an important agreement and, if and as it\u2019s implemented, I think it offers tremendous promise for ending the current conflict and hopefully leading to more durable stability in the eastern DRC.\nNow, a big part of that is M23 genuinely pulling back, and there, we are looking to Rwanda to use its influence with M23 to encourage that and to move that forward.\u00a0 At the same time, any militarized nongovernmental group needs to stand down, and that includes groups like the FDLR, and we are looking for all sides to use their influence to ensure that that happens.\u00a0 Rwandan forces need to pull back.\nSo the challenge now is implementation of what was actually agreed, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with the leaders in question, but also, critically, with those who are playing a leading role in trying to reduce tensions and resolve conflict \u2013 notably, Kenya, Angola, the EAC, et cetera.\nSo I have some hope that we now have an agreement and a process that can lead to that result.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on, and we\u2019ll continue to engage directly with the president of the DRC, the president of Rwanda, and with all of the others in the region who are leading this effort.\nWith regard to Ethiopia, there too we have a very important cessation-of-hostilities agreement that has led, over the last few weeks, to a significant reduction in violence in Tigray, the start of humanitarian assistance getting in in significant quantities, the beginning of the restoration of services, and, we hope as well, the need to verify with international monitors that human rights abuses are no longer taking place.\nImplementation of this agreement, just as with the Luanda agreement, is the critical piece.\u00a0 The agreement\u2019s there.\u00a0 We need to make sure it\u2019s implemented and that, ideally, the implementation is done as quickly and as effectively as possible.\u00a0 Another critical component of this agreement is for Eritrean forces to withdraw from Tigray, and we\u2019re looking to that and we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019ve had discussions with a number of the leaders who were here about the need to see that happen.\nSo in both of these cases, I think we have now positive foundations to try to reduce tensions, resolve conflicts, create a stronger foundation for durable peace.\u00a0 But these things are fragile; they demand constant engagement, constant effort.\u00a0 And part of what we did here in Washington this week with the relevant actors was to work on the roadmap ahead for implementing these agreements, so there\u2019ll be a lot of follow-up in the days to come.\nWith regard to AGOA, it\u2019s produced, I think, tremendously positive results in the time that it\u2019s been in force, and we are discussing now with all of the different stakeholders \u2013 the partner countries, the private sector, our Congress \u2013 and listening to them, learning from them about how AGOA can be as effective as possible and having these conversations as we look to see where we take it once it expires, as you said, in 2025.\u00a0 As to countries and their participation in AGOA, the law has clear criteria, and we simply apply the facts in any given case to the law.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Anthony Osae Brown, Bloomberg Africa.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 My name is Anthony Osae Brown from Bloomberg Africa.\u00a0 You mentioned protecting democracy, encouraging democracy in Africa, and one of the meetings you had yesterday with the Ghanaian Government, he raised the question of the Wagner Group being allocated a mine in Burkina Faso and basically called on the U.S. to help protect democracy in West Africa.\u00a0 And I\u2019m wondering what assurances are you giving to the Ghanaian Government and to your allies in the region that you\u2019ll protect them from destabilization from the activities of the Wagner Group or mercenaries in the area.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So a few things to be said about this.\u00a0 Wagner Group came up in a number of conversations over the course of this week on the margins of the summit, including, indeed, in my meeting with President Akufo-Addo of Ghana.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard repeated concerns that Wagner and groups that are linked to it manufacture or exploit insecurity, they threaten stability, they undermine good governance, they rob countries of mineral wealth, they violate human rights.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve heard that and seen that again and again.\nIf you go back to 2017, Wagner forces have deployed to the Central African Republic, they\u2019ve deployed to Mozambique, to Mali, to Libya, and at the same time we\u2019ve seen disinformation campaigns that are furthering the exploitative goals that Wagner and its founder have quite literally across the continent of Africa.\u00a0 There are United Nations investigations that detail the targeting of minority groups, the killing of civilians in Central African Republic, in Libya, in Mali by Wagner forces.\u00a0 I called out Wagner recently in a report that we put out on international religious freedom for its activities in the Central African Republic.\nThese investigations have documented human rights abuses.\u00a0 They\u2019ve documented recruitment and use of child soldiers.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve also documented the exploitation of resources that Wagner engages in.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also seen Wagner interfere with UN peacekeeping operations, endangering peacekeepers, endangering United Nations personnel.\u00a0 It\u2019s a long litany of bad things.\nAnd then the bottom line, ultimately, is this:\u00a0 Wherever we\u2019ve seen Wagner deploy, countries find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, and less independent.\u00a0 That\u2019s the common denominator.\u00a0 That\u2019s the common story across the board, which is why it\u2019s so important that we work together with partners in Africa to make them resilient to something like the Wagner Group.\u00a0 We have something called the Global Fragility Act that is now being implemented in an effort to address in a very comprehensive way problems of instability so that there\u2019s not a vacuum that something like Wagner comes in and tries to fill.\u00a0 We\u2019re using all of the relevant tools that we have to counter its influence, everything from sanctions to exposure, some of which I\u2019ve just done; bolstering state capacity, bolstering regional capacity, bolstering international cooperation.\u00a0 All of these things are necessary.\nAnd the bottom line is this:\u00a0 What I heard in conversations this week, as I\u2019ve heard in the past, is our partners in Africa tell us that they do not want their resources exploited.\u00a0 They don\u2019t want the human rights of their people abused.\u00a0 They don\u2019t want their governance undermined, and ultimately, as a result, they really don\u2019t want Wagner.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Shannon Crawford, ABC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Through the course of the summit, you have been very careful to make the case that the administration doesn\u2019t want to force African nations to choose between the U.S. and China, but the Secretary of Defense clearly said that Beijing\u2019s influence on the continent is a destabilizing threat.\u00a0 Do you share that assessment?\nAnd secondly, we heard today from the Ukrainian military that Russia is digging in for a prolonged war.\u00a0 Now, as you noted, the White House did commit $55 billion for Africa over the course of three years, but of course, aid to Ukraine through this 10-month conflict has already eclipsed that level.\u00a0 Are you confident that the U.S. can maintain support for Ukraine among members of the Global South through a drawn-out fight, levels of support that have already been described as tepid at best by some?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First part of the question \u2013 this summit is about one thing, Africa and the relationship between the United States and Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s about one region and only one region, Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about any other region.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about any other country, and I think you heard that across the board this week.\u00a0 And I recognize people may want to turn it into something else, but sometimes a thing is just what it is, and this is the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.\nAnd fundamentally, it\u2019s about what we are affirmatively able to bring to the table, some of which I described \u2013 the partnerships, the investments that are based on shared interests and shared values, and again, done in a way that\u2019s transparent, that\u2019s high-quality, that\u2019s sustainable, and with a focus on empowering local communities, respecting their needs, their decisions, and their rights.\u00a0 That is what we\u2019ve been talking about for the last three days.\nAnd in doing that, we\u2019re actually creating more opportunity, more opportunity for Africans, more opportunity for Americans \u2013 new, good-paying jobs, particularly in the green economy; infrastructure that actually connects countries and peoples, which is maybe one of the biggest needs in Africa because to realize the extraordinary potential, that connectivity is the one missing piece.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on that.\u00a0 A more educated, dynamic workforce; more effective approaches to shared challenges, particularly food insecurity, climate.\nIn short, what we\u2019re seeking to do is to try to help deliver on what people need.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is about.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a fundamental challenge.\u00a0 Can we effectively deliver?\u00a0 That\u2019s the challenge for all of our countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s what all of these leaders were talking about this week.\u00a0 And our answer to that question is yes, we want to work affirmatively with you; and the answer is yes, we can deliver if we do it together.\nNow, if other countries have the ability and the will to do the same thing, that\u2019s great.\u00a0 There\u2019s more than enough need to go around.\u00a0 But from our perspective, to the extent that anyone else is engaged, we just want to make sure it\u2019s a race to the top, not a race to the bottom.\u00a0 We want to make sure that when we\u2019re seeing investments in Africa, they\u2019re done to the highest standards.\u00a0 They\u2019re not piling debt on countries.\u00a0 They\u2019re not abusing workers or importing workers from outside.\u00a0 They respect the environment.\u00a0 They don\u2019t bring corruption with them.\nIf that\u2019s the case, if we have these affirmative partnerships and investments, then it\u2019s great for everyone to be involved.\u00a0 And ultimately, as I said, this is about choices that Africans will make, and our purpose is simply to make sure that they have a good choice.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is about.\nWith regard to Ukraine, let me just say two things.\u00a0 First, I had an opportunity over the last week to spend some time on Capitol Hill \u2013 first with the Senate last week, the House actually this morning before we came to the summit \u2013 with the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and colleagues from the Treasury Department, USAID, and others.\u00a0 And what I heard there was continued strong bipartisan support for the efforts we\u2019re making to help Ukraine defend itself, to sustain pressure on Russia, to end its aggression, as well as to continue to strengthen our own defensive alliance, NATO.\nWith regard to the Global South, it\u2019s very powerful because you hear countries that are \u2013 were here in Washington this week \u2013 Ghana, Kenya, so many others \u2013 that have been the victims of imperialism in the past and who see that now happening to Ukraine by Russia, and it cuts to the core for them.\u00a0 They feel strongly that this is not simply a matter of what\u2019s happening to Ukrainians in Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s a matter for all to be concerned by because it goes to the very principles that were established after two World Wars and after colonialism to try to make sure that there are rules and understandings that one country is not going to go in and change the borders of another by force; it\u2019s not going to engage in land grabs; it\u2019s not going to try to erase the identity of a country and subsume it into itself; that territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty, all of these things matter, they\u2019re meaningful, and they\u2019re especially meaningful when it comes to Africa.\u00a0 So we heard this again and again.\nNow, having said that, it\u2019s been very important to us to demonstrate that we can run and chew gum at the same time, by which I mean this:\u00a0 Even as we and many other countries are trying to deal with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re also working on, engaging, dealing with the problems, the challenges that people are feeling around the world, and notably in the Global South, including dealing with climate, dealing with global health and their own situations, dealing with food insecurity, problems that, parenthetically, in some cases have been made worse by the Russian aggression.\u00a0 I think everything that comes out of these three days demonstrates that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing \u2013 that we are responding in partnership to these needs even as we\u2019re dealing with the situation in Ukraine.\u00a0 It is not a zero sum, and I think if you \u2013 I don\u2019t want to speak for them, but if you ask many of the countries that were here this week, I think that they have to come away, based at least on what I\u2019ve heard, very \u2013 feeling very positive about the engagement of the United States on the issues that matter to them and to the lives of their people day in, day out.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Guilaume Naudin, RFI.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I wanted to have your take about the outcomes of this summit.\u00a0 Did it meet your expectations?\u00a0 Did it exceed it?\u00a0 And isn\u2019t the tough part starting right now, considering the last summit was eight years ago and we had to wait eight years to have another event like this, with the implementation and the follow-up of everything that was decided here?\n(Via interpreter) There are many French-speaking countries here.\u00a0 What is your feeling and the rapport from the summit?\u00a0 Does the hard work start now?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) The outcome is very positive, and you\u2019re entirely right: the hardest remains to be done now, and that\u2019s always the case with a summit such as this one.\nThe bottom line is this:\u00a0 We have made significant and tangible progress across every one of the shared priorities that we had going into the summit, and I described some of them a few minutes ago.\u00a0 And so I don\u2019t want to repeat the \u2013 I could actually spend probably the next 15 minutes just going through the list of what we call deliverables.\u00a0 But just in summary, we\u2019ve announced very significant commitments across the board, some of them even groundbreaking, on peace and security, on diplomacy and good governance, on trade and investment, on health, on the environment, on food security, on technology and innovation, on people-to-people connections and ties.\nBut to your point \u2013 and I very much agree with you \u2013 what happens over three days is very important in setting the direction, making the commitments, but it\u2019s what happens over the next 362 days that really matters.\u00a0 It is the follow-through.\u00a0 It is the implementation.\u00a0 And I think that was felt across the board.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the reasons why the President was keen on having maybe our most experienced diplomat for Africa over the last four decades, Johnnie Carson, take on this role of doing the follow-through, doing the implementation, making sure that everything that we said we would do we\u2019re actually going to do.\nSimilarly, the strategy that we put out on Africa a few months ago that I had the opportunity to do in South Africa, we\u2019re in effect putting out a report card on ourselves as well as in partnership with African countries to make sure that we\u2019re making good on what we said we would do.\nSo that\u2019s what, I think, ultimately this needs to be judged on.\u00a0 I believe that the last three days were a significant success, but ultimately, the ultimate judgment has to be in the days to come, the weeks to come, the months to come, are we making good on what we said we would do?\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced that we will.\nAnd by the way, over the last couple years that I\u2019ve been on this job, I\u2019ve had an opportunity to travel a fair bit in Africa \u2013 Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, Algeria, Senegal, Egypt, South Africa \u2013 but as the President mentioned today, I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of us in Africa next year, including the President.\u00a0 So that\u2019s an opportunity as well to carry forward everything that we\u2019ve done here, to continue these conversations, to continue the implementation.\u00a0 And I know when the President goes, when other Cabinet members go, we\u2019re going to want to be able to show that what we did and said here in Washington, we\u2019re actually carrying out.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Jonathan Donkor,\u00a0Ghanaian Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0My question has to do with debt forgiveness.\u00a0 Huge investment deals and commitments have been announced over the last three days.\u00a0 However, many African countries are saddled with debt.\u00a0 Ghana, for instance, is currently undertaking a debt exchange program as part of the IMF support it\u2019s seeking.\u00a0 Is the Western word willing to forgive the debt owed by African countries?\u00a0 And how would you help the countries to prevent similar situations in the future?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, thank you.\u00a0 So this is a subject, a theme that we\u2019ve heard loudly and clearly here.\u00a0 It\u2019s not new in the sense that this has been part of the conversation for some time.\u00a0 And there is no doubt that the rise of unsustainable debt burdens, especially in Africa, is a tremendous challenge, and it\u2019s one that we\u2019re committed to addressing.\u00a0 When you look at the debt crises that we\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re devastating from a humanitarian standpoint, and they can be debilitating when it comes to effective economic development and inclusive growth.\u00a0 So there are a number of things that we talked about and that we clearly need to move forward.\nOne is we need all creditors, both countries and the private sector, to work together with us to support debtor countries.\u00a0 It can\u2019t simply be the United States.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve attempted to address this \u2013 for example, through the G20, through the Paris Club \u2013 as I think you know.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also led debt reduction efforts through the \u2013 something called the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.\u00a0 That has provided, to date, about $75 billion in debt service relief to dozens of countries \u2013 I think nearly 40 countries \u2013 going back to 1996.\u00a0 Of those 40 or so countries, I think more than 30 are African countries.\u00a0 So there\u2019s a real focus on this.\nThere\u2019s a G20 initiative that suspended more than $12.9 billion worth of debt service payments owed by 48 countries.\u00a0 This was between May of 2020 and December of last year.\u00a0 So these are some of the things that we\u2019ve actually been doing and working on.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s also fair to say more needs to be done to prevent debt crises from emerging in the first place.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big part of the challenge.\nAnd one of the things that we\u2019re especially concerned about is the growth of untransparent debt, including off-balance-sheet debt and debt that\u2019s hidden by non-disclosure agreements.\u00a0 So a company or a country may come in, lend the money, and part of the agreement is, no, you can\u2019t reveal the terms.\u00a0 And that means, among other things, that when other countries are negotiating for loans, they don\u2019t know what the terms are, the people don\u2019t know what the terms are, and countries wind up being saddled with debt that they can\u2019t possibly repay.\u00a0 So that transparency that we bring to everything we do, we need to see that spread around in the way that these loans are made.\nAnd not only does this actually increase the risk of a debt crisis, but it also can prolong the duration and create barriers to actually resolving these debt burdens.\u00a0 So bottom line is this:\u00a0 We need both the creditors \u2013 again, countries, private sector, as well as the debtors \u2013 to do their part to support greater fiscal and debt transparency and try to remove the barriers that exist to that transparency.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, we\u2019re out of time.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone, for joining.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So I can make this very simple and easy and quick:\u00a0 What he said.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut I feel an obligation to add just a little bit.\u00a0 First of all, welcome.\u00a0 It is wonderful to see so many friends \u2013 colleagues \u2013 here in this room.\u00a0 To those of you who haven\u2019t been here before, this is actually \u2013 Strive, this is the top floor, and this is the Benjamin Franklin Room.\nBenjamin Franklin is looking down on us this evening.\u00a0 He was, as many of you know, America\u2019s very first diplomat.\u00a0 He signed our first treaty, our first alliance, with France.\u00a0 He charted the Gulf Stream.\u00a0 He pioneered electricity.\u00a0 He gave us our ethos of self-government.\u00a0 And virtually none of this did he do while sober.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I invite you to be inspired by our first diplomat.\nA warm welcome to all of our dinner guests, especially, again, my colleagues and counterparts from African nations.\u00a0 It\u2019s been one of the great pleasures of my tenure in this job working with each of you, and I\u2019m so pleased that we\u2019re here together this week in Washington to continue that work.\u00a0 Thank you for your engagement, thank you for your leadership throughout this summit and everything leading up to it, and the many priorities that have been vital to our partnership.\nAnd thank you as well to the business leaders who are here with us tonight.\u00a0 Thank you for bringing your ingenuity, your energy to our shared work.\u00a0 Indeed, there are few issues that we\u2019ve been talking about these last couple of days that we can solve without the engagement of the business community.\nAnd to the assistant secretary, Molly, thank you not just for your dedication, shared by so many here at the State Department, but to the work that you\u2019re doing every single day and that our team is doing every single day not just to make this summit a success, but to strengthen the relationships that are at the foundation of the summit.\nIt really is not easy to follow Strive.\u00a0 Talk about someone who\u2019s made a profound difference, a real difference, in thousands and thousands of lives \u2013 scholarships for tens of thousands of orphaned children, mobilizing billions of dollars to support African farmers, leading the fight against HIV/AIDs, against Ebola, and more recently against COVID-19.\nAnd now, to my great gratitude, he\u2019s turning to the challenge of long-term food security on the continent, a mission that the United States shares and is joining him to advance.\nThe millions of lives that Strive has touched are a testament to the immense potential, the immense potential for good that can be created when the business community and governments actually work together.\nAnd that\u2019s what tonight is all about.\nPartnership is at the heart of President Biden\u2019s strategy for Africa \u2013 partnerships between the United States and African nations, with the private sector, and between our people.\nAnd in a sense, it\u2019s as simple as this:\u00a0 The challenges and the opportunities of this moment, from climate change to the clean energy transition, public health, economic opportunity, peace and security \u2013 these aren\u2019t African issues or American issues.\u00a0 They\u2019re global priorities, and the best way that we can address them, the best way we can be effective, is together, bringing the full force of our combined, collaborative efforts, including the efforts of the business community.\nI can think of no more compelling demonstration of the power of these partnerships than the successful collaborations between the countries and companies that are here in this room.\nTake the work of the Kenyan Government, which is teaming up with Varian to help millions access life-saving cancer care.\nBenin and Egypt, working with Citi to issue Sustainable Development Goal and green bonds that will help finance clean energy projects directly benefiting their citizens.\nThe small businesses and innovators across the continent who are working with Visa to access financing and global markets.\nOr take what governments and business are doing together to end the COVID-19 pandemic and better prepare us for future health emergencies.\nRight now, the public and private sectors are working with the World Health Organization in South Africa to create the first COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub.\u00a0 This ensures that we\u2019re not only providing emergency aid to African countries, but we\u2019re investing \u2013 investing in future tech know-how and production in Africa, by Africans, with all of the health, science, and economic benefits that this brings.\nAnd this really is at the heart of our thinking and it\u2019s at the heart, as well, of what Strive is doing.\u00a0 Yes, of course, we all have to face and deal with emergency situations.\u00a0 We\u2019re acutely aware of that and acutely invested in that.\u00a0 But even more important is making these investments in sustainable capacity in Africa for the long term, so that whether it comes to dealing with climate, whether it comes to dealing with COVID and global health, whether it comes to dealing with food security, that capacity exists for the long term in Africa.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is all about and what we have to be about together.\nThese partnerships are not simply or merely financial deals.\u00a0 They are actual solutions to some of the toughest and most important challenges that we face and that we have to face as a global community.\u00a0 They\u2019re also critical for increasing trade and investment between the United States and African nations to the benefit of all of us, and you\u2019ve heard us talk about this today.\u00a0 You heard President Biden address this in some detail today.\nTo try to accelerate that progress, the administration is taking a number of steps, including advocating for American business, driving U.S. private sector investment to growth industries in Africa, correcting misperceptions about risk, and working with African partners to strengthen the business climate in their countries.\nI want to thank especially my friend and colleague, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, for her tireless work on this front.\u00a0 She and her team are doing incredible things to make this real.\u00a0 This is where the rubber meets the road, and we\u2019re so grateful for the partnership that we have with our colleagues at Commerce and with Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 Gina, thank you for everything you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nFinally, you may have heard me say this before, but I think it always bears repeating:\u00a0 Africa is a major geopolitical force.\u00a0 It\u2019s one that has shaped our past, it\u2019s shaping our present, and it will shape our future.\nIt\u2019s a demographic reality.\u00a0 It\u2019s an economic reality.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a reality that\u2019s reflected in the incredible dynamism and vitality of African nations, of their people, and the companies that do business on the continent.\nIf we work together, if we harness those strengths, I am confident \u2013 more than confident \u2013 that we really can chart a more prosperous and more secure future for all of our citizens.\nSo there\u2019s a lot to be done day in, day out that makes good business sense, but believe me when I say beyond the business sense there\u2019s a higher calling here, one that can make genuine progress for millions and millions of people.\u00a0 It\u2019s where convenience and conviction come together, and all of you in this room are a big part of that story, a story I hope we can all tell together.\nThank you so much for being here this evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It is wonderful to see this room so full, so full of friends, colleagues.\u00a0 As I came in from the back, I note that this area is often filled with automobiles because this is where the car show takes place.\u00a0 But today, we have an incredibly vibrant community with us.\nTo the heads of state that are joining us today, thank you for being with us for the summit.\u00a0 We\u2019re so grateful to have this time with you in person, face to face.\nTo my friend Scott Nathan, thank you not only for the incredibly generous words but especially for your leadership every single day of what is an incredibly important tool that we have in the U.S. Government, and that is the Development Finance Corporation, one that is now firing on all cylinders under Scott\u2019s leadership.\nAnd a big thanks to my friend, to my partner, to my colleague, Secretary Gina Raimondo, to her entire team at the Department of Commerce, for the work that\u2019s being done every single day to build stronger ties between our countries; the folks at Prosper Africa, the Corporate Council on Africa, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for organizing today\u2019s event.\u00a0 I think I saw Myron in the audience there somewhere; great to be with you today.\u00a0 Thank you for everything that you\u2019re doing.\nTo all the CEOs, to the business leaders who are here today, thank you for the work that you\u2019re doing to strengthen the trade and investment ties between the African countries and the United States, for making it easier for our people to exchange their ideas, to exchange their goods, to exchange their services.\nYou all know this: \u00a0The ties that we already have are robust.\u00a0 Last year, two-way trade in goods and services between African nations and the United States totaled more than $80 billion, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs in our countries.\nOur trade and investment ties have also helped to make progress on our shared priorities, on global challenges, from food insecurity to global health.\nA couple of examples, well-known to many of you.\u00a0 The work being done in Northern Nigeria by a small U.S. company by the name of John Deere, which produces a little bit of farming equipment.\nBut besides the equipment, for the past few years, John Deere has provided agricultural training and youth education to smallhold farmers so that they\u2019re able to apply new, more effective farming techniques.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeing the fruit of that kind of partnership; in some areas, farm yields have gone up by 20 percent.\nPfizer, another great U.S. company, which alongside German biotech company BioNTech agreed to manufacture its COVID-19 vaccine through The Biovac Institute, a South African biopharmaceutical company.\u00a0 Biovac will soon have the capacity to produce more than 100 million COVID-19 vaccines annually in its facility in Cape Town.\nAnd this gets at something that\u2019s vitally important for us, which is to make sure that part of what we\u2019re doing is investing in local capacity, sustainable production capacity, so that African companies and African countries can produce what\u2019s needed for themselves as well as for the world.\nBut we all know \u2013 you all know\u00a0\u2013 that there is so much more that we can and we should do.\nAs business leaders, we appreciate the difficulty of the challenges you face.\u00a0 In so many ways this is one of the great inflection points of our time.\u00a0 And whether it\u2019s the incredible volatility that you\u2019re all experiencing, the changing costs of commodities, supply chain issues caused by COVID, integrating new technologies that are evolving at an ever-faster pace, we know that this complicates life in profound ways.\nAnd of course there are challenges that are, to some extent, unique to the region: differing tax structures across African nations, the balance required to create goods and services that are customized to each country\u2019s consumers and their demands, changes required to engage a young workforce.\nBut there\u2019s tremendous opportunity in those challenges, as well.\u00a0 Take the younger workforce, for example, demanding more, higher-quality jobs, constantly looking for ways to upskill.\u00a0 If we provide them with the chance to do that, we have a chance to build one of the most talented workforces, one of the most dedicated consumer bases, in the world.\nWe\u2019re also trying to listen\u00a0\u2013 listen to our partners, listen to their needs.\u00a0 Ultimately, what we\u2019re doing has to be driven by that, not by something invented half a world away.\nFor example, we\u2019ve been listening, and we\u2019ve been hearing loud and clear ideas for better utilizing AGOA.\u00a0 And we look forward to working with you to ensure that we maximize its full potential going forward.\nBut the big picture is this: together, as the world\u2019s largest economy and one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economic regions, respectively, the United States and African nations have the potential to build one of the 21st century\u2019s most successful economic partnerships.\nIf we manage to increase our share of imports and exports by just 1 percent, we would generate an additional $34 billion in revenue for Africa, $25 billion in revenue for the United States \u2013 and create more than 250,000 good-paying jobs as a result.\nEarlier this year I was in South Africa.\u00a0 I had an opportunity to set out the administration\u2019s new strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa.\u00a0 And at its heart, it\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s focused on one word, and that\u2019s \u201cpartnership.\u201d\u00a0 Our approach is rooted in the recognition that to meaningfully address our shared challenges, we need the leadership, we need the innovation of African nations and institutions working side by side, as equal partners, with American institutions, with our government, with our private sector.\u00a0 And we\u2019re committed to this collaborative approach in our work with African businesses, too.\nLet me just very quickly \u2013 so that I can allow you to get on with enjoying your lunch \u2013 suggest a few ways that we\u2019re working to deepen our partnership in six key areas.\nFirst, the State Department and our colleagues, the Commerce Department, other agencies \u2013 we\u2019re going to be organizing more commercial diplomacy trips, where leaders from across the U.S. Government and our private sector can work together to better identify African partners and source business opportunities together.\nSecond, we will step up our economic diplomacy efforts.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with the Business Council for International Understanding to enhance the abilities of our embassies to identify suitable local partners and to assess investment conditions on the ground.\nFor us, having this diplomatic presence around the world and in virtually every part of Africa is also a critical and unique asset for finding ways to strengthen the trade and investment relationships between our countries, to actually help identify opportunities for American business and, as a result, opportunities for Africa.\nThird, we\u2019ll expand our work in all parts of the investment pipeline \u2013 from fostering investment opportunities, to promoting viable deals, to helping to close those deals.\nOne example:\u00a0 We\u2019ll be investing more in rising African innovators.\u00a0 As Vice President Harris announced yesterday, we\u2019re relaunching the African Women Entrepreneurship Program, which will distribute grants to help African women entrepreneurs grow their businesses.\u00a0 We know from experience that this can be a very powerful source of growth, a very powerful source of opportunity.\nWe\u2019re also funding a new Investment Advisor to the Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area, whose primary responsibility is to connect American companies with business opportunities in African nations.\nFourth, we\u2019ll continue our work with African partners to bolster the building blocks of a strong business environment.\u00a0 We hear, we know from our own companies, what they\u2019re most looking for, what they most need to move forward with investment: clear and consistent tax regimes, protecting intellectual property rights, efficient customs processes.\u00a0 We know that predictability, transparency \u2013 these are the things that make it easier to attract capital.\u00a0 That\u2019s good for African companies; it\u2019s good for African workers.\nFifth, as investors look for ways to manage risk while moving into new markets and new industries, we will help them draw on the best practices of U.S. investors and firms that have already done so successfully \u2013 including many of you who are here in this room today.\nFinally, we will help channel more U.S. private sector investment to the vast growth industries across African nations, including in clean energy, in health care, in the digital sectors.\nWe\u2019re doing that through programs like Power Africa, which has already connected more than 165 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa with cleaner, more reliable electricity.\nWe\u2019re doing it through new initiatives as well, including the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, where we\u2019re teaming up with our partners in the G7 as well as with African host governments to drive investment in areas that will lead the 21st century economy: from the digital economy, to health and energy security, to transportation infrastructure.\nI\u2019m proud to launch another new initiative today: the Technical Assistance for Bankable Infrastructure program to boost private sector investment in Africa\u2019s growth sectors.\nThis program will make it easier for the U.S. private sector to provide technical assistance to partner African governments so that African officials can better identify commercially viable infrastructure projects.\u00a0 It will create a process for both parties to pursue these projects together.\nSo there\u2019s no shortage of ideas, there\u2019s no shortage of initiatives, there\u2019s no shortage of enthusiasm for the ways that we can work together to deepen trade and investment.\u00a0 And we\u2019re making these investments with an eye, yes, to the present, but also to the future \u2013 not just the next fiscal year, not even the next few years, but with the next decade and longer in mind as well.\nAt the heart of these programs, these initiatives that I\u2019ve touched on today, there is one very simple and fundamental goal: working more closely together so we can deliver for our people on the issues that actually matter most to them in their daily lives.\u00a0 And ultimately, that\u2019s profoundly important for governments as well because the fundamental challenge that we all face is that \u2013 can we effectively deliver on the needs, on the aspirations of our people?\nClearly, the connections that we\u2019re making, the work that we\u2019re doing, the leadership that you\u2019re showing in connecting the United States and African nations through business, through trade, through commerce, through investment \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most significant ways that we can actually do that.\nCreating good-paying jobs, reducing inequity in our societies, dealing with the climate crisis, strengthening our health security.\u00a0 In these and so many ways, the private sector is driving the future, driving opportunity, driving the need of governments to address the challenges that our people face.\nSo we\u2019re taking an intentional approach to commercial diplomacy, and we\u2019re doing that in the spirit of partnership.\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced that will lead to the benefit of the African people, to the benefit of the American people, and ultimately to the benefit of people around the world.\nThank you so much for the engagement that you\u2019re showing, the work that you\u2019re doing every single day.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be able to meet this week in Washington.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a way of further energizing all of these efforts, but ultimately it\u2019s what\u2019s happening every day beyond here that\u2019s going to make a difference.\u00a0 And I hope that each of you leaves the summit when it\u2019s over further energized to build these partnerships, to build these relationships, to build this future together.\nThank you so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

		"content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So this is a very good occasion, but it\u2019s a particularly good occasion because we greatly value Ghana\u2019s leadership and your leadership in West Africa, the important efforts on regional security.\u00a0 We\u2019re strong partners, including on the UN Security Council, which we greatly value, partners for democracy and security in West Africa, and we greatly appreciate the peacekeeping contributions that Ghana makes, but also just more broadly your own leadership for peace, for security, for democracy.\u00a0 Many, many challenges, but we\u2019re grateful to actually be facing them together and really pleased to have you here this week for the summit.\u00a0 So thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Appreciate the time.\nPRESIDENT AKUFO-ADDO:\u00a0\u00a0So Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.\u00a0 I want to thank the American Government for the invitation to participate in this summit.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a summit that\u2019s been long overdue.\u00a0 I believe it\u2019s the second \u2013 the last time was, what, over 10 years ago.\u00a0 Perhaps we should be doing it more, but it\u2019s good that it has happened.\u00a0 It gives us an opportunity to talk about many common threats, challenges that we have which you\u2019ve identified, and particularly for us to be able to put into relief where we are.\u00a0 Yesterday I had an extremely \u2013 I was part of an extremely useful meeting with the people from the Congress to come and talk about security matters.\u00a0 Believe that the \u2013 madam, you were there, you were part of the meeting, and it\u2019s significant for us.\nAnd I think that beyond everything, there is a matter that I want to urge upon you.\u00a0 Today, Russian mercenaries are on our northern border.\u00a0 Burkina Faso has now entered into an arrangement to go along with Mali in employing the Wagner forces there.\u00a0 I believe a mine in southern Burkina has been allocated to them as a form of payment for their services.\u00a0 Prime minister of Burkina Faso in the last 10 days has been in Moscow.\u00a0 And to have them operating on our northern border is particularly distressing for us in Ghana.\nApart from not accepting the idea of great powers once again making Africa their theater of operation, we have a particular position that you know about over the Ukraine war, where we have been very, very vocal and up front about condemning the invasion of Russia \u2013 by Russia.\u00a0 And therefore, there now to have this group in our borders is a matter of some considerable disquiet and concern for us.\u00a0 We\u2019d really like to have a privileged opportunity to talk about its implications and what we believe ought to be the case.\nThis is what took place with the discussion in the Congress yesterday, which I found very fruitful.\u00a0 And I would like to \u2013 the themes of that discussion should be the themes that we should continue to address: to what extent we can have you as a partner in confronting these threats.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important that ECOWAS and the West African area remains a democratic space.\u00a0 It\u2019s the reason for the actions we took over the coup d\u2019etats in Burkina Faso, in Mali, and in Guinea.\u00a0 ECOWAS has been very consistent in refusing to deal with these governments because of the undemocratic nature of their accession to power.\nThe commitment to democratic values and institutions is a high priority for our states.\u00a0 We in Ghana have been through all kinds of arrangements, governance arrangements, in the past \u2013 one-party state, all kinds of experiments have taken place.\u00a0 And our people are now very clear in their mind.\u00a0 They want to go down the avenue of democratic engagement, and that is why the last 30 years of the Fourth Republic have been the most stable in our country\u2019s history.\u00a0 We want to do everything to preserve that, but there are enemies of democracy who are working hard in West Africa today.\u00a0 And therefore it\u2019s important that we bring that matter to your notice and see to what extent we can engage you as a reliable partner in the pushback of those forces.\nThere are other areas, of course, of great significance too \u2013 the cooperation for economic growth and \u2013 for the development and for the making of prosperity for our people, which is to some extent part and parcel of the same fight.\u00a0 If the young people have things to do, they\u2019re not going to be recruits for terrorist forces.\u00a0 So all of that is part and parcel, but specifically, what we can do about the terrorist threat in West Africa is now the major security concern of all our states, especially the coastal states that, up till now, till the last six months, have been relatively free of this threat.\u00a0 But now on all our common borders \u2013 Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote D\u2019Ivoire \u2013 are these forces that are operating there.\u00a0 We have to find a way to be able to respond and respond effectively to protect our populations (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\n\n",

And among the proof of this is the Francophone summit that was held on the island of Djerba, and it met resounding success in Tunisia, and it does bear witness to the fact that Tunisia is a Mediterranean country and it has always remained, as usual, to entertain good relations with the northern shore of Europe and with its allies in the United States of America as well.\nThis is a good opportunity to talk about the authenticity of the bonds tying the two countries.\u00a0 And yesterday, when I visited the Library of the Congress, I talked about the longstanding relations that exist between both countries.\u00a0 I also talked about the recognition of Tunisia of the United States of America after the independence, and also I talked about the recognition of the United States Government of the Tunisian independence as one of the first countries.\u00a0 And this is in addition to what the United States has done before that in supporting the independence of Tunisia.\u00a0 And the visits have been so many to the United States ever since, where we have enjoyed huge support for the Tunisian independence after that.\u00a0 We shall not forget this at all.\nTunisia did enjoy full support from the United States, especially in the areas of health and education, either directly from the United States Government or notably with the World Bank group, and also the USAID between the two countries.\nIt was a real revolution in Tunisia through education and through the entrusting by the state of the public\u00a0\u2013 the major public services.\u00a0 Indeed, we have the impact of this revolution at the level of education, at the level of health.\u00a0 And when the public authorities were entrusted with the major commodities which are part and parcel of the human rights by the end of the day.\u00a0 We also talked about the authentic relations that has existed ever since, and I have brought with me here a certain number of documents from Tunisia about the first American flag, how it was made to show how the countries are built and how the nations are built as well.\u00a0 I also reiterated the preamble and American constitution, some short sentences, but quite meaningful to achieve the joy and the happiness of people.\nAnd yesterday I talked about this.\u00a0 And as the lady we met, the counselor for Social Security for President Jimmy Carter, he said, well, I\u2019m not looking for the PNB, but we\u2019re looking for the BNB, that is, the gross national happiness.\u00a0 The words that we are looking for, the international \u2013 the gross international happiness, be it at the international or national levels.\nFor Tunisia, its international experience is quite authentic and deeply rooted in our history.\u00a0 We had constitutions from Carthage to the fundamental pact in 1861, and the first constitution to be drafted in the Arab world and that dates back to 1861.\u00a0 After that, we witnessed the era during which Tunisian nationals asked for constitution to guarantee the rights and liberties and to pave the way for the nation.\u00a0 And this has been achieved eventually \u2013 after independence on the 1st of June 1959, more specifically.\nAnd after the revolution and after the boom that Tunisia witnessed in 2010 and 2011, we have thought seriously of drafting constitution.\u00a0 But the \u2013 unfortunately the constitution that was drafted, it was quite customized to serve the needs of a specific category.\u00a0 It\u2019s as if it was a garment or a pair of shoes, and that was the outcome of the election and the ballots that were adopted, which was the ballot on the list, by implementing the representative \u2013 the partial representativity and the biggest residue.\u00a0 And as (inaudible) said in France when we adopted this kind of ballot system, he said that it is the ballot of shame.\u00a0 We were voting in the dark, and nobody was aware of the outcome of these elections.\nUnfortunately, rather than meeting the needs of the Tunisians at that time, and especially in economic and social terms \u2013 because there were some economic and social terms which are quite hard up to this very moment.\u00a0 And things have also exacerbated.\u00a0 And then we have also adopted constitution to serve the authority, and this has broken down, unfortunately, all of the political institutions.\u00a0 More than that, we have a corruption that has exacerbated \u2013 let me mention here with regards to the low \u2013 related to the supreme \u2013 the constitutional court in Tunisia, the only voice in the assembly who was sold for 150,000 dinars \u2013 about 100,000 dollars \u2013 that\u2019s for one seat, and there were a number \u2013 I say this to my friends who saw that to unveil the truth.\u00a0 There were a number of MPs whose immunity has been lifted after the 25th of July.\u00a0 They were members of the smuggling networks and they were deep involved in a moral crisis and issues.\u00a0 This is in addition to the funds that were distributed on the occasion of making every rule, every project.\nThe economic situation, and the financial situation, and the corruption, and notably the blows that were dealt to the justice system, because the best way is legal and independent justice, but here, unfortunately, these people were involved in the courts.\u00a0 And as one of the French writers said \u2013 here I\u2019m talking about the French experience specifically, and he expressed himself in French \u2013 when the politics does of course come into the territory, justice would come out, and this \u2013 when the politicians would sit on the armchairs, people would exacerbate, and of course, (inaudible) would leave its premises and it\u2019d be transformed into problems of retaliation and reprisals.\u00a0 We wouldn\u2019t like to be a court of retaliation or of reprisals, but we would like a court that is based on justice and equity.\nAnd on several occasions, I use this opportunity to ask you to visit us in Carthage, Tunisia.\u00a0 We did receive so many MPs in Carthage asking to dissolve the parliament.\u00a0 One of them were bleeding in the front head, and about 10 \u2013 I don\u2019t memorize the number, but many of them from the MPs, they were asking to dissolve the parliament.\u00a0 This is in addition to the fact that the claims that came from the Tunisian nationals at that time wherever I went, they were all asking to dissolve the parliament.\nSo I eventually decided to dissolve the parliament.\u00a0 That was not feasible for me because I would like to abide by the constitution that was adopted in 2014, so I decided to rather freeze the parliament at that time.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because the country was on the brink of civil war all over the country, so I had no other alternative but to save the Tunisian nation from undertaking any nasty action.\nAnd let me mention here that on the 24th of June, I \u2013 2021 \u2013 I went to visit one of the cities, the city of Redeyef in the government of Gafsa in the south of \u2013 the southwest of Tunisia.\u00a0 I went to see that, and it was hit by the COVID-19 that was widespread at that time.\u00a0 I went to visit a public hospital.\u00a0 In that hospital there was no water, and no electricity, and no oxygen.\u00a0 This is on the 25th of July, and, of course, I was using the legal devices available at that time, but they were trying to buy out the harms and the illnesses of people, and, of course, the media were simply mentioning the number of victims on the 25th of July, and I was of course quite sad about this.\u00a0 And I couldn\u2019t even accept people to die in front of my eyes when other people are playing havoc with the Tunisian institutions.\nSo I took the decision on the basis of article 80 of the constitution of 2014 to freeze the action of the parliament, and I also invited the head of government \u2013 I told him I would like to be present on my side here to preserve your dignity.\u00a0 But on the basis of the constitution, I have to take advice, so I took advice, the opinion of the speaker, because he was quite old.\u00a0 And I phoned him so that \u2013 to avoid his moving to the palace.\u00a0 That was 8:00 p.m.\u00a0 So I told him that I\u2019m going to use article 80 and dissolve the parliament, and to take some exceptional measures in this regard.\nPeople took out to the street on that very night, on the 25th of July, 2011.\u00a0 They were so happy and so joyful, as if they were getting rid of a real nightmare.\u00a0 And the situations at that time remained as they are.\u00a0 And what do these people did?\u00a0 They organized a totally unacceptable decision by all standards.\n(Ends in progress.)\n\n",

see shortly \u2013 joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and also President Bazoum and President Talon, our dear partners from Niger and Benin.\u00a0 And thank you all so much for joining us today.\nI\u2019m just thrilled to be here at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, working alongside leaders from both sides of the Atlantic as we work together to strengthen partnerships between the United States and all of our dear friends on the continent of Africa.\nAnd that is what this summit is all about: to refresh, to recommit, and to strengthen our partnerships; to pursue opportunities, and to solve the complex, integrated challenges that lie ahead of us, together \u2013 opportunities such as increasing trade and connecting markets and moving goods across borders, and challenges such as security, governance, and political reform.\nWe are here today because MCC has and always will listen to our partners on the continent.\u00a0 Our partners want regional integration for trade, for economic growth, to increase the flow of goods across borders, and to create more economic opportunities for their citizens.\u00a0 In 2018, MCC \u2013 my agency \u2013 sought an additional authority, and it\u2019s a special authority, and it\u2019s an authority that allows us to enter into regional compacts.\u00a0 And that is exactly what our partners were asking.\nThis authority is complex, and it involves working with several countries at a time.\u00a0 And today, we are deeply honored to be working with two of our critical partners: Benin and Niger.\u00a0 And today marks a historical first, because today we will be signing our first regional compact under this very important authority.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe compact will involve $504 million and will be further supported by contributions of $15 million each from Benin and Niger.\u00a0 And entering into this regional compact, MCC will be building on the longstanding relationships that we\u2019ve already had with both countries, which involves some $1.1 billion of investment in critical sectors such as agriculture, irrigation, and energy.\nThe Benin-Niger Regional Compact will strengthen regional economic collaboration and advance the goals of the African Continental Free Trade Area.\u00a0 By rehabilitating one of the most heavily traveled corridors in West Africa, the compact will give a big boost to the people and the businesses whose livelihoods and futures depend on the flow of goods between Niamey and Cotonou as an economic lifeline.\nAll told, the compact is expected to benefit at least 1.2 million people on both sides of the border.\u00a0 And it could benefit even more people if you, our friends in the business community, joined us as partners to extend the network and further its impact.\u00a0 The United States is so proud to partner with both Benin and Niger.\u00a0 I want to thank the staff at MCC and our dear counterparts in Benin and Niger for their tremendous work in reaching this historic moment.\nI look forward to working with all of you to ensure that this investment delivers on its enormous potential to give the people of Benin and Niger the tools they need to build a more prosperous future.\nThank you so much for joining us.\u00a0 I\u2019m so excited to be with you all today on what is a very historic day.\u00a0 But first it is my distinct honor to introduce my dear friend and the U.S. Secretary of State, Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the stage to share his remarks with you.\u00a0 Secretary of State Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 You\u2019ve heard from CEO Albright about what is truly an innovative initiative, and I want to say a few words about it this morning.\u00a0 But before I do, Alice, to you, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your extraordinary leadership of the MCC.\u00a0 This is in so many ways for us around the world where the rubber meets the road in actually having concrete projects that are making a concrete difference in the lives of millions of people.\u00a0 And I could not be more proud and enthusiastic about the work that MCC is doing under your leadership.\u00a0 Alice, thank you.\nPresident Talon, President Bazoum, we are thrilled to launch this new partnership with you today.\u00a0 As Alice said, this is unprecedented for the MCC \u2013 a historic step for our relationship with two important partners.\u00a0 Today, we\u2019re signing joint MCC compacts with Benin and Niger \u2013 the first time, as you\u2019ve heard from Alice, that the two countries will collaborate with the MCC, to tackle an issue that reaches across their borders.\nBenin and Niger are two of the fastest growing economies\u00a0in Sub-Saharan Africa.\u00a0 Their partnership will support growth.\u00a0 It\u2019ll strengthen trade and transportation infrastructure and connect their nations, their industries, and their people.\nAnd as many of you know, one of the tremendous opportunities in Africa \u2013 but that extends beyond Africa \u2013 is building connectivity within Africa.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve seen over the years, Africa has more trade with countries outside of Africa than it does within Africa itself.\u00a0 That\u2019s not normal.\u00a0 This connectivity will help change that.\u00a0 As this group knows well, the port in Benin is critical to the economy of West Africa, the Cotonou port.\u00a0 For Benin, it\u2019s a major source of revenue, facilitating international trade, allowing the export of its products.\u00a0 For neighboring countries like Niger, this port is the main gateway for exporting goods to markets around the world, as well as for importing vital products, including food and cooking oil.\u00a0 The corridors that allow products to move between Niger and Benin, these form a critical foundation for business and also of livelihoods.\nThe MCC compacts will invest more than half a billion dollars in that infrastructure, and they\u2019ll do it with grants, which means that they won\u2019t saddle governments with debt.\u00a0 The projects will bear the hallmarks of America\u2019s partnership.\u00a0 They\u2019ll be transparent, they\u2019ll be high quality, they\u2019ll be accountable to the people that they mean to serve, and they\u2019ll also support good governance.\u00a0 When completed, these projects will make it faster and safer to transport goods along roads and across borders, and they\u2019ll connect Benin and Niger to bigger markets and greater opportunities.\u00a0 These are developments that in turn can help economies grow sustainably and equitably and deliver meaningful pathways to prosperity for hundreds of thousands, if not more, people.\nAt this week\u2019s U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, we\u2019ve made it a priority to mobilize these kinds of investments because we know that this is how you create real, tangible benefits for people on both sides of the Atlantic.\u00a0 We\u2019re pursuing these investments together alongside African nations as genuine partners.\u00a0 That\u2019s the foundation of our administration\u2019s strategy for the region, and it\u2019s also a core pillar of the MCC model.\u00a0 These new compacts were designed by Benin and Niger thanks to the efforts of President Talon, President Bazoum, partners across their governments and societies.\u00a0 They\u2019re funded in part, as you\u2019ve heard, by these countries.\u00a0 The implementation will be led by them as well.\u00a0 That\u2019s the best way to combine our strengths, to maximize our resources, to reach our shared goals.\nIn short, to create real change, we need real partnerships just like the one we\u2019re announcing and signing today.\u00a0 So I wanted to come simply to say\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to everyone involved.\u00a0 This is a milestone; this is innovation.\u00a0 I think it points the way forward as well for many of the projects that MCC will undertake, and it certainly points the way forward for Africa and for our friends in Benin and Niger.\u00a0 To everyone here, thank you for joining this morning and thank you for your own engagement.\u00a0 The opportunity is immense.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to put in place the means, the methods by which to actually seize it.\u00a0 Thank you very much. \u00a0(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Your Excellencies, honored guests, please welcome Patrice Talon, president of the Republic of Benin. \u00a0(Applause.)\nPRESIDENT TALON:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Dear participants, madam head of MCC, Mr. Secretary of State, it\u2019s a real pleasure for me to be the beneficiary and the test \u2013 the actor in this regional compact, which gives more dynamic to the cooperation between the United States and Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s a major innovation that we see in international cooperation and in cooperation between the U.S. and Benin and our brother country Niger.\nAs the Secretary of State has just said, this is an innovation that should be noted because it will help to bring together two neighboring countries to make the space more attractive to businesspeople.\u00a0 Africa is very large but some countries are fairly small markets, and so the attraction for the business world is small.\u00a0 And if we increase our collaboration among African countries, countries that have small markets, this is a great way to increase the attractiveness of our countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the compact which will be signed represents a major innovation.\nI want to ask MCC and Madam Albright to ask her to persevere along those lines so that soon we will be able to sign compacts aimed at promoting investments, U.S. private investments, in our country, because we note, in spite of all the efforts made by the countries\u00a0to improve climate, the climate environment, that the number of private businesspeople from the United States in Africa is low.\u00a0 So we need to improve our attractiveness and the \u2013 this kinds of compact can promote investment in our country, because development cannot come only from investments in infrastructures and in investments in other basic needs for development, but to \u2013 for the growth to be real, we need private sector investment.\u00a0 That\u2019s the only way to have sustainable development.\nI will end by saying that the attractiveness of Africa must be an element in the relationship between the U.S. and all our countries so the private sector will take over from other governments trying to promote the \u2013 our economies.\u00a0 Thank you very much to the United States.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Your Excellencies, honored guests, please welcome Mohamed Bazoum, president of the Republic of Niger.\nPRESIDENT BAZOUM:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Mr. President of Benin, dear friends, Mr. Secretary of State, Madam Alice Albright from MCC, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say how happy I am to participate in this signature in a few moments, the signature which launches this regional compact between Niger and Benin.\u00a0 Benin is a strategic partner for the development of Niger because the port of Cotonou is the closest port of \u2013 from Niamey.\u00a0 It\u2019s a thousand kilometers from Niamey.\u00a0 And for a long time, we\u2019ve considered that this is our natural port, and we\u2019ve developed all the necessary instruments so that we can have relationships that make the economy of Niger viable by linking \u2013 by basing our efforts on this corridor that links us to Benin.\nAnd you, our U.S. partners, understood this.\u00a0 And so that we \u2013 they made sure that we could have quality infrastructure between our two countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re at the end of the \u2013 a Nigerien compact that has already invested a lot in the road infrastructure, and the \u2013 this regional compact will complete what\u2019s already been done.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to hear \u2013 render homage to the cooperation of \u2013 between the U.S. and Niger, and the cooperation between the U.S. and our two countries.\u00a0 There\u2019ll be investments in infrastructures, but there will be also institutional reforms, which will be implemented in order to increase the flow of trade and the contacts between our two countries.\nThe U.S. Government will \u2013 is in fact meeting our desires and determination, and this is another reason for which we consider that we are facing a partner which pays attention to our expectation and helps us realize our own interest.\u00a0 That is why, madam, I\u2019d like to thank you and tell you how committed we are to make sure that the infrastructures and the reforms which will be carried out will be carried out in the best way possible so that we can strengthen relationships between Benin and Niger.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The compact was signed.)\n(Applause.)\n\n",

So here\u2019s how we\u2019re addressing this crisis together.\nFirst, we are partnering to conserve ecosystems.\u00a0 Africa is home to some of the world\u2019s most precious ecosystems, which are critical for combating climate change.\u00a0 This summer I visited the Democratic Republic of Congo, where forests absorb more carbon than is emitted by the entire continent of Africa.\u00a0 The Congo Basin is also a place of tremendous biodiversity, a lifeforce for agriculture across the region.\nTo support the sustainable management of the Congo Basin rainforest, we\u2019ve invested over $600 million in the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment, which brings together the U.S. Government and African and U.S. NGOs.\nAnd we\u2019re building new coalitions between African governments, the private sector, civil society to protect other vital ecosystems across the continent.\nOceans are also a key part of this fight.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019ve launched the Ocean Conservation Pledge to encourage countries to commit to protect at least 30 percent of their ocean waters by the year 2030.\nSecond, we\u2019re partnering to make commitments and communities more resilient in the face of climate change.\u00a0 The President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience is working with national governments to help more than half a billion people in developing countries manage the impacts of climate change.\u00a0 This and other initiatives to support climate-resilient agriculture are increasingly critical as Russia\u2019s war of aggression compounds the impact on food security.\nAt COP, the President also announced a doubling of our pledged contributions to the Adaptation Fund, which has deployed nearly $1 billion to help over 36 million people in the most vulnerable communities around the world.\u00a0 And we committed to begin discussions on loss and damage funding arrangements to support low- and middle-income countries.\nThird, we\u2019re partnering to advance a just transition to a clean energy economy that both saves our planet and fosters inclusive economic opportunity.\nAfrica will be at the center of the clean energy transition.\u00a0 Its renewable energy potential is second to none.\u00a0 It\u2019s home to roughly a third of all critical minerals, essential to the technology that will power the clean energy economy, like batteries for renewable energy storage and wind turbines.\u00a0 But with nearly half of Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population lacking reliable access to electricity and the population set to grow to more than two billion people by 2050, how that transition is made will be decisive in shaping our future climate.\nThe United States will work closely with African countries as they determine how best to meet their specific energy needs \u2013 understanding that, for many, the clean energy transition will be a transition to consistent, reliable energy in the first place.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do so through programs like Power Africa, which has mobilized the public and private sectors to deliver cleaner, more reliable electricity to over 165 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa who previously didn\u2019t have access.\u00a0 We\u2019re proud to announce a new investment of $290 million in that program.\nToo often, those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of these changes have been denied a seat at the decision-making table.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to changing that, including through the new Accelerating Women\u2019s Empowerment in Energy project, which is making sure that women have a say in how their countries move forward on clean energy.\nAll of these efforts recognize that combating the climate crisis, like so many other challenges we face, was actually championed by Africans in the first place.\u00a0 Indeed, in Africa, we see not only the stakes of this crisis, but also the solutions.\u00a0 Gabon has led the way in conserving its forest resources, which now absorb 140 million tons of CO2 every year.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of taking 30 million cars off the road.\nThe Seychelles has pioneered the world\u2019s first sovereign blue bond to marshal public and private investment for sustainable marine and fisheries projects.\u00a0 It\u2019s on the way to conserving 30 percent of its ocean waters \u2013 that\u2019s an area the size of Zimbabwe \u2013 by 2030.\nZambia is harnessing the power of its wetlands and forests to mitigate climate impacts, benefiting tens of thousands of people vulnerable to both floods and to droughts.\nNigeria has set bold targets and robust regulations for methane reductions \u2013 the first country in Africa to do so \u2013 which could reduce air pollutants by a third and avert tens of thousands of deaths.\nEquatorial Guinea just raised its commitment to cut emissions by 35 percent by 2030.\u00a0 And the DRC has hosted the pre-COP27 meetings in Kinshahsa.\u00a0 It\u2019s teaming up with the United States on a broad scope of these issues through our Sustainable Development Solutions Working Group.\nToday, and throughout this summit over the course of this week, I look forward to hearing from this group on how we can most effectively deepen our partnership to the benefit of all of our people, and indeed to the benefit of people around the world.\u00a0 And I look forward to continuing this conversation in the months and also the years to come.\u00a0 This is an enduring project for all of us, but I think we also all feel the fierce urgency of now.\u00a0 And that determination is reflected in so much of the work that is being done and is being represented in this room.\nWith that, it is a pleasure and honor to turn the floor over to President Tshisekedi to offer some remarks.\u00a0 Mr. President, the floor is now yours.\n",

\u00a0How do we build together on that basis?\u00a0 That\u2019s one critically important thing, and it animates everything we\u2019re doing.\nSecond, we\u2019re looking at making genuine investments because, again, a response to the immediate is necessary, but it is insufficient and it\u2019s not a long-term solution.\u00a0 We\u2019re dealing now with a massive food insecurity crisis.\u00a0 It\u2019s the product of a lot of things, as we all know.\u00a0 It\u2019s the product of climate change.\u00a0 It\u2019s the product of COVID.\u00a0 It\u2019s a product, unfortunately, of conflict, including Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 And so we have an immediate emergency response, especially as we\u2019re looking at historic, alas, droughts in different places.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at famine conditions in a number of countries, and the United States has been leading the way on that.\nBut what I have heard time and again, especially talking to African colleagues \u2013 we brought together leaders from around the world back in May at the Security Council, when we were in the presidency of the Security Council, and focused on food insecurity.\u00a0 And in a session that I had with African colleagues the thing I heard again and again and again is, yes, we need to address the emergency situation, but what we want even more is a genuine investment in our own productive capacity and our own self-sufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0 So that\u2019s driving, for example, the Feed the Future program that we have.\u00a0 It\u2019s driving a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing around the world.\nSame thing on global health.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019ve gone through this pandemic, and what we know from that is it\u2019s insufficient simply to deal with the immediate challenge.\u00a0 We have to help put in place \u2013 and have to help Africa put in place \u2013 the foundations to be able to deal with that themselves going forward, so that there\u2019s not a reliance on others to build the productive capacity.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve helped establish, from South Africa to Senegal, the capacity to, for example, produce vaccines in Africa for Africans.\nWe\u2019re investing in young people.\u00a0 As everyone knows, the majority of the population in Africa is young.\u00a0 We have been going back to initiatives that President Obama started invested in young African leaders.\u00a0 There are now 700,000 young Africans who are part of the YALI Network virtually.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredibly powerful because it\u2019s building connections between them, among them, and building out partnerships for the future.\u00a0 A big piece of this is the investments we\u2019re making in women and girls, something we can talk about at greater length.\nAnd then finally, I would say that there\u2019s no one model of good governance.\u00a0 There\u2019s no one model for how to build strong institutions.\u00a0 I think we have to be informed by each other.\u00a0 We have to be informed by local conditions, local needs.\u00a0 And from the perspective of the United States, this is also not about a competition with others.\u00a0 This is not about saying to our friends and partners you have to choose.\u00a0 This is about offering a genuine choice, offering a genuine partnership, and hopefully together building a race to the top, not a race to the bottom.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re animated by.\u00a0 We put out a Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa a few months ago, and it really does bring together the three pieces that are represented here.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is this.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting, when you\u2019re in the Situation Room, as you know very well, oftentimes the diplomats are saying gosh, we could use a little bit more defense and security or a little bit more development, and then the secretary of defense is saying we need some more diplomacy to deal with this.\u00a0 And so we\u2019re constantly playing off of each other, but it\u2019s really increasingly in response to what we\u2019re hearing from our friends, from our colleagues, from our partners.\u00a0 That\u2019s what animating us.\u00a0 That\u2019s the only way I think we\u2019re going to be successful in building this plane as our friends are flying it at 60,000 feet.\nMS FRAZER:\u00a0 Yes. \u00a0Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken, and thank you very much for putting the emphasis on the quality of the partnership, the content of that partnership, the nature of that partnership, and what the United States is doing to build it with all of Africa.\n",

The Secretary of Defense and I are very pleased to welcome President Louren\u00e7o. The United States places a great importance on the relationship with Angola, a relationship that has grown stronger and stronger, particularly under your leadership.\nAnd Mr. President, we also greatly appreciate the leadership that Angola is showing in the region, trying to end conflicts, to bring peace, particularly when it comes to the situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Our own partnership has grown, as I said, even stronger, the trade and investment ties growing ever deeper. We have cutting-edge American companies, including Sun Africa, working in Angola on cutting-edge projects. And of course, we\u2019re also deepening our security ties.\nSo we\u2019re very grateful to have you here in Washington for the leaders summit and also for this opportunity today to talk about the many challenges and opportunities that we face together.\nLloyd.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0Well, thank you, Secretary Blinken, President Louren\u00e7o. Let me add my voice to Secretary Blinken and his comments in terms of welcoming you to the United States. We\u2019re really glad to have you here at the summit.\nThe Department of Defense values our growing partnership with Angola. We recognize that African leadership remains key to strengthening peace, security, and governance across the continent and beyond. This is the defining challenge of our time. Angola is a key leader on the continent.\nAnd I understand that Angola is looking to restructure its military. We look forward to partnering with you on this effort. We\u2019re pleased to hear that Angola is interested in possible purchases from the United States and we\u2019re working with the Department of State to respond to your request.\nWe deeply appreciate your leadership and your friendship, and I look forward to today\u2019s discussion. And again, sir, welcome to the United States.\nPRESIDENT LOUREN\u00c7O:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Secretary Antony Blinken, the Secretary of Defense General Lloyd, distinguished representatives of the U.S. Government. I\u2019m very honored to be here today in your presence and following the invitation extended by President Biden to a number of African leaders, including Angola. We will seize this opportunity of our stay here in order to seek to strengthen further our bonds of friendship and cooperation between our two countries. Angola has been showing very positive signs that we are very interested in strengthening our cooperation with the U.S., so do not doubt about our good intentions with regard to these very responsive step that we\u2019re taking if we are to look into the historic past of our relationships.\nSo there is a gamechanger. We may say it\u2019s significant, and this is in the interest of the \u2013 of both parties, the interest of Angola and that of the United States of America. Angola is a country that is well located geographically because we are part at least of three regions of the country. We are SADC member-states, the Southern African Development Community. We are also members of the Central African Economic Community. We are also part of the Great Lakes region and we are chairing the conference on the Great Lakes region for the second time. So our joint strategic positioning is to be taken into account.\nAnd also, if we are to mention the importance of the reforms that we are conducting, both economic, political reforms in order to attract investment and entice foreign investors, especially the U.S. investors, to invest in Angola, there are already some success cases apart from those investment in the oil sector, which is traditional for decades. But there are new players that are starting to venture in different sectors such as telecommunications, solar energy production.\nWe had a success case in the center of the country in Benguela Province, where we have two big power stations that are already producing electricity. And there is also a pledge of about $2 billion for Sun Africa company in order to develop a giant project that will bring electricity to almost all the southern part of Angola in the provinces of Namibe, Huila, Cunene, and Cuando Cubango. And, of course, the surplus will be brought into the national power grid and benefit the other regions of the country.\nSo U.S. investors mostly will come to Angola to invest in all those fields of their interest without any exception, not only in the energy sector, not only in exploration of mineral resources of all sorts, including diamond and others, which are precious minerals, rare earth. In all those areas, the U.S. investment is mostly welcome. This includes also telecommunication, ICTs, 5G. We hope that the U.S. businesses can take heed of 5G in Angola, which is important for our development.\nWe are promoting three big duty-free zones, namely in Cabinda next to the Caio seaport that would be the biggest deep water port in the Central Africa region, which will be ready by end 2023 or early 2024, the port itself. But around the port we are going to develop the free trade zone, and certainly we count on U.S. investment in these projects as well.\nAnother duty-free zone which will arouse the interest of American investors is the Barra do Dande, which is a few kilometers from Luanda. It\u2019s an old project that has not yet kickstart, but\u00a0this time we are determined in order to take it forward. And the public tender had been opened already, and it\u2019s time for the companies also to present their bids.\nAt the end of 2023, we are going to complete the construction and also the functioning of the new international airport of Luanda named after the first president of Angola, Ant\u00f3nio Agostinho Neto. It is a port that will move about 15 million passengers per year, 50 million tons of cargo per year, so that will make a difference with regard to the air transportation in the region. Also, the emergence of this new airport will make us resume a project which is in the pipeline. I\u2019m talking about the purchase of new aircraft from Boeing, which \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0Mr. President, if I could, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt \u2013 maybe we\u2019ll let our colleagues from the media depart, and we can continue the meeting in more detail. I\u2019m sorry for interrupting. Thank you.\n\n",

thrilled to have you here at the State Department.\nNow, I have not heard or seen this room this animated in the two years that I\u2019ve been here.\u00a0 So there\u2019s something in the water.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBy the way, you\u2019re in the Ben Franklin Room.\u00a0 You can see Ben looking down on us over there.\u00a0 He was America\u2019s very first diplomat.\u00a0 He signed our first treaty.\u00a0 He charted the Gulf Stream.\u00a0 He pioneered electricity.\u00a0 He gave us our ethos of self-government.\u00a0 And none of this did he do while sober.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So please feel inspired.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nLet me begin by thanking our extraordinary emcee for this evening, Yvonne Orji. \u00a0Yvonne, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Nothing makes you more insecure \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 than having to follow Yvonne on stage.\nYvonne once wrote that, \u201cNigeria made me. \u00a0America raised me.\u201d \u00a0We often say that one of America\u2019s greatest strengths is our diversity \u2013 there are few greater testaments to that than the immense contributions of the African diaspora community, which is clearly out in force tonight.\u00a0 It is great to have you here.\nThere are so many other folks here I\u2019d like to thank this evening: Dorothy McAuliffe and our incredible Office of Global Partnerships; the entire Prosper Africa Initiative team; our co-sponsors \u2013 Tony, thank you so much for everything you\u2019ve done; Google, James; an incredible cast of friends, partners.\nNow, I\u2019m a native New Yorker.\u00a0 So my mayor is here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if Mayor Bowser is here.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know \u2013 from Washington.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve also spent a lot of time as a resident of the District of Columbia \u2013 another great mayor.\u00a0 Mayor Bowser, I think, was with us tonight.\u00a0 And I really want to thank the judges of our pitch competition, including Idris Elba.\u00a0 Idris, you here?\u00a0 You\u2019re here somewhere \u2013 was here.\nAnd to the remarkable competitors, know this: if you can survive a pitch competition with Stringer Bell, you can survive anything. \u00a0(Laughter.)\nSo it is fitting that we are kicking off a week focused on deepening our ties with African countries and people with this inspiring group \u2013 innovators, entrepreneurs, young people.\nEarlier this year in South Africa, I had an opportunity to set out our administration\u2019s strategy for the region. \u00a0And at its core, the strategy can be distilled in one word.\u00a0 You\u2019ve already heard it spoken tonight: partnership.\nIt\u2019s rooted in the recognition that the United States and African nations can\u2019t deliver on any of our fundamental needs and aspirations for our people, and we can\u2019t solve any of the really big challenges we face, if we don\u2019t work together. \u00a0So it\u2019s about what we can do with African nations and people \u2013 not for them.\nOur strategy reflects the region\u2019s diversity, its influence, and \u2013 as we can see tonight \u2013 the ingenuity of its young people.\nYou all know this.\u00a0 Those youth are a growing part of the continent\u2019s population \u2013 and also the world\u2019s. \u00a0Today, more than 60 percent of Africa\u2019s population is under the age of 25. \u00a0By 2030, two in every five people on this planet will be African. \u00a0These rising generations are powering dynamic economic growth in their countries and far beyond. \u00a02016 \u2013 just a few years ago \u2013 African startups raised $350 million dollars in investment; last year, they raised $5 billion in investment \u2013 and that\u2019s a curve that\u2019s going to keep going up and up and up.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, it\u2019s one thing to rattle off statistics; it\u2019s another thing to meet these changemakers, as I\u2019ve had the chance to do as Secretary, from Dakar to Johannesburg, from Nairobi to Kinshasa.\nMuch like the founders who took part in tonight\u2019s pitch competition, these entrepreneurs are not just running successful businesses. \u00a0They\u2019re actually solving some of our most vexing problems, like closing enduring gaps in health care, helping entrepreneurs break into the formal economy.\nWe have a huge stake in the success of African innovators. \u00a0Because when they are empowered to reach their full potential \u2013 it\u2019s good for the region, it\u2019s good for the continent, it\u2019s good for the world, it\u2019s good for America.\nIdris said it best:\u00a0 Africa doesn\u2019t need aid, it needs innovation.\nSo tonight, let me just very quickly go through three ways our administration is working to broaden and deepen those partnerships to foster African innovation.\nFirst, we\u2019re investing in the infrastructure that provides the foundation for African entrepreneurship. \u00a0That means creating more pathways for the free flow of ideas, of information, of investment, which in the 21st century requires one thing: digital connectivity.\nLet me give you one example. \u00a0Africa has around twice as many internet users as the United States, yet the continent has only a fraction of our data center space.\u00a0 What does that mean?\u00a0 Slower, less reliable connectivity. \u00a0That\u2019s why our U.S. Development Finance Corporation is investing $300 million in building data centers across the continent \u2013 because we need networks that can keep up with the lightning pace of new ideas.\nSecond, we\u2019re investing in rising leaders. \u00a0Since President Obama created the Young African Leaders Initiative, nearly 5,800 trailblazers from every country in Sub-Saharan Africa have come to the United States for academic and leadership training \u2013 developing skills, relationships that are going to last them a lifetime, to the benefit of their communities but also ours.\nMany of the Mandela Washington Fellows are entrepreneurs, including alum Abel Hailegiorgis from Ethiopia, who\u2019s here tonight.\u00a0 Abel\u2019s company is building bicycles and wheelchairs from bamboo, which is stronger than steel \u2013 there you are right there \u2013 sustaining our planet, supporting local farmers and local manufacturers.\nThat\u2019s not all. \u00a0In September, the U.S. African Development Foundation teamed up with the Tony Elumelu Foundation to create a new program to provide financing, technical assistance, and mentorship to emerging innovators in Africa. \u00a0We recently launched another initiative to connect up-and-coming climate entrepreneurs with American companies.\nThird, we are fostering greater engagement by American companies. \u00a0You\u2019re going to hear more about that throughout this week.\u00a0 The U.S. private sector already invests more than $4 in Africa for every dollar that our government allocates to the region in foreign assistance \u2013 and it wants to do more. \u00a0That\u2019s the objective of our Office of Global Partnerships, which will take a U.S. private sector delegation to Ghana in February. \u00a0It\u2019s the goal of the Prosper Africa initiative \u2013 which is marshalling agencies from across our government to help more U.S. companies and inventors \u2013 investors, excuse me, do business in Africa, and do it in a way that promotes inclusive growth \u2013 growth that\u2019s sustainable for our planet.\nSo tonight we\u2019re joined by Prosper Africa\u2019s institutional investor delegation.\u00a0 It manages more than a trillion dollars in savings for American workers and retirees. \u00a0The delegation recently helped a group U.S. \u2013 of U.S. pension funds, including those of teachers from Chicago, city workers from Hartford and Philadelphia, invest more than $85 million in an African fund that will provide financing to small businesses and entrepreneurs.\nOne more bite-sized example.\u00a0 Several of the items on the menu prepared tonight by Chef Pierre were made using a grain called fonio.\u00a0 Farmed primarily in the Sahel, it\u2019s what your mom cooked for you when you were growing up.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So through a partnership with Prosper Africa, Pierre\u2019s company \u2013 Yol\u00e9l\u00e9 \u2013 is distributing fonio and other products made by small farmers in the region to markets here in the United States \u2013 including at the Whole Foods that\u2019s just a few blocks from where we are this evening.\u00a0 In a region where it\u2019s getting harder to grow crops due to a warming climate, fonio\u2019s deep roots make it virtually drought-resistant. \u00a0Now, in West Africa, it\u2019s also said that \u201cFonio never embarrasses the cook,\u201d which is good news if \u2013 like me \u2013 you\u2019re no Pierre in the kitchen.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo thank you all for being here tonight.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for helping us kick off an incredible week.\u00a0 And more importantly, thank you for all you\u2019re doing working with us to deepen America\u2019s partnerships with African nations \u2013 partnership that has shaped our past, is shaping our present, and will \u2013 will \u2013 shape our future.\nHave a wonderful evening.\u00a0 Have a wonderful week.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n",

by our Congress.\nThis humanitarian aid saves lives and alleviates suffering, and upholds human dignity for tens of millions of forcibly displaced persons, crisis-affected people around the world, including refugees, victims of conflict, stateless persons, and vulnerable migrants.\u00a0 As a career Foreign Service officer, I am so proud to lead the many talented professionals in our bureau, and as the daughter of refuges myself, I am humbled by this responsibility.\nFor both professional and personal reasons, I am so proud of the initiative that we\u2019re here to launch today.\nMr. Secretary, I would like to introduce Hamdi Ulukaya.\u00a0 As many people know, Hamdi, who hails from Turkey, founded Chobani in 2005 with the mission of making better food accessible to more people while improving local conditions.\u00a0 Hamdi is also a devoted philanthropist, and he founded the Tent Partnership for Refugees in 2016.\u00a0 Under his leadership and supported by his team\u2019s dedication in the years since, Tent\u2019s network today now tops 300 companies.\u00a0 They are all committed to providing tens of thousands of refugees with work, training, and mentorship opportunities in order to improve their economic security and facilitate their integration into our country and other countries.\nWhen Hamdi and I first met this past summer, we shared a vision of advancing the potential and the possibility of refugees worldwide by harnessing their talents and their dedication through private sector opportunities.\u00a0 This new partnership will capitalize on our mutual vision and capabilities, and it\u2019s been months in the making and I am so excited to see where it will lead us.\nI\u2019d also like to introduce Mr. Abdul Nasir Rahimi.\u00a0 I had the great pleasure of meeting Abdul in New York at Tent\u2019s summit for business on the margins of the UN General Assembly in September.\u00a0 His story is only one of those that have been impacted by Tent\u2019s work and the commitments of its member businesses, and I\u2019m so happy he could be here today.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to see you again, Abdul.\nAnd without further ado, Mr. Secretary, the floor is yours.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, Julieta, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you for the introduction, but especially thank you for the work that you and your amazing team are doing every single day to stand for and to stand with those who are persecuted and forcibly displaced from their homes.\nThis work is incredibly important to the department, it\u2019s incredibly important to me on a personal level as well, and I\u2019m grateful beyond words for the work that\u2019s being done every single day here in Washington but also around the world.\nHamdi and I actually know each other.\u00a0 We \u2013 and I go back to 2016 when Tent was founded.\u00a0 It\u2019s a remarkable thing because Hamdi\u2019s vision \u2013 but not just vision, the ability to bring this to life \u2013 has been incredibly powerful.\u00a0 But so has \u2013 and we were just talking about this \u2013 so has his dedication, because this goes back to 2016.\u00a0 I remember well on the margins of the UN General Assembly with President Obama the \u2013 many of the companies that were founding members of Tent came together.\u00a0 But the dedication and the drive to mobilize the power of the business community to create genuinely life-changing opportunities, economic security for refugees worldwide, is making a profound difference in life after life after life, and it\u2019s the sticking with it that is almost as powerful as anything else. \u00a0It\u2019s easy to \u2013 might have been easy to fold the tent, but no.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThis year, as you all know, we have hit around the world what is truly a sobering milestone: \u00a0We now have more than 100 million people, for the first time in recorded history, forcibly on the move from their homes. \u00a0Of those 100 million or so, about 35 million people are refugees or asylum seekers. \u00a0And more than a million are children born as refugees.\nThey have gone through incredibly difficult ordeals. \u00a0But one of the things that we all know is that the journey isn\u2019t over even when they arrive at the destination.\nFinding a home. \u00a0Learning a language. \u00a0Seeking a job.\u00a0 Getting kids into school.\u00a0 Building community. \u00a0All of these steps are essential for refugees to build new lives in new lands.\nThe United States is committed to supporting them.\nAround the world, we are the single largest provider of humanitarian assistance to people in need. \u00a0In just the last year, the State Department alone has provided billions of dollars in assistance for refugees, including $2.2 billion to the UN Refugee Agency.\nHere at home, the Biden administration has made it a priority to expand and modernize our refugee admissions program, including by raising our annual admissions target to 125,000 people a year \u2013 that\u2019s more than eight times what it was just a few years ago.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working toward that goal.\u00a0 I wish it were like flipping a light switch, but a lot of work has to go into getting us back and beyond where we were.\nWe\u2019re also assisting Ukrainians and Afghans who\u2019ve fled their countries and sought safety here in the United States \u2013 in part by collaborating with Welcome.US, an organization that\u2019s mobilizing American citizens and businesses to support our new neighbors.\nIn all we do, we know that we can best and most effectively help refugees when we work alongside partners.\nThis is a task, this is a responsibility \u2013 more than a responsibility, also a profound opportunity \u2013 that no single institution or entity can effectively take on alone, including the U.S. Government.\u00a0 And that is one of the main ideas behind the United Nations Global Compact on Refugees.\u00a0 By partnering with the private sector \u2013 and also with civil society, with international organizations, with other groups \u2013 governments can do more and do better in their support of refugees and asylum seekers.\nToday, the United States and Tent are bringing that spirit of collaboration to a new memorandum of understanding that we\u2019re about to sign. \u00a0We\u2019ve both made commitments toward the goals of the compact; now we\u2019ll partner to build upon one of those pledges: expanding economic opportunity for refugees outside of the United States. \u00a0We\u2019ll help create platforms for others \u2013 including the private sector \u2013 so that they can be part of this work.\nOver the next couple of years, Tent, the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration will support companies that hire refugees abroad. \u00a0Tent will help companies directly, for example, by offering guidance on employment laws. \u00a0Here at State, we\u2019ll support Tent, sharing our expertise, working together to engage other governments, international organizations, so that we can help reduce barriers to employment for refugees and continue strengthening a global coalition to support them.\nAs I\u2019ve gone around over the years and met with refugees in many, many other countries, it\u2019s almost palpable:\u00a0 Sometimes you\u2019ll be in a room and you\u2019ll have women who are there, and they are so focused on making sure that their children are cared for and properly integrated, and of course that goes with getting them into school.\u00a0 And there\u2019s almost a palpable anxiety but also energy that you feel.\nThe men sometimes \u2013 I\u2019ve found in my experience \u2013 are initially almost depressed, and it goes to something that I think is equally profound, and that is the desire to be productive members of the communities that they\u2019re joining.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the essence of dignity.\u00a0 When they don\u2019t have an opportunity to work, when they don\u2019t have an opportunity to provide for their families, when they don\u2019t have an opportunity to be productive members of these communities, they feel it powerfully and it really does go to the sense of dignity that\u2019s so important to every single human being.\nAnd so the opportunity to make sure that refugees coming in can find gainful employment can actually add, contribute to their communities, which we see powerfully around the world.\u00a0 That is fundamentally important.\nNow, one of the things that I\u2019ve also found incredibly powerful when you happen to also meet with the children, separately, is they\u2019re children.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And they still have that incredible optimism, hope that comes with being that age, and that is in and of itself an incredibly powerful resource.\nDoing all of this is the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also the smart thing to do.\nWe know refugees have extraordinary talents, expertise, ideas that benefit companies, that benefit communities.\nIn fact, we know \u2013 again, from experience \u2013 that the most driven, energetic, determined, strong people on Earth tend to be refugees because everything they\u2019ve had to go through to get to where they are is evidence of that strength, evidence of that opportunity to contribute.\u00a0 And we see that here in the United States day in, day out.\nSo one example, one exemplar of this is Abdul Nasir Rahimi.\u00a0 He worked with the United States military as a translator and cultural advisor in Afghanistan before he fled the Taliban. \u00a0This year, he and his family moved to Virginia, where he got a job with Hilton \u2013 which happens to be a member of the Tent Partnership. \u00a0Hilton recognized Abdul\u2019s skills and experience made him an ideal fit to oversee the security of their customers in McLean, where I happen to live \u2013 so they hired him.\nAbdul, thank you, thank you, thank you for working alongside our troops. \u00a0Thank you for joining us today.\u00a0 And thank you for sharing more about your experience, which we\u2019re eager to hear.\nBut let me just say in conclusion, with this new memorandum of understanding, we will help begin more stories like Abdul\u2019s, overseas, in countries around the world.\nFinally, Hamdi, let me just say again, thank you for this partnership.\u00a0 Thank you for beginning a new chapter in the partnership.\u00a0 I\u2019m very much looking forward to the work that the department and Tent will do together in the years ahead.\nSo with that, my friend, the floor is yours.\nMR ULUKAYA:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, thank you so much.\u00a0 This is a moment that we will never forget, and it\u2019s an honor to be with you.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll be very brief.\u00a0 If you pick the most important points that Mr. Secretary made, is the most important moment for a refugee is the moment they get a job.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the moment they stop being a refugee.\u00a0 And I saw that when I was running my factory in upstate New York and when we hired refugees to come into our factories, and I saw right there alive how their life has changed and how they evolve and how it affected their families and children.\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t even know it back then that this was a refugee work.\u00a0 I thought that was just a community work, that people within the communities need to be hired.\nLater on when I visited the UNHCR and some other refugee organizations, I realized the absence of business \u2013 and connecting back to my experience in our plant in upstate New York, how important job is.\u00a0 I said if I can take this model and try to convince companies to give a chance for refugees to be with them and see what the result is, and thus the idea was Tent.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t until 2016, when Secretary mentioned that we met with President Obama and Vice President Biden and some other businesses and some other organizations, that gave me that initial light to take Tent to the next level.\nThe convincing of the business community that this is good for the business, not only for these refugees but this is also good for the business, dives into the studies \u2013 economic studies and examples.\u00a0 It took us a while to get there.\u00a0 But also how this work is extremely important for communities, and we can name a couple of communities that I am familiar with \u2013 Twin Falls, Idaho; Utica, New York; and all across the country \u2013 bringing them all together and the passion that people have in this country that work in these companies that opening door to help refugees, and also the consumer rewarding companies that having this kind of consciousness of helping people who have desperately need.\u00a0 This connection was made because I have this most amazing team at Tent led by Gideon and Scarlet and all the smart and passionate people, and some of them here.\nThat we work every single morning and making those calls and making those connections and understanding what the obstacles are and how we can remove, and reach out to our colleagues and all those businesses and see how we can get together and solve these problems.\nMr. Secretary, as you know \u2013 and Assistant Secretary Noyes joined \u2013 the last event we had, we had 45 companies committing over 20,000 jobs in the United States.\u00a0 And I must tell you, those moments to lead into that summit, it was one of the most beautiful moments of my life where we had these connections with the companies and coming and reaching out and willing to help in all dimensions, and CEOs and head of HRs.\nAmerican companies are leading the way again. \u00a0And I was amazed that this example of willingness to help refugees but also help themself, if we can take it to the rest of the world, how would that mean?\u00a0 It\u2019s another leadership that America and American companies are playing.\u00a0 With this effort, sir, we\u2019ll take this knowledge\u00a0\u2013 we already opened our office all across the Europe; we have reached out to Mexico; we are going to all the corners of the country and take this example, and encouraging and helping companies to hire refugees, and not only affect their families but also their businesses and their communities.\nWe want to thank you and your team, and of course Under Secretary Noyes, thank you so much, Assistant Secretary, for your passions and for your work.\u00a0 And we will make you proud, and we will\u00a0\u2013 (laughter)\u00a0\u2013 we will continue to work on this every single day.\nAnd with that, I\u2019ll leave the podium for my friend, Abdul. \u00a0(Applause.)\nMR RAHIMI:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\u00a0 Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 My name is Abdul Nasir Rahimi and I am the safety and security manager working with the Hilton McLean.\u00a0 I would like to mention, I am that Abdul that President Biden mentioned my name in a press conference and he said we\u2019re going to get you out of Afghanistan last year, I guess \u201920.\u00a0 And I\u2019m here with my three kids and with my wife.\nOur journey was frightening. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0Our journey was frightening, and our lives completely changed in two, three weeks in the USA.\u00a0 And spending months on military bases in New Jersey and in Qatar, and then resettling in Virginia as we begin our new life in Virginia, many people helped me a lot, my American friends.\u00a0 And thank you.\nAnd I attended a job fair where I met the team from Hilton McLean there.\u00a0 And for the first time, they offered me a supervisor.\u00a0 And with this \u2013 an interview, and they offered me as a safety and security manager position.\u00a0 This has changed my life.\u00a0 I love the opportunity that I see there every day, the work that the organizations like Tent and Hamdi \u2013 sir, thank you so much \u2013 and the companies like Hilton are doing together is so important for the refugees.\u00a0 The focus they have put on connecting refugees to work, to hiring, training, and mentoring is making a difference.\u00a0 It\u2019s empowering more and more refugees around the world to build lives, discover opportunity and hope, and support their own communities along the way.\nI am honored and grateful to be part of this moment.\u00a0 By coming together through this initiative to provide opportunities, companies will be able to support refugees both in USA and around the world in even greater numbers and go and change the lives of the refugees or other people.\u00a0 And thank you for everything that you guys did for me.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY NOYES:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, Mr. Ulukaya, would you like to proceed to the table for the signing?\n(The MOU was signed.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Now it\u2019s official.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Well done.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you all for being here, and we really are grateful for this partnership and looking forward to making a real difference in the lives of others.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR ULUKAYA:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\u00a0 Good to see you.\n\n",
