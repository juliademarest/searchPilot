You could have picked another place \u2013 another time and place for us to have this occasion, but you picked Port Moresby, you picked our nation\u2019s capital, and you picked Papua New Guinea \u2013 and we sincerely appreciate you very much for this kind gesture.\nToday, in our bilateral meeting, you were witness to the signing of our Defense Cooperation Agreement.\u00a0 That was a culmination of many years and months of engagement with Pentagon, engagement with Washington, engagement with U.S. officials and our team.\u00a0 I just want to stress this point: It wasn\u2019t shoved down our throat.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t forced upon us; it was a mutual agreement.\u00a0 A conversation was held expressly on the need for Papua New Guinea to have our defence force assisted, supported, stepped up.\nPapua New Guineans, you must know you have domestic security issue, as well as closer to home security issues.\u00a0 We cannot forever remain in (inaudible) in as far as our defence force is concerned.\u00a0 Our defence force needs to be stepped up and supported.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had similar defense cooperation agreement with Australia, Indonesia, and other nations we enjoy strong long-term partnerships with.\u00a0 We have every right also, in the same vein, to engage in a straight partnership with United States of America, where we have had no problem with similar defense force cooperation agreements \u2013 have been foundation of our relationship.\nAnd today, the defense force cooperation comes with a backdrop of elevating what was originally the umbrella status of force agreement that kept us together.\u00a0 We are now elevating that to a specific relationship exclusive for U.S.A.-PNG military cooperations and military engagements and partnership.\u00a0 There is nothing for us to be fearful about.\u00a0 I just want to needless repeat but for emphasis because of a lot of misconception and confusion out there in the public.\u00a0 This agreement is subsidiary to a treaty \u2013 it\u2019s below the treaty level.\u00a0 This agreement in no way breaks or encroaches into our country\u2019s legislations, (inaudible) the fundamental constitution of our country or every other (inaudible) legislations we have.\nThis agreement is congruent to the 1975 Visiting Forces Act, the 1975 Visiting Forces Act.\u00a0 James Marape was still a child in 1975, when the fathers of this nation saw it important to have an act called the Visiting Forces Act to ensure we\u2019re engaged in partnership with nations of similarities, nations where we have common bond, where exchanges can be made possible.\nAnd so, I just want to inform the educated out there, especially those of you who want to pick a political bone with me \u2013 let\u2019s not confuse everyone.\u00a0 We are a nation of rule of law.\u00a0 If you feel that this agreement encroaches into one iota of our constitutional law of the land, make reference to the supreme court.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure the court will find \u2013 I\u2019m sure the court will find that what we have done is within the gambit of the constitution of our country and all subsidiary legislations.\u00a0 It is meant to ensure that our country\u2019s domestic as well as sovereign security is secured, beefed up, bumped up, and prepared for any challenges \u2013 not just military challenges, but more importantly, challenges of disaster, challenges of social issues, and every other challenge we go through, including securing our country to be a country known to have secured the security issue and prepared for investments that we are trying to attract into our country.\nMy conversation with India is not just purely on politics; my conversation with U.S.A. is not purely on politics.\u00a0 But more importantly, deep inside \u2013 and Secretary Blinken knows this; those who worked with us on this one knows this \u2013 we want American-based investors to come to our country.\u00a0 We want Indian-based investors to come into our country.\u00a0 We are looking at diversifying our economic base, and growing it \u2013 and make it stronger so that government can in turn look after our citizens.\u00a0 That is foundationally not so today because of the weak security structure we have in our country.\u00a0 Strengthening our defense force, strengthening our police, strengthening our court system, ensuring that our democracy is secure is a key foundational interest of the state to make sure our country is secure.\nIt is in this vein that we are in partnership with the biggest democracy on the face of Planet Earth, and I just want to encourage our people, please don\u2019t be \u2013 don\u2019t think that something suspicious of funny is behind this.\u00a0 It was a work over many years that has culminated over \u2013 into a six month of robust conversation between Port Moresby and Washington, (inaudible) and Washington, our own military head official or former head official as well as Pentagon and Washington officials.\u00a0 Today is a result of many weeks, months, and years of work.\nAnd I will be making available to the public, as we complete due process of key documents to be made known to public in the very near future \u2013 possibly in days, this agreement will be made public to everyone for all of us to understand.\u00a0 The United States of America is always transparent about matters that is of importance to the public.\u00a0 They too, I would believe \u2013 and I don\u2019t like to speak for Secretary Blinken, but they too will make known to public, their own country, they will report \u2013 they have a duty to report back to their country the agreement that we\u2019ve signed.\u00a0 And for matters of transparency for the people and citizens of Papua New Guinea, people and citizens of U.S.A. will know exactly what we\u2019ve signed.\nI just want to conclude by saying what we\u2019ve signed does not encroach \u2013 or affect, rather \u2013 Papua New Guinea\u2019s own relationships we have with other nations we trade with, or we have relationships with, be it military or government-to-government relations.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 It does not affect \u2013 whether in China or Australia or United Kingdom or Japan or India or any other nation, for that matter \u2013 this agreement does not in one way, shape, and form stop Papua New Guinea from continuing on doing business with those we do business with.\u00a0 So, I just want to inform everyone to have a bit of understanding that your government is in the business of securing your future and your economic future as we (inaudible) on these matters.\nOther matters we discussed with Secretary Blinken on behalf of President Biden, (inaudible) ways continuing issue on the climate change, our energy and security, our (inaudible) greater regional security in the region.\u00a0 You would have been informed earlier that we did sign a subsequent agreement called a (inaudible) agreement that secures PNG\u2019s maritime borders and our resources found in our seas.\u00a0 That sort of conversation was also held in the Pacific Island Leaders Meeting, the concern of care for our resources and the security of our seas; all conversation made \u2013 Secretary Blinken was very generous with his time and ears.\u00a0 He sat through, listened to our conversations (inaudible), but a substantial part of Pacific Island and U.S.A. engagements were put to a work-in-progress mode.\u00a0 And we will arrive in Washington in September of this year, hopefully for substantial progress where United States is making a greater commitment to respond to some of the key development challenges we face in the region, including (inaudible) issues and the other insecurity issues that (inaudible).\nOn this note, Secretary Blinken, I have not stolen your time now.\u00a0 There is now space for you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I just have (inaudible) the discussions that we held and (inaudible).\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a few questions (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Prime Minister, thank you so much.\u00a0 And I fully endorse everything you said.\u00a0 And you can speak for me, because you do it so eloquently.\u00a0 And I can only fully agree with everything that you said.\u00a0 But thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the incredibly warm reception, and thank you for the incredibly productive day \u2013 both on a bilateral basis between the United States and Papua New Guinea, but also with all of our regional partners \u2013 discussing and making progress on issues that are critical to our shared future.\nThere is an old Hawaiian saying that translates loosely to \u201cunited to move forward.\u201d\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s the spirit in which we all came together today as Pacific nations.\u00a0 Our partnership is crucial to how we deliver for our people, how we meet their needs and aspirations, and advance our common vision for the region \u2013 one that is free and open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.\u00a0 Or, as your 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent puts it, a \u201cresilient Pacific region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity that ensures all Pacific peoples can lead free, healthy, and productive lives.\u201d\u00a0 It is a powerful, positive ambition that we share.\nAt this forum we\u2019ve built on momentum from the first U.S.-Pacific Island Summit last fall.\u00a0 There in Washington, President Biden pledged to open a new era in our partnership \u2013 one of mutual respect, trust, and benefit.\u00a0 As I had an opportunity to tell Pacific leaders at our meeting today, over the past year the United States has been listening to you, engaging with your governments, working to deliver on our summit announcements that align with your broader vision.\u00a0 And together, we\u2019ve made considerable, tangible progress on many of the commitments in a short period of time.\u00a0 Together, we are super-charging our climate action.\nToday, I announced that the United States will support the PIF in standing up the new Pacific Resilience Facility.\u00a0 This Pacific-owned, Pacific-led solution will drive investment into climate adaptation and resilience in front-line communities.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re boosting our bilateral security relationship to ensure that the Blue Pacific remains a place of peace and prosperity.\nThe prime minister and I just signed, as he mentioned, two agreements which will boost cooperation between Papua New Guinea Defence Forces and the U.S. Coast Guard to help build up the Defence Forces\u2019 capacity, and help combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\nTogether, we\u2019re driving progress to expand trade, investment, and business initiatives that can lift up all communities.\u00a0 In Papua New Guinea specifically, we\u2019re working with Congress to provide over $45 million in new programming on sustainable and inclusive development, public health, and energy security.\u00a0 And later this year the Department of Commerce will lead a first-ever U.S. business delegation to Pacific Island countries to explore opportunities in energy, in transportation, in health care, tourism, and telecommunications.\nTogether, we\u2019re modernizing and enhancing the Compacts of Free Association.\u00a0 These are the bedrock of U.S. engagement in the Pacific.\u00a0 We just signed our agreement with Palau today, in this room.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful to President Whipps for his partnership.\u00a0 Tomorrow, we\u2019ll sign our agreement with the Federated States of Micronesia.\u00a0 And I look forward to finishing negotiations with the Republic of the Marshall Islands soon, to ensure that this arrangement reflects the realities and the challenges of our time.\u00a0 As part of these agreements, the United States will commit $7.1 billion to the Freely Associated States over the next 20 years.\nTogether, we\u2019re also strengthening ties between our peoples.\u00a0 We are very excited to announce the return of the Peace Corps to the Pacific Islands, and that we\u2019re launching new educational exchanges to share skills and expertise, and forge enduring connections that will benefit our communities.\nSo, we\u2019ve got a lot to work on, a lot to accomplish together.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re expanding our diplomatic presence in the region, delivering on our commitments last year.\u00a0 We\u2019ve opened two new embassies, one on the Solomon Islands, the other just two weeks ago in Tonga.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working to do the same in Vanuatu and Kiribati by the end of this year.\nWe\u2019ve named our first ever envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, Ambassador Frankie Reed, who will continue to engage throughout the region to strengthen our partnerships.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to strive to meet the Pacific where it is, (inaudible) Pacific leaders and through the Pacific Islands Forum.\u00a0 We\u2019ll encourage other partners to do the same, including through the Partners in the Blue Pacific, to support the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\u00a0 And in that regard, we very much welcome India\u2019s engagement with countries in the region.\u00a0 That, too, is a very positive development for the future that we all want.\nSo Prime Minister, to you, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for this partnership at a critical time for the region that we share.\u00a0 And thank you for the work that we\u2019re doing every day to build it, to make it stronger, to deliver on our shared vision.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Any questions?\u00a0 We\u2019ll just take two or three questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We will first go to Gorethy Kenneth from\u00a0The\u00a0Post-Courier.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Prime Minister, (inaudible), the line credit \u2013 the line of credit program with India and Papua New Guinea (inaudible).\u00a0 Was it \u2013 will it be extended or was it extended?\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0The prime minister took note of this fact, and he is taking it back to his country.\u00a0 We \u2013 for us, as a country, it\u2019s important we also diversify our source of support.\u00a0 India has opened up that facility \u2013 those facilities.\u00a0 We\u2019ve asked them to go back and maintain the facility and expressed the (inaudible) invite to procure a source.\u00a0 So, he said he\u2019ll take back to his officials.\u00a0 We don\u2019t run other forms of government.\u00a0 We run democratic form of government (inaudible) our systems to go back to (inaudible) said he would look at (inaudible).\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Jack Moore from AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to speak to us.\u00a0 My question is for you, Secretary.\u00a0 Given the inroads that China has made in the Pacific in places such as the Solomon Islands, how important was it for Washington to secure the deals today with Papua New Guinea and renew with Palau to counter Beijing\u2019s rise and influence in the region?\u00a0 And how satisfied are you with the outcome?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, I\u2019d say a few things.\u00a0 First, the agreements that we reached, the work that we\u2019re doing, is not about any other country.\u00a0 It\u2019s about our relationship with the Pacific Islands and the shared vision that we have for this region.\nAnd as you heard the prime minister say, while we signed the Defense Cooperation Agreement today, the ship (inaudible) agreement \u2013 these are very important in helping to strengthen Papua New Guinea\u2019s capacity.\u00a0 We\u2019re working across the board on issues of direct concern to people of Papua New Guinea and throughout the region, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s investment, whether it\u2019s building up healthcare systems.\u00a0 But this is grounded in \u2013 I think what\u2019s fair to say is a shared vision that we have for a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nAnd we talk about that a lot.\u00a0 And I just want to be clear about what we mean by that when we\u2019re talking about a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We need a region where countries are free to choose their own path and their own partners, where problems will be dealt openly, transparently. \u00a0Goals will be reached in a transparent way, (inaudible) fairly, and goods, ideas, and people can float freely and lawfully across the land, the seas, the skies, and in cyberspace.\u00a0 That\u2019s the vision that we have, as well as making sure that the citizens in our countries have the opportunity to reach their full potential, providing the support necessary to do that.\nBut this vision doesn\u2019t exclude anyone.\u00a0 We welcome contributions by other countries, including the PRC \u2013 the regional development \u2013 so long as they adhere to the highest standards, including in areas like transparency and the rule of law.\u00a0 If all of us are going to be engaged in a region as partners \u2013 well, if there\u2019s going to be a race, let it be a race to the top.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re all about, and we want to simply see anyone who\u2019s engaged engage in a way that advances the shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nBut as I said, the focus that we have is on building and strengthening these partnerships on their own terms, not with regard to any other country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Take a final question from Tim Swanston from ABC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m happy just to talk loudly if you can hear me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I appreciate what you\u2019re saying that this isn\u2019t about any other countries, but ultimately, China has made very serious inroads with respect to the defense and security arrangement here in the Pacific.\u00a0 Now that the Defense Cooperation Agreement is being signed, under what kind of timeframe would you like to see U.S. military or U.S. assets placed in PNG?\u00a0 And what bases are you looking at of importance to the island states?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0What we\u2019re focused on is what our partners here are working and trying to achieve in strengthening their capacity.\u00a0 As you heard the prime minister say, there\u2019s a focus on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief.\u00a0 That\u2019s the main import of what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But the main point is that, as you heard the prime minister say, we\u2019ve had this basic arrangement going back to 1975.\u00a0 So, this is simply updating and modernizing what has been a longstanding agreement between our countries just to make sure that we can work together as effectively as possible.\nAnd as I said in the first instance, we want to make sure that we\u2019re being responsive to some of the challenges that the PNG faces.\u00a0 There are other challenges that I mentioned that \u2013 where these agreements will be very helpful \u2013 for example, the issue of illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing.\u00a0 This is something that is having a devasting impact on livelihoods in the Pacific Islands, as well as the ecosystem that is so vital to nourishing these economies.\u00a0 So, this could \u2013 I think the work that we\u2019re doing with PNG can be of a real assistance there.\nYou heard the prime minister talk about other concerns with regard, for example, to (inaudible), where again these agreements will help.\u00a0 But that\u2019s the immediate focus of what we\u2019re looking to do, but it\u2019s all on the basis of simply bringing up to date and modernizing agreements that have been there for a long, long time.\u00a0 And I would emphasize, again, something the prime minister said: these are being done in a fully transparent way, respectful of PNG\u2019s institutions, of its sovereignty.\u00a0 These are agreements that we reach together, not agreements that anyone is imposing on anyone else, and they take away no freedom of action from the PNG.\u00a0 And as the Prime Minister said, we\u2019ll be making these publicly available \u2013 as we always do, as we complete the process of finalizing the agreements in our respective countries.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary, if I could just add one or two more lines \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 the presence of China, let me inform everyone, China is (inaudible) and people have no interest whatsoever with what they do in other nations.\u00a0 We have a healthy relationship with Chinese Government, and they are important and big trading partner, but we are moving into finalizing this agreement.\u00a0 We did not need to tell anyone else what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But they have given assurance to us in our conversations that we have every right to engage with U.S.A. as much as we have with them.\nAnd so, I just want to inform Papua New Guineans in the first instance and the media, we\u2019re trying to play out from this issue of China versus U.S.A.\u00a0 The Secretary of State correctly has stated this has nothing to do with the bigger issues, the headline issues that keep on going off every now and then.\u00a0 Papua New Guinea invited U.S.A. to move beyond just an ordinary agreement to a specifically defense-focused agreement.\u00a0 In my view, that strengthens our Defence Force, and they will come in at the invitation of our Defence Force, and not at their own will.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that must be clear that everyone in the Pacific \u2013 upon our invitation, they come in.\nThat is subsequently a question on when that needs to be done that dwarfs other agreements and other processes.\u00a0 This is just a framework agreement that now (inaudible) this element of specific relationship with U.S.A. like we\u2019ve never had before.\u00a0 And I want to assure Papua New Guinea\u2019s \u2013 particularly with China (inaudible) to do with our internal security issue to ensure that our military is now responsive to the challenges of 21st century, living in this part of Planet Earth.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Prime Minister.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0All right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And let me just say one last thing if I could.\u00a0 The ocean that we share is called the Pacific.\u00a0 And our ambition is for it to remain exactly that: an ocean of peace.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do together.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0All right.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone (inaudible).\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "APEC Haus", "location": "Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea", "date": "May 22, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, everyone.\u00a0 And I have to say I\u2019m very tempted to say, \u201cWhat the prime minister said,\u201d and leave it at that because I could not and cannot say it more eloquently than he just has.\u00a0 But let me first say good afternoon to everyone.\u00a0 It is truly wonderful to be here in Papua New Guinea, to be joining the prime minister, to be joining the defense ministers, to be joining the entire team.\nMr. Prime Minister, we\u2019ve spent a good bit of time together, including a visit to the Oval Office with President Biden during the Pacific Island Summit last year.\u00a0 And you heard this from the President himself during your call a few days ago, but he asked me again to reiterate to you, to all of our friends in Papua New Guinea, his regrets for being unable to be here today.\u00a0 The President values deeply our nations\u2019 longstanding partnership and believes our cooperation is critical to addressing a series of shared challenges that are facing our people.\u00a0 And he\u2019s eager to welcome you, to welcome other Pacific Island Forum leaders, back to Washington for a second summit later this year.\nWe are deeply invested in the Indo-Pacific because our planet\u2019s future is being written here.\u00a0 Papua New Guinea is playing a critical role in shaping that future.\u00a0 That leadership is on display this week as you\u2019ve welcomed 16 delegations for the U.S.-Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting to make progress on priorities that we\u2019ve established together, from tackling the climate crisis to improving public health to enhancing disaster preparedness and response.\u00a0 And the United States is proud to partner with Papua New Guinea on these same priorities because they\u2019re our priorities too.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together as regional security partners.\u00a0 We\u2019re boosting our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific though the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.\nWe\u2019re driving economic opportunity through partnerships between our businesses, which are bringing tens of billions in new investment to Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 And we are teaming up to bring preventative, lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment to people here in Papua New Guinea so that they can continue to lead healthy and productive lives.\nSimply put, we are committed to growing all aspects of our relationship.\u00a0 And to that end, today, as you\u2019ve from the prime minister, we\u2019re signing two agreements on defense and on maritime cooperation.\nThe Defense Cooperation Agreement, drafted by Papua New Guinea and the United States as equal and sovereign partners, will enhance the PNG\u2019s Defence Force\u2019s capability to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, including through providing medical care and temporary shelter to those who are affected by crises.\u00a0 The agreement will also make it easy for PNG and U.S. forces to train together in new ways and in more places as part of our joint effort to uphold peace and security across the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We will be fully transparent of the details of the agreement, which contains elements from our previous agreement and updates to reflect our shared commitment to deepen cooperation on issues that matter most to people here as well as in the United States.\nAnd as you also heard from the prime minister, the Shiprider Agreement will allow the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and the U.S. Coast Guard to deepen cooperation to combat illicit maritime activities, including illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which we know is destroying livelihoods and threatening green ecosystems that nourish Pacific Island economies.\nAt more than 2.4 million square kilometers, the PNG\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone is one of the largest in the South Pacific.\u00a0 That poses a tremendous economic opportunity but also a serious challenge for monitoring, for controlling, for surveilling that vast expanse of maritime area.\u00a0 Under this agreement, our forces will be able to board one another\u2019s vessels, share technical expertise, and ultimately better patrol the seas together.\u00a0 This is vital to protecting livelihoods for generations to come.\nFor nearly 50 years, Papua New Guinea and the United States have worked together to deliver prosperity for our people and promote security and stability for the region.\u00a0 You heard the prime minister speak eloquently to that shared history.\u00a0 But I think what\u2019s so important is that shared history is also a living history, and together \u2013 even as we\u2019re inspired by so much that we\u2019ve done in the past \u2013 we are working together to shape the future.\u00a0 That\u2019s the task before us.\u00a0 And Mr. Prime Minister, we are very much looking forward to taking our partnership to the next level.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

very much.\u00a0 And colleagues, it is a great honor to be with all of you, to be with our Pacific Island partners.\u00a0 Prime Minister, I\u2019m really grateful to you as our host for welcoming all of us to Papua New Guinea.\nPresident Biden was very much looking forward to being here and to addressing Pacific Island Forum leaders before events in Washington required him to be there.\u00a0 He felt it was important for me to represent him to underscore to you our commitment to the region.\u00a0 And in fact, I\u2019m carrying with me a formal invitation from the President for Pacific leaders to come back to Washington this fall for a second summit to continue conversations and develop new initiatives that are critical to our collective future.\u00a0 I know that the President is eager to welcome you in Washington again.\u00a0 The first summit was historic.\u00a0 Our second summit will help us really shape history together.\nThis is the second opportunity that I\u2019ve had to be with the Pacific Island Forum.\u00a0 I very much appreciated the discussion last year in Fiji.\u00a0 Vice President Harris also addressed that meeting virtually.\u00a0 And in between those events, senior officials from across our government have regularly traveled to the region.\nWhen President Biden launched the Pacific Island Summit last year, he pledged a new era of cooperation and partnership to deliver for our people. \u00a0An era of mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual benefit with the United States and the Pacific Islands working together to advance a shared vision for the region that\u2019s free, that\u2019s open, that\u2019s connected, that\u2019s prosperous, that\u2019s secure, that\u2019s resilient.\nSo we sometimes have formulas, phrases that we repeat to each other on a regular basis, and \u201cfree and open\u201d is one of them.\u00a0 What do we actually mean by that?\u00a0 Well, for our part \u2013 and I think this is a shared view among everyone at this table \u2013 when we talk about free and open we mean a region where countries are free to choose their own path and their own partners; where problems can be dealt with openly, rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly; and goods, ideas, and people will flow freely and lawfully across land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nOver the past year, the United States has been listening hard, listening to you, engaging with your governments, working to deliver on our summit announcements and align with your vision.\u00a0 Today, I think we can actually point to substantial progress on many of those commitments, acknowledging that more work needs to be done.\u00a0 And Prime Minister, I take very much to heart what you said about the need to have clear lines of visibility and accessibility so that we can continue to move forward on the agenda we set for each other.\nBut if you just look at what we\u2019ve managed to accomplish over the past year as well as where we\u2019re going.\u00a0 I think we do see tangible progress.\u00a0 We\u2019re enhancing our diplomatic engagements in the Pacific.\u00a0 Last year, we inaugurated our new embassy building here in Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 I had a chance to visit it this morning.\u00a0 It\u2019s an extraordinary facility, really a state-of-the-art building that I think reflects the value that place on our partnership.\nWe recently opened two new embassies in Solomon Islands and Tonga.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to do the same in Vanuatu in Kiribati.\u00a0 We sent our first ever U.S. envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, Ambassador Frankie Reed, who is here with us today and has been hard at work to deepen our relationships across the region.\u00a0 America\u2019s future is here in the Pacific.\nWe\u2019re strengthening our partnerships on public health, the climate crisis, economic growth, and other key regional priorities that respond to people\u2019s needs and expectations.\u00a0 By September, we\u2019ll open a new USAID mission here in the Pacific Islands based in Papua New Guinea to advance those efforts.\nWe\u2019ve also helped Pacific Island countries unlock more than half a billion dollars from international organizations to help communities manage the growing impacts of climate change, a challenge that we know President Biden feels strongly is existential for the Pacific Islands and on which the Pacific Islands have all led in the global community.\u00a0 Today, I am very pleased to announce the United States plans to be among the founding partners to support PIF in standing up the new Pacific Resilience Facility to support investments in adaptation and resilience.\nWe\u2019re updating and enhancing the Compacts of Free Association with our close partners in the Freely Associated States.\u00a0 A little later today, we\u2019re signing agreements with Palau, tomorrow with Federated States of Micronesia, and we\u2019re looking forward to entering negotiations with the Republic of the Marshall Islands very soon.\nAs part of these agreements, the United States will commit more than $7.1 billion to the Freely Associated States over the next 20 years.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also included an enhanced South Pacific Tuna Treaty.\u00a0 We just completed negotiations on a new 10-year economic assistance agreement which will support livelihoods across the region, boost our cooperation on priorities like combatting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\u00a0 We know how essential, how vital this is, to virtually all of our partners in the region.\u00a0 We know the damage that it does to livelihoods and the threat that it poses to ecosystems that are quite literally nourishing your economies.\nWe\u2019re advancing shared prosperity across our region by connecting American and Pacific companies and boosting trade and investment through new initiatives and new dialogue.\u00a0 We launched a new transportation partnership and strategic infrastructure initiatives aimed at unlocking over $450 million in financing for clean energy connectivity and for digital infrastructure.\u00a0 We held the first U.S.-PIF dialogue on trade and investment a little bit earlier this year and look forward to a ministerial level dialogue very soon.\nAnd today, I can announce that our Department of Commerce will lead a U.S. business delegation to the Pacific Island countries in the coming year to look at concrete opportunities in energy, in transportation, in health care, in tourism, in telecommunications.\u00a0 We\u2019re putting together a very strong delegation of leading American enterprises, and we very much look forward to doing that in a few months\u2019 time.\nAlso deepening the already incredibly vibrant ties between our people, we\u2019re partnering with Johns Hopkins University to welcome the first cohort of Pacific leaders at the U.S. Pacific Institute for Rising Leaders program this fall.\u00a0 That will (inaudible) the region\u2019s brightest minds on the key priorities that (inaudible) time.\nAnd we\u2019re returning the Peace Corps to the region with volunteers already on the ground in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, and preparing to arrive in Vanuatu (inaudible) later this year.\nWe\u2019re committed to building on all of this momentum generated in the last year, including by working through the Partners in the Blue Pacific to support 2050 strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\nSo in short, I think we\u2019re making demonstrable progress on the agenda we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\u00a0 There is more that we can do, more that we will do, more that we have to do.\u00a0 But it was very important for me to be here today to hear from all of you, our partners, on how we\u2019re doing, how we can do even better, and how we can deepen all of the work that we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\nSo thank you for the honor of joining you today.\u00a0 I\u2019m so grateful to all of our colleagues for being here.\u00a0 I\u2019m very much looking forward to this conversation, to listening to everyone\u2019s ideas to everyone\u2019s priorities to ensure that the United States is a strong, reliable, effective partner in the Pacific Islands in the future that we are building together.\nThank you very much, Prime Minister.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

together some of our brightest minds, our best universities, our boldest companies, offers incredible promise for the future.\nAnd as the ambassador said, it\u2019s hard to know standing here today all that this is going to produce.\u00a0 But I can say with great confidence that it\u2019s going to stand both of our countries \u2013 and actually the world \u2013 in very good stead.\u00a0 This is an extraordinary collaboration that we\u2019re initiating today.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be a part of it.\nAnd to all of the leaders who are here from U.S. and Japanese industry, from educational institutions, kicking off these new initiatives today from IBM, from Google, from Micron, from Tokyo Electron; Universities of Tokyo, Hiroshima, Tohoku, Chicago, Purdue, Boise State \u2013 this is a extraordinary list but an extraordinary group of institutions, of individuals \u2013 partners, now, in this endeavor.\u00a0 And I really want to thank you for making this happen and thanking \u2013 and thank you as well for making up such an incredible team.\nThe collaborative efforts that we\u2019re launching today are about improving the lives of our people.\u00a0 That\u2019s fundamentally what it comes down to \u2013 now, but also for generations to come.\u00a0 We all know that semiconductors power everything from the devices we all carry in our pockets to the artificial intelligence that\u2019s reshaping the production of knowledge.\u00a0 They are the foundation upon which future innovation will be built, from quantum computers and biotechnology to precision medicine to renewable energy.\nMaintaining our shared edge in these technologies is not just crucial for expanding opportunities and delivering tangible benefits for our people.\u00a0 It will also allow us to shape the rules and norms around emerging technologies so that they\u2019re developed and used in ways that reflect the values that we share.\nAnd it\u2019s not just what we\u2019ll work on that makes these new partnerships critically important, but how we\u2019ll work together.\u00a0 We\u2019re investing in the best ecosystems for innovation, bringing together extraordinary research universities, extraordinary companies, and our governments.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be stronger, we\u2019ll be more nimble, we\u2019ll be more dynamic, because the United States and Japan will build these synergies in unison rather than in isolation.\u00a0 And I\u2019m especially excited by the young minds who are going to be brought to bear on this partnership.\u00a0 That to me is one of the most inspiring parts of this initiative.\nWe know this formula delivers because collaboration across our borders and sectors has already yielded some of the world\u2019s most transformative breakthroughs.\u00a0 Just to cite two examples for this morning out of so many that we all know about, the first is from 1986, when America\u2019s Motorola combined its microprocessor with Japan\u2019s Toshiba\u2019s design and manufacturing technology, producing one of the earliest and biggest leaps in semiconductor technology.\nThe second started back in the 1950s, when, after finishing his PhD at the University of Tokyo, a Japanese meteorologist, Manabe Syukuro, went to work at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0 Over the coming decades, he and American colleagues developed the first models that were used to simulate climate change, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 2021.\u00a0 Even as he pursued his own research, Manabe \u2013 who is now 91 years old \u2013 has mentored generations of rising American and Japanese scientists at Princeton and Nagoya Universities.\nUltimately, that\u2019s what this Memorandum of Cooperation In Education is all about.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just maintaining but expanding the pipeline of rising American and Japanese thinkers, innovators, technologists, so that they can shape emerging technologies for the good of our nations, for the good of the world.\nSo I am confident that no one can do it better together than our countries, our institutions, our people, and Rahm and I \u2013 well, maybe not Rahm \u2013 I\u2019ll be long retired when we get a chance to see the extraordinary innovations that I know this partnership is going to produce.\u00a0 So thank you all so much for being part of this, and we very much look forward to seeing the future that we\u2019re going to be building together.\u00a0 Thank you all very, very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMINISTER NAGAOKA:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good morning, distinguished guests.\u00a0 I am Keiko Nagaoka.\u00a0 I am the minister in charge of education, science, and technology.\u00a0 So shortly after my (inaudible), Ambassador Emanuel had his (inaudible).\u00a0 So he has an office in the Ministry of Education, but that is not true.\u00a0 But I think it is worth a office because he has been visiting us so many times and we have been holding so many frequent meetings, so I think his visit deserves that we give him an office.\nSo Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Ambassador Rahm Emanuel and distinguished guests from U.S. and Japan universities and representatives of (inaudible) companies, good morning.\u00a0 Today I am truly grateful to sign the Memorandum of Cooperation together with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 So this is the first MOC to be concluded between the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and the Department of State.\u00a0 A reference was made to this MOC during the U.S.-Japan summit meeting held earlier.\u00a0 We anticipate that the signing of MOC would contribute greatly to the expansion of cooperation in education between the U.S. and Japan, present and into the future.\nLast week, during the G7 education ministerial meeting which I chaired, G7 nations which share the democratic value of freedom, peace, and rule of law have reached agreement to promote cooperation in education.\u00a0 So the declaration was adopted, and only after the adoption of the declaration we were able to start a concrete action through the signing of this MOC, and I\u2019m truly grateful for that fact.\nGoing forward based on this MOC, our ministry and the Department of State will strengthen cooperation in the secondary and higher education, as well as in research.\u00a0 And at the same time, we will start holding policy dialogue between the two agencies on a regular basis.\nAs for the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, we hope to further promote exchange in education between the U.S. and Japan.\u00a0 Based on the second set of the recommendations, titled Initiative to Promote Overseas Study of (inaudible) Relations Who Will Shape the Future, which as known as the J-MIRAI project \u2013 this was compiled in the Education Future Creation Conference in April.\u00a0 We hope to further accelerate our cooperation.\nIn addition, along with the MOC, I welcome the conclusion of partnership agreements by the companies and universities of both nations on quantum and semiconductors, both of which are strategically critical to the U.S. and Japan.\u00a0 Under these partnerships, we have high expectations that the cooperation of the U.S. and Japan will further evolve in these critical sectors and will foster talent with skill sets that can shape the next generation.\u00a0 And I hope that such cooperation will further expand moving forward.\nAs the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, we wish to cooperate closely with the Department of State.\u00a0 I would like to ask your kind support and cooperation on this matter so that we can further strengthen our cooperation in education sectors and promote educational exchange.\u00a0 And needless to say, with the conclusion of MOC, the U.S. embassy officials \u2013 and not to mention Ambassador Emanuel \u2013 I would like to offer \u2013 express my gratitude for the U.S. embassy officials and Ambassador Emanuel.\u00a0 With that, I would like to conclude my remarks.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The memorandum was signed.)\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Dirksen Senate Office Building", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 16, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, State and Foreign Ops Chair Coons, Ranking Member Graham, distinguished members of the Appropriations Committee, thank you for this opportunity to testify before you today.\u00a0 Thank you for bringing us all together.\nI\u2019m very pleased as well to be here with Secretary Austin, Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 This administration is committed to leading a bipartisan, whole-of-government China strategy that advances U.S. interests and values and delivers for the American people.\nAnd to your point, Chair Murray, I think we do stand at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over.\u00a0 There is an intense competition underway to shape what comes next.\nChina represents the most consequential geopolitical challenge that we face today: a country with the intent and, increasingly, the capability to challenge our vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous international order.\nWe cannot dictate Beijing\u2019s path.\u00a0 We cannot wait for China to change its trajectory.\u00a0 But we can put ourselves in a position of strength to compete intensely to shape the broader strategic environment around China and to advance our vision.\nWe do not seek conflict with China or a new Cold War.\u00a0 We\u2019re not trying to contain China.\u00a0 And in fact, the United States continues to have a comprehensive trade and investment relationship with China, as do most of our allies and partners.\u00a0 We are, however, resolutely for de-risking and diversifying, not decoupling.\u00a0 That means investing in our own capacities and in a secure, resilient supply chain, pushing for a level playing field for our workers and companies, defending against harmful trade practices, and ensuring that the United States and allied technology is not used against us.\nWe\u2019re also committed to working with allies and partners to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific \u2013 one that is at peace and grounded in respect for a rules-based international order.\nWhen we talk about \u201cfree and open,\u201d what we mean is this:\u00a0 We mean countries being free to choose their own path and their own partners, and that problems will be dealt with openly, not coercively.\u00a0 Rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly.\u00a0 Goods, ideas, and people will flow lawfully and freely across the land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nThe world is watching how we \u2013 and Beijing \u2013 manage this relationship.\u00a0 And it\u2019s in our best strategic interest to do so responsibly, in a way that promotes security and prosperity and delivers solutions on shared challenges that matter to the American people and to people around the world.\nLast year, I had an opportunity to set out the administration\u2019s comprehensive PRC strategy to \u201cinvest, align, and compete.\u201d\nWe have made historic investments here at home \u2013 including the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 to strengthen our ability to compete.\nWe\u2019ve aligned our approach with key partners in Europe and Asia and beyond, working methodically to elevate our engagement around the world \u2013 and as a result, we have achieved greater convergence on how to deal with the challenges that China poses than ever before.\nAs we compete, we will work to maintain open lines of communication at all levels with the PRC to avoid miscalculation, to prevent competition from veering into conflict.\u00a0 Senior-level engagements over the past few weeks demonstrate that commitment.\nWe will purposefully engage China, not as a favor, or with engagement as an end in and of itself, but in ways that reflect our values and where we can find areas of cooperation that are in our mutual interest. That\u2019s what the world expects of responsible powers.\nSo we\u2019ll push for progress on priorities like the climate crisis, macroeconomic stability, public health.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to press the need to curb the flow of precursors that exacerbate fentanyl and synthetic opioids and the crisis that they pose.\u00a0 And I very much appreciate the leadership of this committee on this most urgent challenge for the United States.\nWe\u2019ve heard from members in both parties, on both sides of the Hill, that this unprecedented challenge requires an ambitious resource strategy.\u00a0 We very much agree.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the President\u2019s proposed FY2024 State Department budget aims to do: to give us the resources and the agility to advance our strategy.\nThis budget positions the United States to up our game in the Indo-Pacific: the frontline of our competition with China. \u00a0The Indo-Pacific is the most dynamic and fastest-growing region in the world \u2013 50 percent of the world\u2019s population, 60 percent of global GDP, eight of the top 15 U.S. export markets.\u00a0 It supports 3 million jobs here in the United States, provides about $900 billion in foreign direct investment to our country, and it\u2019s driven about 75 percent of global economic growth over the last five years.\u00a0 China, as it happens, invests a full 50 percent of its assistance and economic and diplomatic resources in the Indo-Pacific.\nOur budget proposal will allow us to further deepen our diplomatic footprint in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 from new missions in the Pacific Islands, to a surge of new positions in the region and beyond, including in the areas of greatest contestation with Beijing like technology, economics, and regional and international organizations.\nBeijing understands that diplomacy is a critical tool.\u00a0 It\u2019s why it\u2019s invested heavily in building up its own diplomatic capacity, its own diplomatic reach, and in fact it\u2019s increased its diplomatic budget last year at a faster rate than its military one.\u00a0 And today, it has more diplomatic posts around the world than the United States.\u00a0 If we\u2019re serious about this competition, we have to demonstrate the same diplomatic seriousness of purpose across the board.\nNow, we\u2019re not demanding that other countries \u201cchoose\u201d between us and China \u2013 but rather, we aim to offer a more attractive choice.\u00a0 If we can spark a race to the top, so much the better.\u00a0 That would be to everyone\u2019s benefit.\u00a0 Our budget sets us up to work with likeminded partners to strengthen our offer, and ensure it\u2019s relevant and responsive to the needs and aspirations of people around the world.\nThat\u2019s why the budget includes $2 billion in new investments in high-quality, sustainable infrastructure, rather than low-quality, opaque, extractive projects that leave countries mired in debt.\nIt would invest $2 billion to bolster Indo-Pacific economies and help the United States compete in areas where the PRC currently dominates and in key priorities for the region, including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean energy, digital technology, underseas communications cables, critical mineral mining.\nAnd it contains over $7 billion to extend our economic engagement with the Freely Associated States via the Compacts of Free Association.\u00a0 That\u2019s a critical component of our Indo-Pacific and National Security Strategy.\nAltogether, these funding streams ensure that we can meet a generational challenge and demonstrate our long-term commitment on issues that matter most to key countries in the region \u2013 so that the United States remains the partner of choice.\nDuring this decisive decade, our efforts and investments \u2013 together with our partners \u2013 will determine whether we succeed in advancing our shared affirmative vision for the international system, or whether the PRC can erode or replace the global rules and norms that guarantee peace, security, and stability in the world.\nI\u2019m grateful for this committee\u2019s partnership to sustain the resources and policies required by this challenge and very much look forward to taking your questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-on-the-2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken On the 2022 Report on International Religious Freedom\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Treaty Room", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 15, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Twenty-five years ago, President Clinton signed the International Religious Freedom Act into law.\u00a0 And that gave us a range of new tools to give voice to the persecuted, to empower advocates, to promote religious freedom around the world.\nAt that time, President Clinton noted that freedom of religion was a bedrock American belief.\u00a0 And he said that, and I quote, \u201cWhen we promote religious freedom, we also promote freedom of expression, conscience, and association, and other human rights.\u201d\u00a0 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms this same interdependence.\nReligious freedom is also vital to stable, secure societies.\u00a0 When each person is respected for their beliefs, they are more empowered to reach their full potential, which in turn lifts entire communities and societies.\nToday the State Department is releasing the 2022 International Religious Freedom Report, which provides a fact-based, comprehensive view of the state of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world.\u00a0 This report wouldn\u2019t be possible without the contributions of our civil society partners around the globe who help to shine a spotlight on abuses and advocate for victims of religious persecution.\u00a0 We are grateful for their vital work.\nThis report assesses the actions of countries that are our partners and those with whom we have disagreements, evaluating all by the same standards.\u00a0 Its aim is to highlight areas where freedom of religion or belief is being repressed, to promote accountability, and ultimately drive progress toward a world where freedom of religion or belief is a reality for everyone everywhere.\nOver the past year we\u2019ve seen real progress in some parts of the world on expanding religious freedom as people demanded their rights.\u00a0 Civil society groups pushed for change and governments listened.\nBelgium formally recognized its Buddhist minority, which entitles Buddhist religious organizations to teach their faith in state schools and eventually to apply for federal funding to do so.\nLawmakers in Brazil codified religious freedom guarantees for Afro-Brazilian indigenous communities at the municipal and state levels across the country.\u00a0 They also passed legislation making it a crime carry out discriminatory acts against any religious practices.\nCanada and the European Union both created new offices to combat Islamophobia, while Croatia appointed its first special advisor for combatting anti-Semitism.\nIn the Central African Republic, the country\u2019s special criminal court continue to prosecute cases of religious-based violence and other human rights violations against civilians since the military coup in 2003.\nAnd more broadly, civil society and other concerned governments around the world have successfully secured the release of many who\u2019ve been detained, even imprisoned, for exercising their freedom of religion or belief.\nNow, that\u2019s the positive news.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the report also documents the continuation and, in some instances, the rise of very troubling trends.\u00a0 Governments in many parts of the world continue to target religious minorities using a host of methods, including torture, beatings, unlawful surveillance, and so-called re-education camps.\u00a0 They also continued to engage in other forms of discrimination on the basis of faith or lack of faith, like excluding religious minorities from certain professions or forcing them to work during times of religious observance.\nGovernments use anti-conversion, blasphemy, apostasy laws, which ban the act of leaving a faith, to justify harassment against those who don\u2019t follow their particular interpretation of a theology, often weaponizing those laws against humanists, atheists, and LGBTQI+ individuals.\nAround the world, citizens and civil society organizations stepped up to counter these acts, often at great personal risk.\u00a0 NGOs like Campaign for Uyghurs and Uyghur Human Rights Project are documenting the genocide and crimes against humanity against predominately Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China.\nHuman rights defenders are sounding the alarm on attacks on the Catholic Church by the Ortega-Murillo regime in Nicaragua.\u00a0 Lawyer Martha Patricia Molina Montenegro\u2019s reporting exposed more than 160 attacks against the church and its members since \u2013 in 2022, from desecrations to arbitrary arrests.\u00a0 One of those unjustly detained was Rolando Alvarez, a bishop who criticized the regime\u2019s crackdown on civil and religious liberties and was promptly labeled a \u201ctraitor to the homeland\u201d and sentenced to 26 years in jail.\nPeople across Iran, led by young women, continue peaceful protests demanding their human rights, including freedom of religion, galvanized by the killing of Masa Amini, who was arrested by the so-called morality police because her hijab did not fully cover her hair.\nAmidst the Burma military regime\u2019s ongoing repression of religious minorities, thousands of teachers from Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, and other religious backgrounds continue to teach the importance of human rights, including religious freedom and respect between religions.\nThe United States will continue to stand with and support these brave advocates for religious freedom.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep advocating for religious freedom in countries where the rights are under attack, both publicly and directly in our engagement with government officials.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep working to defend and promote religious freedom here at home, including through the interagency group that President Biden created in December to combat religious bias and discrimination.\nWe defend the right to believe or to not believe, not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because of the extraordinary good that people of faith can do in our societies and around the world to promote peace, to care for the sick, to protect our planet, to expand opportunity for underserved communities, and so much more.\nSo this is an enduring commitment of this administration.\u00a0 This report released today reflects the picture that we see \u2013 saw emerge in 2022, but we are acting on the findings and observations of the report every single day in our efforts around the world to advance freedom of religion and belief.\nThe person who is leading our efforts in that regard is Ambassador Rashad Hussain.\u00a0 It is my pleasure to turn the podium over to him now.\u00a0 Rashad.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR HUSSAIN:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to thank President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Secretary Blinken for their sincere commitments and strong leadership of our global efforts to advance freedom of religion or belief for all people.\u00a0 Let me also take a moment to express my gratitude to our dedicated colleagues at the office of international religious freedom and U.S. embassies and consulates around the world for their remarkable work.\u00a0 They assemble and draft this report after engaging directly with governments, with civil society, and faith actors of every background, and by conducting their own meticulous research.\u00a0 And they are motivated by their unshakable commitment to the idea that saving even one person or improving even one life is well worth their effort.\nThis historic year marks a quarter century since the passage of the International Religious Freedom Act.\u00a0 During these 25 years, the report has served as an invaluable tool for anyone seeking to understand and address religious freedom conditions in any country around the world.\u00a0 So if you ever wonder whether the religious persecution of any group in any part of the world escapes our attention, the answer is in the country-by-country analysis in this report.\nThe role of the International Religious Freedom Office is to work with governments and civil society to expose, counter, and prevent restrictions on religious freedom.\u00a0 The report helps us tailor our diplomatic strategies to the circumstances in particular countries and to inform our policy decisions, and it identifies positive actions as well and trends that we will seek to support.\nNone of this work, of course, is possible without the tenacious leadership of civil society, including the dedicated leaders who are joining us today.\u00a0 So thank you so much for your partnership.\nI\u2019d like to share some key findings from this year\u2019s report regarding religious discrimination and hatred at the governmental and societal levels and describe what we are doing to address it.\nFirst, far too many governments continue to freely target faith community members within their borders.\u00a0 Russia, a Country of Particular Concern for the second year in a row, continues to target faith communities within its borders and beyond.\u00a0 Brave people of faith in Russia who dare to speak against its brutal war against Ukraine are targeted for repression.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China seized, imprisoned, and banished predominantly Muslim Uyghurs to re-education camps.\u00a0 They continue the repression of Tibetan Buddhists, Chinese Christians, and Falun Gong practitioners \u2013 many of whom are fleeing the PRC\u2019s abuses.\nIn Afghanistan, members of communities that do not toe the Taliban\u2019s narrow theological line must hide their religious identity or flee for their lives.\u00a0 In Saudi Arabia, we recognize the important recent moves to increase interfaith dialogue and religious tolerance.\u00a0 Publicly practicing any faith other than Islam, however, remains illegal.\nIn India, legal advocates and faith leaders from across the country\u2019s diverse religious communities condemned a case of extreme hate speech against Muslims in the city of Haridwar, calling for the country to uphold its historical traditions of pluralism and tolerance.\u00a0 And the Burma military regime continues to repress the Rohingya population, causing many to flee their homes.\nOur report also describes our response.\u00a0 We address these concerns directly with governments.\u00a0 We meet with and listen to victims.\u00a0 We partner with civil society and we also urge other countries and multilateral organizations to speak up, to build coalitions, and decry violations and abuses of the freedom of religion or belief.\nAs we do this work of advocating for people all around the world, we are sometimes asked:\u00a0 Who are you as the United States to speak to other countries about their human rights conditions?\u00a0 Well, I believe that we are uniquely situated to stand up for religious freedom around the world for a number of reasons.\u00a0 First of all, we are ourselves a country founded on religious freedom, founded by individuals fleeing religious persecution themselves.\u00a0 They felt so strongly about this right that they enshrined it in the First Amendment in our Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights.\u00a0 And we are a country of immigrants.\u00a0 People come to the United States from all around the world and demand that their elected representatives and government official promote our values in their homelands.\u00a0 They would have it no other way.\u00a0 So who are we to stand up for religious freedom around the world?\u00a0 In many ways we are representatives of the rest of the world gathered here in the United States.\u00a0 And we also don\u2019t walk away from discussing our efforts to form a more perfect union here at home.\nA second theme and trend the report highlights is the increase of government restrictions on access to holy sites and places of worship.\u00a0 We have all seen the sad pictures of Ukraine\u2019s civilians sifting through the rubble of their beautiful and most historic churches destroyed by Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression.\u00a0 Uyghurs have witnessed the PRC Government destroy or repurpose their mosques or cemeteries.\u00a0 Authorities also destroy the monasteries of Tibetan Buddhists and expelled monks and nuns.\nOn my trip to Jerusalem and the West Bank last month, I joined services at al-Aqsa Mosque, attended the Holy Fire Ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and visited the Western Wall during the convergence of Ramadan, Orthodox Easter, and Passover.\u00a0 I sat down with government leaders as well as leaders of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities to discuss the importance of religious coexistence and protecting access to these religious sites.\nThird, many countries continue to legislate and enforce apostasy, blasphemy, and anti\u2011conversion laws and related polices.\u00a0 These laws are direct attacks on the right to freedom of religion or belief.\u00a0 They criminalize religious expression and justify discrimination and harassment against members of minority religious groups or others who do not conform with the dictates of the approved theology.\nFourth, the report shines a light on the need for governments to ensure equal access to primary services for all, including education.\u00a0 Despite the near universal consensus among Islamic scholars regarding the right to education for women and girls, the Taliban in the name of religion continues to rob women and girls of this fundamental right.\u00a0 In Nigeria, yesterday Leah Sharibu turned 20 years old but remains captive to the Islamic State in West Africa Province after being kidnapped six years ago.\nOn the sidelines of last year\u2019s UN General Assembly, I unveiled Pathways to Respect, an effort that highlights the importance of educational initiatives to prevent and combat hatred.\u00a0 Many of these efforts, such as the 2016 Marrakesh Declaration play a critical role in educating public broadly, not just in the formalistic classroom setting; on the rights of religious minorities.\u00a0 I would be remiss not to mention the countless young people who have been forced to flee their homes based on their beliefs regarding religion and find themselves locked out of any educational at all.\u00a0 I had the opportunity to visit some of them in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.\nFinally, in addition to discriminatory laws and policies, the report describes growing bigotry at the societal level in many places around the world.\u00a0 Let me note the ongoing and deeply disturbing proliferation of anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim hatred, and xenophobia that target religious and non-religious communities.\u00a0 We are seeing increasing links between these forms of hatred and between those who propagate them at home and abroad.\u00a0 Earlier this year, I traveled with Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt to the Holocaust sites on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.\u00a0 We continue to participate in the White House-led interagency effort to combat anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hatred.\u00a0 And on March 15th, the anniversary of the Christchurch massacre, the United States joined with countries around the world on the First International Day to Combat Islamophobia.\nDespite the challenges we face, and in many ways because of these shared challenges, defenders of human rights are building a global movement to respond.\u00a0 The 42 members of the International Religious Freedom of Belief \u2013 or belief \u2013 Freedom of Belief Alliance[i]\u00a0collaborate to call for the release of prisoners of conscience, advocate for laws promoting religious freedom, and partner with civil society to promote respect and tolerance around the world.\nThe International Contact Group and civil society coalitions of religious, non-religious, humanitarian, and development organizations cast light on religious freedom violations.\u00a0 They give voice to those who are locked away or forcibly disappeared.\u00a0 And in London last July, I had the honor to join thousands from countries around the world at the International Religious Freedom or Belief ministerial.\u00a0 The Czech Republic will serve as this year\u2019s host.\nReligion can be such a powerful force for good in the world.\u00a0 Societies who seek to restrict it or use it to

Blinken At the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement Ceremony\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "National Academy of Sciences", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 11, 2023", "content": "\n\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Vilsack, Ambassador Branstad, and distinguished guests, my name is Ramin Toloui, Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs here at the State Department.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a pleasure to welcome you to the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement Ceremony.\nFor more than 30 years, the World Food Prize has recognized individuals who advance the cause of food security and nutrition around the world, and the State Department\u2019s collaboration with the World Food Prize goes back more than 20 years, actually to one of my predecessors and fellow Iowan Al Larson.\nAnd in 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell participated in this announcement ceremony.\u00a0 And the reason is the same as the reason that the Nobel Committee awarded Norman Borlaug the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970: food security is essential to global welfare, security, and peace, and elevating and celebrating the individuals whose scholarship, leadership, and activism advance the cause of global food security benefits us all \u2013 Americans and people around the world.\nAnd it\u2019s not about just the prize itself.\u00a0 Concurrent with the award ceremony in October, Des Moines also hosts the Borlaug Dialogue, which brings together scholars and practitioners for panels and seminars dedicated to the various critical food security issues the world faces today.\nAt last year\u2019s dialogue, it was a particular delight for me to meet the USDA Borlaug Fellows.\u00a0 These are young scholars from around the world who are selected to come to the United States and spend time at U.S. universities around our country on research collaborations, and so I met scholars from Egypt, Philippines, Tunisia, Algeria.\u00a0 And what was so exhilarating was getting to hear their passion for the problems that they were working on that came from their experiences in their local communities.\nAnd the idea that they would come to the United States, spend time at research organizations, and then take back to their communities the knowledge that can help solve the problems that are important to their lives was really what it was \u2013 what this collaboration \u2013 what the Borlaug Dialogue was all about.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just the \u201cwhat\u201d; it\u2019s the \u201chow\u201d through these global partnerships, and that\u2019s something that Norman Borlaug believed in very deeply.\nOn a personal note, as a native of Iowa City and fourth generation Iowan myself, it was rewarding to see the excitement of these young scholars and welcome them to my home state.\nSo with that, let\u2019s get down to it.\u00a0 Now, to introduce the new World Food Prize Foundation President and Former U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, I welcome World Food Prize Foundation COO Mashal Husain to the stage.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS HUSAIN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you Assistant Secretary Toloui for your very gracious introduction.\u00a0 To all our guests here this morning,\u00a0khushamdeed.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the manner in which friends are greeted in my country of heritage, Pakistan.\u00a0 Dr. Norman Borlaug often heard this phrase of welcome from farmers in the villages of Punjab, working to increase food production and prevent famine across South Asia.\u00a0\u00a0Khushamdeed\u00a0to all of you and welcome to the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMy own lifelong cross-cultural journey has taken me from my native Pakistan to living in Tanzania, the Philippines, and in Thailand and has ultimately brought me to the place from which Dr. Borlaug\u2019s \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d emanated, Iowa, where I found my purpose at the World Food Prize.\nSecretary Blinken, on behalf of our president, Ambassador Terry Branstad, Janis Ruan, and the entire Ruan family, as well as our board chair Paul Schickler, and our counsel of advisors, I want to thank you and your exceptional State Department staff for your invaluable collaboration.\nThis special gathering continues the tradition that began in 2004, when the first laureate announcement was held in partnership with the State Department.\u00a0 As a special surprise that year for Dr. Borlaug, who had just celebrated his 90th birthday, the State Department presented a cake with 90 candles.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He blew out the candles and made a wish.\u00a0 When asked what he wished for, he replied that this ceremony could take place with the State Department every year.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So Mr. Secretary, today, you are still making Dr. Borlaug\u2019s wish come true.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I know Julie Borlaug, his granddaughter who is here, is especially grateful to you and to Secretary Vilsack for your instrumental roles in carrying forward his legacy and this wonderful tradition.\nThe World Food Prize promotes Dr. Borlaug\u2019s legacy of global peace through agriculture and champions the values that drive us to create a better world.\u00a0 We do so by holding our annual Borlaug Dialogue addressing critical and cutting-edge conversations in food security.\u00a0 We do so by inspiring our next generation of agricultural innovators and by awarding our World Food Prize.\nSince 1987, 52 laureates from 21 countries and the United Nations have been recognized for their achievements in confronting hunger, poverty, and malnutrition.\u00a0 Now to reveal our 53rd World Food Prize laureate, it is my great honor to introduce the president of the World Food Prize, former U.S. ambassador to China, and the longest-serving governor in the history of the United States, Ambassador Terry Branstad.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR BRANSTAD:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mashal, for that very kind introduction.\u00a0 Thank you to Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack, for joining us for this very important celebration.\nWe are grateful to all of you for the strong partnership between the World Food Prize Foundation, the State Department, and the Department of Agriculture.\u00a0 This laureate announcement is a great legacy of collaboration which dates back nearly 20 years.\u00a0 Thank you also to all the members of the Iowa congressional delegation, many of which are here with us today, to support. Your support is also very much appreciated.\u00a0 I would especially like to thank the Greater Des Moines Partnership and Jay Byers, who\u2019s joined us today along with his team.\u00a0 This is the most Iowans that I\u2019ve seen in Washington, D.C. \u2013 (laughter and applause) \u2013 the most Iowans in Washington, D.C. since we dedicated the statue of Norman Borlaug in Statuary Hall in 2014 on his 100th birthday.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI am thrilled to be attending my first laureate announcement and I\u2019m honored to be here with all of you.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always been a strong supporter and advocate for the World Food Prize Foundation and served as governor when Dr. Borlaug partnered with Iowa businessman and philanthropist John Ruan, Sr. to move the World Food Prize to Des Moines.\u00a0 There wouldn\u2019t be a World Food Prize today if it were not for the ongoing commitment and vision of the Ruan family.\u00a0 We are very grateful for their dedication to this important work.\nAmbassador Quinn is also with us today in the front row.\u00a0 He is responsible for taking the World Food Prize Foundation to the very successful progress it\u2019s made over the last 25 years.\u00a0 Ambassador Quinn, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAll of us Iowans are proud of our native son, Norman Borlaug.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug and I are both of Norwegian heritage, and we share roots on farms in northern Iowa.\u00a0 In fact, Dr. Borlaug grew up on a farm in Howard County, and I grew up on a farm just two counties away in Winnebago County.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his lifetime of work to feed a hungry world.\u00a0 He is the guiding light behind the World Food Prize, which honors significant achievements in improving the world\u2019s food supply.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug\u2019s granddaughter, Julie, is here with us today.\u00a0 Julie, thank you for continuing your grandfather\u2019s legacy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI also want to thank Dr. Gebisa Ejeta, who is the 2009 laureate, for his service as chair of the independent group of experts who select the World Food Prize laureates.\nToday, I have the honor of announcing the 2023 World Food Prize laureate.\u00a0\u00a0 Our 53rd laureate has built a model of work directly with farmers to restore farmland and food security after devastating conflict.\u00a0 Through this work, she has shown more than a million people living in war-torn regions a way forward to restoring peace and prosperity through agriculture.\nHere\u2019s how it works.\u00a0 First she partners with demining organizations to clear land mines.\u00a0 Then she works with farmers to replant fields with modern agriculture practices.\u00a0 Our laureate has worked in nine countries to confront the daunting challenge of rebuilding food systems and livelihoods after conflict.\u00a0 She started by partnering with wineries in her home state of California to raise funds to remove land mines in Croatia and replant vineyards and orchards.\u00a0 Then she took this model to Afghanistan.\u00a0 After clearing land mines there, she helped farmers \u2013 including more than 5,000 women \u2013 produce high-quality crops.\u00a0 She built agriculture value chains and provided market support and development.\nHer organization is one of the few U.S. non-profits that\u2019s still operating in Afghanistan.\u00a0 In Vietnam, she partnered with the State Department and with others to clear unexploded bombs, making it possible to plant more than 1.6 million black pepper trees.\u00a0 Her work shows the world the vital role agriculture must have in the resilient recovery from conflict and restoration and peace.\nFor making her mission to turn mines to vines, I am so pleased to announce that the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate is Heidi K\u00fchn.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHeidi K\u00fchn is the founder and CEO of the non-profit Roots of Peace.\u00a0 We are pleased to have here with us her husband Gary and one of her four children, her son Tucker.\u00a0 Thank you to the K\u00fchn family.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYeah, stand up.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nToday, Heidi is actually in Azerbaijan.\u00a0 As we speak, she\u2019s working in Azerbaijan to remove land mines \u2013 which is her Mother\u2019s Day tradition.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI want to also welcome Ambassador Ibrahim from Azerbaijan, who I think is also here.\u00a0 Ambassador, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 An honor to have you and many other ambassadors here.\nIt will be our honor to present the World Food Prize at the beautiful Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines on October 26th.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 This will culminate the event of the 2023 International Borlaug Dialogue from October 24th through the 26th, which will be held in person as well as virtually.\u00a0 Our theme this year is \u201cHarnessing Change.\u201d\nAgain, I want to say thanks to all of you for coming today.\u00a0 I hope to see you all in Des Moines in October \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as we celebrate our 2023 laureate.\u00a0 Again, thank you for being here, and\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to Heidi K\u00fchn as our new laureate.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR FOWLER:\u00a0 Good morning.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Good morning.\nMR FOWLER:\u00a0 I\u2019m Cary Fowler.\u00a0 I\u2019m the Special Envoy for Global Food Security, and I feel like I should say I\u2019m not from Iowa.\u00a0 I think I\u2019m the first one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The office of secretary of state is not where you would expect to find a farmer sitting behind the desk.\u00a0 And indeed, I \u2013 not sure that there has been one sitting behind that desk since the first secretary of state, who was Thomas Jefferson.\u00a0 Jefferson famously said that the greatest service that can be rendered to any country is to add a new crop to its cultivation.\u00a0 Norman Borlaug, the inspiration for the World Food Prize, effectively did that by giving new life and added productivity to one of the world\u2019s oldest staple crops: wheat.\nSeveral weeks ago, our next speaker appeared before a Senate committee, and among other things \u2013 after all, it was, I think, a hearing that lasted several hours \u2013 mentioned the importance of adapting crops and the importance of soil fertility to food security.\u00a0 I can imagine that both Thomas Jefferson and Norman Borlaug would have approved.\nIn our community, Mr. Secretary, it\u2019s a high honor to be mentioned in the same sentence with Thomas Jefferson and Norman Borlaug, but that honor belongs to you.\u00a0 It belongs to you for the priority that you\u2019ve given to combatting food insecurity, the guiding spirit behind the World Food Prize.\nSo it\u2019s my privilege to introduce my boss and our Secretary of State, Antony Blinken to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Welcome to Iowa Day.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 This is a shameless promotion for the state.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I\u2019m glad that Cary mentioned that he\u2019s not from Iowa because I was going to ask: Is there anyone here who is not from Iowa?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And it turns out that apparently, Cary, you and I are probably the only people who are not, although maybe we should do a little bit of digging into the birth records to find out.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut thank you, my friend, for that truly lovely introduction, humbling introduction.\u00a0 To you, to Under Secretary Jose Fernandez, Assistant Secretary Toloui, to the entire team in our Office of Agricultural Policy, thank you for what you\u2019re doing every single day to fight global hunger.\nAnd it\u2019s particularly inspiring to be here with many of the people who are leading what is a whole-of-government mission to advance our commitment to food security.\u00a0 Agriculture Secretary Vilsack, USAID Assistant Administrator Dina Esposito, and many of members of Congress who are with us today, it\u2019s wonderful to have you here, wonderful to have your partnership in this absolutely essential \u2013 it\u2019s hard to think of a more essential \u2013 effort that we make around the world.\nAnd Ambassador Branstad \u2013 maybe I should say governor because once a governor, always a governor, especially if you happen to the longest-serving governor in the history of the United States.\u00a0 And Secretary Vilsack, Governor Vilsack, the longest-serving Democratic governor in the State of Iowa.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nBut Terry, thank you to you, to everyone at the World Food Prize Foundation for the absolutely vital work that you\u2019re doing to inspire action and support outstanding individuals who are improving global food security, including, of course, this year\u2019s remarkable laureate, Heidi K\u00fchn.\nIt\u2019s wonderful that members of her family are here.\u00a0 I thought how inspiring that someone who has just won one of the most significant awards any of us can give can\u2019t be here.\u00a0 Because what is she doing?\u00a0 She\u2019s actually doing her work in the field, helping to remove landmines in Azerbaijan.\u00a0 I think that in and of itself is an extraordinary tribute to Heidi and the work that she does.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo as you\u2019ve heard, for more than 25 years, Heidi has led a movement to remove landmines from former conflict zones and plant crops in their place \u2013 turning fields of death into gardens of life.\nIn total, by harnessing the collective power of governments, businesses, international organizations, Heidi\u2019s non-profit, Roots of Peace, has, as you\u2019ve heard, removed over 100,000 landmines.\u00a0\u00a0 And not just removed them \u2013 this is what\u2019s so extraordinarily powerful \u2013 restored the land that is now being used by over a million farmers across nine countries, helping to feed people and create economic opportunity for so many.\nNow, we know that today conflict remains the largest single driver of food insecurity.\u00a0 The ten worst food crises in the world have all been caused or worsened by conflict.\u00a0 Seventy percent of the hungriest people in the world live in regions that are affected by war and by violence.\u00a0 And, often, even when the violence ends, hunger remains.\nOver the last year, millions more have been affected by conflict beyond their borders, as the Kremlin has tried to leverage food as a weapon in its aggression against Ukraine.\nFood insecurity, of course, is also being worsened by other intersecting challenges \u2013 COVID\u201119 and its disruption of global food supply chains and the climate crisis that\u2019s killing crops around the world.\u00a0 Hundreds of millions of people face food insecurity across our planet.\nSo for me, for the State Department, this is of course first and foremost a human issue, but it\u2019s also a national security issue, as well as an economic issue.\u00a0 In the United States, we are deeply committed to addressing it on all of these fronts.\nWe\u2019ve long been the largest single donor of global food assistance, something that I\u2019m immensely proud of.\u00a0 Last year, we contributed $13.5 billion to these efforts \u2013 when we had the Russian aggression exacerbate the problem, we doubled down on what we were doing.\u00a0 We provide more than 40 percent of the World Food Programme\u2019s budget every year.\nWe\u2019re also working to sustain the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has facilitated the delivery of more than 29 million metric tons of food from Ukraine to the global market since July.\u00a0 Now, this initiative never should have been necessary in the first place.\u00a0 It never should have been necessary because Russia should not have invaded Ukraine.\u00a0 It never should have been necessary because once Russia invaded Ukraine, it shouldn\u2019t have gotten into the business of blockading Ukraine\u2019s ports and preventing food from going around the world to people who desperately need it.\u00a0 Nonetheless, it was necessary.\nThe United Nations, T\u00fcrkiye did an extraordinary job in helping to set it up.\u00a0 But the fact that it succeeded over the last months in getting so much grain to so many places around the world is a very powerful thing.\u00a0 This includes eight million tons of wheat.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of roughly 16 billion loaves of bread, most of which has gone to low-income countries, including under the auspices of the World Food Programme.\nJust as we\u2019re focused on the acute humanitarian challenge of hunger, we\u2019re also addressing long-term food insecurity \u2013 including by working closely with partners across the globe.\u00a0 Because none of us can solve this complex problem alone, and also because what I\u2019ve heard time and again, especially from engaging with my counterparts around the world \u2013 foreign ministers from Africa and other places \u2013 is again and again:\u00a0 Yes, we need, we\u2019re grateful for emergency assistance, but what we most want is the ability to sustain the production for ourselves.\u00a0 And so the more that we can contribute to that, the more that we can help countries build resilient, sustaining productive capacity, that really is the objective.\nWe\u2019ve heard from partners again and again:\u00a0 Emergency food aid cannot be the only solution. And so we are investing in sustainable, long-term food production.\nLast May, we helped launch the Roadmap for Global Food Security, which calls on countries to fight hunger for generations to come \u2013 not just next month, not just next year, but for generations to come.\u00a0 Today, more than 100 countries have signed on and pledged to take swift, concrete steps toward building stronger, more resilient food systems, from improving access to markets for farmers to boosting the productivity of crops.\nWe\u2019re putting a special focus on adapting agricultural to \u2013 agriculture to the changing environment that we\u2019re all experiencing.\u00a0 We\u2019re helping farmers learn techniques that make their crops more resilient.\u00a0 Dr. Fowler is doing extraordinary work, along with international organizations, researchers, and donors, to improve healthy soil and identify regional crops that can thrive in Africa despite climate change.\u00a0 This focus on soil and seeds is absolutely essential for the future.\nWe also expanded USAID\u2019s Feed the Future program last year, from 12 target countries to 20, which will help farmers produce more crops, raise healthier livestock, and grow their businesses.\u00a0 The work that USAID is doing every single day on the frontlines of this effort is absolutely central to our efforts.\nPartnerships \u2013 across governments, science, business \u2013 that\u2019s at the heart of so much of our work on food insecurity.\u00a0 It is critical to our success.\nAnd when it comes down to it, it\u2019s the pioneers and visionaries like Heidi K\u00fchn who are such a big part of this process.\u00a0 They bring a spirit of innovation to this work.\u00a0 They bring a spirit of determination to this work, and they are quite literally forging new paths toward progress.\nIt\u2019s of course a special honor to be in the long, extraordinary shadow of Norm Borlaug.\u00a0 Hard to think of a fellow citizen who\u2019s done more for the world over so many years.\u00a0 And Julie, a reference has been made to you.\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 Are you here with us today?\u00a0 And if so, stand up \u2013 if not, we send our greetings to you.\u00a0 We send our greetings to the entire family.\u00a0 The efforts that Norman made to make our planet a little bit more just, a little bit more stable, a little bit more peaceful.\nTo this year\u2019s winner of the prize, thank you for carrying on that extraordinary tradition.\u00a0 And thanks to all of you for being here today and for your efforts every single day to help feed our planet.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, thank you for those wonderful remarks.\u00a0 We now return to the Iowan portion of the programming.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And it\u2019s my honor to introduce another leader on food security here and abroad, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY VILSACK:\u00a0\u00a0When I ran for governor in 1998, I wore a sweatshirt that said: I wasn\u2019t born in Iowa, but I got here as fast as I could.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So Tony, Dr. Fowler, there\u2019s still hope.\u00a0\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIt\u2019s an honor to be here today to acknowledge the work of Heidi and Roots [of] Peace.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s somewhat of a framing device for the last month that I\u2019ve experienced as Secretary of Agriculture.\u00a0 Several weeks ago I was in Vietnam visiting with the prime minister about our relationship.\u00a0 And what a phenomenal experience it is to be in Vietnam, a person my age; to have the experience of being welcomed by a leader and have the conversation and discussion substantively talk about the important role of agriculture in building relationships and friendships between two countries who in a lifetime had been at war.\nIt was interesting to me because at the tail end of our conversation, after we\u2019d gotten through all of the trade issues and some of the substantive issues, the prime minister turned to me and he said, \u201cWe still need help.\u00a0 We still need help removing explosive devices from our fields.\u00a0 We still need the United States to work with us to allow our farmers the opportunity to farm.\u201d\u00a0 So Heidi\u2019s work obviously incredibly important and ongoing, tragically.\nI then traveled to Japan, another country at one point in time that we were at war, and had the opportunity to visit with the agricultural minister, whose first comment about the relationship between the United States and Japan was focused on the hog lift that Iowa farmers were engaged in when a tsunami hit Japan and wiped out their hog industry, and the importance and significance of that relationship that is still valued today.\u00a0 As Ambassador Branstad knows, we\u2019ve both been to Yamanashi, we both know how important that connection has been.\nAnd then I come back home, and this week we invited folks who are engaged in our AIM For Climate Initiative.\u00a0 Now, this is an initiative that is right down Norman Borlaug\u2019s sweet spot.\u00a0 It is about science, it\u2019s about innovation, it\u2019s about agriculture and the role of embracing and enabling farmers to continue to be productive, sustainable, and profitable.\u00a0 We welcomed the largest number of agricultural ministers that have ever assembled in Washington, D.C. \u2013 over 50 nations represented at our Aim For Climate Summit.\nAnd during the course of the conversations that we had with a number of noted guests, Norman Borlaug\u2019s name was mentioned, world food laureate prize \u2013 World Food Prize laureates\u2019 names were mentioned frequently, because there was a recognition and understanding that in order for us to deal with the existential challenge that we face in agriculture and in food security of continuing to be productive at a time when climate is changing and threatening our capacity to produce, it is science and innovation that is at the heart of how we\u2019re going to approach this issue.\nNorman had some great advice for policy makers, and that advice was take it to the farmer.\u00a0 If you provide farmers the information, if you provide them the resources, there isn\u2019t anything they can\u2019t do.\u00a0 There isn\u2019t any problem they can\u2019t solve when it comes to growing and raising food.\nIt\u2019s been an extraordinary journey, and the World Food Prize allows us every year in October to focus the world\u2019s attention on the importance of agriculture, on the importance of farmers, on the significant contribution they make not just to food security but to overall peace and security, as witnessed by the fact that we\u2019re now working with Vietnam, we\u2019ve always worked with Japan.\u00a0 And during the course of the G7 meeting that was in Japan, the minister from Ukraine came on by video and talked about the necessity and need that when this war ultimately is over \u2013 and we hope it is over as soon as possible \u2013 the expectation is that the United States of America will work collaboratively with Ukraine to rebuild their agricultural economy.\nSo in acknowledging Heidi\u2019s work, in acknowledging the work of the laureates in the past, we really live the opportunity to remind ourselves of the importance of vision; the importance of a man, Norman Borlaug, whose vision still today impacts our ability to produce; the vision of John Ruan and John Ruan\u2019s family in allowing this great opportunity to continue.\nSo I\u2019m pleased to be here today.\u00a0 I\u2019m pleased to acknowledge Heidi and her family for the work that they do.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known her for quite some time.\u00a0 The passion \u2013 the unfortunate thing was she\u2019s not here today, because if she were, you would understand and appreciate the passion that drives her.\u00a0 And that is the same passion that drove Norman Borlaug.\u00a0 It is the same passion that has driven every one of our laureates.\nSo this is a day of celebration, a day of acknowledgment of the work of one person to make a difference.\u00a0 But at the end of the day, it is ultimately a celebration of the power and significance of agriculture and of farmers everywhere in the world.\u00a0 And that is indeed a cause for great celebration.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Vilsack, for those remarks.\u00a0 It\u2019s now my honor to introduce Dina Esposito, assistant to the administrator for the International Development Bureau for Resilience and Food Security at the U.S. Agency for International Development and deputy coordinator of the Feed the Future program.\nDina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS ESPOSITO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Assistant Secretary Toloui, and good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be here with those of you in Washington, and welcome to those of you joining virtually online as well.\u00a0 I am thrilled to be here and to be adding my voice to those we\u2019ve heard today and celebrating the World Food Prize Laureate Heidi K\u00fchn.\u00a0 Heidi K\u00fchn\u2019s leadership of Roots [of] Peace has shown us how agriculture can be a peacebuilder in the wake of conflict, not only rebuilding food systems in economies but by restoring hope and helping survivors envision and move towards a brighter future.\u00a0 We don\u2019t actually always think about this connection, how agricultural development can spur peace.\u00a0 Roots of Peace has shown us that making this connection can lead to transformative results.\nFor 26 years, Heidi has been a thought leader, bridging peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance, and economic growth to show how agriculture can help people cope and sow the seeds of a positive future.\u00a0 In conflict zones there\u2019s a tendency to focus on the searing experience of the war itself, and we often forget that these zones are still places of possibility, where people live, work, raise their families; where smallholder farmers \u2013 many of them women \u2013 need to rebuild and sustain livelihoods despite cycles of conflict.\u00a0 We must keep this at the forefront of our efforts.\u00a0 More conflicts rage today than any time since the Cold War, and more people are displaced than ever before.\nAnd when conflict strikes, it severely disrupts agriculture and food systems.\u00a0 A farmer may not be able to plant or travel to markets.\u00a0 She may have to cope in dangerous ways \u2013 by eating less, feeding her children less, traveling farther afield for goods, or quickly selling off her assets.\u00a0 Wages, extension services, and inputs are adversely affected too.\u00a0 And all of this further damages farmers\u2019 ability to make the adjustment they need to adapt to a changing climate, further fueling vulnerability.\u00a0 The better we understand these connections, as Heidi K\u00fchn has, and the earlier we take action on them, the better we can achieve our shared goal of a more food-secure and peaceful world.\nConflict is the largest driver of global food insecurity worldwide.\u00a0 And as the world\u2019s provider \u2013 largest provider of humanitarian assistance, we at USAID often hear, as Secretary Blinken also said, this refrain in fragile and war-torn places:\u00a0 Thank you for the relief assistance, but please help us rebuild so we can take care of ourselves and our families.\u00a0 Because of visionary partners like Heidi and Roots of Peace, we are able to do just that, to integrate what are often siloed efforts of peacebuilding, conflict prevention, community resilience, and long-term development, bringing them together in a shared vision.\nAnd we\u2019re investing in lasting food security in communities around the world through the U.S. Government\u2019s Feed the Future global hunger initiative.\u00a0 USAID is proud to call Roots of Peace a partner in this work.\u00a0 In fact, this year marks 20 years since USAID and Roots [of] Peace first began working together.\u00a0 This was in Afghanistan, where decades of war left the country\u2019s farming infrastructure in ruins and its market linkages broken.\u00a0 Through Heidi and her team\u2019s efforts, smallholder farmers benefited from training, tools, and market support they needed to increase their harvests and their incomes.\nIt\u2019s just one among \u2013 one example among many of how Roots [of] Peace has shown us through their work that we can help sustain livelihoods, even in conflict-affected settings.\u00a0 It is this simple but powerful insight that Heidi K\u00fchn acted on so many years ago, and for which we and the world are profoundly grateful.\u00a0 Again, my thanks to Heidi for her groundbreaking work and well-deserved recognition as the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Dina.\u00a0 And to close our ceremony, I\u2019m pleased to welcome to the stage Jose Fernandez, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, to give closing remarks.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUNDER SECRETARY FERNANDEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Full disclosure:\u00a0 I\u2019m not from Iowa.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But two years ago, I participated in the race across Iowa, the RAGBRAI.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And for six days and nights in 100-plus degree weather, across 500 miles of soybeans and corn fields, I experienced the warmth and the hospitality of Iowans \u2013 hospitality and pork chops.\u00a0 (Laughter, applause.)\u00a0 And \u2013 I haven\u2019t had a pork chop since.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us today.\u00a0 Thank you to the World Food Prize Foundation for inviting us.\u00a0 And thank you to the National Academy of Sciences for allowing us to use this beautiful venue.\u00a0 I would like to add my congratulations to our winner, the 2022 [1] \u00a0prize laureate Heidi K\u00fchn for her amazing work, her courageous work in converting heavily mined war zones into healthy and productive agricultural lands.\u00a0 We at the State Department believe that we must make global food assistance more resilient in the face of armed conflicts such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while also responding to the critical threats that are posed by the climate crisis, climate crisis whose impact on global food security and global agriculture and fishery systems are increasingly severe.\u00a0 We\u2019re fortunate to have talented, far-seeing, innovative partners like Heidi K\u00fchn and the World Food Prize Foundation to help us tackle these twin challenges.\nAnd as we end today\u2019s ceremony, it should be clear to everyone who\u2019s here in person and also participating virtually how seriously the U.S. Government takes this issue \u2013 through pioneering\u00a0 climate-resilient and food security initiatives, what Cary Fowler is doing now at the State Department or working with government, with embassies, with companies, with researchers, with philanthropies around the world to drive investment and innovation towards our most pressing challenges.\u00a0 And we\u2019re grateful to the World Food Prize Foundation for this \u2013 for advancing these goals, as well as to everyone here in this room.\nLet me thank Secretary Blinken, Secretary Vilsack, my colleagues in EB, and Assistant Administrator Esposito for their personal engagement.\u00a0 I\u2019d also like to thank Ambassador Terry Branstad \u2013 thank you, sir \u2013 and the entire World Food Prize Foundation for their commitment to strengthening global food security and food systems.\nThe State Department and our government partners look forward to participating in the October Borlaug Dialogue in Des Moines \u2013 and I look forward to being there as well \u2013 and our efforts throughout the year to advance common objectives to build sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems.\nSo thank you again.\u00a0 Thank you again to everyone for joining us today, and once more,\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to the 2023 World Prize Laureate, Heidi K\u00fchn.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\u00a0\n[1] 2023\n\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s really wonderful to have my friend, the foreign minister, back at the State Department.\u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Manuel, welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to have you.\nAs always, with such a close ally and friend, there is no shortage of important issues that we\u2019re tackling together.\u00a0 And the conversation that we had today, not surprisingly, reflected that.\u00a0 We covered a lot of territory together, and let me just share some of the important points.\nOne of the areas we discussed was deepening our cooperation in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 Spain has long invested in expanding economic opportunity for people across the region, and it\u2019s a key partner in supporting implementation of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which brings a regional approach to promoting safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.\u00a0 We are grateful for Spain\u2019s commitment to work with us on these Regional Processing Centers that we\u2019re establishing, which will expand access to people in the Americas who seek safe and legal migration options to come to the United States and potentially to Spain.\nThese innovative centers will allow people to stay in their own countries and determine their eligibility for lawful pathways to the United States, making them less likely to undertake the dangerous and costly journey to the border to seek asylum.\u00a0 And the centers will be a referral point for humanitarian refugee protections in other countries, including Spain.\u00a0 Spain has already received hundreds of thousands of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean.\u00a0 It\u2019s committed to increase the number of people that it accepts from the region.\u00a0 Madrid recently created an innovative new pathway itself that will work with the private sector to match the skills of people seeking protection with the needs of Spanish businesses.\nI also thanked Jos\u00e9 Manuel for Madrid\u2019s unwavering support and partnership with and for Ukraine as it defends its people and its territory against Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression.\u00a0 Spain\u2019s assistance has come in all forms: robust military aid, including the recent revision of Leopard 2 tanks; air defense systems; ammunition; humanitarian aid, including ambulances specially equipped to tend to the needs of women and girls; and of course, the generosity of the Spanish people, who have now welcomed more than 173,000 displaced Ukrainians into their communities.\nSpain has made clear that marshaling ongoing support for Ukraine \u2013 and for the principles at the heart of the United Nations Charter, including respect for a nation\u2019s sovereignty, territorial independence \u2013 will be a central focus of its upcoming presidency of the Council of the European Union.\u00a0 This is just one of the many ways that Spain is demonstrating leadership in rallying allies and partners around our shared interests and shared values.\nSpain has also played a key role in shaping the Strategic Concept that we and our allies adopted at the Madrid Summit of NATO that sets out a vision for strengthening transatlantic security in the face of unprecedented challenges.\u00a0 And Madrid has led by example in delivering on the commitments we made in deploying additional troops to bolster NATO\u2019s eastern flank, to strengthen the defenses of our Alliance.\nWe also discussed how to strengthen our longstanding efforts to defend and promote human rights.\u00a0 And to that end, we\u2019re very pleased, as we just did, to welcome Spain to the Global Equality Fund, a partnership between governments and the private sector to support those on the front lines of advancing the human rights of the LGBTQI community and people around the world.\nWith Jos\u00e9 Manuel\u2019s signature, Spain becomes now the 18th government to join this effort, which has dedicated over $100 million to civil society organizations and human rights defenders in more than 100 countries.\u00a0 Every year, that support takes the form of training and tools that make local advocates safer and more effective, and emergency assistance and legal aid to human rights defenders and LGBTQI+ persons who face violence and abuse because of who they are, who they love, or what they do.\u00a0 Our efforts are helping to change the views of individuals and communities, and chipping away at enduring prejudice and abuse.\u00a0 We will be even stronger with Spain as a partner.\nWe also touched upon a number of other important issues of mutual concern, including shared concern about the situation in the Sahel and the work we can do there together to help stabilize countries that are in very difficult situations.\u00a0 We engaged on a number of issues relating to Spain\u2019s upcoming presidency of the European Union.\u00a0 And of course, we discussed how we can build on our cooperation across all of these priorities and many others when President Biden hosts President S\u00e1nchez at the White House later this week.\nThis includes accelerating our joint efforts to cut carbon emissions and increase energy security, expanding inclusive economic opportunities, fostering entrepreneurship, and deepening our educational exchanges and scientific collaboration \u2013 something we spent some time discussing today \u2013 all priorities that will benefit the people of our nations and people around the world.\u00a0 With that, Jos\u00e9 Manuel, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) First of all, I would like to thank Tony Blinken for his hospitality and warmth during this trip to Washington.\u00a0 The Secretary of State is a good friend with whom I have had several meetings already, and these meetings have always been extremely fruitful for the relationship between our two countries.\u00a0 Spain and the U.S. share values and interests, such as the fight against climate change, preserving the environment, defending democracy and human rights.\u00a0 And on the international stage, we defend an international rule-based order and we work together on this within NATO, the G20, the UN, organizations in which we share the defense of these common values.\u00a0 These are the foundations upon which our relationship is based, and we would like to continue to build upon this to create stronger ties in the future.\nIn May, we signed the Madrid Declaration.\u00a0 This was the first U.S.-Spain declaration signed in two decades, which has strengthened our bilateral relationship even more in many areas.\u00a0 And one year later, the excellent state of our bilateral relationship is shown with the meeting that we just had and the meeting that our president of government will hold with President Biden this Friday.\nThis bilateral relationship is based on many ties: our businesses, which have a significant presence in both countries; our universities, who cooperate very closely; and we are also united by the strengths of our languages.\u00a0 We have talked about many of these issues, areas of cooperation today \u2013 our defense cooperation, our migration agreement via which Spain and the U.S. will work together in order to promote safe, humane, orderly, and regular migration from Latin American countries.\u00a0 We discussed Palomares as well as the renewal of the Scientific Cooperation Agreement to continue to promote working together with NASA, especially the Artemis program.\u00a0 We just signed an MOU to work together in one additional area: protecting the human rights of LGBTQI people through the world Equality Forum.\nWe unfortunately for many months have done \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the unjust, illegal war against Ukraine, and we talked about the transatlantic ties that tie the U.S. and Europe.\u00a0 Regarding the situation in Ukraine, I have discussed with Secretary Blinken the unconditional support of Spain as long as necessary with that country.\u00a0 We support Ukraine in its defense against the violation of its territorial sovereignty.\u00a0 This will \u2013 we will maintain this until peace comes once again to the borders of Ukraine and Ukraine is able to recover total sovereignty.\nWe also discussed how the Sahel is increasingly \u2013 has increasing geostrategic importance.\u00a0 We have discussed in NATO the threats that come from the southern flank, and we will continue to work to strengthen stability and development in the Sahel and coordinate our cooperation missions via AECID and USAID.\nThe transatlantic unity is key.\u00a0 It\u2019s always key, but it\u2019s even more so in moments like these \u2013 unity among Europeans, but also transatlantic unity with the U.S., which is a natural ally to Spain in many areas: health, energy, food security.\u00a0 In all of these areas, cooperation with the United States is vital.\nWe also spoke of the next EU summit during the presidency of Spain.\u00a0 This will be one of our priorities because we think that the entire Atlantic should become closer.\u00a0 There must be closer ties between our shores and we must create more stability and growth.\nIn sum, I would like to once again thank you for your hospitality, Tony.\u00a0 We will continue to work on these foundations of our relationship of friendship and cooperation, and that is why this week will culminate, then, with the meeting between President Biden and President S\u00e1nchez, which will show once again the excellent relationship that binds our countries.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Andrea Mitchell from NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister and Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good to see you, Andrea.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, as you know, China is the largest holder of U.S. debt.\u00a0 With the gridlock now in Washington, are you concerned that China and Russia will try to take advantage of the economic chaos that could ensue here and the gridlock right now, and that would damage the credibility of American democracy and economic power around the world?\nAnd I\u2019d also like to ask you what your message is to U.S. companies \u2013 companies working in China that are being raided by the police under their new law, their counterespionage law, that accuses them of espionage for sharing data with the United States.\u00a0 What do you recommend that American companies do?\u00a0 Is there anything the U.S. can do to protect them?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, your prime minister was recently in Beijing.\u00a0 China\u2019s foreign minister is now on tour in Europe and has threatened reprisals against the EU if it sanctions the Chinese companies that have supported Russia\u2019s war machine.\u00a0 Would you \u2013 is the EU \u2013 should the EU punish Chinese companies and retaliate against them despite the risk that China will have reprisals against the EU?\nThank you both very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much, Andrea. \u00a0On the debt ceiling, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the White House and our colleagues there.\u00a0 I think, as a general proposition, it\u2019s proven time and again to be a bad bet to bet against the United States.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the conversations that are going on now.\nWith regard to the treatment of some of our companies and other companies in China, I\u2019ve seen those reports and we obviously have concerns.\u00a0 I mean, one of our general concerns \u2013 and it\u2019s a concern shared by many allies and partners \u2013 is the way some of our enterprises are treated in China, certainly treated in a way that\u2019s not reciprocal to the way that many Chinese enterprises are treated, businesses are treated, around the world.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one of the challenges that I think a number of countries have.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we talk to the Chinese about.\u00a0 To the extent, of course, that China wants to have a positive business environment that attracts foreign investment, that attracts foreign businesses, the actions that it takes with regard to those businesses will have a big impact.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) China is a country \u2013 due to its demographic weight, its military capabilities, its economic weight \u2013 is extremely important for global challenges such as climate change or such as using the influence that it has on Russia and Vladimir Putin in order to achieve peace as soon as possible in Ukraine, because the war in Ukraine is a \u2013 it\u2019s not a European war, but it is a war in Europe.\u00a0 It\u2019s a war against the principles of the UN Charter, and China is a permanent member of the Security Council.\u00a0 So it is in that spirit that we work with China.\nWhat we want with every country worldwide is equal conditions under which we receive the businesses of any country in the world and where our businesses are able to go to those countries.\u00a0 And in Europe, all European countries are open societies.\u00a0 We believe in free trade and we believe in a relationship with all countries on the planet.\u00a0 We do always require equal conditions for the businesses that we receive and for our businesses that go to any other country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Eduard Ribas from EFE.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 I would like to ask the minister about the migration agreement with the U.S.\u00a0 Could you clarify how many migrants will be received by Spain, during what time, and especially what migratory status would these migrants have in Spain?\u00a0 I would also like to know if you\u2019ve celebrated any agreements to transfer the Palomares territories and when that would happen, when that transfer might happen.\nAnd for Mr. Secretary, same topics.\u00a0 Are you planning to expand the migration agreement with Spain to other European countries?\u00a0 And there is any U.S. commitment to keep the contaminated lands from the nuclear accident of Palomares?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding the migration agreement and the details of the agreement, the ministry of the interior and the ministry of inclusion, which are the two ministries in charge of deploying and implementing the agreement in and of itself, they will provide all the details in this regard.\nWhat I would like to point out is that this agreement responds to a shared vision vis-\u00e0-vis a very complex phenomenon, which is migration.\u00a0 We need to offer protection to people who for different reasons may need our protection to seek refuge and asylum in each of our countries.\u00a0 We also need to show that irregular migration, the migration that puts so many innocent lives at risk, people who only want to legitimately improve their lives but they choose the wrong path, that is not the only path that exists.\u00a0 There\u2019s also safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.\nAnd when all of us have labor markets, we have needs in these labor markets \u2013 we need labor in very specific industries.\u00a0 So we would also like to show what we\u2019re doing already with other countries through migration programs, circular migration programs.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to show that that migration path, the regular, orderly, safe path exists.\u00a0 And in the end, this is the best tool that we can use to discourage irregular migration.\u00a0 And of course, Spain will also be one of the countries that will join any initiative that may help our Latin American brothers and sisters with whom we share so many things, and so many of them area already living perfectly integrated in Spain and they promote our economic development and prosperity.\nWe discussed \u2013 I was saying this earlier \u2013 the Palomares area.\u00a0 I would like to state that both parties are willing \u2013 this is a complex issue technically speaking.\u00a0 It\u2019s been 60 years that this has been ongoing, and there are a series of technical issues that we need to solve and we need to expedite before making final decisions.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to the Regional Processing Centers, these are centers that give would-be migrants the opportunity to stay in their own countries and to determine whether they have a legal pathway to come to the United States, or to Spain, because Spain is participating in this process, and Canada has also indicated its interest in participating.\u00a0 That means that, again, a would-be migrant can stay in their own country, go to one of these centers and find out whether they qualify for a legal pathway, including, as Jos\u00e9 Manuel laid out so clearly, a worker or labor-related pathway so that they can perhaps fill a gap that exists in a given country when it comes to its labor market.\nSo we are very pleased and appreciative that Spain is participating.\u00a0 As I mentioned, Canada is participating as well; conceivably other countries could.\u00a0 Needless to say, in the case of Spain, there\u2019s a particular logic because, one, the needs of the labor markets in Spain; two, the shared language makes it particularly interesting and attractive.\nWith regard to Palomares, just as the minister said, first, we recognize the importance of this issue.\u00a0 And as he said, it goes back many years.\u00a0 We conducted remediation after the 1966 accident at Palomares.\u00a0 We now anticipate that negotiations related to further cleanup efforts will restart soon, and we very much look forward to working with our Spanish partners on this.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Tracy Wilkinson from\u00a0The Los Angeles Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, thank you.\u00a0 For Secretary Blinken, please, Spain \u2013 and like many countries in Southern Europe, those especially who have ties with the so-called Global South \u2013 have been more reluctant to join in the Ukraine mission.\u00a0 So you\u2019ve listed a couple of steps here today, and I just wondered if this is \u2013 if you\u2019re satisfied, if you\u2019d like to see more coming from Spain and countries like it.\nY para el Ministro Albares,\u00a0in English:\nFollowing on my colleagues\u2019 questions on immigration, you talked about the\u00a0misi\u00f3n compartida, the shared mission.\u00a0 Is it difficult for Spain to continue to receive more immigrants and refugees given you mentioned the many who have come from Ukraine, already several \u2013 several thousand from Venezuela and Cuba, and not to mention Northern Africa?\u00a0 So I just wonder how politically that goes over.\nAnd then second question on that issue, and last question, the United States talks about the root causes of immigration a lot, and one of those root causes is just dire, dire poverty.\u00a0 Do you \u2013 some of that poverty is exacerbated by sanctions that the United States maintains on Cuba and to a lesser extent Venezuela.\u00a0 And I wonder if you would think it a good idea for the United States to ease up on some of those sanctions.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Happy to start, Jos\u00e9 Manuel.\u00a0 Tracy, thanks very much.\u00a0 I have to tell you I don\u2019t share the premise of the question.\u00a0 Spain has been unwavering in its support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u00a0 It\u2019s made that crystal clear not only through what it says but through what it does.\u00a0 I mentioned earlier the very strong support when it comes to making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression and to retake territory that\u2019s been seized from it by Russia, including the provision of very important weapon systems through the process that we put in place, the coordinated effort that Secretary Austin has been leading.\nYou\u2019ve seen strong support for EU sanctions on Russia to continue to exert pressure on Russia for the aggression.\u00a0 The humanitarian support has been remarkably strong, both in what it\u2019s provided to Ukraine and also in the generosity of the Spanish people in taking in more than 175,000 Ukrainian refugees.\u00a0 So we have seen from day one extraordinary solidarity and a strong sense of common purpose and common action when it comes to supporting and defending Ukraine.\nThe other aspect of this that\u2019s so important is this:\u00a0 Even as we together and with many other countries are working to defend Ukraine, to help Ukraine defend itself and to deal with the Russian aggression, we are relentlessly focused on the many issues that are affecting people all around the world.\u00a0 You mentioned the Global South.\u00a0 If you look at the agenda that we just had at the recent G7 meeting of foreign ministers heading toward the leaders meeting coming up, I\u2019d say two-thirds of that was on the issues that are of most concern to people around the world and including in the Global South, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s food security, whether it\u2019s global health, whether it\u2019s finding ways to advance inclusive economic growth, whether it\u2019s meeting the development goals that the international community has set for itself.\nPart of the challenge, of course, is that the very aggression by Russia against Ukraine has actually exacerbated some of these problems, and we\u2019ve made that crystal clear.\u00a0 We are the solution to the problems, not the cause of the problem.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s been clear in the focus that we brought, including, for example, on making sure that the Black Sea Grain Initiative is extended.\u00a0 You have a situation now where Russia continues to try to use food as a weapon in its war against Ukraine.\u00a0 And Spain, the United States, many other countries are determined that that not happen because the victims in this case are people throughout the Global South who desperately need the food and desperately need to make sure that food prices are held \u2013 are held in check.\nSo I think we\u2019re both deeply appreciative of Spain\u2019s engagement and leadership on Ukraine, but also together very focused on this broad array of issues that are of fundamental concern to people around the world.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, I\u2019d like to continue along the lines that Tony Blinken was mentioning.\u00a0 I wanted to correct that mistaken perception of our support for Ukraine, which is total since day one.\u00a0 And I said it today publicly but I\u2019ve said it on many other occasions:\u00a0 It will be there for as long as necessary.\nSpain denounced from day one the illegal and unjustified aggression of Russia towards Ukraine.\u00a0 We supported the 10 packages of sanctions from the EU towards Russia.\u00a0 We have supported the use of the European Peace Facility to purchase weapons for Ukraine.\u00a0 We were with the U.S. to meet with the International Criminal Court to prosecute for the war crimes present in Ukraine, and we do have police officers from our scientific police in Ukraine helping to collect evidence.\u00a0 We provided the largest humanitarian aid package ever provided by Spain to another country.\u00a0 We have received 170,000 Ukrainian refugees under (inaudible) specific statute and we are of course willing to receive more if this unfortunate humanitarian catastrophe were to continue.\u00a0 We have provided military equipment to Ukraine that includes Leopard tanks, anti-air batteries.\nAnd of course we do speak with our friends about what is now called the Global South.\u00a0 We talk to our Latin American friends, we talk to our African friends, because as Tony very rightly pointed out, there is a food crisis, there is an energy crisis that is a global crisis and affects all of these countries.\u00a0 And we want to send the message that of course we are completely committed to Ukraine, but we are not forgetting the needs of all of these countries.\u00a0 That is why Spain has tripled its cooperation programs for development in Africa.\u00a0 In January I talked to all African Union ministers and I announced a package of millions of euros for the African Union and for insecurity situations.\nWhen it comes to migration, this phenomenon \u2013 this is your second question \u2013 and Spain knows this issue very well.\u00a0 We, as a country, have a land border with Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s 14 kilometers away from Africa, and we are very familiar with the complexity of migration.\u00a0 And one thing we do know is that this is a global phenomenon, and therefore we must act together.\u00a0 And this is the spirit with which we are going to start to work with the U.S. and Canada now, as we do with many other countries, and we do this in the EU as well.\u00a0 We will do this in order to tackle this phenomenon, which includes irregular migration, but there are many other issues when it comes to migration.\nWe cannot just become resigned and \u2013 resigned to the fact that the Mediterranean and the Atlantic will be the grave of thousands of innocent people who desperately want to improve their lives.\u00a0 And we need to tackle the root causes as well, because while the inequality between different countries is what it is, we\u2019re facing structural \u2013 a structural problem, and structural problems do not have one solution; rather, there is management, and part of this management is improving development cooperation programs as Spain is doing to promote regular migration programs like what we\u2019re doing with the United States, and we do this in many other ways as well.\nAnd regarding Cuba and Venezuela, Spain has a very special \u2013 in the best sense of the word \u2013 relationship with all Latin American and Caribbean countries.\u00a0 We are an authentic community of an Ibero-American family, and we want \u2013 what we want for all Latin American countries is the exact same thing that we want for Spain: prosperity, democracy, and freedom.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Sara Canales, La SER.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) And I will not discuss the decisions of other countries.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, this week the U.S. has agreed to send two additional destroyer ships to the Spanish naval base in Rota, increasing the number from four to six.\u00a0 How will this increase in military presence impact global security?\u00a0 Why now?\u00a0 And could we see more U.S. military presence in Spain?\nAnd then Latin America will be a big priority during Spain\u2019s turning presidency of the EU \u2013 oh, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 EU, yeah.\u00a0 How can the U.S. through this relationship with Spain benefit from this?\u00a0 What message does this send to the competitors such as China?\n(Via interpreter) Regarding Title 42, Minister, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and political divisions in the U.S. regarding the border as of Friday.\u00a0 Are you worried about this uncertainty in Spain?\u00a0 Are there guarantees from Washington, assurances that the situation can be kept under control?\u00a0 How have other EU countries seen this agreement?\nAnd when it comes to Palomares, you\u2019ve talked about complexity, but could it be resolved before 2024?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 So we were very pleased to be able to sign the Defense Cooperation Agreement with Spain, the enhanced agreement, and I think it\u2019s simply a reflection of the fact that one of the important aspects of our relationship is our cooperation in the realm of defense.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re joined together as NATO Allies.\u00a0 Spain is playing a critical role in NATO.\u00a0 In fact, the work that it\u2019s done since the Russian aggression against Ukraine to help reinforce the eastern flank of NATO is essential to the work of the Alliance and making sure that all of our members are defended.\nAnd in this context but also in the broader context of shared security interests, having stronger defense coordination, cooperation between us is important.\u00a0 That is one aspect of the relationship.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to predict any future deployments one way or the other; that\u2019s really up to our military experts and officials to determine.\u00a0 But we\u2019re very pleased that we were able to reach this agreement and strengthen and deepen even more the cooperation that we have on defense.\nAnd again, I emphasize it\u2019s on defense.\u00a0 The work that we\u2019re doing together is to defend our people, to defend our interests, to defend our values, to defend ourselves at a time when there are increasing challenges to our common security.\nWith regard to Spain\u2019s EU presidency, we welcome it for a number of reasons.\u00a0 One is, exactly as you say, the close relationship that we have, the extraordinary breadth and depth of our dialogue, I think will also be very beneficial when it comes to the relationship between the United States and the European Union, something that we have invested in very significantly over the last two and a half years.\nThe entire premise of President Biden\u2019s approach to foreign policy and to U.S. engagement in the world starts with the re-engagement, the re-energizing, the rejuvenation of our core partnerships and our core alliances, and one of our core partnerships is with the European Union.\u00a0 We have an extraordinarily rich agenda with the EU.\u00a0 One aspect of that agenda is how we see some of the challenges posed by China, and I think what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is a remarkable convergence in the approach that we\u2019re both taking.\u00a0 And I think if you look at the different articulations of policy that have put out, as well as the work that we\u2019ve actually been doing \u2013 including, for example, through the Trade and Technology Council \u2013 with the EU, you see that convergence.\nAnd I think there\u2019s a shared understanding that the relationship that we all have with China has aspects that are clearly competitive.\u00a0 There may be aspects that are adversarial, and it\u2019s our determination to make sure that competition does not veer into conflict.\u00a0 And there are aspects that can and should be cooperative because they\u2019re important things that might be important to our citizens as well as to people around the world that we should look and find ways to do together.\nAnd I think the EU, European partners, have very much the same perspective.\u00a0 The EU is one place where we can really continue to work on the details of how that convergence of views translates into specific policies, and having Spain in a leadership role I think will only advance those efforts.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding migration, there\u2019s several things.\u00a0 Migration is a global phenomenon, and we see it everywhere worldwide, and this is a challenge that we need to tackle from a \u2013 using a multilateral approach.\u00a0 Spain has a way of handling this challenge which includes constantly fighting against the mafias that smuggle human beings, a political dialogue with the origin and transit countries to offer regular pathways for migration \u2013 orderly migration \u2013 and to protect those who do warrant refuge and asylum in our countries.\nAnd especially we must \u2013 we fight against the deeply rooted causes of migration, and that is why this year we passed a new law for development cooperation that puts Central America and Africa at the center of our cooperation.\u00a0 And we have tripled our cooperation programs in many countries.\nNow, when it comes to the Palomares soil, there are technical aspects there that we must discuss at the technical level, not at the political level, and that is where we will set the different stages that must be followed.\u00a0 The important thing is that the will is there in our dialogue.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-freedom-house-2023-annual-awards-ceremony/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Conrad Hotel  ", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 9, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\nLet me start by thanking my good friend of so many years, Mike Abramowitz, for the honor of joining Freedom House tonight and helping you to celebrate the 2023 Annual Freedom Awards. \u00a0Now, we have to be honest with people; we\u2019ve known each other for a while, going back to our college days.\u00a0 We both wrote for our college newspaper. \u00a0Or, more accurately, I wrote for Mike because on the Crimson he held the title of president back then.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThere\u2019s something else you need to know about Mike.\u00a0 I tended to write a lot of opinion pieces read by, if I was really fortunate, one or two of my roommates and a family member too.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I was always trying to get Mike to write more opinion pieces.\u00a0 And his answer back then in being reluctant to do that was I just don\u2019t know, I really see both sides and I just have trouble coming out on one side or another.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well, something\u2019s changed in all those years, because I know, we know Mike, as being someone who is resolutely, ferociously on the side of democracy, freedom, and human rights.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe have here tonight leaders from across the Executive Branch, Congress.\u00a0 I think Chairman Mike McCaul is here, Representatives Swalwell and Panetta, others.\u00a0 Your presence reflects the bipartisan commitment to standing up for universal freedoms, universal rights, to standing up for democracy.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to be able to work with you and other members in Congress every single day to try to uphold that agenda.\nNow, when this organization was founded eight decades ago, the specter of Nazism loomed over Europe. \u00a0In the rise of Hitler, the men and women of Freedom House saw a threat not only to freedom on the continent, but to life and liberty everywhere. \u00a0And so they threw their full weight behind pushing President Roosevelt to enter World War II to join the fight against fascism.\nEver since, Freedom House has taken on challenges to freedoms everywhere \u2013 from standing up against McCarthyism, advocating for civil rights, to, in our time, protecting human rights during the pandemic, combatting transnational repression.\nThe Freedom Index that Mike spoke about is one of the most powerful tools that we in government have.\u00a0 Being able to refer to an objective, unbiased source that shows us the trajectory for good or back of democracy in our world, it helps guide our work and it is that unimpeachable document that we can use to try to leverage progress in country after country.\u00a0 And indeed, what we see today 71 years later is Freedom House helping lead the charge to defend and advance freedom and human rights in what is, I think everyone in this room knows, an extremely challenging and difficult time.\nGlobally, just to focus on the human rights dimension, governments have jailed upward of a million people just for exercising their fundamental human rights and defending the human rights of others. \u00a0That includes one of tonight\u2019s Freedom Award recipients: Russian journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza \u2013 sentenced to 25 years for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, and also for a lifetime of courageous work to seek a better future for his fellow Russian citizens.\nMillions of others are defending human rights on the frontlines, often at extraordinary personal risk. \u00a0People like Aida Ghajar, the first journalist to publish Mahsa Amini\u2019s name after her death. \u00a0We\u2019re honored that Aida is here to accept tonight\u2019s second Freedom Award.\nFor months now, Aida and hundreds of thousands of Iranian women, girls \u2013 with the support of many of their male compatriots \u2013 have demanded their basic freedoms be respected, even in the face of the most brutal repression.\nCountless journalists are working to expose and report on the truth in extremely dangerous conditions.\u00a0 Today, we were devastated to learn of the death of an AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in eastern Ukraine. \u00a0Our thoughts are with his family, with his loved ones, with the entire AFP family.\nJust a week or so ago I had the chance to welcome back to the State Department another remarkable journalist, Ben Hall from Fox, who traveled with me at the beginning of my tenure in this job and then was grievously wounded in Ukraine doing his job \u2013 trying to cover the war and bring its realities to people around the world.\u00a0 It was just a wonderful thing to have Ben back at the State Department back on the job after coming back from truly horrific injuries.\nBut he, so many others who are on the frontlines trying to make sure that they\u2019re shining a light on what\u2019s going on in the darkest recesses of Earth, more important than ever.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a lot to be said about press freedom in this moment, but I\u2019ll save that for another day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nThe work of so many who report on and advocate for human rights and human dignity \u2013 including our extraordinary Ambassador to Liberia Michael McCarthy, also being honored tonight \u2013 is both incredibly dangerous but even more so incredibly consequential.\nPresident Biden has worked to put the promotion and protection of human rights, fundamental freedoms, at the core of our diplomacy.\nAt the State Department, we\u2019ve been ramping up programs to provide emergency support and legal assistance to those who are out there defending human rights around the world; pressing for the release of political prisoners; holding human rights abusers accountable, including with sanctions, visa restrictions; strengthening the rule of law and systems of transnational[1]\u00a0justice. We\u2019re also engaging constantly with our civil society partners, like Freedom House, on how to best defend and advance human rights in the face of traditional challenges as well as evolving challenges.\nAnd of course, one of the most rapidly evolving challenges \u2013 not a surprise to anyone here \u2013 is technology, both in the affirmative pursuit of human rights but also in further enabling repression. \u00a0And that\u2019s what I thought I\u2019d spend a little bit of time on tonight.\nNow, I suspect everyone in the room felt the same way.\u00a0 For a time, it seemed that leaps in technology would be a gamechanger, tilting the balance of power away from human rights abusers and in favor of human rights defenders.\nIn 1989, President Reagan summed up the consensus view at the time when he said, \u201cMore than armies, more than diplomacy, more than the best intentions of democratic nations, the communications revolution will be the greatest force for the advancement of human freedom that the world has ever seen.\u201d\nSince then, of course, the internet, digital technologies have connected and empowered billions of people: amplifying their voices, providing the opportunity to form communities, expanding economic opportunity.\u00a0 And in many ways, expanding freedom for human rights defenders specifically, technologies provide a platform to connect, to collaborate, to communicate across borders.\nYet, at the same time, as we all know too well, in many of the same places where human rights defenders are using technology for good, authoritarians and repressive regimes have abused technology to carry out their own transgressions.\nIn short, we\u2019ve been reminded powerfully that technology is not inherently good or bad. \u00a0Whether it makes our societies more or less equitable, whether it promotes or represses human rights, whether it brings us together or drives us apart \u2013 that\u2019s up to all of us.\nThe United States is committed to doing whatever we can, drawing on the full range of our own tools, diplomatic and otherwise, to try to maximize technology as a force for good and to minimize its misuse.\nWe\u2019ve also made historic investments like the CHIPS and Science Act, because we know we can only be effective in shaping these technologies in a way that aligns with our values \u2013 in particular, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2013 if countries that support freedom maintain leadership in cutting-edge technologies and are playing a lead role in shaping the norms and rules by which these technologies are used.\nOur human rights future is going to be shaped, simply put, by our technological future.\u00a0 And that\u2019s particularly so in four areas where we have to work together if we\u2019re going to achieve the goals that unite us.\nLet me just mention these quickly.\nFirst, surveillance technology, particularly spyware. \u00a0Our digital lives make us all vulnerable to new forms of surveillance tech, embedded in the devices we carry in our pockets, we wear on our wrists, we have in our homes.\nFor many here tonight, the proliferation and misuse of surveillance technology is a daily and growing threat. \u00a0Journalists, political activists, opposition figures, human rights advocates, others across nearly every continent have been targeted with commercial spyware that\u2019s readily available to governments and nongovernmental actors alike.\nNongovernmental reports have found that over 70 governments around the world \u2013 including democracies \u2013 have acquired commercial spyware or data extraction technologies.\nNow, governments, of course, can use surveillance technologies to help protect national security; to enhance law enforcement, public safety, the environment, critical infrastructure. \u00a0But they have to be used in a way that\u2019s consistent with domestic law, with international law, and with proper legal authorization, safeguards, and oversight.\nThat\u2019s why we have mobilized a government-wide effort to try to shape how surveillance technology is used. \u00a0We\u2019ve been putting significant restrictions on the export of technologies and inputs used for surveillance and other malicious cyber activities by governments.\nWe added spyware companies that have enabled the misuse of their technology to something called the Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List, which prevents these companies from receiving products or components from our own firms without the approval of our government.\nWe will continue to identify and sanction foreign companies that develop and supply software and other surveillance technology to governments with a record of using these tools to abuse human rights.\nThis year\u2019s Second Summit for Democracy, President Biden issued an executive order that bans the U.S. Government use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our own national security, including that which has been used to target U.S. Government personnel or devices or has been misused by foreign actors to target dissidents or abuse human rights.\nWe\u2019ve also encouraged the 36 other governments that are part of the Freedom Online Coalition to begin to adopt guiding principles on surveillance technology to prevent its misuse by bad actors, like targeting people based solely on their race, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, their political views, or any other classification protected by law. \u00a0And we\u2019ll keep working to bring more countries online with these efforts.\nA second area I just wanted to highlight quickly, where we\u2019re seeing technology\u2019s impact most significantly on human rights, and that, of course, is internet freedom. \u00a0Governments are finding new ways to restrict access to the internet, to choke off the information that citizens take in and that they share. \u00a0Some shut off the internet altogether. \u00a0Others, of course, use censorship and punitive laws to control how the internet is used.\nAccording to Freedom House\u2019s most recent Freedom on the Net report, internet shutdowns and internet censorship by governments are now at an all-time high.\nNow, we know unfettered access to the internet is essential for defending human rights and human freedoms.\u00a0 Aida Ghajar\u2019s news outlet Iran Wire used the internet to receive critical information from inside Iran to do everything from documenting an accurate death toll from the repression of protests, to sharing live footage of the regime\u2019s crackdown, to gathering and disseminating reporting by its network and citizen journalists.\u00a0 One Iranian journalist put it this way and explained of the protestors: \u00a0\u201cPeople don\u2019t have weapons. They have mobile phones.\u00a0 They have social media.\u201d\u00a0 These are among the strongest tools in democracy\u2019s arsenal.\nSo we are leading a global effort to try to advance \u2013 to protect and to advance internet freedom, particularly in areas where governments are most aggressively repressing it.\nWhen the Iranian regime tried to throttle internet access for most of its 80 million citizens, we issued a General License that enables technology firms to provide more digital services, hardware, and software to people in Iran, from access to cloud computing services to better tools to enhance their own online security and privacy; in other words, to be able to remain connected with each other and connected with the rest of the world.\u00a0 These tools have been essential in helping Iranians not only report on the regime\u2019s abuses, but to tell their own stories and exercise their right to free expression. \u00a0We\u2019re committed to expanding similar efforts around the world wherever necessary.\nThe third thing I wanted to highlight.\u00a0 While we\u2019re working to promote access to the internet for all, we\u2019re also working to address threats to human rights that come with an open internet, including online harassment, abuse, disinformation.\nNow, online abuse doesn\u2019t, of course, target only human rights defenders. \u00a0Instead, the internet and digital technologies are often used to amplify attacks on vulnerable groups \u2013 women, the LGBTQI community, marginalized ethnic or religious groups \u2013 and undermine our broader fight for human rights. \u00a0So this year, we launched what is now at least a 12-country Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse.\u00a0 We\u2019re encouraging private sector to become engaged with us as well.\nWe\u2019re also working to address the massive challenge of online misinformation and disinformation \u2013 again, something familiar to everyone in this room.\u00a0 To cite one example, of course, Russia continues to push a steady, relentless stream of disinformation about its war of aggression against Ukraine, to lie about and cover up horrific abuses it\u2019s committed, to try to justify committing others.\nIn response, the State Department has developed an AI-enabled online Ukraine Content Aggregator to collect verifiable Russian disinformation and then to share that with partners around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re promoting independent media and digital literacy.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with partners in academia to reliably detect fake text generated by Russian chatbots.\nWhich leads to a fourth area that I wanted to mention tonight, a fourth area where technology and human rights are converging, and that, of course, is emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and biotechnologies, including genomics.\nAs a system that reflects the data on which it\u2019s trained \u2013 including the biases embedded in that data \u2013 AI can, of course, amplify discrimination and enable abuses.\nIt also runs the risk of strengthening autocratic governments, including by enabling them to exploit social media even more effectively to manipulate their people and sow division among and within their adversaries.\nIn October, the White House put out a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \u2013 some basic principles to try to guide the way that we design and use automated systems in ways that protect our people and defend our democratic values. \u00a0These include the principle that people should be protected from unsafe and ineffective AI, and that people should know when an automated system is being used and understand how it affects them.\nThe National Institute for Standards and Technology also developed a risk management framework for how to measure and manage the risk of automated systems and make AI that\u2019s safe, accountable, and fair, and that protects privacy.\nNow, I think it\u2019s also not a secret to everyone in this room and particularly to those of you who are either serving or have served in government to suggest that one of the biggest challenges that we face in government is keeping up with technology as a general rule, including AI.\u00a0 It takes us a while to figure it out, to understand it.\u00a0 By the time we do, it\u2019s usually leaped several generations ahead.\u00a0 And then we go to regulate it; we tend to take out a 2 by 4 that governments use instead of a scalpel that may be more effective.\nSo one of the things that we are doing relentlessly, and including in my department at State, is to bring in much more expertise than we\u2019ve had in the past to help us in real time better understand the technologies that are shaping our world and to work together in figuring out how best to try to shape them in a way that advances the good and minimizes the bad.\nIt took me a while working in government over the years as someone trained in the humanities, as most of us are working on foreign policy, to understand that I needed scientists and technologists in the room just to tell me whether I needed scientists and technologists in the room.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So we\u2019re getting there.\nBut just recently, the State Department stood up an entire new bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy.\u00a0 We have an incredibly effective senior envoy for emerging technologies.\u00a0 We want to make sure that not only are we at the table, but we\u2019re really helping to shape the discussion at that table about, again, how these technologies are going to be used because they so powerfully affect our lives.\nAccess to human genomic data opens up a whole other set of human rights concerns. \u00a0Advances in biotechnology have enabled genomic surveillance based on a person\u2019s DNA, potentially facilitating abuses.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen some of those, for example, committed by the People\u2019s Republic of China against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. \u00a0We\u2019re also concerned by reports of the spread of mass DNA collection to Tibet as an additional form of control and surveillance over the Tibetan population.\nGoing back to last September, President Biden issued an executive order on biotechnology and biomanufacturing innovation, which seeks to ensure that the United States and our partners continue to lead and set norms and rules on advanced biotechnology in a way that is rights-affirming and reflects our values.\nNow, we know these principles and guidelines aren\u2019t the final word in navigating the extraordinary complexities around these technologies, which evolve, as I said, almost faster than we can keep up with understanding them.\u00a0 But they are a way to start to create guardrails and to shape the space, particularly as countries on the cutting edge of tech-enabled repression seek to export their models and technologies, with all the biases and risks that they contain, and to do so at scale.\nThese four challenges \u2013 and others that we know will emerge in the months and years ahead \u2013\u00a0 require all of us to try to work harder, to work smarter, to work more collaboratively than ever before.\nAt the same time, for our administration as we consider the larger challenge of strengthening democracy and pushing back against autocracy, we\u2019ve tried to put in place some foundational pieces that will help us do that.\nOver the last few years, we\u2019ve been working very hard to invest in ourselves, to make sure that our own country is as competitive as can be and that it\u2019s delivering on the things that people\u00a0 most want and expect.\u00a0 Because fundamentally, if we can\u2019t demonstrate that our democracies can deliver, if we can\u2019t demonstrate that we can compete effectively, we\u2019re going to be on the losing end.\nThe other half of the coin is making sure that we\u2019re engaged, truly engaged, in the world.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ve worked very hard to re-engage, to rejuvenate, to re-energize our alliances, our partnerships, starting but not ending with our democratic partners around the world.\u00a0 Because if we can build convergence among countries about the way to approach these problems, if we can multiply the weight that we bring, we are going to stand a much better chance in being effective and getting real change and defending more effectively the freedoms and rights that are under challenge.\nBut what I know powerfully is this:\u00a0 It\u2019s simply not enough for governments to do this.\u00a0 We can\u2019t, we can\u2019t do it alone.\u00a0 On the contrary, more than ever before we need partnerships.\u00a0 We need partnerships with the private sector.\u00a0 We need partnerships with nongovernmental organizations.\u00a0 We need partnerships with academia.\u00a0 We need partnerships that bring together all of the stakeholders in this fight to strengthen, to preserve, to defend our democracies and to uphold human rights.\nWe know that in so many ways all of these stakeholders are more empowered than ever before.\u00a0 And if we\u2019re not together on the takeoff, we\u2019re probably not going to be together on the landing.\nAt the end of the day, we together have a shared commitment and a shared responsibility to uphold the freedoms that so many of us have tended to take for granted but that Freedom House never has.\u00a0 I think the great power, the great strength, the great contribution that Freedom House has made over so many years is precisely that: not taking freedom for granted, not taking democracy for granted, not taking human rights for granted; on the contrary, telling us, showing us, that we have to fight for them and we have to fight for them together every single day.\nNow, I suspect many have been awakened to that proposition a little bit more recently, but I hope it commits all of us to try to find ways to work together in ways perhaps that we haven\u2019t before.\u00a0 So what I really wanted to share with you tonight is simply that, speaking on behalf of our administration, we will continue to look to Freedom House and to human rights and freedom defenders writ large who have always been and have to remain our North Star. \u00a0We ask you to continue to work with us, including by sharing your ideas, by sharing your perspectives, and yes, holding us accountable.\n[1] transitional\n\n"}, {"url":

you.\u00a0\u00a0Assalamu alaikum, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Eid Mubarak to you and to your families.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to join you.\u00a0 Alia, I\u2019m tempted to say, \u201cWhat she said,\u201d drop the microphone, and leave.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Because who wants to follow this extraordinary woman.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0on the acceptance to Northeastern.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0on your decision to dedicate what are manifestly tremendous talents to the public health field.\u00a0 We need you.\u00a0 They need you.\u00a0 The world needs you.\u00a0 We\u2019re so grateful to have you here with us now.\nMS SALEEBAAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And to my friend and colleague, our remarkable ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom.\u00a0 He\u2019s been a remarkable force for the United States around the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Opening doors, opening minds, opening hearts, and making a huge difference.\u00a0 And it\u2019s always great to be with you, my friend.\nTo all of our distinguished guests, members of religious communities, civil society, the diplomatic community, thank you for joining us this afternoon and welcome to Blair House, a absolutely wonderful setting.\u00a0 Blair House, which is, I think as most of you know, the President\u2019s guesthouse, has played host to countless dignitaries over the past 80 years, including more than a hundred heads of state from predominantly Muslim countries.\u00a0 Now we are thrilled to be opening its doors \u2013 actually quite literally opening its doors \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 to community leaders for the first Eid reception hosted here by someone in my position.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo as you all know better than anyone, Eid is a time of spiritual renewal, an opportunity to reflect on a month of fasting and prayer, and to recommit \u2013 recommit to values at the heart of Islam: compassion, empathy, service, charity, gratitude, generosity.\u00a0 Our nation is strengthened by the contributions of hundreds of Muslim Americans across our government, including at the State Department.\u00a0 We know \u2013 I know profoundly \u2013 that our diversity \u2013 it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it is so profoundly true: our diversity is our greatest strength in the world, and we\u2019re putting it to use to serve American interests and values.\u00a0 We are operating in an extraordinarily diverse world.\u00a0 If we were to leave our own diversity on the sidelines, we\u2019d be shortchanging ourselves, shortchanging our foreign policy, shortchanging the country.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined not to do that.\nAs we look around the world, we see examples of Muslims living out the values that we\u2019re celebrating here today: showing compassion for the vulnerable, showing a commitment to justice, showing a commitment to the pursuit of peace.\u00a0 When a devastating earthquake hit T\u00fcrkiye and Syria just a couple of months ago in February, governments stepped up to build shelters, to dispatch search and rescue teams.\u00a0 NGOs like the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement, Islamic Relief USA, provided lifesaving equipment, humanitarian assistance, food, water, clothing, medicine.\u00a0 We saw people coming together in an hour of profound need\u00a0for so many of our fellow human beings.\nWhen the Taliban enacted restrictive bans on higher education for women, governments from across the Muslim world spoke up to condemn the Taliban\u2019s decision, arguing that their actions were inhumane and contrary to Islamic beliefs.\u00a0 Scholars of Islamic law weighed in to condemn the Taliban\u2019s actions, too, noting that the Quran gives the right to education to women and men alike. \u00a0(Applause.)\nAnd in Sudan, which has occupied our minds and focus recently, Arab countries as well as regional and international partners across Africa are providing aid and helping secure an immediate end to the conflict.the se\nThe United States is proud to support these efforts and others, and we will continue to work with our Muslim partners and allies to tackle the challenges of our time, the responsibilities that we all share.\u00a0 That includes fighting for the rights of many people around the world who simply cannot freely or safely practice their faiths.\u00a0 We\u2019re standing up for those who face persecution, for peacefully worshiping, those who are vilified for being part of a religious minority, those who face real threats to their safety, for choosing not to observe a faith at all.\nThe team at the Office of International Religious Freedom, led by Ambassador Hussain, works with partner countries and civil society to advance religious freedom and drive progress on tackling pressing challenges \u2013 global health to climate change \u2013 and they\u2019re doing that, Rashad is doing that, around the world.\nFor us, freedom of religion is a fundamental human right, one foundational to the creation of our country.\u00a0 And our government is committed to supporting the right of every person \u2013 every person \u2013 to worship as they choose.\u00a0 We\u2019re equally committed to standing against discrimination and affirming every Muslim American\u2019s place as a full member of American society.\nThe leaders in this room reflect the reality that Muslim Americans are a vital part of the fabric of this country.\u00a0 With us this afternoon: doctors, scientists, writers, poets, leaders tackling virtually every vital issue that our society has to tackle and confront.\nMina Kalil and Faisal Mumtaz are two such leaders in this room.\u00a0 Both moved from Afghanistan to the United States in 2021.\u00a0 They quickly threw themselves into serving refugees in their new community here in northern Virginia.\u00a0 They both work at the nonprofit Islamic Circle of North America Relief, where they\u2019re helping provide essential social services to new refugees like health care, like transitional housing.\u00a0 They\u2019ve both been generous about sharing their experiences with incoming refugees in panels and one-on-one conversations, because they know that\u2019s one of the best ways to help others.\nNow, if Mina and Faisal are here \u2013 there you are.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSimply put, you reflect so much of the spirit of Eid \u2013 the desire to serve, compassion for the newcomer, a commitment to building a community.\u00a0 And you are, as we would say, paying it forward in a very profound way.\nBut each of you here tonight embodies these values.\u00a0 You embody them with your words.\u00a0 You embody them with your work.\u00a0 The United States, the world, is immeasurably better off because of it.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for being here tonight, and everybody,\u00a0Eid Mubarak\u00a0to everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-uk-foreign-secretary-james-cleverly-at-a-joint-press-availability-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken And UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly At a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Burns Auditorium ", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 9, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It is a genuine pleasure to welcome my friend Foreign Secretary James Cleverly back to the State Department.\u00a0 As usual, we covered a lot of ground, but I began by asking the foreign secretary to extend my warm\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla on their coronation.\nI was in Atlanta over most of the weekend.\u00a0 I can report that many members of our team got up pretty early on Saturday to watch the ceremony, including me.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s something that captivated millions and millions of Americans, as it did people around the world.\nToday, I also had the chance to thank James for the United Kingdom\u2019s crucial cooperation in getting citizens of both of our countries out of Sudan.\u00a0 These joint efforts allowed UK aircraft to evacuate more than 2,000 people, including U.S. citizens, from dangerous and unpredictable conditions (inaudible) evacuation of hundreds of additional U.S. citizens through Port Sudan.\u00a0 All told, we supported the evacuation of more than 1,300 Americans from Sudan in collaboration with our partners.\nTogether now, we are pressing the warring parties in Sudan to put down their guns and allow lifesaving aid to reach the Sudanese people.\u00a0 Even as we meet here, we have diplomats from the United States and Saudi Arabia deeply engaged in talks in Jeddah, working in close consultation with counterparts from the UK, the United Arab Emirates, the African Union, and other multilateral partners.\u00a0 The collective aim that we have is to lay the foundation for further negotiations between the parties that we hope can lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities.\nBut in the first instance, we\u2019re working in Jeddah to extend the ceasefire and get agreement on the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Sudan.\u00a0 We continue to engage directly with Sudanese civilian leaders, with Sudanese civilian society with the goal of putting their nation back on the track to civilian democratic governance.\u00a0 That\u2019s the goal that we share and the goal that we will not give up on.\nWe\u2019re also working hand in hand, as we have been for well more than a year now, to provide support for Ukraine as it defends its people and its territory against Russia\u2019s war of aggression.\u00a0 We applaud the UK\u2019s pledge to match in 2023 the $2.3 billion in military support that it provided to Ukraine during the first year of the war.\u00a0 In addition to training of tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, the UK is providing MRS, Challenger 2 tanks, armored vehicles, anti\u2011air missiles, and other military aid that will help equip Ukraine\u2019s defenders as they work to retake more of their nation\u2019s territory in the weeks and months ahead.\nWe also talked about the urgent need to extend and expand the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukraine\u2019s ports to pick up the grain: a cynical action that directly results in less food getting to global markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East, and around the world who need that food.\u00a0 While we\u2019re grateful for the tireless efforts of Secretary-General Guterres and our colleagues in T\u00fcrkiye working to break this impasse, the world shouldn\u2019t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people\u2019s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.\nWe\u2019re teaming up to help rebuild Ukraine from the colossal damage inflicted by Russia\u2019s relentless attacks.\u00a0 Next month, we\u2019ll build on these efforts at the UK-hosted Ukraine Recovery Conference, which will bring together governments like ours with the private sector, with international financial institutions, with multilateral organizations to invest in the future of Ukraine and its people.\nWe also discussed how to meet other challenges to our shared security.\u00a0 In March, the UK released its Integrated Review Refresh 2023 and its assessment of both the challenges that we face and how to effectively address them to work together in that area.\u00a0 I think we see very, very close strategic alignment.\u00a0 That includes when it comes to both our individual relationships and coordinated approach with China, which we discussed today.\nThe vision that James set out a few weeks ago in his speech at Mansion House underscores the shared approach when it comes to key issues like ensuring peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as looking for ways to cooperate with China where we can work together to solve big challenges.\u00a0 That\u2019s what people around the world expect from great powers, and it\u2019s in our collective interest.\nI think it\u2019s also important to note that even as we focused today, as we do, on Ukraine, on some of the challenges represented by our respective relationships with China, we equally focused on a much broader agenda and that is the needs, the concerns, the imperatives for people around the world as they deal, and as we deal, with the impact of climate change, food insecurity \u2013 as I\u2019ve already mentioned \u2013 energy insecurity, global health, trying to provide for more inclusive economic growth through work that we and partners in the G7, as we\u2019re preparing for the leaders\u2019 meeting of the G7, can help advance and support.\u00a0 That agenda is very much the focus of both the United Kingdom and the United States.\nJames said something when we were together recently in Japan that I\u2019ll take the liberty of quoting here.\u00a0 He said, \u201cThe world is a healthier, happier, safer, more prosperous place when the United Kingdom and the United States work closely together, and it\u2019s in our mutual interest to do so.\u201d\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t agree more.\nAnd next month\u2019s visit by Prime Minister Sunak to meet with President Biden will offer us a chance to do even more of that, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to it.\nWith that, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Tony, thank you once again for hosting me here in Washington.\u00a0 It\u2019s always a pleasure to speak with you, to discuss the areas of bilateral interest, as well as the issues which affect the whole world.\u00a0 We did so recently at the G7 with our \u2013 all our friends in the international community.\nAnd thank you also for the kind words that you\u2019ve said on behalf of your nation on the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III and Queen Camilla.\u00a0 Can I also thank the First Lady for joining us at this time of special celebration, a once in a lifetime event made more special because we were able to share it with friends from across the world.\nCan I also put on record our thanks to the United States of America and, indeed, you personally for the huge amount of effort that you have invested in seeking peace in Sudan.\u00a0 It was a situation which unfolded whilst we were meeting at the G7 in Japan, and I commend the effort that you personally put in, engaging with the generals, with the leadership of the warring factions, to try and bring initially a ceasefire and then your ongoing work, the ongoing work of the United States of America, in trying to broker a sustainable peace.\nIt should remind everybody that whilst we are, of course, working on the support that we give to Ukraine and their self-defense \u2013 and I\u2019ll touch upon that again in a moment \u2013 we are not distracted from the pressing issues of the day and we deal with them.\u00a0 We deal with them effectively; we deal with them collaboratively.\u00a0 And we\u2019re able to do so because of the very strong bilateral relationship that our two countries enjoy, a relationship which is invested in regularly by the visits that we make over here.\u00a0 And as you say, I know the prime minister\u2019s very much looking forward to meeting with President Biden when he comes across next month.\nBut also we are very grateful to the President for his recent visit to the United Kingdom to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, a topic which I know is of great interest and passion to him, and we value your country\u2019s engagement on that issue.\nWe remain committed to building peace and prosperity around the world, just as we are attempting to do in Sudan, and we continue to work towards that goal in Ukraine.\u00a0 Every time I come to the United States I make a point of thanking your nation for the scale of support that you have given to Ukraine.\u00a0 You are the largest donor, both in military and economic terms, and I know that your support is incredibly important in their ability to defend themselves against this unprovoked attack from Russia.\nWe, of course, spoke at length about the nature of that support, about the next few months, and the importance to not only look at the context through the prism of the conflict but also to focus on the future rebuilding work that will inevitably be needed.\u00a0 We are very pleased \u2013 the UK is very pleased to host on behalf of Ukraine the Ukraine Recovery Conference, where we will seek to build a coalition that will enable Ukraine to rebuild its country after this conflict has been concluded, after they regain their country back.\u00a0 And we value the United States of America\u2019s coordinating role in ensuring that the private sector as well as the public sector is heavily involved in that reconstruction.\u00a0 From the UK\u2019s point of view, we\u2019ll of course also continue to provide financial and military aid.\u00a0 We intend to give the Ukrainians the tools they need to successfully defend themselves against the invasion.\nBut just as we did with Sudan, we remain focused on the needs of some of the poorest people in the world, and I echo your comments on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 It is completely wrong that Russia uses the hunger of some of the poorest people in the world to pursue leverage during this conflict.\u00a0 They should re-sign the Black Sea Grain Initiative and do so immediately.\u00a0 They should unlock the supply of food to go to those people around the world who need it most.\u00a0 And it is perverse that they are using hunger in the developing world as leverage in their conflict in Ukraine.\nWe did, of course, also have the opportunity to speak about issues on a broader context.\u00a0 And, of course, how we recognize the role that China has in world affairs and how we respond to China\u2019s action will, of course, be an ongoing part of our bilateral discussions.\nI recently gave a major speech on the UK\u2019s posture towards China, which was derived from our recent integrated review refresh.\u00a0 We made the point that we need to defend ourselves as nations \u2013 the UK is doing this, as indeed the United States of America is \u2013 against inappropriate activities by China.\u00a0 We also need to make sure that we build alliances and strengthen the pre-existing alliances that we have, as I\u2019m doing today with the United States of America, but also with our friends in the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 And we have to engage with China directly, robustly, regularly, to seek to influence the decisions that are made in Beijing and do so in a way that benefits the whole world, whether that be on the maintenance of peace across the Taiwan Strait, which of course is something which affects all of us irrespective of where we are in the world, to issues such as climate change, pandemic prevention and response.\nAnd that of course brings us full circle to our bilateral relations with the United States of America.\u00a0 We have been close defense partners.\u00a0 We are intelligence-sharing partners.\u00a0 And of course, we have strong economic ties.\u00a0 And we will seek to find opportunities where the UK can be a strong economic partner to the United States of America as well as being a strong defensive partner as well.\nIt is \u2013 and thank you for reminding me of that quote; I do happen to be rather proud of it \u2013 I think it is in our mutual interest and in the interests of everyone around the world that the UK and U.S. bilateral relationship continues to be one of the points of pride, and one which is strong, and one which I intend to make even stronger still in the future.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Kylie Atwood from CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you both for taking questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I want to just ask you a quick question on China and then pivot to Ukraine.\u00a0 This week, when Ambassador Burns met with the Chinese foreign minister, did they agree to begin planning on your rescheduled visit to Beijing?\u00a0 And then on Ukraine, does Ukraine have what it needs to be successful in winning back at least some of the territory that Russia is now occupying in the upcoming counteroffensive?\nAnd Secretary Cleverly, the same question for you.\u00a0 Does Ukraine have everything it needs to be successful in winning back some of that territory?\u00a0 And then specifically related to international support for Ukraine headed into the coming months and year, there are reports that your country is preparing to send long-range missiles to Kyiv.\u00a0 When could those long-range missiles from the UK and potentially other European allies actually arrive in the country?\u00a0 And we have seen in the past that when the UK moves on an additional military capability for Ukraine, the U.S. has followed suit.\u00a0 In any of your conversations so far, have you gotten indications that that might be the case with long-range missile systems as well?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, thanks very much.\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 With regard to China, I\u2019m obviously not going to go into any detail about the ambassador\u2019s conversations with Chinese counterparts.\u00a0 What I can say is this.\u00a0 What we have communicated to our colleagues in the government in Beijing is the importance from our perspective in engagement, precisely because we have a deeply complicated and also consequential relationship that is important to people in the United States and China, but beyond that around the world; that our two presidents agreed when they met in Bali at the end of last year that it would be important to establish and strengthen our lines of communication; and that we believe that that\u2019s in our interests and also something that the rest of the world expects us to do because there\u2019s an expectation that we will responsibly manage the relationship.\u00a0 And precisely because we have profound differences as well as, I believe, some responsibility not only to manage those differences so that the competition that we have doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, but also the potential where it\u2019s in our mutual interest and where it answers needs that the world has as well to find areas of cooperation, that engagement\u2019s the way that we try to pursue both of those responsibilities.\nSo that\u2019s the nature of the conversation that we\u2019re having with China in this moment, and we\u2019ll see where that goes.\nWith regard to Ukraine, all along, from day one \u2013 in fact, before day one \u2013 it\u2019s been our determination to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 And throughout the more than one year of that aggression, we have worked very hard to adjust at every step of the way to what was needed at any given time; and right now, of course, the focus is on the Ukrainian efforts that we anticipate to try to retake more of the territory that\u2019s been seized from Ukraine by Russia over the last 14-plus months.\nI believe that the efforts that both of us have been deeply engaged in are very productive in terms of what more than I think 50 countries have been able to provide Ukraine.\u00a0 Secretary Austin has been leading a process, as you know, for many months where we have a coordinated process to do that.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said repeatedly, it\u2019s not only the weapons; it\u2019s the training, and the UK has been engaged in significant training.\u00a0 It\u2019s making sure that the Ukrainians can maintain the systems that we provide them.\u00a0 And it\u2019s important, of course, that they have the right plans, again, to be successful.\nMy own estimation is that they have in place across all of those dimensions what they need to continue to be successful in regaining territory that was seized by force by Russia over the last 14 months.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Kylie, thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to take slight issue with one of the elements in your \u2013 in your question, but thank you for highlighting that the UK has been very proactive in our support for Ukraine.\u00a0 We are very proud of the fact that we provided the antitank \u2013 the handheld antitank missile systems ahead of the February of last year\u2019s invasion by Russia, and those pieces of equipment proved very consequential in Ukraine\u2019s defense of Kyiv.\nBut I also think it\u2019s important that we put on record that the United States from the very start has been very active, very effective in its support, and as befits a country of the scale and power of the United States of America, it is the largest donor of the allies.\u00a0 So I wouldn\u2019t want to imply that there\u2019s either kind of competition between us or anything else.\u00a0 We have from the very start worked in close coordination.\nThe nature of our militaries is different.\u00a0 The natures of our political systems are different.\u00a0 There are some things that the UK is able to do more quickly because of the nature of our political system, and there are some things that the American system allows them to do different and better.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about always trying to replicate what our allies do.\u00a0 That\u2019s not the point of an alliance.\u00a0 The point of an alliance is that we support each other, that we reinforce each other in our work to help Ukraine defend itself.\u00a0 And as Secretary Blinken said, we constantly assess and coordinate with each other and with the Ukrainians to make sure that the support that we are giving them matches the needs at the time: those antitank missiles at the early stages, air-defense systems more recently, the training of their ground troops, the provision of armored vehicles and ammunition, and the ability for them to project effective force against Russian troops within Ukraine to push them out of their country.\u00a0 And we will continue to do so.\nIt is a collaborative effort.\u00a0 It has proven to be very, very effective.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve seen over and over again is that the Ukrainian, both politically \u2013 the Ukrainians, both politically and militarily, have learned quickly, have been relentlessly focused on using the support that we give them effectively, and have consistently outperformed expectations \u2013 certainly the expectations of Vladimir Putin.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Your assessment on the long-range missiles that potentially get to them?\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, look, you would, I\u2019m sure, understand that anything to do with operational details about the nature, the timing, the scale of our support would be counterproductive for us to discuss publicly.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Mark Stone with Sky News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you both very much.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, a question for you in a moment, if I may.\u00a0 But first of all, for Foreign Secretary Cleverly:\u00a0 It feels as though support for Ukraine is waning a little bit.\u00a0 You may disagree with that, but you can feel it on Capitol Hill with influential sections of the Republican Party and their base across America skeptical now about the never-ending \u2013 seemingly never-ending support for Ukraine.\u00a0 If Ukrainians don\u2019t deliver a decisive victory over the next few months, how do you \u2013 how does Britain persuade America that they must continue to lead support for a Ukrainian victory?\u00a0 And if you can\u2019t, what then?\nAnd a second question for you, if I can, just a little bit more on the long-range missiles.\u00a0 Can you give us any assessment of whether these long-range missiles will come and what effect that will have on the battlefield?\nAnd then in a moment for you, sir.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, I \u2013 I\u2019ve said this \u2013 why don\u2019t you put your question on record, and then (inaudible) my frame of view \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah, okay.\u00a0 Sorry, I will.\u00a0 Yeah, of course.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I want to focus with you on American priorities, if I may.\u00a0 Since Ukraine \u2013 since the war started, there have been nearly 9,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine, according to the UN.\u00a0 In America this year, in the past five months, 15,000 people have died from gun violence; 70,000 people died last year from opioid overdoses, many of those drugs coming from China.\u00a0 Your argument on defending Ukraine is clear, but with so many fundamental challenges here at home and politicians telling people that security begins at home, how do you maintain support for a battle far away?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 So firstly, on our support for Ukraine \u2013 and when I say \u201cour,\u201d I mean the wider alliance of friends who are supporting Ukraine.\u00a0 This means the UK and the United States of America and others.\u00a0 We need to recognize that the outcome of this conflict will have effect all over the world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said over and over again the eyes of the world are watching.\u00a0 They are watching how we respond to this challenge; they are watching to see our resolve.\u00a0 And whether it be in capital cities or non-state actors, the message that we send now is really important.\nI think the message that we should send is that when we commit to something, we stick with it.\u00a0\u00a0 We have the grit, we have the determination, we have the strategic endurance to see it through until its successful conclusion, and anyone watching should learn that lesson.\nI would also make the point that, of course, there has been an economic impact on people in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 This is not a byproduct of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 This is part of the conflict.\u00a0 Economic coercion through their restrictions of hydrocarbons, pinching off the supply of grain to the developing world \u2013 this is part of the conflict; it\u2019s not a byproduct of the conflict.\u00a0 And we should recognize that if we do not re-establish the principles of the UN Charter \u2013 the foundation stone of peace in the post-Second World War era, that powerful nations cannot invade their neighbors with impunity \u2013 the world will be more dangerous, more expensive, more difficult.\nSo this is not just about Ukraine, though, of course, the Ukrainians have been suffering enormously and it\u2019s right that we defend them.\u00a0 It is about us, and it is in our interest, as well as the Ukrainians\u2019 interest, that we stay resolute in our support, because it will become more painful and more expensive if we do not.\nAnd when it comes to the Ukrainians\u2019 forthcoming counteroffensive, I\u2019ve made the point that this is not a film.\u00a0 There are no certainties when it comes to conflict.\u00a0 The Ukrainians have consistently outperformed expectations, but there can be no guarantees in war.\u00a0 So we have to recognize that we are giving the Ukrainians a huge amount of support \u2013 as I\u2019ve said, they have learned quickly; they have adapted very, very successfully, and they have defended themselves incredibly effectively \u2013 and we need to continue to support them, irrespective of whether this forthcoming offensive generates huge gains on the battlefield, because until this conflict is resolved and resolved properly, it is not over.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the message that I have spoken about back home in the UK and I will continue to say to those friends and colleagues here in the United States of America as well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, I can only violently agree with my friend and strongly endorse what he\u2019s just said.\u00a0 We have exactly the same perspective.\nSecond, I would also dispute the notion of waning support.\u00a0 I would refer you, for example, just recently to the very strong statement made by the Speaker of the House McCarthy about support for Ukraine and the enduring support and determination to see this through.\nBut stepping back, there is not a zero-sum choice between some of the work that we\u2019re doing around the world and the work that we\u2019re doing at home.\u00a0 In fact, to the contrary, they\u2019re directly linked and they\u2019re mutually reinforcing.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent the last couple of years making historic investments in ourselves \u2013 infrastructure, our technological edge when it comes to semiconductors, making sure that the United States would continue to lead when it comes to dealing with climate change and producing the technology of the future, green technology for green economies.\nAt the same time, working closely with our partners, we\u2019ve revitalized, re-engaged our alliances, our partnerships.\u00a0 We\u2019ve built new ones.\u00a0 The net result is that we are stronger at home, and our standing around the world is at I think the highest level that I\u2019ve seen in recent years.\nAnd, of course, we are \u2013 I was going to say walking and chewing gum \u2013 running and chewing gum at the same time.\u00a0 Even as we are engaged in helping Ukraine defend itself against this Russian aggression, for all the reasons the Foreign Secretary laid out \u2013 and, as he said earlier, we are equally focused on a very broad global agenda that addresses the needs and concerns of people around the world as well as our own citizens, and, of course, we\u2019re focused on challenges that we have at home.\nYou mentioned opioids, synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\u00a0 We\u2019re relentlessly focused on that, and that is by definition a problem that is both local and global.\u00a0 We\u2019re in the midst of building a much stronger global coalition to deal with the ravages that fentanyl is producing.\u00a0 In the United States, it\u2019s the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 49.\u00a0 So this is right at the top of our agenda.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re working very hard at home to deal with demand, to deal with treatment, to deal with recovery.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re working very closely, including with our neighbor Mexico, on the law enforcement piece to break up the cartels, to break up the financing, to interrupt the distribution.\u00a0 But more broadly, we\u2019re also working to get at the global network that has the production of some of the chemicals that go into fentanyl being made halfway around the world, and then coming close to us, perhaps getting diverted into the illicit produciton of fentanyl, and then winding up in the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what the coalition that we\u2019re building \u2013 and more on that in the coming weeks \u2013 will work to address.\nWe know that in the United States, when it comes to fentanyl and synthetic opioids, to some extent we\u2019ve been the canary in the coal mine.\u00a0 It hit us first, and it\u2019s hit us very hard.\u00a0 But as the markets become saturated in the United States, we see criminal enterprises trying to make markets elsewhere in the world, including in Europe, including in Asia.\u00a0 And there is a growing awareness and urgency on the part of other countries to making sure that we\u2019re tackling this problem.\nSo that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re not only doing it at home \u2013 we\u2019re doing it by building a very strong partnership with other countries, with the private sector, and other institutions to engage on it.\nSo the bottom line is these are not zero-sum choices.\u00a0 These are responsibilities we have: dealing with challenges we have at home, dealing with challenges we have around the world, and understanding the connections that exist between them.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Shaun Tandon with the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi there.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 Another conflict that\u2019s caused a lot of suffering: Syria.\u00a0 Just two days ago, the Arab League voted to readmit Syria.\u00a0 To both of you, do you see this at all as a failure of the efforts to isolate Assad that have been going on for many years?\u00a0 Specifically to Secretary Blinken, across partisan lines in Congress there are calls to continue using the Caesar Act and other authorities to prevent normalization with Assad.\u00a0 Is this still something that can be done, despite the reconciliation by the Arab League and by T\u00fcrkiye, for that matter, with the Assad regime?\nAnd to Foreign Secretary Cleverly, on that note as well, does the United Kingdom agree with the U.S. approach of no reconstruction aid at this point so long as Assad is there?\u00a0 Is that the approach that you think is beneficial?\nAnd just briefly, if I could ask both of you if you had any \u2013 any thoughts on the events today in Pakistan.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Khan was arrested; there was some violence.\u00a0 If you have any thoughts on that \u2013 thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Shaun, thank you.\u00a0 Let me \u2013 let me address Syria first.\u00a0 A few things on that.\u00a0 We do not believe that Syria merits readmission to the Arab League.\u00a0 It\u2019s a point we\u2019ve made to all of our regional partners, but they have to make their own decisions.\u00a0 And our position is clear:\u00a0 We are not going to be in the business of normalizing relations with Assad and with that regime.\nHaving said that, we also clearly have shared goals when it comes to Syria with our partners.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s reflected in a number of the things that they\u2019ve said.\u00a0 First, ultimately the only solution to the crisis inflicted on Syria by Assad has to be consistent with the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 that lays out expectations for a ceasefire, for humanitarian assistance, and for free and fair elections to ensure that Syrians have a government that actually reflects the will of the Syrian people.\u00a0 We agree on the importance \u2013 the imperative \u2013 of expanding humanitarian access to Syria.\u00a0 We agree on the importance of continuing the work to degrade ISIS or Daesh, to make sure that it can\u2019t re-emerge.\u00a0 And we agree on the importance of reducing Iran\u2019s malign influence and presence in Syria, as well as more broadly in the region.\nSo I think the Arab perspective, as articulated through the Arab League, is they believe that they can pursue these objectives through more direct engagement.\u00a0 But the \u2013 we may have a different perspective when it comes to that, but the objectives that we have I think are the same.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where the focus is.\nI think it\u2019s also fair to say that in terms of what\u2019s happened over the last few years, what we\u2019ve set out to do is to work to try to stabilize as best we could from afar the situation; to ensure, as I said, that ISIS cannot re-emerge in Syria; to expand humanitarian access.\u00a0 And on those criteria I think we\u2019ve actually made some progress.\u00a0 Fewer Syrians have lost their lives in the last few years.\u00a0 It\u2019s unfortunately a low bar given the horrors of the last decade, but that is a fact.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken ISIS leaders off the battlefield to ensure that, again, that organization couldn\u2019t re-emerge in the way that it at one point controlled a huge chunk of Syria and used it as a base for potential attacks around the world.\u00a0 And the humanitarian aid has continued to flow.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve managed to expand it, and we even managed to continue it despite the horrific earthquake in Syria.\nSo I think if you look at those various metrics, we have made some progress.\u00a0 And again, with our Arab partners, even if we disagree on the readmission to the Arab League, the objectives that we have remain the same.\nAnd with regard to Pakistan, of course I\u2019ve seen the reports that you\u2019ve alluded to, and we just want to make sure that whatever happens in Pakistan is consistent with the rule of law, with the constitution.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Shaun, yes.\u00a0 Again, this is an occasion where the UK and the U.S. share very, very similar views.\u00a0 I had a number of conversations with our interlocutors in the region ahead of the formal announcement of Syria\u2019s readmission.\u00a0 I say to you now what I said to our friends in the region, that the UK is very uncomfortable with Syria\u2019s readmission to the Arab League.\u00a0 But as Secretary Blinken said, ultimately is a decision for the membership of the Arab League.\nThe point that I have made is that there needs to be conditionality if they choose to take this course of action, have they done \u2013 as they have done.\u00a0 It needs to be conditional on some fundamental changes of behavior from Damascus and from the Assad regime.\u00a0 The protection of Syrians, if they choose to go back to Syria from the refugee camps in the region, needs to be assured.\u00a0 The Security Council Resolution 2254 needs to be at the heart of any engagement with Syria.\u00a0 And we cannot just wish away the actions of the Assad regime over the last few years; the brutality against Syrian people cannot just be ignored.\u00a0 And the UK certainly won\u2019t brush that under the carpet.\nBut we do recognize that there is a huge amount of pressure on countries in the region.\u00a0 They seek to alleviate that pressure through engagement with the Assad government in \u2013 or the Assad regime in Damascus.\u00a0 (Inaudible) if they are going to do that, then my strong view is that they should make sure that any steps that they take are more than matched by fundamental changes in behavior from the Assad regime and commitments that are then adhered to in line with 2254.\nAgain, with regard to Pakistan, I\u2019ve seen the headlines.\u00a0 I have not yet had the opportunity to be briefed in detail.\u00a0 The UK has a longstanding and close relationship with Pakistan.\u00a0 We are Commonwealth partners.\u00a0 We want to see peaceful democracy in that country.\u00a0 We want to see the rule of law adhered to.\u00a0 I\u2019m uncomfortable to speculate any further without having a detailed briefing on that.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll \u2013 final question \u2013 go to Nick Allen of\u00a0The Telegraph.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 If I could turn to trade, please.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, how do you address concerns on the other side of the Atlantic about the Inflation Reduction Act?\u00a0 What do you say to allies who might feel it\u2019s protectionist at their expense?\nAnd Foreign Secretary, in the absence of an FTA, and with the emergence of the Inflation Reduction Act, what specifically are you pushing for to boost joint economic security and the bilateral investment relationship between the two countries?\u00a0 For example, was there any discussion today about critical minerals and a deal similar to the one with Japan?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I think as we\u2019ve said over these last months, our primary focus with the Inflation Reduction Act was making sure that we\u2019re making the appropriate investments in ourselves to make sure that we can deliver when it comes to continuing to produce the technologies that are necessary both for dealing with the climate crisis and that are going to be, I think, central to 21st century economies.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what the act is all about.\u00a0 This is a historic commitment to dealing with climate and also a historic commitment to making sure that our economy is producing the very things that will be front and center for economies around the world over the next decades.\nBut as we\u2019ve also said very clearly, the intent is broader than that in terms of making sure that, collectively, with countries around the world that have a similar approach and are of similar mind, that we\u2019re working together to build the strongest possible collective infrastructure, supply chains, ecosystem to produce those technologies.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also worked to make sure that to the extent there were any unintended consequences coming from the act, that we\u2019ve addressed those, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working to do, I think successfully, over the recent months.\u00a0 This is not at all zero sum.\u00a0 On the contrary, I think it offers the prospects for a collective race to the top, not a race to the bottom when it comes to both addressing the climate crisis and making sure that our economies are producing the very technologies that are going to be front and center in the 21st century global economy and making sure that our countries collectively are doing that and that we are producing the strongest possible diversified and resilient supply chains.\nAll of these things are connected.\u00a0 I think there are profound benefits in the IRA for many of our partners around the world because, again, we will be increasingly joined in a supply chain that we\u2019ve been working to build.\u00a0 So I suspect that when the prime minister is here, we\u2019ll continue with that conversation.\u00a0 As the foreign secretary said, we continue to look at ways to strengthen and deepen what is already an extraordinarily strong economic partnership between our countries.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Nate, I know FTAs are often used as a shorthand for closer economic partnerships.\u00a0 We are not prioritizing an FTA with the United States of America because there are many areas where we can work more closely, more collaboratively, have real economic coordination that does not require the traditional kind of tariff-reducing elements of an FTA.\nOne of the advantages of being able to speak directly and regularly is the ability to coordinate and make sure that the completely understandable and correct desire of every government to make sure that it protects itself against future economic coercion \u2013 for example, that it protects itself against pinch points of critical elements of its supply chain, and that is right and proper that governments seek to do that.\nBut in doing so, it also seeks the opportunity to work closely with likeminded friends and economic allies in the same way that we are amongst the strongest defensive allies in the world as two member states of NATO.\u00a0 We are intelligence-sharing partners through the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship.\u00a0 The UK is also seeking to build an economic alliance which protects the interests of the United States of America while simultaneously protecting the UK\u2019s interests, protects standards, protects against the use of constrictions of key elements of global supply chains as a form of political or \u2013 as a form of coercion.\nAnd all these things are best done in close coordination, which is why \u2013 whether it\u2019s in Japan or in London or in Washington or anywhere else \u2013 we always take the opportunity to discuss, as we do the situation in Ukraine, those other immediate pressing issues, but also some of the long-term ways that we can work more collaboratively to protect those things that Tony quoted that I\u2019ve said in the past: the things that make us healthier and wealthier and more prosperous and safer.\u00a0 And I have no doubt that when my prime minister comes to the United States next month that\u2019ll be very much on the agenda that he discusses with President Biden.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Burdell \u2013 as America\u2019s next ambassador to France.\u00a0 He\u2019s earned it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, to get down to business.\u00a0 Before we get to where you\u2019re headed, let\u2019s just take a moment to reflect on where you\u2019ve come from, or better said, who you\u2019ve come from. \u00a0The people, as you heard the president say, who helped get you to this day, who always believed in you, even when you were a ramblin\u2019 wreck; the people who put their heads down so that you could lift yours up: moms and dads, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, grandparents, best friends.\nMany of them are here today cheering you on, and those who can\u2019t be, are part of who you are.\nThis is their day, too.\u00a0 So let\u2019s give them big round of applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nClass of 2023, I have to tell you I remember almost nothing about what the commencement speaker said at my college graduation.\u00a0 Not because it was a terrible speech \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 or because it was a long time ago \u2013 it was \u2013 but because my mind was elsewhere.\u00a0 And I suspect that may be the case for many, if not most, of you today.\nGraduation is one of those moments when your past, your present, your future all seem to be converging at once.\u00a0 You feel, rightly, immensely proud of what you\u2019ve achieved \u2013 and, at the same time, maybe a little bit anxious or even outright terrified about what you\u2019ll do next.\u00a0 It\u2019s a time when the question of who you are \u2013 and who you\u2019ll become \u2013 looms large.\nI can tell you from experience:\u00a0 It\u2019s a question you\u2019ll probably be grappling with years to come.\nSo I thought the most useful thing that I could do today is to share a few tips from my own experience about how to navigate the periods of uncertainty that lie ahead.\nFirst, get comfortable with what you don\u2019t know.\nTwo decades ago, I was hired as the staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u00a0 A big part of that job was fielding questions from senators, especially the chairman of the committee \u2013 a guy named Joe Biden \u2013 like how much aid we\u2019d given a foreign country over the last decade, or how long judges served on their supreme court.\nA lot of the time, I didn\u2019t have the answer.\nNow, when you get asked a question you don\u2019t know \u2013 especially by your boss \u2013 it\u2019s easy to feel like everyone will realize you\u2019re an impostor.\u00a0 You might be tempted to wing it \u2013 to fake it \u2018til you make it.\nDon\u2019t do it.\u00a0 Memorize this answer instead: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nI still use this line, including in Cabinet meetings with my boss, who\u2019s now President Biden.\nHere\u2019s why:\u00a0 If you give your boss bad information because you\u2019re too embarrassed to admit that you don\u2019t know, you\u2019re on the way to losing their confidence.\nIt\u2019s getting the right answer that matters, even if it takes some time to find it.\nThat\u2019s important when you\u2019re the one in charge, too, because acknowledging that there are things that you don\u2019t know signals to your team that they can also be honest with you.\nAnd it\u2019s also okay not to have the answers to the big questions like what you\u2019re going to do with your life.\u00a0 Everyone struggles with those.\nNow, you probably wouldn\u2019t know that from people\u2019s Instagram or LinkedIn accounts, where everyone seems to be crushing it.\u00a0 But remember, these are kind of like the real-world versions of George P. Burdell \u2013 they\u2019re highlight reels with the toughest parts edited out.\nYou never know what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s life, so err on the side of grace.\u00a0 And don\u2019t compare their outsides to your insides.\u00a0 Focus on your own journey.\u00a0 Be patient with yourself \u2013 you\u2019ll get there.\u00a0 You just may just need to wander a little bit first.\nWandering is how Buckminster Fuller \u2013 one of our nation\u2019s greatest innovators \u2013 found his way.\nHe was born in 1898[i].\u00a0 He failed out of Harvard \u2013 twice.\u00a0 He joined the Navy; he started a family.\u00a0 He had a successful construction company.\u00a0 Then his world unraveled.\u00a0 He lost his three-year-old daughter to a terrible illness; soon after that, he lost his job.\u00a0 Broke, sad, depressed, he considered two paths: either he would take his own life, or he would fully dedicate himself to serving humanity.\nBucky chose life, but he had no idea where to direct his new sense of purpose.\u00a0 He spent two years rigorously observing the world around him, driven by the belief that nature\u2019s patterns would teach him how to use technology to improve people\u2019s lives.\nHis first discovery was inspired by the triangular structures of spider webs and the branches of trees, which led to his realization that the right combination of tension and compression could make light, flexible structures incredibly strong.\nHe called the principle \u201ctensegrity,\u201d and designed an entire home based on it, whose lightweight parts could fit into a single shipping container.\u00a0 It was Bucky\u2019s answer to affordable and sustainable housing, and when\u00a0Fortune Magazine\u00a0put his prototype on its cover, he received 30,000 unsolicited offers.\nBucky led a wildly prolific life.\u00a0 He earned 25[ii]\u00a0patents in everything from cartography to car design, all focused on serving humanity.\u00a0 To this day, his designs are all around us.\nI was in Montreal recently, and we had a town hall at the U.S. pavilion from the 1967 World Expo \u2013 a geodesic dome that\u2019s over 20 stories high.\u00a0 Bucky designed it.\u00a0 And the mace that Vice Provost Jacobs carried when leading you out onto the field today \u2013 its design is based on Bucky\u2019s principle of tensegrity.\nSo get comfortable with not having answers.\u00a0 The search for them will lead to your most important discoveries.\nSecond, know what you do know \u2013 the principles that guide you \u2013 no matter what changes around you.\nJimmy Carter, of course, spent one of his undergraduate years here at Tech, and he later said that the only way he could \u201cget out\u201d was by getting elected president and then picking up an honorary degree.\u00a0 He had a beautiful saying for our core beliefs, which came from his high school teacher: \u201cWe must adjust to changing times and still hold [to} unchanging principles.\u201d\nThat\u2019s true for individuals; it\u2019s true for nations.\nAs President Biden often says, we\u2019re at an inflection point, when we face defining questions about the future we want and how to get there, including when it comes to technology. The unprecedented leaps in AI and biotech and quantum computing and other fields that you\u2019ve studied are already having a profound effect on the lives that we live, how we live, how we learn, how we work.\nIt can be difficult to keep up, no matter what field you\u2019re working in.\u00a0 At the State Department, I\u2019ve realized that I need scientists and technologists in the room just to tell me whether I need scientists and technologists in the room.\nBut as developments in recent years have made clear, technology \u2013 like any other field \u2013 is not inherently good or bad.\nThis fundamental truth is baked into Georgia Tech\u2019s mission statement, which commits this institution\u00a0\u201cto develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, whether technology makes our societies more or less equitable, whether it promotes or represses human rights, whether it brings us together or drives us apart, that will come down in no small part to what you do.\nThat\u2019s the story of Joy Buolamwini, Tech class of 2012.\u00a0 From the moment she started building websites in high school, she knew that she wanted to use her programming skills to serve other people.\u00a0 But Joy spent almost all her time coding, and little time talking to the people who were using what she made.\nThat changed during her junior year at Tech, when she went to Ethiopia to help the Carter Center build an app to track neglected diseases.\u00a0 That experience pushed Joy to get out into communities where she could interact with people who were using the technology that she was designing.\u00a0 And that contact raised questions, questions she hadn\u2019t grappled with before \u2013 like how seemingly minor choices in language could make people feel excluded, or how to engage people in designing the tools that were intended to serve them.\nJoy found a cardinal direction on her internal compass:\u00a0 Always \u2013 always \u2013 see the people behind the code.\nYears later, she was designing an app that could superimpose the faces of other people \u2013 like one of her heroes, tennis legend Serena Williams \u2013 on top of her own.\u00a0 But the software Joy was using couldn\u2019t detect her face.\u00a0 It only worked if she covered her skin, which was black, with a white mask.\nShe tried out other facial recognition programs \u2013 same result.\nSo she peeled back the code and found the problem:\u00a0 The programs were trained on databases made up mostly of the faces of white men.\u00a0 The result was an algorithm that literally \u2013 literally \u2013 couldn\u2019t see Joy or many other black women.\nBut Joy refused to stay unseen.\u00a0 She took the brave step of calling out the facial recognition software made by big tech companies and the harms that algorithms could cause.\u00a0 She published research; she wrote op-eds; she testified before Congress; she created museum exhibits.\u00a0 She convinced companies to sign onto a pledge limiting their use of facial recognition software, and formed a group of coders to fight for greater equity and accountability in the AI that she continues leads to this day.\nSo like Joy, each of you will have to find points on your compass.\nLet me share one of my own, which has a lot in common with Joy\u2019s:\u00a0 Never lose sight of the people \u2013 the real people \u2013 on the other side of your decisions.\nA great journalist from many years ago, Edward R. Murrow, once told a group of American diplomats that the most crucial connection in international relations is made in the last three feet, by one person talking to another.\nThe more layers there are between us and the people whose lives are affected by our actions \u2013 whether those layers are screens or miles or ideological bubbles \u2013 the easier it is to stop seeing the connections that we can only make in those last three feet, and the easier it is to start seeing people as numbers or statistics \u2013 the other \u2013 rather than as fellow human beings.\nAround the dinner table, when I was growing up, I heard a lot about our country as a beacon of hope.\u00a0 My grandfather came to the United States after fleeing pogroms in Russia.\u00a0 My stepmom found refuge here after fleeing the communist regime in Hungary.\u00a0 And my stepdad was rescued by American GIs after enduring the horrors of the Holocaust.\nSo to this day, when I meet with refugees \u2013 whether they\u2019re Ukrainians uprooted by Russia\u2019s brutal invasion, or Nicaraguans who escaped their country\u2019s repressive regime, or the Syrian and Afghan employees that I met earlier today working here in Atlanta at the Refuge Coffee Shop, I see my own family in their shoes.\nThese meetings are also a chance to hear directly from the men, the women, the children whose fates are too often decided without their voices \u2013 in air-conditioned conference rooms, in policy memos, in spreadsheets.\nNow, some people believe that when it comes to shaping our policies, empathy clouds our judgment rather than clarifies it, and that if we want to advance the interests of the American people, we have to worry less about the hardships and injustices faced by people beyond our borders.\nI\u2019ve never seen it that way.\u00a0 In fact, when I look at the programs that continue to make our country a beacon of hope \u2013 and strengthen our standing in the world \u2013 they almost always are ones where we\u2019ve remembered to see ourselves in others.\nPrograms like the President\u2019s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, which has saved more than 25 million lives and counting in the 20 years since President George W. Bush created it. Programs like the international exchanges that have fostered ties between generations of students, professors, leaders from the United States and other countries \u2013 including President Cabrera \u2013 and I\u2019m so delighted that the Fulbright program can take responsibility and credit for you being here, not to mention your marriage.\u00a0 Programs like our sustained efforts to promote the human rights of women and girls and LGBTQI people around the globe.\nIt\u2019s up close, in those last three feet \u2013 that\u2019s where we remember that the true measure of any policy \u2013 or any app, or any start-up, or any organization, anything else that we do \u2013 is the tangible difference it makes in the lives of our fellow human beings.\nThird and finally, always be open to rethinking the things that you thought you knew.\nThat includes the path you\u2019re on.\u00a0 It\u2019s never too late to change course.\nThat\u2019s what happened to me.\u00a0 I went to law school after college and then headed to a big firm. The job checked a lot of boxes.\u00a0 I had brilliant colleagues, intellectually rigorous work.\u00a0 The salary wasn\u2019t bad, either.\u00a0 But my heart just wasn\u2019t in it.\u00a0 So one year, ten months, two weeks, three days, and five hours after I started, I quit.\nSome of my best friends while I was in law school were film students, and a few of them had recently started a production company.\u00a0 So when I left, they asked me if I wanted to join them, and I said yes.\nI loved movies, and the idea of being part of building something from the ground up was incredibly exciting.\nWe produced a handful of films \u2013 including one about a brooding student-turned-vampire \u2013 no, not Twilight \u2013 and we put on a film festival in New York.\u00a0 But most of the creativity was coming from the writers, the directors, the actors \u2013 not me.\u00a0 Collaborating with them made clear they had gifts that I did not.\nAnd as much as I love movies, I was looking out at a world that was changing quickly, and I was feeling the pull to be a part of it.\u00a0 Apartheid was coming to an end in South Africa.\u00a0 The Soviet Union had collapsed.\u00a0 The people of newly independent nations were finding their own way.\u00a0 There were peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, a growing ethnic conflict in the Balkans.\nI wanted to get involved; I just didn\u2019t know how.\nThen I caught a break.\u00a0 Someone that I\u2019d worked for years earlier told me about an opening for an assistant job at the State Department.\u00a0 I applied \u2013 and I got it.\nNow, it was a pretty junior position.\u00a0 My first office \u2013 well, let me put it this way.\u00a0 The previous occupant of my first office was a very large safe, so that gives you some idea about what the office was like \u2013 basically, a windowless closet.\nBut from day one, I was hooked.\u00a0 Diplomacy felt urgent, challenging, directly connected to improving people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 It was a way to serve my country, which I badly wanted to do.\u00a0 I felt grateful every morning walking into work.\u00a0 I still do.\nNow, I\u2019m biased, but I think you might feel the same way.\u00a0 So I hope that some of you will consider putting your skills toward public service \u2013 maybe even toward making our foreign policy better \u2013 for the good of Americans, for the good of people around the world.\u00a0 We need your help.\nIn my case, it took a few tries, but I found my place.\nAnd I learned something important along the way:\u00a0 I had to be open to starting over.\u00a0 When things didn\u2019t turn out the way I hoped, I had to change my experience, not my expectations.\nLong before he was President, Jimmy Carter was a young dad with three small kids and a promising career in the Navy\u2019s nuclear submarine program.\u00a0 One day he got a call that his father, Earl, who was sick with cancer, was dying.\nJimmy drove from his base in New York to Plains, Georgia \u2013 a town of around 600 people where he\u2019d grown up.\nNow, Earl Carter, his dad, cast a big shadow in Plains, and Jimmy had worked hard to get out from under that shadow.\u00a0 But there was something about reflecting on his dad\u2019s life during that visit that planted a question in Jimmy.\u00a0 Not only was the family peanut farm one of the town\u2019s biggest employers, but Earl was a church deacon, a leader in the Elks club.\u00a0 He served on the local school and hospital boards.\u00a0 When kids in Plains couldn\u2019t afford clothes for graduation, the teachers told Earl and he donated them, anonymously.\nIf the family business went under, Jimmy knew the town would go with it.\nSeeing the community that his dad had worked so hard to build made Jimmy wonder whether it made sense and what it would be like if he tried something similar.\nAfter Earl died, Jimmy struggled with whether he should move his family back to Plains.\u00a0 And on paper, it made no sense.\u00a0 The family business was deep in debt, and he knew little about farming or running a business.\u00a0 He had a bright future ahead in the Navy.\u00a0 But he went back anyway.\nHis superiors thought he was crazy.\u00a0 His wife, Rosalynn, was so mad she refused to talk to him except through their kids.\u00a0 The first year, the farm earned $280.\nBut Jimmy found something different in Plains \u2013 something that he\u2019d been missing for years that he hadn\u2019t been able to put his finger on: a sense of community.\u00a0 And as he and Rosalynn turned the business around, he threw himself into local service: getting involved in the Lions Club, the Boy Scouts, the school, hospital, and library boards, in his church.\u00a0 Then he decided to run for a state senate seat, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nClass of 2023, you have a mantra here at Georgia Tech: \u201cWe can do that.\u201d\nAnd it rings true for so many of our shared hopes and ambitions \u2013 far beyond this campus.\nBut I would humbly suggest, as Zaria also suggested, that the most important in \u201cWe can do that\u201d is not \u201cdo\u201d but \u201cwe.\u201d\nWe can do that \u2014 whether that \u201cwe\u201d is a family, a campus, a city, a country, or the world.\nThat\u2019s certainly true today.\u00a0 Think about your experience.\u00a0 Look around.\u00a0 No one gets out by doing it alone.\u00a0 You got out because you did it together.\nAnd I\u2019m confident that as you reflect back on how you made it to this day, behind everything you\u2019ve done and everything you\u2019re proud of, there is a \u201cwe.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the one constant in navigating all the uncertainty that you\u2019ll face \u2013 whether that\u2019s getting through the times when you don\u2019t have the answers, or figuring out the principles that will anchor you in life, or keeping yourself open to rethinking the things that you thought you knew\u00a0\u2013 you must always, always be guided by people you love and trust.\nAnd so, esteemed graduates, don\u2019t forget:\u00a0 The key to navigating all uncertainty is never trying to do it alone.\nFind your \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 and there\u2019s absolutely nothing you cannot do.\nThank you, and congratulations!\n(Applause.)\n[i] 1895\n\n[ii]\u00a028\n\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken Following a Tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Atlanta, Georgia", "date": "May 5, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It really is a pleasure for me to be here at the Centers for Disease Control to spend some time with our colleagues with whom we have an extraordinary partnership between the CDC and the State Department.\u00a0\u00a0 But I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t start first by saying that we send our deepest condolences to the family, the friends of Amy St. Pierre, a member of the CDC community who was killed in the recent violence in Atlanta, someone who dedicated her career to working on maternal health issues and I know was a treasured member of this community.\u00a0 So we\u2019re thinking of her today as we\u2019re here.\nI also want to say at the outset that it was a coincidence but nonetheless powerful to be here with the director, Rochelle Walensky.\u00a0 She\u2019s announced she\u2019s leaving the CDC.\u00a0 She has been an extraordinary leader of this enterprise.\u00a0 She\u2019s made our country healthier and safer.\u00a0 She\u2019s made countries around the world healthier and safer.\u00a0 I could not be more grateful for the collaboration that we\u2019ve had during the time she\u2019s directed the CDC, and our institutions continue that collaboration every single day.\nWe have CDC experts in more than 60 of our embassies around the world, really the front-line defense for the United States in terms of detecting and then dealing with the outbreak of infectious disease.\u00a0 And we all know \u2013 we\u2019ve all experienced over the last few years \u2013 just how something that starts halfway around the world can have the most profound impact imaginable right here in the United States.\u00a0 So that front line of defense, that collaboration with the CDC in country after country, is making a huge difference.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a difference in spotting something as it emerges.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a big difference in helping build the capacity of partner countries to better detect, prevent, deal with the emergence of disease.\nThat remains a vital collaboration.\u00a0 But there is so much more that we\u2019ve been doing together for many years, working together, particularly on HIV/AIDS around the world through the PEPFAR program initiated by former President Bush, where as a result of that program we have helped save well more 20 million lives.\u00a0 And we\u2019re determined to see that it\u2019s reauthorized and to make sure that we complete the mission, because we\u2019re very close to getting that done, eradicating HIV/AIDS around the world as a killer.\nWe\u2019re dealing now together with Marburg and an outbreak that we\u2019ve seen in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania, where again the CDC and the State Department are joined at the hip in working with the host governments in dealing with that outbreak and trying to make sure that it doesn\u2019t go any further than it\u2019s already gone.\nAnd more broadly, we are working together to try to build up genuine global health security in a sustainable way.\u00a0 The thing that we\u2019ve learned powerfully in recent years is that health security is national security.\u00a0 We know that when health security breaks down, it\u2019s almost inevitably going to have an impact on our national security.\u00a0 As disease outbreaks that go uncontrolled and unmanaged, we have everything from, potentially, societal breakdowns to mass migrations, all of which have a profound impact on national security.\nSo one of the things that we\u2019re doing at the State Department \u2013 another reason for this visit today \u2013 is we\u2019re standing up for the first time a Global Health Bureau in our department to make sure that we\u2019re marshaling all our resources in effectively responding to global health challenges.\u00a0 And we\u2019re also here to learn from the experience of the CDC and to integrate into that effort to stand up this bureau some of the experiences, some of the learning, some of the ways that CDC has done things that will help shape what we\u2019re doing at the State Department.\nFinally, right now the number one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49 are synthetic opioids, fentanyl \u2013 the number one killer.\u00a0 Last year we seized enough fentanyl to kill every single American citizen.\u00a0 So the State Department is working aggressively to build an international coalition to help more effectively deal with the fentanyl challenge because it\u2019s by definition a global challenge, an international problem.\u00a0 The precursors that go into making fentanyl often are manufactured somewhere else in the world.\u00a0 They wind up coming toward us, turned into a synthetic opioid, and then they wind up on our streets and kill Americans.\u00a0 So we need global collaboration, global cooperation, as part of dealing with this challenge.\nHere again, CDC is a critical partner, learning from them some of the best practices that they\u2019ve put into dealing with things like fentanyl, synthetic opioids, sharing some of those best practices with our partners around the world \u2013 that\u2019s going to make a difference in combating what is one of the worst scourges that we face as a country.\nSo in these areas and so many more, this partnership, this collaboration, is an essential part of our national security.\u00a0 It\u2019s an essential part of our foreign policy.\u00a0 And to have the opportunity to come here today to be with the leaders of the CDC, to learn from them, and to look at how we\u2019re going to pursue this partnership going forward is a very important part of my agenda.\u00a0 So I\u2019m grateful to our colleagues here, grateful for the collaboration, and very much looking forward to the work ahead.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-american-foreign-service-association-memorial-plaque-ceremony/",

Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 5, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good morning, everyone.\nPresident Rubin \u2013 Eric \u2013 thank you for making this event happen.\u00a0 To you, to the American Foreign Service Association, the DACOR Bacon House Foundation, the Senior Living Foundation: we are so grateful for everything that you do to support our diplomats.\nAs Eric said, I\u2019m also very gratified that we\u2019re all here today in person once again.\u00a0 It makes today even more meaningful.\nTo every member of our foreign affairs agencies, whether you\u2019re serving now or whether you served in the past, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the critical work that you do.\u00a0 Thank you for your dedication, your professionalism, your patriotism \u2013 all that you bring to our missions around the world.\nAs President Biden often says, we find ourselves now at an inflection point.\u00a0 So many of the actions that we take today are going to shape the lives of the American people for decades to come \u2013 whether that\u2019s meeting the challenge of great power competition, addressing the climate crisis, shaping the rules for emerging technologies, working to prevent the next pandemic.\nThese challenges make our diplomacy more critical than it\u2019s ever been.\nAnd it\u2019s only by working with allies, with partners that we can actually solve these problems \u2013 and seize some of the opportunities \u2013 that are too big for any one nation to face alone.\u00a0 And you are the ones leading the charge \u2013 following in the footsteps of generations of extraordinary public servants.\nLast year, more than 800 members of the Foreign and Civil Service retired, having devoted decades of their lives to this institution and to the American people.\nAltogether, that cohort dedicated over 22,000 years of service to our country.\u00a0 Its members worked in every single bureau in this department, at posts in more than 170 countries.\nThey tackled the most important issues of our time: protecting the environment, defending human rights, aiding refugees, expanding economic opportunity, negotiating peace agreements.\nThis class built and deepened ties between the United States and other countries.\u00a0 They forged new partnerships.\u00a0 They facilitated exchange programs.\u00a0 They issued countless visas and passports.\nTheir actions, big and small, changed the trajectory of so many lives, here and around the world.\nBut today, we celebrate not only what our diplomats do, but how they do it.\nThese jobs, as President Rubin said, require extraordinary sacrifice \u2013 from diplomats who work long hours; from their loved ones who support them.\nThese jobs demand character.\u00a0 They demand integrity.\nAnd serving as a diplomat also requires courage.\u00a0 Right now, around the world, our colleagues are working in war zones, under foreign surveillance, amidst humanitarian crises, in the aftermath of natural disasters.\u00a0 Some experience serious accidents abroad; others are exposed to severe illness or health hazards.\u00a0 Some of our LGBTQI colleagues serve in places where they \u2013 and their partners \u2013 don\u2019t feel safe to be their full selves.\nJust this week, we lost a treasured local staff member at Embassy Lisbon, Rui Noronha, who died in the course of his duty.\u00a0 His family\u2019s loss is our loss, too.\nBut our diplomats face these situations with tremendous heart, with compassion, with decency, focusing not on themselves, but on helping the people around them, who often go through some of the hardest days of their lives.\nSimply put, that\u2019s our mission.\u00a0 And for generations, our diplomats have carried on despite danger, despite difficulty.\nNowhere is that devotion more clearly illustrated than in the 312 individuals honored on our Memorial Walls \u2013 those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\nThis year, we pay special tribute to two more members of the Foreign Service: Thomas Wallis and Elbridge Lee, both of whom died from COVID-19 in 2021.\nTom dedicated his life to public service \u2013 first as a soldier in the U.S. Army, where he completed several tours, and was awarded a Bronze Star.\u00a0 Then, he became a consular officer.\u00a0 He brought a spirit of service to everything that he did.\u00a0 Tom had a special fountain pen that he used only to sign certificates of death abroad \u2013 to make sure that they looked dignified for the families who received them.\u00a0 When he sat at the consular window \u2013 working with foreigners or helping Americans in crisis \u2013 Tom was calm, he was friendly, he was easy to talk to.\u00a0 He also lifted up his team.\u00a0 He was the kind of person who would stop by his supervisor\u2019s office, just to let her know that a coworker had done a great job.\u00a0 He brought this kindness everywhere he went: from the animal rescue organizations he supported around the world, to trivia games, where he was always everyone\u2019s first pick, apparently, to be on their team.\nElbridge \u2013 who went by his last name, Lee \u2013 specialized in information management, and by all accounts he was a natural diplomat.\u00a0 Thoughtful, compassionate, a talented problem-solver.\u00a0 Whether you were a colleague, a friend, a family member, if you needed advice, you went to Lee.\u00a0 And people wanted to be like him.\u00a0 One of his former teammates said that, in tough situations, he found himself asking, \u201cWhat would Lee do?\u201d\u00a0 Lee was proud to be an American, proud to serve his country.\u00a0 So much so that it rubbed off on the people around him, especially those closest to him.\u00a0 Years ago, he encouraged his wife, Josie, to apply to the State Department.\u00a0 She still works here today.\u00a0 His eldest daughter, Naomi, said that her interest in the world and the people in it came from her dad.\u00a0 And when his youngest daughter, Esther, starts college this fall, she\u2019s planning on studying international relations.\nThe State Department \u2013 the United States of America \u2013 are better because of Tom and Lee.\u00a0 Because of their service, but also because of who they were as people.\nTo their family \u2013 Tom\u2019s wife, Monica; Lee\u2019s wife, Josie, their daughters, Naomi and Esther \u2013 we will be forever grateful, grateful that we got to know \u2013 and that we got to work alongside \u2013 your exceptional loved ones.\nWith this new plaque, we honor the permanent mark that they made on this department, and on our country.\nAnd by carrying out their dedication and compassion \u2013 and continuing the spirit of service that runs through every single name on these walls \u2013 we will work to keep their legacies alive.\nMay God bless you.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-bilateral-peace-negotiation-closing-session-with-armenian-foreign-minister-ararat-mirzoyan-and-azerbaijani-foreign-minister-jeyhun-bayramov/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

I want to start by thanking our colleagues, both foreign ministers, their delegations for traveling here and for spending the time here in \u2013 at the Foreign Service Institute, and especially for their commitment to dialogue, and I think a recognition on the part of both Armenia and Azerbaijan that the only path to a lasting, durable peace is through dialogue.\u00a0 The United States is very happy to continue to offer its support, its engagement, its good offices to host this discussion and any future ones toward an enduring peace.\u00a0 That is the objective.\nThe two sides have discussed some very tough issues over the last few days and they\u2019ve made tangible progress on a durable peace agreement.\u00a0 I hope that they see \u2013 and I believe that they do, as I do \u2013 that there is an agreement within sight, within reach.\u00a0 And achieving that agreement would be, I think, not only historic, but would be profoundly in the interests of the people of Azerbaijan and Armenia, and would have very positive effects even beyond their two countries.\nI think the pace of the negotiations and the foundation that our colleagues have built shows that we really are within reach of an agreement.\u00a0 The last mile of any marathon is always the hardest; we know that.\u00a0 But the United States is here to continue to help both of our friends cross the finish line.\u00a0 And as I say, I think we\u2019re very much within reach of that.\nI have to say, finally, that the leadership that we\u2019re seeing from both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and from my friends the foreign ministers, is inspiring.\u00a0 None of this is easy, but the commitment, the determination to move forward, to deal with the remaining challenging issues is real.\u00a0 And we feel, coming out of these few days, that, as I said, we\u2019ve made very tangible progress.\u00a0 A final agreement is within reach, and we\u2019re determined to continue to help our friends achieve it.\nSo with thanks to both of you, to both of your delegations, as well as to Prime Minister Pashinyan and President Aliyev for sending you here.\u00a0 I thank everyone, and we look forward to continuing.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-closing-remarks-at-the-2023-selectusa-investment-summit/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Good morning, everyone, and it is wonderful to see all of you here, so many of you here.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite an extraordinary turnout.\u00a0 And Don, thank you very much for that introduction and also \u2013 and more important \u2013 my thanks to you and to my good friend, Secretary Gina Raimondo, and the entire team at the Commerce Department for the work that you\u2019re doing every single day to drive economic opportunity for the American people and for our partners.\nSo it really is a pleasure for me to be here at the United States\u2019 biggest investment summit with business leaders from every part of the world, including thousands of foreign investors and representatives from the American private sector.\nA very warm welcome as well to the hundreds of city and state leaders here with us today.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the critical role that you\u2019re playing in attracting and welcoming new businesses into your communities and reminding private and public investors alike why it is always a good bet to invest in America.\nSo throughout this week, this group has heard from leaders across the U.S. Government on why the United States is the best place in the world to invest: our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, driving new products and solutions at scale; a world-class system of universities and colleges, fueling ideas and fostering talent; our rule of law, protecting intellectual property, worker rights, fostering growth.\nToday, what I thought I\u2019d do is just briefly lay out how we\u2019re building on these advantages to try to make the United States an even stronger and more attractive place to invest, to do business.\u00a0 And the short answer really is this: first and foremost, by investing in ourselves.\nWe\u2019ve made, as you know, historic investments in our competitiveness with legislation like the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \u2013 transformative laws that make America an even better place to do business, with more resilient supply chains, a stronger and more inclusive workforce, more regional innovation and technology hubs, improved infrastructure, including new roads, rail transit, waterways, airports, as well as expanded fast and free broadband across our entire country.\nBut investment in ourselves is not a zero-sum proposition.\u00a0 Our approach is predicated on building a strong, resilient, and advanced industrial base with our partners around the world.\u00a0 We can\u2019t build everything domestically, nor would we want to, because it\u2019s to our collective benefit to have diversified supply chains across all of our partners.\nWe\u2019re also trying to modernize our economic partnerships to better position us to address the challenges and opportunities of this moment that we share: from combating the climate crisis, to tackling corruption, to driving sustainable economic growth.\u00a0 New initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity will both protect our national and economic security, and that of our partners \u2013 creating closer connections between our countries, more opportunities for our businesses to invest and to thrive.\nAnd we\u2019re using existing bodies to produce results for our people, like the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, through which we\u2019re coordinating our industrial strategies to be complementary to one another.\nThis approach is delivering results.\nSince 2021, the private sector has invested more than $435 billion in businesses across the United States.\u00a0 A third of the investments announced since August have involved a foreign investor.\u00a0 There\u2019s also record demand for our international business leaders to come to the United States, and that\u2019s something that my department is working to facilitate.\nSo far this fiscal year, we have already issued nearly double the number of business visas that we did at this point last year, and we\u2019ve also surpassed the number of business visas that were issued before the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 so that entrepreneurs and investors can attend professional conferences, negotiate contracts, work with their associates, do the countless things that they do to run successful businesses.\nAs has been very evident this week, there is tremendous pent-up demand for more business travel, so we\u2019re devoting more resources and streamlining our processes to help you secure business and work visas for yourself and for your employees.\nOur Bureau of Consular Affairs stands ready to help.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made it easier to apply for these visas, including by launching the Business Visa Center.\u00a0 That\u2019s a one-stop-shop to help international investors access visas for business travel.\u00a0 Later this year, we\u2019ll be piloting a program to make it easier to renew some of our temporary work visas from within the United States instead of having to traveling abroad.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to save time and it\u2019s going to reduce uncertainty for employers.\nIf you go back to 2011, since then this conference has helped bring in more than $80 billion in private investment.\u00a0 It\u2019s supported more than 60,000 jobs in the United States while helping thousands of foreign businesses and investors enter the U.S. market, to the benefit of themselves, their economies, their fellow citizens back home.\nThese partnerships have also helped us advance critical foreign policy priorities \u2013 something that needless to say I\u2019m focused on.\nAt last year\u2019s SelectUSA Summit, the CEO of Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer GlobalWafers, Doris Hsu, announced plans for a new state-of-the-art facility in Sherman, Texas.\u00a0 It will be the largest facility of its kind in the United States.\u00a0 GlobalWafers broke ground last December, and once completed, this $5 billion facility will support more than 1,500 jobs in the United States.\u00a0 But it will also fill a critical gap in our advanced semiconductor supply chain \u2013 crucial to preserving our competitiveness on a technology that is foundational to the 21st century economy.\nOr consider the example of Delfast, a Ukrainian e-bike company that helped us confront the climate crisis by creating a zero-carbon transportation option.\u00a0 Thanks to the connections that they made with American partners at the SelectUSA Summit last year, as well as ongoing support from our embassy in Ukraine, Delfast was able to open its first store in the United States in September 2021 in Whittier, California.\u00a0 They are growing very quickly in the United States, with 70 percent of their customer base located in this country.\u00a0 In fact, Delfast has been so successful that they\u2019ve announced plans to invest another $25 million in their U.S. operations over the next year, next several years.\u00a0 That will create another 200 jobs in Whittier.\u00a0 And we\u2019re joined by representatives from dozens of Ukrainian startups similarly taking advantage of SelectUSA to thrive.\nNow, I know Delfast just won the premier award that we issue from this gathering.\u00a0 My only disappointment was that in the long journey from my car through the back stage all the way to the stage, I didn\u2019t get a chance to use one of their e-bikes, but maybe on the way out.\nGlobalWafers, Delfast, hundreds of other companies have used this summit to gain the connections and the know-how to enter the United States market.\u00a0 The State Department stands ready to help your company do the same thing.\nWe have 200 Economics and Business Affairs officers in Washington, D.C., and 1,500 economic officers in our embassies and consulates around the world, across more than 150 countries. \u00a0All have the responsibility to help foreign businesses find the strongest investment opportunities here in the United States.\u00a0 They, along with our colleagues in the Department of Commerce\u2019s Foreign Commercial Service, will be able to help you navigate legal frameworks in the United States, connect you with potential partners, and answer any questions that you\u2019ve got along the way.\nSo to our international visitors here today:\u00a0 The United States is very much open for business, and we hope you choose to invest your time and your talents with us.\nAnd to the U.S. businesses that are here today:\u00a0 We are standing by to continue supporting everything that you\u2019re doing as you grow your businesses both here in the United States and around the world.\nIf the innovation, the dynamism on display here this week is any indication, we have a lot to look forward to, a lot to be optimistic about.\u00a0 So to each and every one of you, thank you for being here.\u00a0 Thank you for taking part.\u00a0 We look forward to doing a lot of good business together in the years ahead.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "May 3, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0The only thing better than having the Secretary of State on the screen is having the Secretary of State in person.\u00a0 We\u2019re very happy that Secretary of State Blinken could join us today to celebrate, commemorate World Press Freedom Day.\nIn our business, we like to cover the story; we worry that we\u2019re becoming the story.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had 67 journalists and media workers who were killed last year.\u00a0 We have about 570 who are in prison around the world in 30 different countries.\u00a0 We have a problem.\u00a0 And I want to ask you about the case that we\u2019re focused on most immediately right now, which is that of\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporter Evan Gerschkovich.\u00a0 Tell us about the efforts the State Department has made to get Evan free, and \u2013 in particular I\u2019m curious whether you\u2019ve been able to talk \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Excuse us.\u00a0 We can\u2019t use this day without calling for the freedom of Julian Assange.\nSTAFF:\u00a0 Come on, you got to go.\u00a0 Come on, you go to go.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 The Biden administration must (inaudible) Julian Assange.\u00a0 Stop the extradition request of Julian Assange.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 What about \u2013 two hours and not one word about (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Take it easy.\u00a0 Take it easy.\u00a0 Take it easy guys.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Not one word about journalist Shireen Abu-Akleh, who was murdered \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 by the Israeli occupation forces in Palestine.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Not one word about Julian Assange.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019re here to celebrate freedom of expression, and we just experienced it.\u00a0 Let me continue, Mr. Secretary, to ask you about Evan Gerschkovich and your efforts to get him free.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first, David it\u2019s very good to be here, to be with you.\u00a0 This is an important day.\u00a0 It\u2019s a somber day, for the reasons that my alter ego cited just a few minutes ago.\u00a0 We know that journalists around the world are increasingly under siege \u2013 under siege in a whole variety of ways.\u00a0 That\u2019s now manifested itself once again very powerfully in Evan\u2019s detention and incarceration, in Moscow \u2013 profoundly, unjustly \u2013 for doing his job.\u00a0 We\u2019re intensely engaged with the Russians to seek his freedom, to seek his immediate release \u2013 short of that, just to get what Russia\u2019s obligated to provide, which is consular access, which they\u2019ve done once but have yet to repeat.\nOur Ambassador Lynne Tracy had a chance to be with Evan about ten days ago; found him of incredibly strong of mind and spirit, which is a very powerful thing in this situation.\u00a0 But we have a country in the case of Russia that like a handful of other countries around the world is wrongfully detaining people, using them as political pawns, using them as leverage in a practice that is absolutely unacceptable and that we\u2019re working both broadly to try to deter \u2013 but also at the same time to try to secure the release of those who are being unjustly detained.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0And let met ask, Mr. Secretary, whether you\u2019ve talked directly to your Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, about this.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I have.\u00a0 I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov shortly after Evan was detained. \u00a0I haven\u2019t spoken to him since.\u00a0 I made clear the imperative of releasing Evan.\u00a0 I made clear the imperative of getting consular access.\u00a0 We did get consular access after that.\u00a0 We have a channel that President Biden and President Putin established, some time ago, to try to work on these cases, so we\u2019re engaged.\u00a0 I wish I could say that in this moment there was a clear way forward.\u00a0 I \u2013 we don\u2019t have that in this moment, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working every single day.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ve done something unusual in these cases, which is to impose the Levinson Act and declare the FSB, the Russian secret police, as a target of your sanctions because of wrongful detention.\u00a0 Tell us about that, whether that was a difficult choice to make, and what specific leverage that\u2019s going to give you in getting freedom for Evan.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Look, the Levinson Act is an important tool.\u00a0 It gives us different and new authorities to try to go at those who are directly engaged in wrongfully detaining journalists or wrongfully detaining our citizens.\u00a0 It includes things like travel bans, like asset freezes.\u00a0 And, look, I think it\u2019s clear that in some cases the individuals who are sanctioned may not be planning to travel to the United States anyway; we have to acknowledge that \u2013 or many not have assets here.\u00a0 But our hope is that by applying it, we can have a chilling affect on those who would engage in these practices going forward.\nThere\u2019s something else, though, that\u2019s going on.\u00a0 For a country like Russia that has already severely isolated itself by its aggression against Ukraine, these acts only further its isolation.\u00a0 Increasingly, the message is don\u2019t come here, don\u2019t travel here; whoever you are, you risk being pulled off the street and thrown in jail \u2013 and that is only going to deepen Russia\u2019s isolation.\u00a0 As we speak, to my knowledge there are no reporters of American nationality in Russia.\u00a0 There are about 20 Russians who are formally accredited here with state media organizations.\u00a0 But if this is applied across the board, and you see more and more countries, and the nationals of more and more countries saying \u201cI\u2019m not going there,\u201d that is simply going to further detach Russia from the world, and that is profoundly not in Russia\u2019s interest.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0As someone who has personally been sanctioned by Russia, this has meaning for me.\u00a0 I want to ask you about another\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0colleague, and that is our contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza.\u00a0 He is not a U.S. citizen, but his wife is.\u00a0 He\u2019s been a permanent resident \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 in Washington and his two children \u2013 his children are citizens.\u00a0 Why isn\u2019t he included in your declarations about wrongful detention, which would have some force in leaving the 25-year \u2013 the harsh, harsh sentence that was just imposed on him?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So first, we deplore what is being done to him.\u00a0 Second, when it comes to determinations of wrongful detention, it\u2019s a process.\u00a0 And there are clear criteria, but it\u2019s also true that these cases evolve.\u00a0 And as we learn more, as we fully understand the circumstances, the details as we are able to look at how people similarly situated are being treated, that \u2013 all of that goes into a determination of wrongful detention.\u00a0 So these determinations are not typically made immediately; there is a process and criteria that we apply.\u00a0 And that does not in any way prejudge what we might do coming up as we continue to look at that case and others.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So, just because it\u2019s important, obviously, to his family and to those of us here at the\u00a0Post, I understand you to be saying that the State Department is still examining whether you might \u2013\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s correct.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 \u2014 declare him as wrongfully detained.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That is correct.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And when do you think you might make that decision?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to put a timeframe on it.\u00a0 Again, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at constantly.\nThe other thing I\u2019d say is this, because I think it\u2019s important:\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to fight back and push back around the world to help journalists, who \u2013 in one way or another, are facing intimidation, coercion, persecution, prosecution, surveillance.\u00a0 We have a fund, a technology fund, to try to get technology in the hands of journalists and other civil society advocates to make sure that they can continue even in a surveillance state to communicate with each other and to be connected to the outside world.\u00a0 We have a defamation fund, because increasingly what we\u2019re seeing in country after country is the use of lawfare, trying to put journalists and put media enterprises out of business by litigation.\u00a0 We now have a defamation fund that journalists and independent media can tap into to help defend themselves.\u00a0 We have a program to try to help journalists protect themselves \u2013 physically, or in cyberspace \u2013 from intimidation and coercion by states.\u00a0 We contribute tens of millions of dollars into a media freedom fund for independent media to bolster their capacity to continue doing business even in very difficult places.\u00a0 And we\u2019re part of a Media Freedom Coalition, about 52 countries, pooling resources, pooling information, sharing expertise and knowledge with journalists and independent media enterprises around the world.\nSo, it\u2019s not just a matter of putting a spotlight on this, as we do every day.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just a matter of engaging country after country where journalists are being in one way or another mistreated.\u00a0 We\u2019re actually trying to get tools in the hands of journalists and independent media so that they can push back, so that they can sustain what they\u2019re doing.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful, obviously, for the support of all countries in the United Nations, the United States leading among them, in recognizing World Press Freedom Day and taking this issue seriously, as Secretary-General Guterres did in his comments this week.\nI want to ask you briefly about another\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0colleage \u2013 I wish this list was shorter \u2013 and that\u2019s Austin Tice, who was a contributor to\u00a0The Washington Post, who\u2019s been missing in Syria now for many years.\u00a0 His mother, Debra, told CBS News this week that she wants to see the same urgency and commitment that she hears from top levels trickle down through the State Department, throughout the administration, and that the assurances that have been given that her son will someday be free be realized.\u00a0 What would be your response to Debra Tice, Austin\u2019s mother?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well first, David, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet with Debra Tice on a couple of occasions.\u00a0 I can\u2019t begin to tell you my admiration for her, the extraordinary courage that she and the family have shown, the resilience that they\u2019ve shown.\u00a0 I can\u2019t begin to put myself in her shoes \u2013 almost 11 years now that Austin has been taken and separated from her, from his family, from his friends.\u00a0 And her absolute determination, relentless determination to do everything in her power to push for his freedom is beyond admirable.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really \u2013 I think humility in the face of that is what really comes to mind.\nAnd I know when you\u2019re in the shoes of someone like Debra Tice \u2013 and unfortunately we have 60 or so American families who have their loved ones wrongfully detained somewhere around the world; I\u2019ve met virtually or in person with every single one of them \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly frustrating, because you want to see something happening every single day.\u00a0 And often we\u2019re engaged in efforts to get people home that we can\u2019t talk about even with the families.\nWhat I can say is this:\u00a0 We\u2019re extensively engaged with regard to Austin \u2013 engaged with Syria, engaged with third countries \u2013 seeking to find a way to get him home.\u00a0 And we\u2019re not going to relent until we do.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Let\u2019s \u2013 as more Arab countries establish diplomatic relations with Syria, that\u2019s one hope that we have, is that that leverage will be used to get freedom for him.\nBefore we leave this general topic, I want to ask you a question from a member of our audience, which is a good one.\u00a0 This is from Ramunas Bigalus (ph) in Connecticut.\u00a0 The question is:\u00a0 \u201cShould the State Department warn all journalists to avoid travel to Russia and Belarus?\u201d\u00a0 Given the situation you described, given the threats that are so obvious, should the State Department be saying flatly, \u201cWe don\u2019t think you should go at all\u201d?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, the truth is we\u2019ve instituted something in our travel warnings \u2013 a D indicator, as we call it \u2013 to make sure that every American who is contemplating travel to a certain group of countries understands that they engage in this practice of wrongful detention, so that at least people are put on notice.\nNow, I recognize journalists are in a different category.\u00a0 It\u2019s your job to shine a light everywhere in the world, including in the darkest corners.\u00a0 And\u00a0that comes with extraordinary risk.\u00a0 So yes, as a government we can certainly recommend that anyone with a U.S. passport strongly reconsider traveling to a handful of countries that are known to do this, and we\u2019d say the same thing to journalists.\u00a0 But I also recognize that you feel that you have a job to do, it\u2019s an invaluable job, and ultimately journalists have to balance that risk, calculate that risk.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I have to say we are in the business of ignoring those risks, and going to places where people tell us not to go, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change.\u00a0 I hope it doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 So we wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs as journalists \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if I didn\u2019t ask a little bit about the news of the day, because there\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 And I want to start with the new overnight from the Kremlin, accusing Ukraine of having tried to assassinate President Vladimir Putin with a drone strike on the Kremlin near his residence.\u00a0 Ukraine has denied doing this.\nI want to ask the question this way:\u00a0 What is the United States position on such attacks, on leadership during this war by Ukraine or other combatants?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, I\u2019ve seen the reports.\u00a0 I can\u2019t in any way validate them; we simply don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Second, I would take anything out of the Kremlin with a very large shaker of salt.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s see \u2013 we\u2019ll see what the facts are.\u00a0 And it\u2019s really hard to comment or speculate on this without really knowing what the facts are.\nMore generally, as I\u2019ve said and as we\u2019ve said, when it comes to Ukraine \u2013 which is under daily assault \u2013 and not just its incredibly courageous military forces, but its citizens \u2013 its men, women, and children \u2013 being assaulted on a daily basis by this Russian aggression, being bombed out of their homes, their apartments, and their streets, children killed, families torn apart \u2013 well, we leave it to Ukraine to decide how it\u2019s going to defend itself, and how it\u2019s going to try to get back the territory that\u2019s been seized from it illegally by Russia over the past 14 months and going back to 2014, back to then.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So to clarify, if Ukraine decided on its own to strike back in Russian territory, the United States would not criticize them?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, these are decisions for Ukraine to make about how it\u2019s going\u00a0 to defend itself, how it\u2019s going to get its territory back, how it\u2019s going to restore its territorial integrity and its sovereignty.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 We carried a story this morning that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read in which President Zelenskyy of Ukraine complains about the reporting about the so-called discord leaks, which contained material on almost every imaginable subject around the world, but of special interest to Ukraine \u2013 had information said to be U.S. intelligence estimates that Ukraine was running out of air defense weapons, that this war was likely heading toward a stalemate.\u00a0 Zelenskyy said to our journalists this was not helpful.\nOne thing that the story said was that you, as Secretary of State, had talked to your counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in April about these leaks that were just hitting.\u00a0 What did you tell him?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Without commenting on purported leaks of documents, I can say this generically about the stories that were in the press.\u00a0 What I told him is we very much regretted the unauthorized exposure of these documents, that we took very seriously our obligations and responsibility to protect information.\u00a0 \u00a0We, of course, have arrested someone who is allegedly responsible for this.\u00a0 And at the same time, we were determined to pursue our partnership with Ukraine, our support for Ukraine.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that Ukrainians, as well as many other countries around the world, have benefitted from the extraordinary information that the United States is able to develop and provide that helps support, defend, protect their security as well as ours.\u00a0 I have to say, David, going around the world since then, meeting with colleagues from probably dozens of countries, this has virtually not come up.\u00a0 In fact, to the extent it\u2019s come up, I\u2019ve raised it just to make clear how seriously we take this.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The Ukrainians and President Zelenskyy obviously took the information in these alleged leaks with special seriousness, because of their planned offensive.\u00a0 They\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that they want to push the Russians back, and here were arguments that they may have limited success.\u00a0 Documents aside, you study this every day.\u00a0 This is an anguishing war on your watch.\u00a0 What\u2019s your sense, as we head in the spring and summer, and this long-awaited counteroffensive is about to dawn, about Ukraine\u2019s ability to alter the balance over the course of this year in this war in a way that might make ending the war possible?\u00a0 What do you think?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, this:\u00a0 What was published in the press, in the media reflected a particular point in time.\u00a0 And this is not static.\u00a0 And so, where Ukraine might have been a month ago, two months ago, three months ago is not where it is now in terms of its ability, for example, to prosecute a counteroffensive and to deal with the ongoing Russian aggression.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s one very important thing to keep in mind.\nSecond, we have been engaged intensely over many months with about 50 countries in trying to provide the support that Ukraine needs both to defend itself, but also to help regain territory that\u2019s been taken by Russia over the last 14, 15 months.\u00a0 Lloyd Austin has, I think, worked miracles in bringing together 50 countries in a very coordinated way.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just the equipment that we provide, because while that\u2019s vital, it\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 In and of itself, it doesn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to be able to use it \u2013 training \u2013 you\u2019ve got to be able to maintain it \u2013 we\u2019ve been working on that.\u00a0 And then, the Ukrainian forces have to be able to use everything in a coordinated and combined way, and many countries have been working to support them on that.\nSo, I feel confident that they will have success in regaining more of their territory.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s also important to note that, for Russia, this is already a strategic failure.\u00a0 Russia sought to erase Ukraine from the map, to eliminate its independence, to subsume it into Russia.\u00a0 That has failed.\u00a0 And of course, Ukraine has regained a big chunk of the territory that Russia originally had its footprints on.\u00a0 Where exactly this settles remains to be seen. \u00a0And Ukraine has to make important decisions about exactly where it\u2019s going to go, how far it can get, and how it wants to pursue this.\u00a0 But we\u2019re determined to sustain that support.\u00a0 We\u2019re also determined not only to look at this in the short term with this intense focus on the counteroffensive in the months ahead, but also for the medium and long term.\nBecause what Ukraine also needs \u2013 and what many countries around the world are interested in doing on a sustainable basis \u2013 is to help them develop the kind of military that in the future can effectively deter another Russian aggression \u2013 and if deterrence doesn\u2019t work, to defend against it, and if necessary to defeat it.\u00a0 That is going to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position, as well as helping to rebuild the country and pursuing its integration into Europe, its economic integration.\u00a0 The combination of those things, as well as Ukraine continuing to pursue policies that root out corruption, that put in place transparency, good governance, strong civil society, a vibrant, independent media \u2013 those are the secrets to success, to resilience, to strength for Ukraine over the coming years in being able to resist further Russian aggression.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re walking and we\u2019re running, even, and chewing gum at the same time.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So, that\u2019s a useful summary and a hopeful summary of where Ukraine will end up.\u00a0 I hear you saying they will gain some territory as a result of this counteroffensive.\u00a0 A question that lies ahead after these months is whether there\u2019s some effort to seek a settlement that might include, yes, the United States and Europe, but also China, which has expressed a strong interest in doing so, has a 12-point peace proposal.\u00a0 As I look at the 12 points, many of them are ones that we\u2019d probably write ourselves.\u00a0 What do you think in principle, Mr. Secretary, about the idea of the United States working in parallel at some point down the road with China to seek a stable outcome here?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0In principle, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u00a0 If we have a country, whether it\u2019s China or other countries, that have significant influence, that are prepared to pursue a just and durable peace \u2013 and I\u2019ll come back to what that means in a minute \u2013 we would welcome that.\u00a0 And it\u2019s certainly possible that China would have a role to play in that effort, and that could be very beneficial.\u00a0 There were elements in the plan that China put out, things that actually it had said and many others had said for some time, that were positive.\u00a0 But it has to begin with a couple of things.\nFirst, a clear understanding that in this instance, there\u2019s a victim and there\u2019s an aggressor.\u00a0 There\u2019s no moral equivalence between the two positions.\u00a0 And I have to say, until recently, it was very unclear whether China accepted that basic principle.\u00a0 I\u2019m still not sure that they do, but at least President Xi has now had a conversation with President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 That\u2019s a positive thing, because it\u2019s vitally important that China and other countries that have been seeking to advance peace hear from the victim, not just the aggressor.\nSecond, any peace really has to be both just and durable, and what do I mean by that?\u00a0 Just in the sense that it has to basically reflect the principles that are at the heart of the United Nations Charter, when it comes to territorial integrity, when it comes to sovereignty.\u00a0 It can\u2019t ratify what Russia has done, which is the seizure of so much of Ukraine\u2019s territory.\u00a0 And it needs to be durable in the sense that we don\u2019t want this to land in a place where Russia can simply rest, refit, and re-attack six months later or a year later.\u00a0 So, we have to look at all of that.\u00a0 But as a matter of principle, countries, particularly countries with significant influence like China, if they\u2019re willing to play a positive role in trying to bring peace, that would be a good thing.\nBut, it starts fundamentally with Vladimir Putin actually making that fundamental decision.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not seen that yet.\u00a0 There is zero evidence that Russia is prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 To the contrary, we\u2019ve seen the horrific onslaught, just in the past week, again, on civilian targets in Ukraine.\u00a0 We saw the horrific story of a father in an apartment building who, after this attack, opens the door of his children\u2019s room to find that it\u2019s gone and they\u2019re gone.\u00a0 So, there has to be some profound change in Mr. Putin\u2019s mind and in Russia\u2019s mind to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0One more quick question.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about China.\u00a0 You had a trip that was scheduled to China that you postponed, because of the Chinese spy balloon.\u00a0 And I have to ask you:\u00a0 In a period where there seems to be some warming of relations between the United States, beginning of a thaw, are you hopeful that you may be able to reschedule that trip this year?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I am, and I think it\u2019s important, as President Biden laid out in Bali when he was with President Xi at the end of last year, that we re-establish regular lines of communication at all levels and across our government.\u00a0 We\u2019re in a competition with China; there\u2019s no secret about that.\u00a0 But we have a strong interest in trying to make sure that that competition doesn\u2019t veer into conflict.\u00a0 There\u2019s a clear demand signal from around the world that we manage this relationship responsibly \u2013 a demand signal on us, but also on Beijing.\u00a0 And that starts with engagement, that starts with communicating, it starts with trying to make sure, again, that we don\u2019t veer into conflict.\u00a0 If there are areas where we can actually cooperate, because it\u2019s in the interest of our people, Chinese people and people around the world, so much the better, but at the very least we need to have a floor under this relationship.\u00a0 We need to have some guardrails on it.\u00a0 And the way to do that is through engagement.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So, Mr. Secretary, we want to thank you for coming here, for answering all these questions frankly, and especially we want to thank you for marking with us World Press Freedom Day.\u00a0 This is a period where journalists are under threat.\u00a0 Knowing that senior officials of the U.S. Government, the leadership of the United Nations stand with people in our business in insisting that journalists be free to do their work matters a lot.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0You know, David, we\u2019re also trying, at least in my department, to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.\u00a0 One of the first things we did \u2013 actually, probably the first thing we did \u2013 was to restore the daily press briefing at the State Department.\u00a0 Virtually, wherever I travel, I have your colleagues with me.\u00a0 And, pretty much every stop, we have some kind of press conference, press engagement that brings in our travelling pool but also brings in journalists from the countries that we\u2019re traveling to, including countries that may not have the most open media environment.\nIt\u2019s hugely important to me and to us to demonstrate that we\u2019re holding ourselves accountable by making sure that we\u2019re answering questions, we\u2019re engaging with people who have one of the most important responsibilities in this world, and that is to hold governments, to hold institutions to account, to shine light where there\u2019s darkness, to give people confidence in their institutions, in the people who have the responsibility to represent them.\u00a0 I think, in my experience, there\u2019s actually no more important time for it.\u00a0 I\u2019m incredibly grateful \u2013 even if there\u2019s some days when I don\u2019t feel like it \u2013 incredibly grateful to you and to all of our colleagues.\nThe other day \u2013 and let me end with this \u2013 I got a chance to sit down with Ben Hall from Fox, who was part of our traveling family and then was grievously injured in Ukraine covering the war, trying to shed light on it.\u00a0 Extraordinary story.\u00a0 He\u2019s back.\u00a0 It was just incredibly good to see him and have a chance to talk to him.\u00a0 I said to him when we started the interview how glad I was to see him back, and I said I\u2019d probably regret saying that about five minutes later when the interview was over.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But it was just one powerful example of the dangers that so many of our colleagues expose themselves to so that they can bring forward the story, bring forward the truth, and I\u2019m really grateful for it.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So amen to those comments, and thanks to our courageous colleagues.\u00a0 Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, my friend.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much.\nSECRETARY

you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 It is wonderful to be with all of you here in Denver.\u00a0 And Mike, let me just say to you first off, I can\u2019t thank you enough for your extraordinary leadership in bringing all of this together.\u00a0 The work you did to galvanize the community, to get the support that we needed for this summit, it\u2019s a remarkable contribution not just to this community but to our entire hemisphere.\nAnd I also want to especially thank Governor Polis, Mayor Hancock not just for your hospitality but for your leadership as well in bringing us all together.\u00a0 We picked Denver to host the inaugural Cities Summit of the Americas in large part because of its track record in addressing global challenges at a local level.\u00a0 And that\u2019s really what this summit is all about for us.\nI\u2019m so thrilled to be joined by literally hundreds of mayors and governors, tribal and other indigenous leaders, along with dozens of networks which support them, like ICLEI, U.S. Conference of Mayors, C40 Cities Group.\u00a0 We also want to welcome the many representatives of civil society and the private sector who are here with us today.\nIf you go back to last June, leaders from across our hemisphere came together in Los Angeles for the Ninth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 We agreed to ambitious commitments on issues that actually matter in the lives of all of our citizens: migration, climate change, democratic governance; sustainable, inclusive economic growth.\nEach of you, as city leaders, are on the front lines of tackling these global challenges.\u00a0 You\u2019re welcoming and integrating migrants into your communities.\u00a0 You\u2019re planning for and responding to natural disasters, made more frequent by the climate crisis.\u00a0 You\u2019re addressing the issues that are facing your residents, from law enforcement challenges like ransomware, to public health crises like the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 Your efforts day-in/day-out are helping us make progress on the commitments that we made as countries in Los Angeles.\nCities, when you come down to it, are where democracy is closest to its people.\u00a0 And when cities are responsive to the needs of residents, they demonstrate democracy\u2019s greatest strength: its ability to improve on itself, to empower citizens to hold their leaders accountable, to try out different solutions, and to allow the best ideas to rise to the top.\nWe\u2019re hosting the Cities Summit of the Americas because our collective ability to deliver for our people and to tackle global issues depends on all of you.\u00a0 It\u2019s as simple and as straightforward as that.\u00a0 And we look forward to continuing to elevate your voices in every dimension of our work in the hemisphere, including at the Tenth Summit of the Americas that\u2019ll be hosted by the Dominican Republic.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also why we plan for this to be the first but not the last of many Cities Summits to come.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, what we know is this and what I\u2019ve learned over 30 or so years of doing this going around the world is this:\u00a0 Somewhere, in some part of the world, someone has figured out the solution to a problem that many people are trying to solve; but if we don\u2019t share that information, if we don\u2019t share that knowledge, then everyone else just has to keep reinventing the wheel.\nSo our success in addressing the many issues that we\u2019re trying to tackle right now depends on the best ideas being shared among all of you.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why I hope that the connections \u2013 and that\u2019s the word that Mike used \u2013 is the word indeed that comes back again and again.\u00a0 Connections, interconnectivity.\u00a0 I hope the connections you\u2019ve made here in Denver will last a long time and that you use them to continue to engage with each other, to share ideas, to share solutions.\nAnd as I said, our success depends on these ideas being shared among you.\u00a0 It also depends on national governments learning from you, incorporating the ideas and perspectives of our cities and communities into the policies that we\u2019re making at a national level.\nSo what I thought I\u2019d do today as we\u2019re closing out this summit is to share just three areas where cities are leading the way, and where deeper connections between cities and national governments can make a profound difference in the lives and livelihoods of our people, starting with the first issue I\u2019ll talk about: migration.\nNow, if you step back for a minute and think about the moment we\u2019re in globally, there are more people displaced from their homes around the world than at any time in recorded history: more than 100 million.\u00a0 In our own hemisphere, more than 20 million people are on the move.\nBack at the Summit of the Americas, we came together to try to address what is an unprecedented migration challenge across our hemisphere through something we called the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which reflected the first truly regional approach to the issue.\u00a0 Twenty-one countries agreed that we have a shared responsibility to tackle the migration challenge together, and they agreed on a shared set of principles and priorities, among them expanding protections for migrants who are at risk.\nSo under the leadership of Mayor Claudia L\u00f3pez, someone I\u2019ve had the great pleasure of working with on many occasions \u2013 she\u2019s here with us today, Bogot\u00e1 has been putting this principle into practice since last year.\nI had a chance to visit last time I was in Colombia one of the city\u2019s pioneering migration integration facilities, which offers basically a one-stop-shop where people get a Temporary Protected Status card, they get connected to jobs, they get connected to schools, they get to sign up for essential services like health care.\nBecause of these efforts, Bogot\u00e1 has welcomed more refugees in recent years than any other city in the Americas \u2013 or, as Mayor L\u00f3pez likes to call them, \u201cNew Bogot\u00e1nos.\u201d\u00a0 Colombia as a whole has given refuge to more than 2.5 million Venezuelans who were displaced by their country\u2019s crisis.\nAnd because the protected status that Colombia gives them allows Venezuelans to work, they are also contributing to Colombia\u2019s economy, filling jobs, providing services, starting new businesses.\u00a0 These efforts are driving growth.\u00a0 They\u2019re creating opportunities for Colombians as well as Venezuelans.\u00a0 And they\u2019re showing that we can actually manage migration safely, humanely, and use it as an opportunity to strengthen our communities.\nCity leaders are also stepping up to tackle the second issue I want to talk about, and that\u2019s the climate crisis.\nBack in 2019, the Mississippi River Basin \u2013 and that\u2019s an area that stretches across 31 of our states in the United States \u2013 that basin experienced historic floods, causing more than $6 billion in damages.\u00a0 In the aftermath, mayors from more than a hundred cities and towns \u2013 led by Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons, who\u2019s here with us today \u2013 have been helping prepare their communities for future floods to get ahead of the next problem, the next crisis.\nWorking hand-in-hand with local and global environmental organizations, the mayors and their partners are restoring 66,000 acres of wetlands, of forests, of marshes, and adapting the land to regulate stormwater flow, with a focus on building resilience for communities that have historically been overlooked.\nOnce completed, these restored lands will capture more than 165,000 tons of carbon from the air.\u00a0 Now, that\u2019s the equivalent of taking about 36,000 cars off the road every year.\u00a0 And their efforts are making cities and towns more resilient against floods.\u00a0 When the area around St. Louis \u2013 which is in the basin \u2013 was hit with a \u201conce in a thousand-years rainfall\u201d in 2022, the wetlands there soaked up enough stormwater to fill 750 Olympic-size swimming pools, and that saved millions of dollars in potential damages.\nNow, often innovations at the city level start from the dedicated work of civil society leaders, and that\u2019s the case for the third and final area I want to talk about today, and that\u2019s transparency in our governance.\nIn Chihuahua, Mexico, members of a local anti-corruption nonprofit, Karaywah, came together to tackle lack of transparency in their municipal government.\u00a0 In 2019, when this initiative started, only about 60 percent of municipal contracts were being publicly bid.\u00a0 That meant that many companies were left out of the bidding process \u2013 reducing competition, driving up costs for taxpayers.\nKaraywah teamed up with other Mexican NGOs, with the United Nations Development Programme, and with the U.S. Agency for International Development to put together a digital platform that tracks and publishes open municipal contracts, that follows the bidding process, that allows constituents to monitor where their tax dollars are being spent.\nNow, 100 percent of municipal contracts in Chihuahua City are published online.\u00a0 The tool has been so successful that it\u2019s now being rolled out, free of cost, to 15 other city and state governments across Mexico \u2013 decreasing the potential for corruption, increasing people\u2019s\u00a0 participation and trust in government, something that is especially critical in the times that we\u2019re living.\nOn issue after issue, in city after city, local leaders are pointing the way to effective solutions.\u00a0 This week\u2019s summit shows many more promising opportunities to deliver for our people, including one starting right here in Denver.\nThe City of Denver and the State Department signed an agreement to partner on building early detection systems to track the evolution of new synthetic drugs, like fentanyl, so that we can develop lifesaving interventions early on.\u00a0 We\u2019ll share our findings with partners across the hemisphere, so that we can inform locally-led efforts to counter this public health and security threat.\nNow, this is a powerful illustration of how solutions that we\u2019re finding and answers that we\u2019re finding at the local level can have a powerful impact on the most pressing, most urgent national problems and international problems we face.\u00a0 Fentanyl in the United States is responsible for more deaths among Americans aged 18 to 49 than anything else.\u00a0 Think about that for a second.\u00a0 The leading cause of death in our country for Americans aged 18 to 49 is synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\nLast year, we seized enough fentanyl to kill every single American.\u00a0 That\u2019s the scale of the problem.\u00a0 By definition it has to have an international solution, which we\u2019re working on very hard at the State Department under President Biden\u2019s guidance, but also national and local responses.\u00a0 And I had a chance to see some of the incredibly important work that Denver is doing right here, and I\u2019m grateful for the partnership that we have.\nDozens of cities from across the hemisphere also came together to sign the Denver Declaration, which reflects their shared commitment to addressing the challenges facing our cities, including affordable housing, migration, and the climate crisis.\nAnd thanks to the leadership of Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, more than 45 cities also launched the Anti-Racist Cities Network, through which cities will share best practices for promoting equity and inclusion in our societies.\u00a0 Discrimination robs democracies, including ours in the United States, of the strength, the innovation, the creativity of so many of our citizens, which is exactly what we need to more effectively face the challenges of our time.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why efforts like this one are really important in empowering our full populations.\nTo strengthen the partnership between the United States mayors and their counterparts across the world, we at the State Department recently launched a new City and State Diplomacy Office.\u00a0 So again, people might ask, how is it that we have an office at the State Department to engage at the subnational level?\u00a0 Well, this summit here in Denver demonstrates exactly why it was important for us to do that.\nSince October, Ambassador Nina Hachigian and her team have been working at building the ties that we\u2019re seeing come to full fruition here in Denver.\u00a0 Ambassador Hachigian has held senior positions at the White House, the State Department, and the city of Los Angeles, where she was deputy mayor for international affairs. \u00a0Nina and her team are here in Denver; if you haven\u2019t had the chance to connect up with them yet, I hope in the remaining time that you have you\u2019ll take the opportunity to do so.\nThe city and state diplomacy teams work as a key component, but not the only component, of the State Department\u2019s substantive engagement with cities across our hemisphere.\u00a0 Many of you in this audience have worked closely with our embassies in your countries, in your cities, on a wide variety of issues \u2013 connecting your cities\u2019 businesses with the U.S. private sector.\u00a0 Launching partnerships to strengthen our shared energy security.\u00a0 Combating human trafficking.\u00a0 Promoting global health.\u00a0 In so many ways, the connectivity between our department and your cities is helping to produce real results.\nEarlier today I also had a chance \u2013 and I hope, again, some of you, if not all of you, had the opportunity to do this \u2013 I had a chance to visit the Innovation Plaza at the summit, where many of our companies are displaying solutions that they\u2019ve found to the challenges that you\u2019re trying to address, from accessing government services to recycling and sustainability to housing.\u00a0 These connections, too, between cities and the private sector are another very vital part of this gathering.\nNow, to build on all of this work, we\u2019re devoting additional resources to our engagement with cities.\u00a0 Yesterday we launched something called Cities Forward, an initiative to help cities build a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future.\u00a0 Through this program, which we\u2019re running with our implementing partners ICLEI, Resilient Cities Catalyst, and the Institute of the Americas, we\u2019ll start by connecting 12 American cities here in the United States with 12 Latin American and Caribbean cities so that they can share directly experiences and lessons on everything from how they\u2019re finding new ways to reduce air and water pollution to designing their infrastructure to better withstand more intense and frequent natural disasters.\nWe\u2019ll also support participating cities with funding, technical assistance to develop and implement sustainability action plans that benefit all of their constituents, including those from underserved communities.\u00a0 And while we\u2019re starting with 24 cities, we plan to share our findings with cities throughout our entire hemisphere so that what we learn from this initiative, we can take that and we can scale it.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing a little advertising \u2013 the application for Cities Forward is now live.\u00a0 Consider applying.\nAs you all know well, there is tremendous collaboration already happening in communities across our hemisphere.\u00a0 To cite just one example, look at the work being done here in Denver by community leaders Kristin Lacy and Vivi Lemus, who are also here with us today.\nWhen they first met, Kristin and Vivi realized how much that they had in common.\u00a0 Vivi was born in Guatemala; Kristin had spent years working there.\u00a0 They loved two things: coffee and cooking.\u00a0 They shared a dream of creating a space to build community between Spanish and English speakers.\u00a0 So they started putting away their savings.\u00a0 They got financing from local lenders.\u00a0 A fellow entrepreneur tipped them off to an open space, and city leaders stepped in to help them secure it.\nLast year, Kristin and Vivi opened Convivio Caf\u00e9, Denver\u2019s first women and immigrant-owned, bilingual coffee shop.\u00a0 They source their coffee directly from Guatemalan growers.\u00a0 That allows farmers to earn up to four times the profit they otherwise would, and they use the walls of their cafe as a space to display art that exposes customers to Guatemalan culture.\nConnections like these are leading to tangible benefits for people across our countries \u2013 through greater exports and good-paying jobs that respect labor rights, that give workers a fair shot at getting ahead, providing for their families and their communities.\u00a0 These partnerships are already being built \u2013 not only between our people and businesses, but also city and national governments, labor unions, civil society, multilateral organizations.\nWe\u2019re increasingly bound together through these connections, and what\u2019s so important is that we\u2019re putting them to work, putting them to work to meet the challenges of our time, the challenges we have to face if we\u2019re going to make a meaningful difference in the lives and livelihoods of our fellow citizens.\nPresident Biden has said on more than one occasion that we have everything we need to deliver for our people right here in our own hemisphere \u2013 and work being led by cities across the region, which you\u2019ve shared throughout this summit, shows exactly how we\u2019re doing that.\nSo to each and every one of you who\u2019s participated this week, and to each and every one of you who\u2019s not only participating this week but engaging every single day in these efforts, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your leadership, thank you for your partnership, thank you for the work that we\u2019re doing together as we build toward a more secure, a more prosperous shared future in the Americas.\u00a0 I, for one, am greatly looking forward to seeing all that we can accomplish for our people, and for our hemisphere, in the months and years ahead, following up on everything that\u2019s happened this week here in Denver.\u00a0 Thank you all so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

That speaks volumes at a time when we need those resources.\nAnyway, I was anxious to get a chance to share some of your experiences, and finally I\u2019ll say this:\u00a0 I\u2019m hoping very much that the work that\u2019s being done here and the connections that are being made across our hemisphere continue well beyond the days in Denver.\u00a0 I\u2019m really grateful to Nina Hachigian, who\u2019s leading our efforts in the State Department in what we call sub-national diplomacy, which is an increasingly critical part of what we\u2019re doing, and no one is actually better prepared to do that, having served at the highest levels of our national government but also as deputy mayor of Los Angeles, so not bad.\nIn any event, thank you all for taking some time.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-following-a-meeting-with-mayors-from-the-western-hemisphere-to-discuss-efforts-to-combat-fentanyl/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

the sea is much larger.\u00a0 The number one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49 is synthetic opioids, notably fentanyl.\u00a0 And by its very nature, this is a problem that requires us to work at a local level, at a national level, and at an international level.\nAs the mayor said, you might ask why someone in my job focusing in on this here in Denver, and it\u2019s precisely because of that.\u00a0 Just to give you a couple of quick examples, what Denver is doing so remarkably well both on dealing with prevention, with treatment, with recovery, with detection, with law enforcement, all of that is a powerful example for other communities that may be affected down the road if they\u2019re not already affected by synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\nAnd what we\u2019ve seen here is the United States has been something of the canary in the coal mine.\u00a0 It hit us here before it\u2019s hit many other places, but now we see it picking up in Mexico, in Canada.\u00a0 We heard from our colleague from Vancouver the numbers in Canada are dramatic, and we know it\u2019s going to spread to other places in the world.\u00a0 Our market is increasingly saturated.\u00a0 The criminal enterprises that are engaged in producing and distributing synthetic opioids like fentanyl are trying to make markets elsewhere.\nSo the more we can learn about how a city like Denver is being affected in dealing with the problems at a local level, the better we\u2019ll be able to share that with countries around the world.\u00a0 But we also need their help.\u00a0 Much of the fentanyl that\u2019s coming into the United States starts halfway around the world with perfectly legal chemicals that may be produced in one country then sent somewhere else, including to Mexico, and diverted into illegal use and used to manufacture fentanyl.\nSo having the cooperation and collaboration of countries around the world to prevent that diversion is critical.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got to get countries involved, we have to get the private sector involved because these chemicals are made, manufactured, and shipped.\u00a0 And all of us together can do a much better job in making sure that these chemicals are not diverted into illegal use and fabrication of fentanyl.\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons why President Biden is building an international coalition of concerned countries to work together to get ahead of this around the world.\u00a0 But at the same time, when I\u2019m going around the world and people are asking, well okay, what is the United States doing about this at home, I\u2019m able to point to a city like Denver that\u2019s leading on this effort in trying to reduce demand, in dealing with prevention, in dealing with treatment, in dealing effectively with law enforcement.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly powerful example that I can share.\nAnd then finally, there\u2019s a big law enforcement component to this at a local level but also at an international level.\u00a0 Much of this is driven by large transnational criminal enterprises that we\u2019re working every single day to break up, to break down, to break down the financing, the production, the distribution.\u00a0 But if we\u2019re not working at every single one of these levels \u2013 at the local level, at the national level, the international level \u2013 we\u2019re not going to solve the problem.\nSo being here, having so many of our colleagues from around the hemisphere here in Denver, to see what you\u2019re doing and how you\u2019re doing it, and then being able to share their own experiences and for us to be able to then build partnerships, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re ultimately going to get ahead of this problem.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really grateful \u2014 Mr. Mayor, to you; Mr. Director to you \u2013 for sharing everything that you\u2019re doing here in Denver, and we\u2019re determined together to get ahead of it.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-state-luncheon-in-honor-of-republic-of-korea-president-yoon-suk-yeol/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

", "date": "April 27, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Please, take a seat.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Please take a seat.\u00a0 Good afternoon, and welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 President Yoon, Mrs. Kim, it is a great pleasure to have you here with us today.\nNow, some of you may have heard this and actually seen it, but last night President Yoon \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 brought down the house at the state dinner \u2013 (applause) \u2013 singing \u201cAmerican Pie.\u201d\u00a0 So, Mr. President, I want you to know we have two great American musical giants with us here today, Herbie Hancock and Diane Reeves.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So if you feel moved to deliver another performance \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 don\u2019t let the music die, Mr. President.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nEvan and I are delighted to join Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, in welcoming all of you here today.\u00a0 And I know we\u2019re joined by an incredible group of friends, colleagues.\u00a0 Particularly I want to salute the members of Congress who are here.\u00a0 President Yoon just came from delivering an extraordinary speech to a joint session.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt has been 70 years since the United States and the Republic of Korea formed our alliance, making official a bond that was forged by Korean and American soldiers in the crucible of war.\u00a0\u00a0Katchi kapshida\u00a0\u2013 we go together \u2013 that was their motto.\u00a0 And indeed, they lived and fought and died shoulder to shoulder.\nFrom the beginning, American and Korean leaders understood that our alliance was about more than our two nations.\u00a0 President Eisenhower, speaking to Congress, said that it was an affirmation of our belief that the security of an individual nation in the free world depends on the security of its partners and constitutes another link in the collective security of free nations.\nIt was also a way to create space \u2013 space for Korean and American entrepreneurs and innovators, scientists and artists, governments and citizens \u2013 to use that security and their freedom to improve our societies in real ways.\u00a0 And who, looking at how far we\u2019ve come since that time, would question whether our partnership has lived up to its promise?\u00a0 We see the extraordinary emergence of Korea in virtually every domain around the world, not just as the strongest of security partners for the United States, but in science, technology, the arts, culture.\u00a0 We have never wavered in our commitment to our mutual defense.\u00a0 We\u2019ve invested in our shared prosperity and competitiveness.\u00a0 And we have decades of mutual growth to show for it, including in the industries and technologies that are shaping the future \u2013 from quantum computing to renewable energy to biotech.\nWe\u2019ve invested in the foundation of our strength, our democracies, while also deepening ties to our partners who share our commitment to freedom, to equal opportunity, to human rights, to the rule of law.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden convened the first two Summits for Democracy, the second of which was co-hosted by President Yoon.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why Seoul will take up the mantle now in leading the third Summit for Democracy next year.\nAs we think about all the ways that our countries go together, it\u2019s easy to take for granted our closeness, to see as somehow inevitable the parallel arcs that U.S. and Korea have traced over time.\u00a0 But the reality is this: the friendship between nations, like all friendships, ultimately comes down to the actions of individuals.\nAnd it\u2019s here that I\u2019d like to express our enormous gratitude to President Yoon.\u00a0 At a time of tremendous challenge to the international rule of law and the United Nations Charter, to our democracies, indeed to our planet, Mr. President, your principled leadership has helped bring us even closer together and has made Korea a global pivotal state.\u00a0 And that\u2019s to the benefit of Koreans, Americans, and indeed to people around the world.\nNow, it\u2019s not just our leaders who are committed to deepening our friendship, but our people, starting with Korean Americans.\u00a0 This year also marks the 120th anniversary of the arrival of the first Korean immigrants to America, a hundred or so men, women, and children who arrived on Honolulu\u2019s shores.\u00a0 Today, the extraordinary contributions of generations of Korean Americans are woven into the fabric of American society, from the sweeping histories of Min Jin Lee\u2019s novels to the explosive flavors of David Chang\u2019s dishes to the exceptional service of diplomats right here at the State Department, like one I\u2019d like to mention today: Julie Chung.\nJulie was just five years old when, in 1977, her family moved from Seoul to California.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t speak a word of English.\u00a0 Her dad got a job on the drafting floor of an engineering company.\u00a0 Her mom worked nights washing dishes in a restaurant.\u00a0 Julie\u2019s mom went on to become a librarian and a church deacon.\u00a0 Her dad later designed a heating system to prevent O-rings from freezing on space shuttles \u2013 that\u2019s what had caused the Challenger explosion \u2013 allowing NASA to restart the space missions.\u00a0 And Julie joined the first cohort of Pickering fellows at the State Department, which encourages the service of historically underrepresented minorities.\nToday, Julie\u2019s dad\u2019s engineering company is working on technology that will help the United States, Korea, and other partners who are joined in the Artemis Accord return astronauts to the Moon, including the first woman and first person of color.\u00a0 And Julie is the United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka.\nIf these are the threads that are connecting the United States and Korea through a single family, just think how rich, how deep the ties are that are binding our nations together.\nSo, President Yoon, Mrs. Kim, all of our distinguished guests, I ask you to raise a glass with me \u2013 and we\u2019ll even find a glass to raise.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 To all the ties that make our nations go together, and to all the places that they\u2019ll take us.\u00a0 Mr. President, cheers.\n(A toast was offered.)\nAnd now it\u2019s my great pleasure to turn it over to the Vice President of the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The Vice President delivered remarks.)\n(A toast was offered.)\nPRESIDENT YOON:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Emhoff, Secretary Blinken, White House Cabinet Secretary Ryan, and distinguished guests:\u00a0 I extend the gratitude to you for inviting me to the heart of global diplomacy, the Department of State.\u00a0 With Vice President Harris, a fearless fighter, and with strong supporters of the ROK-U.S. alliance, it feels as though there is no obstacle that we cannot overcome.\u00a0 It is truly reassuring.\nI heard that the name of this building is the Harry S Truman Building.\u00a0 President Biden gifted me a plaque with President Truman\u2019s words that I keep on my office desk.\u00a0 He granted me this plaque last year in Korea, and the plaque reads, \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d\u00a0 This place reminds me of the devotion and responsibility for freedom and democracy.\u00a0 And as you are well aware, President Truman in 1953, when communism attacked Korea, he dispatched U.S. forces and also put together the UN Security Council and came to our rescue.\u00a0 For the past 70 years, the ROK-U.S. alliance has developed into the most successful alliance in history on the soil that was fortified by the sacrifice of Korean War veterans.\u00a0 The Republic of Korea was able to rise from the ashes of war to become a country with global stature thanks to the power of the ROK-U.S. alliance.\nYesterday, President Biden and myself had an invaluable discussion on where the ROK-U.S. alliance should head towards.\u00a0 And based on our discussion, I plan to develop our alliance in a way that expands practical benefits for the peoples of both our countries.\u00a0 Our future will be brighter than the past.\u00a0 Our two countries will build peace through strength and lead the solidarity of freedom to promote peace in East Asia and the rest of the world.\u00a0 We will further strengthen our solidarity on cooperation in cutting-edge future technologies, including semiconductors, quantum, artificial intelligence, space, and cyber.\u00a0 And the young talents of our two countries will learn from one another and build a free, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 We will also work very closely together in response to pending global issues.\nVice President Harris, Secretary Blinken, and all distinguished participants gathered here today are the mainstays of the global comprehensive strategic alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States.\u00a0 We look forward to your continued support as the ROK-U.S. alliance marches forward.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas at a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Press Briefing Room", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "April 27, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Let me just say at the top that besides being delighted to be joined by Secretary Mayorkas, I also want to take this opportunity to say how thrilled I am that we have Matt Miller joining us as our new spokesperson.\u00a0 Probably have more to say on that in the days to come.\u00a0 But I couldn\u2019t be more pleased, not just for me but for the department and, indeed, for our country.\u00a0 An extraordinary professional I\u2019ve had the benefit of working with over many years.\u00a0 And I\u2019m equally grateful to Vedant Patel, who\u2019s done an extraordinary job as our spokesperson these past weeks.\nIn two weeks\u2019 time, the CDC\u2019s temporary Title 42 public health order will expire, as required by court order.\u00a0 President Biden and agencies across our government have been taking robust steps to prepare for the effect this will likely have on our immigration system, our partners in the region, and the movement of people across our hemisphere.\nSecretary Mayorkas will speak about the immediate impact of Title 42\u2019s expiration and our stepped-up enforcement efforts.\u00a0 But first, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to put this in the context of our broader approach to migration in the region, which we\u2019ll continue to build on in the coming weeks.\u00a0 It\u2019s an approach focused on making migration more safe, orderly, and humane, and on advancing the interests of the American people.\nIf you step back \u2013 and it\u2019s really important to do that \u2013 globally there are more than 100 million people on the move today, compelled to leave their homes in search of security and better lives.\u00a0 That is more people than at any time in recorded history.\u00a0 And in our own hemisphere, we are facing an unprecedented migration challenge.\u00a0 Long-term drivers like violence, corruption, lack of economic opportunity, continue to push people from their homes \u2013 problems that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, crises of governance, extreme weather events caused by the changing climate.\u00a0 Twenty million people are displaced across this hemisphere, and the strain on transit and host countries is high.\nMigration is the definition of a challenge that no country can solve alone.\u00a0 The magnitude, the range of drivers, the push and pull factors \u2013 all demand that we work together.\u00a0 That\u2019s why last summer President Biden brought together leaders from nations across the Western Hemisphere to agree to the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection; 21 countries have joined that declaration.\u00a0 The LA Declaration is an acknowledgment of our shared responsibility on migration, and our shared commitment to work together and leverage the strengths of partners across government, civil society, the private sector, humanitarian organizations, multilateral organizations, all coming together to address this challenge.\nSo let me highlight some of the ways the United States is working with our partners in the region on migration so as to take, among other things, pressure off our borders by giving people alternatives to making a hazardous journey to seek asylum in the United States.\nOf course, fundamentally we\u2019re working to tackle the root causes of migration so that people don\u2019t have to leave their homes in the first place.\u00a0 That includes investing and redirecting and mobilizing resources toward greater economic opportunities, as we\u2019ve done through the more than $4.2 billion in private sector commitments that Vice President Harris has helped to secure for northern Central America.\u00a0 These investments by businesses and social enterprises will sustain and create jobs, connect people to the digital economy, expand access to financing, provide training and education for young people and workers, and improve economic livelihoods across the region.\nWe\u2019re also investing in economic opportunity through the nearly $1.2 billion that we provided in humanitarian assistance across the region last year, and through initiatives like our commitment to work with our partners to train and equip 500,000 local healthcare workers across the hemisphere over the next five years so that more people can get quality care in their own communities.\u00a0 All of these investments will help people feel that they have a future in their own communities.\nNow, of course many of these investments can take time to bear fruit.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working in parallel on critical collaborations and initiatives with partners in the hemisphere to have a more near-term impact.\u00a0 First, we\u2019re supporting host countries as they provide legal protections and assistance to refugees and migrants so that they can thrive in their new communities.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that by delivering funding to schools, health facilities, and other providers of support to migrants, funding the staffing and capacity-building of local asylum centers and systems, and supporting registration and documentation efforts so that individuals can gain and demonstrate legal status, which is critical for access to work, to schools, to social services.\nOur partners in turn are doing extraordinary work in this area.\u00a0 Colombia, for example, has given 10-year temporary protected status to approximately 2.5 million Venezuelans, allowing them to work, to study, to access public services.\u00a0 Ecuador, Costa Rica, Belize are also undertaking similar efforts to regularize migrants from Venezuela and Nicaragua, as well as Peru.\u00a0 We see efforts as well to forgive existing migrant overstay fines, effectively removing one of the largest barriers to regularization.\u00a0 Brazil\u2019s \u201cOperation Welcome\u201d helped over 100,000 Venezuelans voluntarily resettle in places where they have greater economic opportunity.\u00a0 Mexico and Canada are increasing the number of people that they welcome on a humanitarian basis.\nWe\u2019re also working with partners in the hemisphere to accept repatriation flights, increase security forces along migration routes, provide more assistance to migrants and refugees.\u00a0 We continue to surge assistance to host countries throughout the hemisphere to help integrate refugees and migrants, and increase humanitarian aid and protection for vulnerable populations.\nSecond, we\u2019re announcing a 60-day surge of urgent assistance to regional partners to enhance security, to counter smuggling \u2013 an effort that Ali will share more about in a few moments.\u00a0 We\u2019re also working to counter disinformation being spread by traffickers and other bad actors, including by expanding our paid and earned media outreach to high out-migration communities and migrant routes through channels potentially reaching upward of 85 million people \u2013 so that people who want to migrate have accurate information about how to do so legally and safely, and know the dangers of putting themselves in the hands of traffickers.\nThird, we\u2019re significantly expanding access to lawful pathways for migration for those in need, including the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.\u00a0 For too many people in too many places, these pathways feel far from reach.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working to create more opportunities, and to make them more accessible.\u00a0 The United States welcomed six times as many refugees from Latin America and the Caribbean in 2022 than during the previous year.\u00a0 We\u2019re on track to more than double those arrivals in 2023.\nAnd in January, President Biden committed to welcoming 30,000 individuals every month from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, and Nicaragua through a parole program.\u00a0 Irregular migration from those four countries fell by more than 97 percent within the first month \u2013 because people now have a legal and safe pathway.\u00a0 That means tens of thousands of people are no longer making the perilous overland journey to our border, or putting themselves at the mercy of abusive smugglers.\nWe\u2019re partnering with both national and international NGOs to connect the most vulnerable populations \u2013 including religious minorities, political dissidents, LGBTQI+ persons, and survivors of gender-based violence \u2013 to expedited resettlement processes.\nWe\u2019re developing new ways to increase the scope and effectiveness of our migration system, like Welcome Corps, which \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 allows American individuals to sponsor refugees.\nAnd soon we will stand up Regional Processing Centers in select locations in the region.\u00a0 I want to thank Colombia and Guatemala specifically for their role as excellent partners of the United States in these efforts.\u00a0 These centers will be operated by international organization partners and improve qualified individuals\u2019 access to accelerated refugee resettlement processing, family reunification, and labor pathways in the United States.\u00a0 They will also be a referral point for lawful pathways as well, as well as humanitarian and refugee protections in other countries, like Canada and Spain.\nThese centers will take a hugely important step to prevent people from making the dangerous journey to the border by providing a much safer legal option to migrate that they can pursue in and from their own countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new and innovative approach that does right by people who want to migrate, and that enhances security and stability in the region.\nLater today, I\u2019ll have a chance to travel to Denver for the Cities Summit of the Americas, where we\u2019ve convened leaders to talk about how governments can better deliver for their people.\u00a0 And that mission is at the heart of the migration challenge:\u00a0 How can we all work together, as we are, to provide the foundation for better, more secure, and more hopeful futures for all our citizens?\nWith that, let me turn it over to Secretary Mayorkas.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 As the Secretary described, this is a hemispheric challenge that demands hemispheric solutions.\u00a0\u00a0 Working with our neighbors in the region, we can and will reduce the number of migrants who reach our southern border.\u00a0 The Regional Processing Centers announced today will be a critical addition to the programs and processes DHS has in place for qualifying individuals to obtain authorization to enter the United States before arriving at our borders.\nThis is particularly important because we have a humanitarian obligation to cut the smugglers out.\u00a0 We have seen a dramatic rise in the reach, sophistication, and cruelty of the smuggling organizations over the past ten years and the challenges that presents.\nThe comprehensive plan we have developed and are executing takes this reality into account.\u00a0 We are building lawful pathways for people to come to the United States without resorting to the smugglers.\u00a0 At the same time, we are imposing consequences on those who do not use those pathways and instead irregularly migrate to our southern border.\nThis plan has proven effective.\u00a0 Building on the success of Uniting for Ukraine, we created parole processes for qualifying Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, and we expelled individuals from these countries who sought to enter at our southern border.\u00a0 We have seen a high degree of interest in these parole processes and a dramatic drop in encounters from these nationalities.\u00a0 Overall, the number of Border Patrol encounters in March 2023 was down 23\u00a0percent compared to March of last year.\u00a0 When people have safe and orderly pathways to come to the United States and face consequences for failing to do so, they use those pathways.\nAfter May 11th, our court-compelled use of Title 42 will end and we will once again process all migrants under Title 8 of the United States code.\u00a0 This is a longstanding immigration enforcement authority that multiple administrations \u2013 Republican and Democratic alike \u2013 have used to process individuals.\u00a0 It carries stiff consequences for irregular migration, including at least a five-year ban on reentry and potential criminal prosecution for repeated attempts to cross unlawfully.\u00a0 The return to processing migrants under Title 8 authorities will be swift and immediate.\nWe have been preparing for this transition for more than a year and a half.\u00a0 Notwithstanding those preparations, we do expect that encounters at our southern border will increasing, as smugglers are seeking to take advantage of this change and already are hard at work spreading disinformation that the border will be open after that.\u00a0 High encounters will place a strain on our entire system, including our dedicated and heroic workforce and our communities.\nThe smuggler\u2019s propaganda is false.\u00a0 Let me be clear:\u00a0 Our border is not open and will not be open after May 11th.\nToday, we are announcing the expansion of our plan to build lawful pathways and to impose consequences for failure to use those pathways.\nFirst, the Department of Homeland Security is proud to work with the State Department in establishing the Regional Processing Centers that Secretary Blinken described.\u00a0 We are dedicating specially trained refugee officers to the centers.\u00a0 They will interview applicants for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and provide for the swift processing of a greater number of individuals.\u00a0 In addition to refugee processing, migrants may be screened at these centers and referred to pursue additional pathways to the United States or to other countries for which they may be eligible.\nSecond, we are streamlining the long-established family reunification parole processes for Cubans and Haitians so that individuals from these countries with approved family-based petitions can more quickly reunite with their families here in the United States.\nThird, I have directed my team to develop family reunification processes that will extend this well-recognized model to certain individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Colombia.\u00a0 More information about these processes will be available by May 11th.\nFourth, we will continue the successful processes we announced in January.\u00a0 Through our CPB One mobile app, we will enable individuals to schedule more appointments at ports of entry, consistent with Title 8 processing.\u00a0 The Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela parole processes, as well as the corresponding returns to Mexico for those without a legal basis to remain will continue.\nAt the same time, we are imposing consequences for individuals who do not use our lawful pathways.\nBeginning on May 12th, we will be \u2013 we will place eligible individuals who arrive at our southern border in expedited removal proceedings.\u00a0 Those who arrive at our border and do not have a legal basis to stay will have made the journey, often having suffered horrific trauma and having paid their life savings to the smugglers, only to be quickly removed.\u00a0 They will be removed most often in a matter of days in just a few weeks.\nUnlike the Title 42 public health authority, the penalty for being removed from the United States under Title 8 through expedited removal and other immigration laws we will be enforcing is not just removal.\u00a0 An individual who is removed is subject to at least a five-year ban on admission to the United States and can face criminal prosecution for any subsequent attempt to cross the border illegally.\nWe will process eligible single adults for expedited removal while they are in our Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\u00a0 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will be conducting any credible fear interviews.\u00a0 We have expanded our holding capacity and set up equipment and procedures so that individuals have the ability to access counsel.\u00a0 We have digitized processes, surged personnel, and with the cooperation of partner governments increased return flights.\u00a0 We are ensuring that removals are accomplished fairly, efficiently, and quickly.\nFamilies have always presented unique challenges within our immigration system, particularly for an administration like ours that priorities family unity and opposes family separation.\u00a0 Like single adults, families will be placed in removal proceedings, including expedited removal.\u00a0 We are currently focused on utilizing the full spectrum of our Alternatives to Detention Programs, including GPS monitoring and enhanced supervision, such as curfews and expanding case management services.\u00a0 This will be coupled with more stringent measures for those who do not comply.\nThe same principle will apply to single adults and families.\u00a0 They will have an opportunity to seek protection or other relief from removal.\u00a0 If they receive a final order of removal, we will enforce the law, and they will be removed.\nIn addition to our land border, we will continue to confront the challenge of migration on our seas.\nSince we announced our parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, we have made it clear that those who arrive at our southern border are not eligible for the parole processes.\u00a0 We are announcing today that that ineligibility will now extend to individuals who take to the seas and are interdicted trying to arrive at our maritime borders.\u00a0 We have seen too many people \u2013 families, women, children \u2013 perish in the rough seas.\nWe have increased the presence of our United States Coast Guard to interdict migrants trying to reach the United States by sea.\u00a0 We have saved countless lives, and we have returned the migrants to their home countries.\u00a0 That will continue.\nIn addition, we are finalizing the regulation that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security jointly proposed earlier this year.\u00a0 That proposed regulation will incentivize individuals to avail themselves of lawful, safe, and orderly pathways, and disincentivize dangerous border crossings by placing a new condition on asylum eligibility for those who fail to use those pathways.\u00a0 The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security aim to have the rule finalized by May 11 and will swiftly implement it.\nThe work we have been performing to prepare for post Title 42 continues, as I have previously outlined in our six-pillar plan.\u00a0 We are surging resources to our border, modernizing processes, attacking the smuggling organizations with unprecedented law enforcement focus, strengthening our immigration enforcement tool of expedited removal, working to increase information sharing and resources \u2013 having distributed over $130 million this fiscal year with 290 more to be awarded in the coming weeks \u2013 for local communities and their non-profit organizations.\u00a0 We are partnering with nations in the region to address the challenges of unprecedented migration throughout the hemisphere.\nFor example, two weeks ago we reached a trilateral agreement with Colombia and Panama to attack the smugglers who falsely coax people into the treacherous terrain of the Darien.\u00a0 We initiated a 60-day coordinated campaign with Panama and Colombia to prevent the incredibly dangerous humanitarian situation of migrants traversing the Darien jungle.\u00a0 We have made more than 10,000 smuggling arrests since April of last year and seized more than $47 million in smugglers\u2019 illegal property and finances.\u00a0 The Canadian commitment to accept an additional 15,000 migrants was part of a complementary effort to create lawful pathways.\nEveryone agrees \u2013 everyone agrees \u2013 our immigration system is outdated and badly broken.\u00a0 We must tackle the challenges before us together.\u00a0 This includes the potential for increases in migration after May 11 and the strain it will place on our communities, our workforce, and our system.\nThat\u2019s why today we notified Congress of our intent to reprogram funds within our budget to support other emerging requirements across DHS.\u00a0 This reprograming of existing funds will not meet our longer term needs for securing our border and enforcing our laws.\u00a0 The administration requested $4.9 billion for these requirements but received only $2.7 billion in the funding bill passed this December.\u00a0 While the department is prudently utilizing the limited funding Congress has provided to prepare for the post-Title 42 environment, this notification of repurposing existing funds is only a fraction of what we will ultimately need.\nWe know smugglers will seek to take advantage of the end of Title 42 and that the first few weeks will be challenging, but I have full confidence in the dedicated men and women of DHS.\u00a0 We will do all we can to manage our border and increased encounters in a safe, orderly, and humane way.\u00a0 We are working with our regional partners.\u00a0 We are going after the smugglers.\u00a0 We are surging resources to the border.\u00a0 But we cannot do everything that we need to do until Congress provides the needed resources and reforms.\u00a0 We call on Congress to provide the resources we need to continue our work.\u00a0 We stand ready to work with Congress to pass desperately needed reform to our immigration and asylum system.\u00a0 In the meantime, we will continue to do our part, implementing the approach we have described here today.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We will take a couple questions.\u00a0 I see we have a special guest today.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you want to ask the secretaries first.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 It\u2019s Take Your Children to Work Day, and we\u2019d happy \u2013 happy to take a question from you, if you have one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Or you can whisper to Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Well, I think she wanted to ask about the geopolitical and strategic implications of the U.S.-China-Russia rivalry, but that\u2019s a little bit off topic.\u00a0 Instead, she had a joke she wanted to tell, but I don\u2019t \u2013 not sure if she\u2019s got a little bit of stage fright.\u00a0 So let me go ahead and start.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Go ahead, Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 One, for either of you, on the Regional Processing Centers, do you have a target, an estimate, of how many people will be able to \u2013 the capacity for these, like per week or per month?\u00a0 And whether you do or not, if you think that they will be so successful and are truly new and innovative, why hasn\u2019t this been done before?\nAnd then secondly, for Secretary Blinken, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any updates on the Sudan evacuation or non-evacuation situation in terms of the State Department.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Do you want to start, Ali?\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 Happy to.\u00a0 So this is a process that will scale up over time.\u00a0 We are going to begin in collaboration, of course, with the State Department and our partner countries to begin several thousand each month, 5-6,000 plus each month individuals processed, a material impact on the decision-making of people who are seeking relief in a country.\u00a0 The whole model is to reach the people where they are, to cut the smugglers out, and to have them avoid the perilous journey that too many do not make.\u00a0 But we are beginning in Guatemala and Colombia.\u00a0 We are beginning at the level that I described and we will scale up.\u00a0 We are incredibly proud of the fact that we negotiated this agreement with those foreign countries and we hope to expand beyond there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Ali.\u00a0 And Matt, just to add one point on that, I think as this effort moves forward and we establish it, my expectation would be that even beyond the numbers of people who might be processed in a given month, other people, having \u2013 seeing that this is now a way to access legal pathways to the United States that doesn\u2019t require them to, again, take the hazardous journey to our border and to put themselves in the hands of smugglers, and then to come only to be turned away in any event, my expectation would be that many other people beyond those who are actually being processed in a given month will stay put and wait to avail themselves of this additional way of accessing legal pathways.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We have to build it out and we\u2019re very actively working on doing that.\nAs to why this hasn\u2019t been done before, well, I mean, it\u2019s like any good idea.\u00a0 You can say, \u201cGee, why didn\u2019t we think of this before?\u201d\u00a0 But the fact is we\u2019re working on it now, and we\u2019re working to make it real and effective.\nOn Sudan, just a few things.\u00a0 First, we are very actively working to extend the ceasefire.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a 72-hour ceasefire, which like most ceasefires is imperfect but nonetheless has reduced violence.\u00a0 And that\u2019s obviously created somewhat better conditions for people in Sudan.\u00a0 It\u2019s also enabled some humanitarian assistance to continue to move around.\nBut we want to make sure that, if possible, this is extended.\u00a0 We\u2019re very actively engaged on that.\u00a0 I hope and expect to have more information on that in the coming hours.\u00a0 And the focus, again, is on extending the ceasefire and making sure there is humanitarian access.\nWith regard to American citizens in Sudan, a few things to be said about that.\u00a0 We are providing the best possible advice that we can to anyone asking for our assistance about conditions, about safety, about security, so that they can make decisions with the most information possible about what they want to do, whether they want to stay, whether they want to try to go.\nAs you know, the vast majority of American citizens who are in Sudan are dual nationals, most of whom have made their lives and livelihoods in Sudan for years, decades.\u00a0 So these are very challenging decisions for people to make.\u00a0 But we\u2019re in contact with Americans who have registered with us in one way or another, and very active contact.\nWhat\u2019s happened over the last 72 or so hours is that the reduction in violence that we were able to achieve through the ceasefires that we helped produce has allowed partners and allies, in coordination with us, to conduct some aerial evacuations.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing important logistical support to these efforts.\u00a0 This is a collaborative process and we have managed to direct many Americans who have \u2013 were seeking to leave to that evacuation process so that they could, along with other nationals, take advantage of it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s ongoing.\nAt the same time, what happens in these situations is you have people who are not all at once\u00a0\u2013 everyone making a decision in a given moment, at a given time, about what they\u2019re going to do or not do.\u00a0 This changes over time.\u00a0 So people who today think that they\u2019re going to stay put may decide next week, next month, that they want to leave.\nWhat we need to do and what we\u2019re working to establish is a sustained process for enabling people to leave, assuming that the conditions that we see now are maintained, by which I mean on the one hand, yes, a ceasefire, however imperfect, but also ongoing violence, confrontation between the two rival military groups, et cetera.\nAs we\u2019ve looked at this, we believe that the best way to have an enduring capability to help people leave Sudan, if that\u2019s what they so choose, is overland.\u00a0 And we are working to establish a process that would enable people to move overland to a place where they can more easily exit the country \u2013 in all likelihood, Port Sudan.\u00a0 So that\u2019s under very active development, and again, that will be the most effective way to have a sustained process, a sustained mechanism, an enduring capability to enable people to leave if that\u2019s the choice they make.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Tracy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A couple of technical questions and then something broader for either of you.\u00a0 Following up on the regional centers, how many more countries are you negotiating with to set up centers to add them down the line?\u00a0 You have set a goal, I think you said, of doubling the number of refugees to be admitted.\u00a0 Is that realistic given the huge backlog, the enormous demand, and how long it does take to scale up to the 6,000 a month or whatever it is?\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering how many more people will really be helped in these new measures.\nSecretary Mayorkas, you said something I didn\u2019t quite get about family detention.\u00a0 Will entire families now be detained?\u00a0 Is that the idea?\nAnd finally, for Secretary Blinken, you mentioned the global aspect of immigration, and so I wanted to ask about Russians who\u2019ve been coming to the United States seeking asylum, saying they\u2019re fleeing conscription.\u00a0 Many of them are minorities, and it seems like their cases are being turned down.\u00a0 Many have been detained by ICE and a few that we know of have been deported back to Russia.\u00a0 So why is that not a \u2013 why do they not have a credible fear case?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 So let me \u2013 I can take the questions, if I may.\u00a0 So the issue of credible fear, the determination of credible fear is a very case-specific, individualized determination.\u00a0 Our very experienced asylum officers make those determinations based on the facts presented to them as well as their background information with respect to the country conditions.\u00a0 And so they evaluate the claims based on the people before them and the case that those individuals present.\nWe are indeed in discussions with other countries to expand the Regional Processing Centers, and they will have a significant impact on the migratory decisions of individuals in the region, and our parole processes really communicate that fact quite powerfully.\u00a0 People don\u2019t want to place their lives and their life savings in the hands of ruthless smugglers.\u00a0 If they have a lawful, safe, and orderly pathway to come to the United States or another destination country \u2013 like Canada or Spain, as Secretary Blinken mentioned \u2013 they will avail themselves of those lawful pathways.\u00a0 That has proven true through our parole processes and other lawful pathways that we have implemented to date.\nThat is especially true when, if they do take that perilous journey and happen to survive, because all too many do not, they will find that the border is not open and they are subject to removal.\u00a0 And removal will occur in the expedited removal context swiftly, in a matter of days or just a few weeks.\nThe Regional Processing Centers will indeed make a big difference because we are surging asylum officers to work with the international organizations \u2013 the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration \u2013 to screen people very quickly.\u00a0 We are going to be delivering efficiencies in the refugee screening process to move that process more rapidly than before.\u00a0 This is going to have a material impact in a number of ways.\u00a0 One, we will provide relief for a greater number of people; and two, an even greater number of people will wait to avail themselves of this pathway because of its magnitude and the consequence of not doing so.\nWe have no plan to detain families.\u00a0 As I mentioned, we will be employing alternatives to detention, including some innovations in that regard, and we will on a case-by-case basis use enhanced alternatives to detention as warranted.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Camilla.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 The \u2013 my understanding is that the U.S. intends to continue deporting Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans to Mexico if they crossed the southern border unlawfully.\u00a0 So do you know how many migrants or deportees Mexico has agreed to accept, if any?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think Mexico has spoken about it publicly.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 To date \u2013 to date, Mexico has agreed to accept up to 30,000 expulsions under Title 42 per month.\u00a0 That is a decision that they have made.\u00a0 We intend in a post-Title 42 environment, when we are using expedited removal \u2013 our Title 8 of the United States Code authorities \u2013 we intend to return individuals to Mexico from those nationalities.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Leon.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Just a technical question on these regional centers, if I may.\u00a0 If I understood you correctly, you said they were being \u2013 they would be operated by international partners.\u00a0 Are you outsourcing the immigration process?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start with that.\u00a0 No, the point here is to do the following:\u00a0 It\u2019s to take advantage of the fact that international partners have physical locations in a number of countries where they are doing very, very important work, and to be able to bring some of our own officers and experts into these centers so that people can come to them and explore whether they are eligible for one of the various legal pathways to come to this country, whether it\u2019s as a refugee, whether it\u2019s for family reunification, whether it\u2019s for a labor pathway.\u00a0 And that means that it\u2019s a lot easier for people who are contemplating coming to determine from their own countries whether they have a legal pathway to do that, so it\u2019s making legal pathways much more accessible.\nAnd as Secretary Mayorkas was saying, as this gets up and running and as people see that there is now a more accessible way to determine whether they are eligible to come to the United States through a variety of pathways, we believe that that will take significant incentive away for people to instead make this incredibly hazardous journey to the United States, put themselves in the hands of smugglers, encounter all the terrible dangers that we know they encounter along the way in an effort to pursue asylum, and in any event not get in.\nSo that\u2019s the idea.\u00a0 But no, it is reliant on our own people to share the information and to do some prescreening of individuals who come to these centers.\nAnything you want to \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Have you discussed with Colombia about returning migrants?\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\n\n"}, {"url":

everyone, and a very warm welcome to my friend the Cabinet Secretary Mutua.\u00a0 Alfred, very good to have you here, and I really appreciate the good, productive conversation that we had a short while ago.\nHowever, before I turn to that and to the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Dialogue, which is underway today, let me just share a brief update on Sudan.\nOn Saturday, I directed the temporary suspension of operations at Embassy Khartoum, and we conducted a successful operation to safely evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel and their dependents.\nI want to reiterate my appreciation for the leadership of Ambassador John Godfrey and the entire embassy team who managed the consolidation of our people and the necessary preparations for the evacuation under a very fluid security situation, even as they were tirelessly working to broker an Eid ceasefire.\u00a0 I could not be prouder of our team, most of whom are now en route back to the United States.\nI especially want to express my gratitude to Secretary of Defense Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Milley, and the men and women of the U.S. military who executed the evacuation operation with their usual extraordinary precision and skill.\u00a0 They once again demonstrated that they are the finest in the world.\nA decision to suspend operations at the embassy, remove our personnel from their assigned post, is among the most difficult that any Secretary has to make.\u00a0 But my first priority is the safety of our people, and I determined that the deteriorating security conditions in Khartoum posed an unacceptable risk to keeping our team there at this time.\nI want to be clear that even as we have temporarily suspended operations on the ground in Khartoum, our diplomatic and consular work in Sudan continues.\u00a0 Indeed, in just the last 36 hours since the embassy evacuation operation was completed, we\u2019ve continued to be in close communication with U.S. citizens and individuals affiliated with the U.S. Government to provide assistance and facilitate available departure routes for those seeking to move to safety via land, air, and sea.\nThis includes Americans who are traveling overland in the UN convoy from Khartoum to Port Sudan.\u00a0 We also continue to coordinate with allies and partners who are conducting their own operations, and to leverage those efforts to include Americans.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking further steps to support Americans and are exploring options to return the diplomatic and consular presence to Sudan as soon as possible.\nWe also continue to engage directly with General Burhan and General Hemedti to press them to extend and expand the Eid ceasefire to a sustainable cessation of hostilities that prevents further violence and upholds humanitarian obligations.\u00a0 The Sudanese people are not giving up on their aspirations for a secure, free, and democratic future; neither will we.\nThe United States will work with all parties, in coordination with regional and international partners, to bring an end to the fighting and a return to the transition to a civilian government.\nKenya, under President Ruto, has been a strong partner in this effort.\u00a0 And indeed, Kenya is a security leader throughout the region.\u00a0 That\u2019s evident not only in its commitment to resolving the current crisis in Sudan, but also in its support for United Nations and African Union peacekeeping efforts and the counterterrorism mission in Somalia, in its partnership to reach the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Ethiopia, and in its stewardship of the Nairobi process to advance peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAnd over the last two years, its tenure on the UN Security Council, Kenya has consistently stood up for the UN Charter and focused members on addressing the humanitarian and human rights crises across the continent and beyond.\nBeyond peace and security, Kenya and the United States are partnering on a wide range of issues.\u00a0 And that\u2019s reflected in the breadth of topics that we\u2019re tackling in the Strategic Dialogue.\u00a0 One of the major focuses we had today is public health, an area in which Kenya is demonstrating its potential to be a regional and indeed a global leader.\u00a0 The United States is supporting Kenyan-led vaccine production, including through Moderna\u2019s $500 million investment in a new manufacturing facility near Nairobi, which will produce mRNA vaccines to tackle viruses from COVID-19 to Ebola, from RSV to HIV.\nKenya remains at the forefront of the global HIV response.\u00a0 Today that\u2019s nearly reached \u2013 and has nearly reached \u2013 excuse me \u2013 its 95-95-95 targets: diagnose 95 percent of all HIV\u2011positive individuals, provide anti-retroviral therapy for 95 percent of those diagnosed, and achieve viral suppression for 95 percent of those treated.\u00a0 That is a tremendous milestone that is saving countless lives, and we\u2019re proud to have supported this effort over two decades with PEPFAR as it\u2019s been operating in Kenya.\u00a0 Now, we\u2019re building on that success by moving to a Kenya-owned, Kenya-driven, and Kenya-funded framework that will position the country to achieve sustained HIV epidemic control by 2025.\nHealth security and food security are closely intertwined.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard loudly and clearly from African leaders that emergency aid cannot be the only solution.\u00a0 So we\u2019re investing in sustainable, long-term African food production.\u00a0 That includes our work, with the AU and the UN, to invest in nutritious, climate-resilient crops and develop climate-smart agriculture.\u00a0 And it includes mobilizing the private sector in that effort.\nPresident Ruto recently announced 14 investments valued at over $150 million by private firms in Kenya\u2019s agro-industrial productivity.\u00a0 In total, these new partnerships will create over 20,000 Kenyan jobs, boost incomes by \u2013 for more than 1 million smallholder farmers, and increase sales and exports by over $130 million \u2013 while, of course, dramatically increasing local crop production and reducing malnutrition.\nU.S. companies are eager to invest in Kenya\u2019s success.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to supporting U.S. investment in Kenya \u2013 particularly in key sectors like information and communications technologies, agriculture, renewable energy \u2013 which will help Kenya achieve its goal of reaching upper-middle income status by 2030, while creating jobs and opportunity for people in both our countries.\nFinally, we\u2019re discussing through the Strategic Dialogue how the United States can continue to support Kenya\u2019s democratic progress.\u00a0 Its recent and fair elections and orderly and peaceful transition of power are a model for the region \u2013 demonstrating the commitment of its people, civil society, and leaders to transparent governance that is accountable to its citizens.\nSo we have made a lot of progress, and we\u2019re proud of it, and we have a lot on the agenda today.\u00a0 And as with all of our Strategic Dialogues, particularly with Kenya, the work of today is also the work of the 364 days that follow.\u00a0 This is an effort that takes place day-in, day-out between our governments, between our officials, between our experts, but also between our private sectors, our civil societies, our citizens, building, strengthening a partnership between our countries.\nI want to thank the cabinet secretary for his commitment to advancing this agenda, and Alfred, the floor is yours.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I\u2019m very happy to be here with my team.\u00a0 And I want to thank you for the warm welcome that you have given to us and the hospitality, and this Strategic Dialogue that is very important for both our countries, and not just both our countries, but also the African continent.\nLet me start the way you finished, and that is the issue of democracy.\u00a0 Kenya prides itself to be a democratic country that believes in the rights of the people to be able to go to the ballot box and choose their leaders and to live in a stable country where there\u2019s economic growth.\u00a0 And we want to thank the United States for the support you\u2019ve given us over the years in ensuring that we have a democratic country.\u00a0 And we will continue expounding the views and the principles and philosophies of true democracy as it is and stability in the region.\nKenya is open for business, as we usually say.\u00a0 We are moving into an era where we are saying we want more trade, not aid.\u00a0 Kenya is well placed in the African continent to be a hub for American investors.\u00a0 In the African continent, we now have the African Continental Free Trade Area, with a population of 1.3 billion people.\u00a0 When you come and invest in Kenya, it means you\u2019re investing in the continent of Africa.\u00a0 You\u2019re able to supply your goods, you\u2019re coming from a hub that can able to help you.\u00a0 We have worked very closely with American companies, and we had a very good Chamber of Commerce meeting in Nairobi, where a raft of new initiatives were announced to enable people to be able to \u2013 American farms to be able to come and invest in Kenya.\u00a0 So welcome, Americans, to come and invest in Kenya as you continue.\nIn the area of our cooperation and Strategic Dialogue, you mentioned Moderna as a company that is about to break ground in Kenya.\u00a0 We welcome more companies to come to Kenya, because we\u2019ve always been very good partners, and we\u2019ll continue working well together.\nIn this Strategic Dialogue, I think we\u2019re also talking about issues of climate change.\u00a0 The reality is that it is not a matter of when but if the world has transitioned from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\u00a0 Kenya, we\u2019re at a good place and only 2 percent of our energy is renewable energy, using hydro, geothermal, solar, and wind.\u00a0 And we want to grow that to 100 percent by 2030.\u00a0 And we want to work with American farms and American Government towards supporting the production of green hydrogen, which is what the future will need.\nSo we have looked at the past.\u00a0 We have fossil fuels.\u00a0 We\u2019ve decided not to tap into them because the environment is very important.\u00a0 We have to protect now for future, otherwise the world will not be in a very, very good place.\u00a0 So we want to be able to work together in those many ways.\nWe\u2019ll be discussing many issues, ranging from security, peace in the region \u2013 as you know, Kenya has been quite involved in the mediation in Ethiopia, and also looking at what you can do for Democratic Republic of Congo.\u00a0 COVID has taught us that what happens in one part of the world will happen \u2013 will have an influence or an impact on what happens in the rest of the world.\u00a0 So we want to acknowledge the support we have been receiving, and the comradeship between us and the United States in terms of bringing peace to the region.\u00a0 And we are committed to be the peacemakers of the continent of Africa, if not the world, looking at silencing the guns, people sitting down and being able to work together.\nIt is in the same spirit we are talking about the Russia and Ukraine conflict where Kenya recognizes Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders, and we\u2019ve been calling for cessation of hostilities, and the steps that have been taken so far to tell others that you cannot roll back history.\u00a0 We\u2019re at a place we are by now; we have to move forward.\u00a0 You can\u2019t start claiming countries, or claiming countries that are part of you.\u00a0 Nostalgia is not the order of the day now.\u00a0 We need people to be respected, they need peace and security, and we have to have a system where we don\u2019t let things get out of hand.\u00a0 Because today it\u2019s Ukraine; what about tomorrow?\u00a0 What will it be?\nWe also are very happy about many things that are happening.\u00a0 But as they happen also, we are quite sad of what\u2019s happening in the Sudan.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been working closely with the Government of Sudan, trying to get to a place whereby we can have peace and stability.\u00a0 It is quite tragic that we have more bullets coming into Sudan or being used in Sudan than food.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a tragedy, because we see from where we sit a lot of international interference, a lot of other players trying to use Sudan as a playing field for whatever reason, for the gold in Sudan, for territorial strength and control of the region.\nAnd we\u2019re trying to ask \u2013 we are asking external forces to leave Sudan alone.\u00a0 As an African continent and the AU and intergovernmental organization called IGAD, we are trying to find solutions for Sudan.\u00a0 I know you\u2019ve pulled your teams out.\u00a0 Kenya is not pulling its diplomatic offices.\u00a0 We\u2019re not shutting them down because we want to have a presence as we negotiate.\nPresident Ruto is looking forward to going to Sudan as soon as it stabilizes and there is enough security to try and see how we can engage the leaders.\u00a0 We are trying to engage the two warring parties, we\u2019re trying to bring them to the table so that we can have a good end, to a cessation of the violence.\u00a0 And what we want is civilian rule eventually over there.\nPresident Ruto has offered Kenya to mediate the conflict and to restore civility and peace.\u00a0 And we are quite persuaded that a peacefully negotiated solution to the conflict in Sudan is within reach.\u00a0 And as always, we stand ready to make our contribution, and we\u2019ll be playing hand-in-hand with that.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll be able to work together and see what we can do.\nI want to thank you.\u00a0 There are many topics we can talk about.\u00a0 We look forward to welcoming you back to Kenya sometime soon, and we look forward to President Biden also visiting Kenya, and President Ruto coming back, and thus holding these meeting at presidential level as we continue to work.\nWhat I can assure you is that Kenya will remain a good partner, will remain a friend of the United States, and we\u2019ll be able to work in sync as we try to improve the world that we live in.\u00a0\u00a0 When it comes to issues of trade, when it comes to the issue of health, when it comes to the issue of peace and stability, when it comes to issues of humanity, we are all the same people and we want to have a good life while we\u2019re here.\u00a0 And if we can work together as friends, it will be very good.\nAnd at that note, I want to welcome Americans to visit Kenya.\u00a0 We don\u2019t get as many Americans coming to Kenya as they should.\u00a0 I think our elephants and lions are complaining that they don\u2019t see a lot of Americans in our national parks.\u00a0 So Kenya is a safe and happy place, and we welcome Americans to come down for safari where you actually get to interact with the animals as long as they don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t get too close.\u00a0 But they\u2019ll be happy to see you.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take three questions.\u00a0 First, we\u2019ll go to Cindy Spang from Voice of America.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, thank you.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 I have one question for you, Secretary Blinken, and several questions for both of you, please.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, do you have numbers of how many Americans remain in Sudan?\u00a0 And could you share any updates on their safety and well\u2011being?\u00a0 And what options are there for those who want to leave?\nAnd for both of you:\u00a0 Cabinet Secretary Mutua, you mentioned foreign involvement in Sudan.\u00a0 Could you elaborate on that, please?\u00a0 And have either of you seen direct or indirect involvement from Egypt or the United Arab Emirates?\u00a0 And if so, have you spoken to their leaders about that?\u00a0 And have you seen involvement by the Wagner Group, and you are \u2013 how concerned are you that Russia may fan the violence?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 First, in terms of American citizens in Sudan, as you know, in any country around the world, whether it\u2019s Sudan or anywhere else, we never know with any precision how many Americans may be there at any given time because Americans are not required to register with the embassy, with the government, either when they go, when they reside, or when they leave.\u00a0 So we don\u2019t have a good fix on the number of Americans who are there at any given time, including now.\nWe do know, of course, the number of Americans who have registered with us and with whom we\u2019re in very active touch, communication.\u00a0 And of those, I would say some dozens have expressed an interest in leaving, and as I mentioned just a few moments ago, even with the withdrawal of our embassy personnel from Sudan, our efforts to provide services to American citizens who are there \u2013 consular services, other services, advice \u2013 continues, and we\u2019re in regular communication with American citizens.\u00a0 We are looking to see how we can help them ensure their own safety.\u00a0 We have been working with allies and with partners to do as much as we can to enable them to find their way out if that\u2019s what they choose to do.\nNow, keep in mind as well that the overwhelming majority of American citizens in Sudan are dual nationals who have made their lives there, been living there for years, for decades, for generations, and many want to continue to do that.\u00a0 But for those who are seeking to leave, we\u2019ll continue to engage directly with them to see what we can do to help them, and as I said, with allies and partners as well to help facilitate their departure.\u00a0 And this is going to be an ongoing process.\nIn addition, we\u2019re looking at what options we have to perhaps resume a diplomatic presence in Sudan, including in Port Sudan; that\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 But conditions are very challenging and we\u2019re tracking that very carefully.\nJust to pick up on the second part of the question, look, on one level, a whole variety of countries are involved in Sudan, have been engaged there, and engaged in \u2013 to some extent in trying to help Sudan move forward with its transition to a civilian-led government.\u00a0 And we have been in touch repeatedly throughout this crisis with a variety of them.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken directly to counterparts in Saudi Arabia, in the United Arab Emirates; other members of our team have spoken to Egypt and other countries, the United Kingdom \u2013 all to the same end, which is trying to get a ceasefire, trying to get a more sustainable cessation of hostilities, and then trying to get the country back on track to the transition to a civilian-led government that it was on before the violence that erupted derailed that effort.\u00a0 And it remains vitally important that countries use whatever positive influence they have to try to move Sudan in that direction.\nWe do have deep concern about the engagement of the Prigozhin group, the Wagner Group, in Sudan.\u00a0 It\u2019s in so many different countries in Africa \u2013 an element that, when it\u2019s engaged, simply brings more death and destruction with it.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very important that we not see its further engagement in Sudan.\u00a0 And I know a number of countries are very concerned with that prospect.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I agree with you there with the last statement about all these groups coming in and destabilizing.\u00a0 Currently in Sudan, we are trying also to evacuate Kenyans who have been working and living in Sudan.\u00a0 We\u2019ve (inaudible) to a lot of requests by the international organizations, the UN particularly, and other countries to help evacuate some of their people and bring them to Kenya or get them out of Sudan because of current need to accompany, and so we\u2019ll be proceeding.\nBut it would be good if we can find a way of establishing a ceasefire, even for a few hours or even a half a day or a day, to enable people to be able to move, to enable food and supplies to be brought in to the \u2013 especially in the capital, Khartoum, and other places.\nIn terms of involvement and indirect and direct involvement of various groups, we\u2019ve been quite concerned by some of our friends in the Middle East as (inaudible) Russia and others who for a long time have been friendly to either one or the other side.\u00a0 And we are just saying that at this particular time, it is not a time to take sides in a war.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to be able to come together and bring them together because at the end of the day, peace has to prevail.\u00a0 And so it doesn\u2019t matter who you support; at the end of the day, we need to have the people of Sudan have stability.\nSo all these other interests, if they can just keep off and let us bring peace to Sudan, we do believe it is possible.\u00a0 And that is where we are working towards as Kenya, together with our partners.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t want to be talking to people who are being supported and armed more and given strength by outsiders who don\u2019t live in Sudan.\u00a0 We care about Sudan.\u00a0 As part of the African Union, we want to silence the guns in Sudan, want to find an African solution to African problems with the support of our friends.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t effectively do that if we are talking to groups that are being strengthened every day by the parties who believe that all they need to do is to fight to the end.\u00a0 There is no fighting to the end.\u00a0 At the end of the day, it\u2019s the local and the normal people who lose, not just their leaders.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Julian Pecquet from\u00a0The Africa Report.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Julian Pecquet of\u00a0The Africa Report,\u00a0Jeune Afrique.\u00a0 You mentioned, Secretary Mutua, about President Ruto\u2019s involvement with IGAD and the talks with the Sudanese, so I have a few questions.\u00a0 One of them is what are you hearing from the parties to the conflict?\u00a0 What are you telling them?\u00a0 What kind of progress are we seeing, are we making since the past week?\u00a0 Any progress on when the president might host the parties in Nairobi if he can\u2019t go to Sudan because of the security situation?\u00a0 And how are you working with the African Union, which has its own effort going on?\u00a0 Secretary Blinken perhaps can talk to what the U.S. can do to help with the African-led negotiations.\nEastern Congo is another conflict where foreign actors are working at cross-purposes.\u00a0 I wanted to ask if Kenya can be a meaningful force in the DRC.\u00a0 Are you willing to take on the fight to the M23, which is what the Congolese seem to want?\u00a0 And can you tell us what the latest is with negotiations to renew the mandate of the East Africa Community regional force?\u00a0 And here as well, what role can the U.S. play?\nAnd then finally, on trade, perhaps we can talk about agriculture specifically, which is a very big deal to the Kenyans, obviously.\u00a0 What kind of progress are we making in the bilateral talks on agriculture, and particularly U.S. GMO exports to your country?\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 As members of IGAD, we have decided to be at the forefront in finding a solution to all these problems.\u00a0 We do believe that we are at a good place because the two warring leaders are talking to us, so that\u2019s a good sign.\u00a0 They are not \u2013 they \u2013 when you talk \u2013 when they are being talked to, they\u2019re talking back, and we\u2019re able to open the channels of communication.\u00a0 The fighting is still going on in Sudan, but we just feel that at least we have an entryway.\u00a0 They have not locked themselves up and shut their ears to the world.\u00a0 They are listening to the world, and they know the pressure that is being felt around them.\nOur president is ready.\u00a0 We have said that Kenya is ready at any moment\u2019s notice.\u00a0 Even if our president may not be able to go there immediately, we are ready to start discussions, and that\u2019s a message we are communicating to them, is that send us part of your teams.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start talking about what needs to be achieved because there\u2019s a reason they are fighting.\u00a0 They are fighting because they can\u2019t agree about something and we need to be able to sort out what they can\u2019t agree about, find a common, agreeable ground and then be able to move forward.\u00a0 And this is also under the auspices of the African Union.\u00a0 The African Union had a ministerial meeting where they called cessation of fighting, where they called for dialogue, and so this is part of the process.\nWhat we are doing as Kenya is that we are not just going to wait.\u00a0 We are saying \u2013 we\u2019ve put \u2013 stuck our necks out and said, we can provide a solution.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been in this game for some time.\u00a0 We\u2019ve \u2013 kind of have a bit of experience in how these things are done, and we love the people of Sudan so much that we say that we are ready to commit ourselves to hosting a negotiation between the two of you, the two warring groups, and trying to find solution so that the innocent people of Sudan \u2013 great people of Sudan \u2013 who are suffering can have this burden lifted from them.\nIn terms of eastern Congo, yes, our troops are on the ground, and it\u2019s not about us fighting the M23.\u00a0 We are not there to fight M23 or to fight anybody.\u00a0 We are there to provide a corridor that allows the groups that are fighting the Congolese Government and the ones that are being fought by the Congolese Government to have a sense of security through there.\u00a0 That they can start \u2013 we can \u2013 they can start putting down their guns and getting to the table and be able to negotiate.\nIt is important to note that M23 has been in operation for over 30 years.\u00a0 It is not just a simple problem that just started yesterday.\u00a0 So we are working together, and the Nairobi processes are still \u2013 is still going on, process still going on.\u00a0 We have Nairobi 4 coming up, and so we are fully engaged.\u00a0 And they have different meetings being called this coming month to try and sort out the issue.\nIn terms of the regional force and extending, that\u2019s in the process, and we are confident that will be \u2013 Kenya is not planning to withdraw its troops until we find an amicable solution.\u00a0 And we want to thank our partners, the United States and others, for the promised support that we can be able to work together to ensure that that region is stable.\nMaybe you can take agriculture fast, then I can \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Alfred.\u00a0 Let me just add that in terms of our engagement in Sudan, first, we\u2019ve been deeply engaged directly with the parties.\u00a0 I have spoken to Generals Burhan and Hemedti on multiple occasions.\u00a0 We strongly support African-led efforts to help both mediate this crisis, to end the hostilities, and, as I said, get back on the \u2013 on track to transition to a civilian-led government.\u00a0 We participated in, I think, an important meeting by video conference that was convened by the chairperson of the African Union, Mr. Faki, just at the end of last week that included the secretary-general of the United Nations, that included virtually all of the stakeholders in Africa and beyond who have an interest in trying to help Sudan get back on track, and we continue to support those efforts.\nWe all have the same goal.\u00a0 We\u2019re all driving to the same place.\u00a0 That is a ceasefire that\u2019s genuinely durable, that turns into a full cessation of hostilities between the competing forces, and that resumes the very important negotiations that were underway to create a transition to a civilian-led government \u2013 negotiations that had produced very significant progress, including the agreed framework.\u00a0 So that is everyone\u2019s goal, and we\u2019ll use both our direct engagement as helpful and as appropriate, but also strongly in support of AU-led efforts to put this back on track.\nWith regard to the United States and Kenya and trade, I think first it\u2019s worth pointing out that it\u2019s up 20 percent over the last year.\u00a0 That in and of itself speaks volumes.\u00a0 And when it comes to agriculture, that\u2019s exactly one of the things that we focused on today in a variety of ways, and I think that\u2019s going to be also the product of the Strategic Dialogue that we\u2019re having today and that you\u2019ll hear more about when we conclude our conversations.\nOne of the things that we talked about \u2013 and this has been part of an ongoing conversation \u2013 is of course Kenya is on the receiving end of an acute food insecurity challenge, like many other countries in Africa and beyond.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen an almost perfect storm that\u2019s emerged \u2013 the combination of climate change, of COVID, and of conflict, including the Russian aggression against Ukraine \u2013 all of which have contributed dramatically to rising food insecurity in Africa and beyond.\nWe have been deeply and intensely engaged in meeting this challenge.\u00a0 If you go back to February of last year when Russia invaded Ukraine again, we\u2019ve provided since then about $13.5 billion toward building greater food security, including direct assistance to Kenya and to many other countries.\u00a0 The United States has provided about 75 percent of the United Nations appeal for Kenya when it comes to food security.\nBut for all of the efforts that we and other countries are making in partnership with Kenya and other friends to address the immediate crisis, we\u2019re equally focused on helping countries build sustainable, long-term, productive capacity themselves.\u00a0 That is fundamentally the answer to the challenge.\u00a0 And I think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity there, including in the work that we\u2019re doing with Kenya.\nOne aspect of that is making sure that, using remarkable technology that we\u2019ve developed over recent years, that two things are addressed: the health and strength of soil, and the resilience of seeds.\u00a0 We have the capacity to basically map soil anywhere to determine whether it\u2019s strong or not and needs help.\u00a0 We also have remarkable technology when it comes to seeds to make sure that they are much more resilient to climate change, to droughts, to extreme conditions.\u00a0 And this is one of the things that we\u2019re working on with Kenya, as well as building out the entire production infrastructure that\u2019s also vital to making sure that there\u2019s genuine food security.\nSo this is very much part of our dialogue.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of our ongoing conversation.\u00a0 And I expect you\u2019ll see more on that in \u2013 both today and in the months to come.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\u00a0 Just to add on to issues of agriculture, and this is where with the impact of climate change I think it\u2019s a lesson to all of us that we can\u2019t keep on relying on rainfed agriculture.\u00a0 So we have a massive program in Kenya of building dams so that we can be able to conduct irrigation \u2013 hold irrigation programs so that now when it rains \u2013 it doesn\u2019t rain at least over there, but we still have to combat climate change.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we are planting 15 billion trees over the next few years to try and roll back what is happening.\nAgriculture in our region will only thrive if our farmers feel that they need to use it for economic reasons.\u00a0 Agriculture is not only for food, because when a farmer grows crops, that farmer uses \u2013 sells those crops, eats some and sells the crops and gets money for school fees, for building, for their car, et cetera, et cetera.\u00a0 So to us when it came to agriculture is also an economic issue, and that\u2019s why we are talking about value addition in the conversation we\u2019re talking about, getting our products here.\nI can say with no fear of contradiction that Kenya has the best tea and coffee in the world, and so we would like to be able to get more of that in the United States.\u00a0 And even our products \u2013 as we add value to our products, which means that with opening up of the markets means that our farmers get more money in their pocket as a motivation, they engage more into growing crops, and then it becomes a cycle that is able to continue.\u00a0 So it\u2019s about sustainability.\nMR. PATEL:\u00a0Final question. Kylie Atwood, CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thanks, you guys.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to start with Secretary Mutua, please.\u00a0 I just wonder if you could be a little bit more explicit for us in terms of how exactly Kenya has seen the Wagner Group\u2019s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Sudan.\u00a0 And you said that you believe that a peaceful resolution is in reach in Sudan.\u00a0 Why exactly do you feel that that is in reach?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, just questions on Sudan and then also on Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 First, on Sudan, have the convoys that have attempted to leave Sudan, that have American citizens who have joined them, run into any problems, any violence along the routes on the way out, as far as the U.S. knows at this point?\u00a0 And you mentioned potentially resuming a U.S. diplomatic presence at Port Sudan.\u00a0 Could that happen as soon as this week?\nAnd then just one question about a report this morning in\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0on the \u2013 on Ukrainians planning to attack Moscow earlier this year, on the one-year anniversary of the war.\u00a0 Based on that article, which comes from leaked classified U.S. Intelligence documents, it says that the country\u2019s military intelligence directorate agreed to postpone the strikes at Washington\u2019s request.\u00a0 Have Ukrainian officials ever discussed with you such potential plans for an attack on Moscow?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your message to any Ukrainian Government officials who may be privately advocating for such an approach?\u00a0 Thank you.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I think the position that Kenya holds is that we don\u2019t want interference by any group, may be Warner Group or individual countries that may be involved directly or indirectly.\u00a0 At this particular time, we\u2019d just like us to be left with Sudan without foreign and other groups interfering with the peace process.\nWe are quite encouraged about peace being found in Sudan very soon.\u00a0 This is because we\u2019ve had negotiations and mediation and a process in Sudan that has gone on for some time.\u00a0 And a few weeks ago, there was a very successful forum held in Khartoum, where there was an agreement basically in terms of returning the country to civilian rule, in terms of when the next elections will be held, in terms of the balance of how things will run.\u00a0 And it was only one item that there was a bit of disagreement, and it\u2019s not even a major item.\u00a0 It was all about the militia \u2013 the RSF joining the national military and how the timelines and the groups \u2013 which was a very, very small issue, and we are confident that that is an issue that you can tackle.\u00a0 Basically, it\u2019s a 2 percent that remains; 98 percent has already been done and agreed and signed to.\u00a0 That is why we are very confident that, once there\u2019s cessation, and with a bit of mediation, we believe that by the end of this year we\u2019ll be talking a different story about Sudan.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, in terms of the convoys, it\u2019s \u2013 look, it\u2019s a moving picture, and we\u2019ve seen to date different things.\u00a0 Some of the convoys that have tried to move people out, including all the way to Port Sudan but also to places closer into Khartoum, some of them have encountered problems, including robbery, looting, that kind of thing.\u00a0 Others not.\u00a0 But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking very, very carefully.\nTo the extent that we\u2019ve been able to facilitate Americans being folded into some of those convoys, we\u2019ll continue to do that.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also trying to provide the best possible advice we can to anyone asking for our assistance about conditions, about safety, about security, so that they can make their own decisions with the most information possible.\u00a0 But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking as carefully as we can, and of course we\u2019re in very close contact with a number of countries that are engaged in removing their personnel from Sudan to make sure that we know from them what they\u2019re experiencing, what they\u2019re encountering.\u00a0 All of that factors into the advice that we can provide and the decisions that we make.\nWhen it comes to resuming our own diplomatic presence in Sudan, look, that\u2019s going to be entirely dependent on the conditions in Sudan. \u00a0Again, something that we\u2019ll look at day-in/day-out, but I can\u2019t put a timeframe on it at all.\u00a0 It\u2019s really conditions dependent.\nAnd finally, the last part of your question:\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to comment on any purported intelligence documents that are being reported on in the press.\u00a0 Thanks.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 When it comes to what Ukraine does to defend itself against the Russian aggression, these are decisions for the Ukrainians to make.\nThank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-japanese-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken At a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "The Prince Karuizawa ", "location": "Karuizawa, Japan", "date": "April 18, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone. \u00a0Let me \u2013 let me start with the situation in Sudan. \u00a0For the past 36 hours, we and our partners have been focused on how to stop the widespread fighting in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. \u00a0Indiscriminate military operations have resulted in significant civilian deaths and injuries, and are recklessly endangering the Sudanese people, diplomats including U.S. personnel, and humanitarian aid workers.\nThis morning, I made calls to Generals Burhan and Hemedti, urging them to agree to a 24-hour ceasefire to allow Sudanese to safely reunite with their families and to obtain desperately needed relief supplies.\nI also underscored in both calls the responsibilities that Sudanese fighting forces bear for ensuring the safety and security of U.S. and other diplomats who are resident in Sudan, as well as for UN staff and other humanitarian partners. \u00a0If implemented successfully, a ceasefire for 24 hours can create a foundation to build upon for a more sustained halt to the fighting and a return to negotiations on a durable end to the hostilities.\nThe people of Sudan have made clear their democratic aspirations. \u00a0After months of talks, they were close to restoring a civilian-led government.\u00a0 We remain committed to helping them achieve that goal. \u00a0At the same time, we will take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of our people.\nNow, we just finished up a marathon couple of days, during which the G7 foreign ministers came together to address some of the most consequential issues confronting our countries and people all over the world.\nI want to thank our Japanese hosts and especially my friend Foreign Minister Hayashi for the warm hospitality and for his leadership.\nTogether, we have strengthened the centrality of the G7 as the steering committee of the world\u2019s advanced industrial democracies, and deepened ties with other countries around the world. \u00a0And together, we emerge from this ministerial more globally engaged than ever.\nA major theme of this G7 was how our nations can leverage our strengths to work with our partners to deliver better futures for people around the world, to focus on the issues of most concern to them in their daily lives. \u00a0And this means combining our political and economic muscle and our development dollars, yen, euros, and pounds to support countries on every continent in meeting their food, energy, climate, infrastructure, and technology challenges.\nIt means shaping a more inclusive international system \u2013 including with UN reform, making the international financial system more responsive to the actual needs of countries, and finding new formats for consultation that welcome more voices. \u00a0It means offering more countries better, more sustainable, and more equitable ways to prosper, while respecting their sovereignty. \u00a0From Central Asia to the Pacific Islands to Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, our goal is to offer leaders and citizens better choices \u2013 free from coercion, unsustainable debt, and malign influence.\nWe also discussed a range of challenges to our shared vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous international system. \u00a0The most immediate challenge, of course, is Russia\u2019s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.\nYesterday, we recommitted to Ukraine: with the security and economic support that it needs today to defend its sovereignty and people, and for the long term to ensure that Ukraine doesn\u2019t just survive, that it thrives \u2013 and that Russia is deterred from further aggression.\nThis includes continuing to tighten sanctions and export controls, putting that pressure on Russia to limit its ability to wage its war, cracking down on sanctions evaders wherever they hide, rejecting Moscow\u2019s nuclear blackmail, and ensuring accountability for war crimes.\nThe G7 from the get-go has led the world in galvanizing and sustaining support for Ukraine. \u00a0Now, as Ukraine prepares to launch a counteroffensive to take back its land, to liberate its people in occupied territories, to stop the missiles, bombs, and drones which continue to rain down daily on its civilians, we stand with Ukraine.\nAnd when the inevitable voices, led by a Russia that is losing its war of conquest, talk about avoiding escalation or call for Ukraine to stop reclaiming its own territory, we will remind the world who is the aggressor and who is the victim \u2013 who has 20 percent of its land occupied by enemy forces; whose children are being disappeared, and whose civilians are being killed and left in mass graves.\nAt the same time, Russia is again blocking Ukraine\u2019s grain from reaching the world, spiking food prices for people everywhere. \u00a0For the last few days, no ships have gotten out of Ukraine, and more than 50 have been blocked from going in to load up. \u00a0Countries around the world depend on this life-saving grain. \u00a0Russia is breaking its promises to them.\nWe also discussed China. \u00a0All of our nations have consequential relationships with Beijing, and a number of G7 colleagues have recently visited. \u00a0What struck me in hearing the readouts of those conversations is that we are resolved and united in the need for candid discussions with Beijing about its unfair trade practices, its actions that undermine the international rules that all nations benefit from, and the risks if it breaks its word and starts arming Russia. \u00a0And of course we\u2019re united in making clear to Beijing our opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo with Taiwan.\nWe\u2019re also equally committed, individually and collectively, to constructively engaging with Beijing if it chooses to contribute its efforts \u2013 to efforts to address shared global challenges. \u00a0That is what the world expects of responsible powers.\nAt this ministerial, we also focused on nuclear proliferation. \u00a0I\u2019m grateful to Japan for the high priority that it has placed on countering nuclear threats \u2013 including from the DPRK\u2019s dangerous ballistic missile launches; Iran\u2019s expansion of its nuclear activities, including the operation of advanced centrifuges and the accumulation of highly enriched uranium, for which it has no credible civilian explanation or purpose; Russia\u2019s New START suspension and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric; and the PRC\u2019s opaque and rapid build-up of its own nuclear arsenal. \u00a0These actions only strengthen our determination to address nuclear dangers.\nWe\u2019re also focused on the threat posed by synthetic opioids. \u00a0Our communique speaks to our collective commitment to developing and implementing solutions to this crisis, and we will continue to cooperate closely \u2013 indeed, we will strengthen that cooperation \u2013 addressing illicit financing, disrupting trafficking networks, supporting public health responses, and more.\nSo it\u2019s been a very productive and important few days which lay the groundwork for the Leaders Summit in Hiroshima in a month\u2019s time.\u00a0 And I commend to you the joint statement that we issued, or will soon issue, reflecting the work that we\u2019ve done.\nWith that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 All right, we\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Nike Ching from Voice of America.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Nike, how are you?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Inaudible.) \u00a0Thanks for the press conference.\u00a0 On Sudan, can you provide more details on reports that a U.S. embassy vehicle was targeted in Khartoum, which means (inaudible) divided?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your plan to ensure the safety and security of U.S. citizens and diplomats?\u00a0 Is there a plan to evacuate the embassy there given the newest developments?\u00a0 And if I may, do you support the calls from some senators to sanction generals of the two fighting military factions?\nAnd finally, if I may, on\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporter.\u00a0 Do you have more details on Ambassador Lynne Tracy\u2019s access to Evan Gershkovich given reports that a Moscow court is scheduled on Tuesday to hear an appeal on his case?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to Sudan, look, I\u2019m limited in terms of the details and what I can get into from here, but I can confirm that yesterday we had an American diplomatic convoy that was fired on.\u00a0 All of our people are safe and unharmed.\u00a0 But this action was reckless, it was irresponsible, and of course unsafe \u2013 a diplomatic convoy with diplomatic plates, a U.S. flag, being fired upon.\nIn the calls that I had this morning with Generals Hemedti and Burhan, I made very clear that any attacks, threats, dangers posed to our diplomats were totally unacceptable.\u00a0 This particular incident is still being investigated in terms of understanding exactly what happened.\u00a0 The initial reports that we have is that it was undertaken by forces associated with the RSF, and again, I made very clear in my conversation with General Hemedti that any attacks that endanger our diplomats are totally unacceptable, and I shared the same with General Burhan.\nWe have deep concerns, of course, about the overall security environment as it affects civilians, as it affects diplomats, as it affects aid workers.\u00a0 World Food Program had to suspend its operations; three of its people were killed.\u00a0 That potentially has terrible consequences for the Sudanese people, who are in desperate need of the assistance provided by the World Food Program.\u00a0 That only underscores the imperative of getting a ceasefire and putting Sudan back on the track that it was on, which was talks and negotiations toward the restoration of a civilian-led government.\nWe will continue to track this very closely and very carefully.\u00a0 My number one priority, of course, is the safety and security of our personnel.\u00a0 I\u2019m in very close contact with \u2013 as is my entire team \u2013 with Ambassador John Godfrey and our entire team in Khartoum.\u00a0 Again, I won\u2019t go into any details except to say that we are and will continue to take every responsible measure to make sure that our people are safe and secure.\nWe\u2019re also in very close coordination with other countries that have influence in Sudan.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been on the phone with counterparts from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, to make sure that we\u2019re coordinating carefully.\u00a0 Our team as well has been in very close contact with the African Union, with other international organizations \u2013 again, to make sure that everyone is coordinated and that we are channeling the shared determination among the international community to get to a ceasefire as quickly as possible and to put Sudan back on the track of talks, negotiations, again, to restore civilian-led government in Sudan.\nBut first things first, the imperative is getting quickly to a ceasefire so that the guns stop firing, people can move about safely, reunite with their families, get the assistance they need, and all of us can continue to engage in supporting Sudan as it makes its transition.\nWith regard to Evan Gershkovich, yes, Ambassador Tracy and our chief consular officer were able to see Evan in prison in Moscow.\u00a0 I can report, based on what Ambassador Tracy has said, that he is in good health and good spirits considering the \u2013 considering the circumstances.\u00a0 We continue to call for his immediate release from this unjust detention.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Tetsuo Shintomi with Kyodo News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I would like to ask on the nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation, which is of big interest among Japanese people.\u00a0 As you know, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida has expressed his hope to discuss on a world without nuclear weapons at coming G7 Leaders Summit.\u00a0 As you are wrapping up foreign ministers meeting here in Karuizawa, do you feel any tangible progress toward that end?\u00a0 And how do you think about the possibility of a world without \u2013 achieving a world without nuclear weapons despite all these challenges?\nAnd in addition, if I may, many local people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including a\u00a0Hibakusha, which is an atomic bomb survivor, are looking forward to a U.S. leader\u2019s visit to Hiroshima in May.\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering if you had any message to them.\nThank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, I should tell you that we had \u2013 during this G7 meeting we had dedicated sessions on specific issues, the most important issues on our agenda.\u00a0 And the final session that we had, dedicated session, was on arms control and nonproliferation, which in and of itself underscores the importance that the G7 attaches to it.\u00a0 And I have to praise Japan\u2019s leadership, as always, on this issue.\nWe, as G7 countries, are committed to maintaining and strengthening disarmament and nonproliferation efforts toward a more secure, stable, and safer world.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be convening, as you noted, at a leaders level in Hiroshima, which together with Nagasaki offers the most powerful reminder of the unprecedented devastation and immense human suffering that the people of Japan experienced as a result of the atomic bombings in 1945.\nThe overall decline in global nuclear arsenals has to continue and must not be reversed.\u00a0 If you look at the trajectory from the onset of the Cold War through to today, we\u2019ve seen that overall decline.\u00a0 And that can and should be achieved through a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach to arms control and nonproliferation.\nHaving said that, we also see some very significant challenges not just on the horizon but fully present, and we have to continue to work collectively to counter these challenges: Russia\u2019s suspension of the New START agreement, irresponsible nuclear rhetoric; the DPRK\u2019s dangerous ballistic missile launches and further development of its own nuclear program; Iran\u2019s expansion of its nuclear activities; and China\u2019s pursuit in a very opaque way of a rapid nuclear arsenal buildup.\nSo based on our conversations today, I can tell you that these actions only strengthen our determination to address nuclear dangers, and it\u2019s particularly why I\u2019m grateful to Japan for the high priority it\u2019s placed on this topic under its G7 presidency.\nI can also tell you that the President very much looks forward to being in Japan for the G7 leaders and in Hiroshima specifically, and I know he\u2019ll have much more to say when he\u2019s here, but it\u2019s something that he\u2019s very focused on and looks very much forward to.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg news.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary. \u00a0Chinse leader Xi Jinping has recently, obviously, made diplomatic waves both with the Saudi Arabia-Iran deal and its own proposal for peace in Ukraine.\u00a0 Just the other day, Brazil\u2019s president said the U.S. should stop encouraging war and start talking peace, and Brazil\u2019s foreign minister also criticized Western sanctions for taking an unnecessary toll on nations involved in the conflict.\u00a0 Do you think the Brazilian comments suggest that the U.S. is potentially losing the battle for public opinion on Ukraine in the Global South?\u00a0 And do you think it\u2019s time that Washington should meaningfully engage with China\u2019s peace proposal, even despite the reservations about it freezing Russia\u2019s territorial gains?\nAnd secondly, just on China.\u00a0 It\u2019s been weeks since Biden said he would try and speak with Xi, and there\u2019s still no clear plan for your own previously postponed trip to Beijing.\u00a0 Given your own G7 counterparts are visiting China and urging engagement, do you think it\u2019s time the U.S. started more substantive, meaningful engagement with senior Chinese officials or do you think Beijing\u2019s unwillingness to engage is holding that back?\nThanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, just speaking to the G7 itself and what I heard here and what we\u2019ve been discussing over the last few days, what I \u2013 what I heard, again, is remarkable convergence on concerns related to the PRC and on what we\u2019re doing to address those concerns.\u00a0 And I think some of you heard my counterparts speaking to that directly, and I\u2019d also invite you to read the joint statement that we put out that reflects very well the shared approach that we have to China \u2013 both the challenges it poses as well as the need for engagement that we all see and share.\nBut in general, over the past two years what I\u2019ve seen not just in Europe but also in Asia is much greater convergence on the approach to take to China, which for all of our countries is among the most consequential as well as complicated relationships that we have.\u00a0 We believe \u2013 the United States \u2013 that having lines of communication, being able to engage across the broad range of issues that animate the relationship, is important.\u00a0 And we also believe that countries around the world expect us to manage the relationship with China responsibly, and that starts with engagement, with having lines of communication.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what President Biden sought to reinforce in Bali when he met with President Xi, and my expectation would be that we will be able to move forward on that.\u00a0 But it does require China to make clear its own intentions in doing that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll look to see if they do so, but if they do so my expectation would be that we will find ways to engage as the presidents agreed during their Bali meeting.\nBeyond that, I\u2019m not going to speak to any individual countries.\u00a0 I can just say more generally with regard to Brazil that President Biden, President Lula had a very good meeting when President Lula visited the White House \u2013 I think his first or certainly among his very first visits to any country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 The final question, Ryo Kiyomiya from\u00a0Asahi Shimbun.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Welcome to Japan.\u00a0 I have several questions on Taiwan and engagement with the Global South.\nFirst, on Taiwan, French President Macron said in his interview that Europe must not be a follower of either the U.S. or China on Taiwan, and we heard that there was some discussions on this comment during the ministerial meeting.\u00a0 How much are you worried his comment may undermine global support for Taiwan?\u00a0 And do you think they represent perhaps a small victory for Xi Jinping in China\u2019s effort to divide Europe and the U.S. on foreign policy issues?\nAnd secondly, on the Global South, to address the challenges of Russia and China\u2019s influence in the developing world, how do you mean to offer an alternative to China by engaging more with the Global South?\u00a0 And also, what kind of role do you expect Japan to play in increasing engagement with the Global South?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to Taiwan, there is clear unanimity in the approach that we\u2019re taking with all of our G7 partners and many other countries around the world, and that is an expectation that any differences be dealt with peacefully and that neither side take any unilateral actions that would disrupt the status quo that preserves peace and stability.\u00a0 That is clearly what every single one of our G7 partners believes.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s reflected well in the G7 statement that we\u2019re putting out today.\u00a0 And again, a number of partners spoke directly to their views, to their countries\u2019 views, on the broader relationship with China and the more specific question of Taiwan.\u00a0 And as I said a moment ago, in my experience we actually have not seen greater convergence at any other time in the approach than we see now, both with Europe as well as with key countries in Asia.\nWith regard to what\u2019s called the Global South, I think if you look at the discussions that we had just over the last two and a half or three days, the vast majority of the time was spent on looking at the issues that are actually affecting people\u2019s lives around the world and focusing, as I said, on how we can leverage our strengths to deliver actual solutions on the issues that, as I said, are having an impact on the lives of people around the world as well as in our own countries.\nSo look at what we spent our time focused on and developing concrete action plans on: food security; energy and climate change; health security; building infrastructure that addresses the needs of countries around the world; catalyzing more investment from the private sector; broader and more inclusive economic growth; international financial institutions that actually respond to the needs of countries around the world.\u00a0 That was probably two-thirds of the discussion that we had over the last two and a half days, and I suspect that you\u2019ll see the leaders do the same when they meet in a month\u2019s time.\nAnd what this comes down to is that we as a G7, as individual countries, along with many other countries that are not part of the G7, want to spend our time, our focus, our resources on addressing these challenges and making it clear to countries around the world that this is not about asking or making them choose; it\u2019s about offering a good, indeed a better \u2013 a better choice.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve focused our attention on.\u00a0 Again, I invite you to take a look at the statement that we put out.\u00a0 I think it reflects it very well, and it\u2019s a very good prelude to the meeting that the leaders will have in a month\u2019s time.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY

everyone.\u00a0 So I have been long been looking forward to returning to Vietnam and making my first visit here as Secretary of State.\u00a0 I was here as deputy secretary in 2015 and 2016, but I am so pleased to be back today.\nA decade since the United States and Vietnam launched our Comprehensive Partnership, and nearly 28 years since we normalized relations, our nations have forged a relationship that is robust, dynamic, and consequential.\nI\u2019m here at the behest of President Biden to further broaden and deepen that partnership following the President\u2019s call with the general secretary last month and building on earlier high-level visits, including from Vice President Harris, Secretary of Defense Austin, U.S. Trade Representative Tai, USAID Administrator Power, and recently as well members of Congress.\nThroughout my engagements today, I focused on how the United States can continue to support Vietnam\u2019s success \u2013 which is good for the Vietnamese people, for Americans, and indeed for the entire region.\nOur countries are collaborating on an incredibly broad range of shared interests, and we believe that by supporting Vietnam\u2019s ambitions we advance our own, from the creation of American jobs and the strengthening of American businesses, to progress on the climate crisis that affects us all, to preventing pandemics.\nI also focused on how our countries can advance a free and open Indo-Pacific, one that is at peace and grounded in respect for the rules-based international order.\u00a0 When we talk about \u201cfree and open,\u201d we mean countries being free to choose their own path and their own partners and that problems will be dealt with openly; rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly; and goods, ideas, and people will flow freely across land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nIn my meetings with General Secretary Trong, with Prime Minister Chinh, with Foreign Minister Son, and External Relations Commission Chairman Trung, I discussed our work to promote broad-based prosperity in Vietnam and throughout the region, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 Vietnam has joined negotiations on all four pillars of IPEF, and that will help lead a race to the top on the issues that are shaping the 21st century economy, including supply chain resilience, the clean energy transition, digital connectivity, and that will benefit Americans and people across this region.\nWe discussed our mutual respect for ASEAN centrality and our close partnership through regional economic frameworks, including APEC, which the United States is proud to be hosting this year, and the Mekong-U.S.\u00a0 Partnership.\u00a0 We appreciate Vietnam\u2019s indispensable leadership in solving development challenges in the Mekong region that have been made worse by dam construction, climate change, and overfishing.\nWe\u2019re also growing our bilateral economic partnership.\u00a0 The U.S. is helping Vietnam double down on key reforms it\u2019s embraced \u2013 including on labor, intellectual property, fair trade \u2013 which have made it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\nWe believe that Vietnam can achieve its goal of becoming a connected, high-income country by 2045 by pursuing growth that lifts up all communities, while building resilience to adapt to climate change.\nWe know Vietnam is increasingly vulnerable to threats posed by the climate crisis.\u00a0 As Vietnam takes steps to become a leader on climate energy transition, the United States is investing in that tremendous potential.\nWe\u2019re launching new bilateral climate initiatives that were announced by Vice President Harris during her August 2021 visit to Vietnam, which do everything from conserving ecosystems and reducing emissions from rice farming in the Mekong Delta, to expanding a market-driven clean energy system and scaling up adoption of electric vehicles, to leveraging our private sectors to drive climate action.\nWe\u2019re also harnessing the power of regional frameworks like the Just Energy Transition Partnership.\u00a0 Vietnam recently joined that partnership.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to deploy $15.5 billion to help the country deliver on its ambitious Net Zero 2050 goal as well as the Japan-U.S.-Mekong Power Partnership.\nWe\u2019re also collaborating to build up Vietnam\u2019s public health capacity, including by establishing a national CDC here in Vietnam.\u00a0 We\u2019ve partnered closely to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, with the United States donating more than 40 million vaccine doses, followed by Vietnam\u2019s donation \u2013 following \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Vietnam\u2019s donation of millions of articles of PPE during the earliest part of the pandemic, when America was at a time of its greatest need.\u00a0 And I have to say this is a very powerful example of countries coming together and coming to each other\u2019s assistance when each of us needed it most.\nAs part of our bilateral security partnership, which is growing, we\u2019re finalizing the transfer of the third U.S. Coast Guard cutter to Vietnam, complementing a fleet of 24 patrol boats and other equipment, training, and operational facilities that we\u2019ve provided since 2016.\u00a0 All of these efforts bolster Vietnam\u2019s capacity to contribute to maritime peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nThe United States is committed to supporting a strong, prosperous, independent, and resilient Vietnam.\u00a0 And we respect Vietnam\u2019s right to shape its future under its own political system.\u00a0 At the same time, we continue to underscore how future progress on human rights is essential to unleashing the full potential of the Vietnamese people.\u00a0 That\u2019s the central focus of the U.S.-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue.\nFinally, the United States is committed to our ongoing work to address the legacies of the war, even as we focus on the future.\u00a0 This is a matter of trust, of commitment, and of duty.\nWe\u2019re continuing our joint efforts to clear unexploded ordnance.\u00a0 Next month, we\u2019ll complete the survey of the heavily bombed Quang Tri Province.\u00a0 We\u2019re making significant progress cleaning up dioxin hotspots from the war.\u00a0 Last month, we announced a new $73 million contract to treat contaminated soil and sediment at Bien Hoa Air Base.\nAnd we\u2019re continuing the important humanitarian work to account for those missing from the war, including by increasing Vietnam\u2019s capacity to identify its own missing and dead.\u00a0 We recognize the longstanding support of the Government of Vietnam to account for U.S.\u00a0 personnel lost during the war.\u00a0 Our reciprocal cooperation for ensuring families from both countries receive the closure they deserve remains vitally important.\nToday, we took another step to strengthen our relationship by breaking ground on our new embassy compound.\u00a0 When completed, our new embassy in Hanoi will be a state-of-art facility worthy of our ambitious vision for the future of our partnership and worthy of the American and Vietnamese people who work every day to make that vision a reality.\nWith that, I\u2019m happy to take some questions.\u00a0 Vedant.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll do four questions today.\u00a0 First question, John Hudson of\u00a0The Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, a three-part question on Vietnam if you\u2019ll indulge me.\u00a0\u00a0 You have underscored that the U.S. and Vietnam \u2013 the U.S. and Vietnam are aligned on a common view of free and Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 How does this square with Vietnam\u2019s recent crackdown on dissent?\nSecondly, advocacy groups say Vietnam deported several Russian residents who expressed opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\u00a0 And Vietnam earlier this year also voted to abstain from a UN vote to condemn the Russian invasion.\u00a0 Did you discuss Vietnam\u2019s position on the war with leaders today?\u00a0 And if so, what did you hear from them?\nAnd then lastly, from your discussion today, what ways does the U.S. and Vietnam share concerns about China\u2019s assertiveness in the region?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, John.\u00a0 So first, I am not aware of the deportations that you referenced.\u00a0 We did talk about Ukraine and about the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 Vietnam has a long history and relationship with Russia.\u00a0 We understand that and recognize that.\nAt the same time, I\u2019ve heard clearly from our Vietnamese interlocutors and I\u2019ve heard them state publicly their commitment and the importance that they attach to the basic principles that are also under threat by Russia\u2019s aggression, the principles at the heart of the UN Charter \u2013 territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence.\u00a0 Vietnam stands strongly for those.\u00a0 They\u2019ve made that clear.\u00a0 They\u2019ve said so publicly and they repeated that in conversation with us today.\nWith regard to human rights and the relationship that we have, this is a conversation that we regularly engage in.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve said to our counterparts, it\u2019s very important that we continue to speak directly, openly, candidly about our concerns.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly, exactly what we do.\nWe continue to seek progress on issues like freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of religion.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen, I think, positive steps taken in some areas, to include, for example, the respect for the rights of the LGBTQI+ community.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen important work that Vietnam has done with UNHCR on the right of stateless people, for example.\u00a0 But in these other areas we continue to have concerns that we\u2019ve shared.\nAs well, I think it\u2019s important that the space be expanded for nongovernmental organizations to be able to register, to operate without burdensome intrusion by the state.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve noted and we\u2019ve noted the important contributions these organizations make to issues that matter to all Vietnamese, for example, on climate change, on conservation, on dealing with transnational crime.\u00a0 But this is an ongoing part of our dialogue and an important one.\nFinally, on South China Sea, I think it\u2019s very clear that countries throughout the region, to include Vietnam, feel strongly about the importance of respecting the rule of law, particularly under the Law of the Sea Convention, when it comes to issues of freedom of navigation, when it comes to maritime disputes, when it comes to illegal fishing, et cetera.\u00a0 And a lot of good work is being done, for example, through ASEAN to try to address these issues.\u00a0 That\u2019s been going on for some time.\nAnd in our own relationship with Vietnam, with other countries in the region, one of the things that we\u2019ve worked on, I think very productively, is helping countries strengthen what we call maritime domain awareness \u2013 having the capacity to see very clearly what is happening in the seas that surround their countries, particularly when it comes to things like piracy, like illegal fishing, or like any use of coercion by other countries against \u2013 against these countries, against their fishing fleets, et cetera.\nSo that\u2019s an important part of the conversation as well, and it does go to the heart of what we have as a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, one in which, again, countries are free to pursue their own policies, their own partnerships, and in which everyone in the region abides by the international rule of law.\u00a0 This is something that joins us together with Vietnam.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to\u00a0H\u00e0ng Duy Linh with Tuoi Tre.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So let me ask you in Vietnamese, okay?\n(Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, before your arrival there are already speculation that this year will be the very good year to change the partnership from comprehensive to strategic partnership.\u00a0 Why would the U.S. would like that, and what do you think whether you can \u2013 the two countries can result in that goal?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I think from the perspective of the United States \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to speak for our Vietnamese colleagues, but certainly from our perspective \u2013 we think this is an auspicious time to elevate our existing partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had for the last 10 years this Comprehensive Partnership that has created an incredibly strong foundation of cooperation across many different areas.\nAnd as a result, we think this is a good moment to go even further.\u00a0 And by that we mean this: to make even more effective the existing cooperation that we have, and then to work in new areas of cooperation and collaboration in the partnership.\u00a0 And this is something that the \u2013 that President Biden and the general secretary discussed when they spoke on the phone a couple of weeks ago, and it was very much part of the conversations that we had today.\nSo I think what you\u2019ll see in the weeks and months ahead is our teams working on this.\u00a0 There are so many areas where we can either deepen cooperation or really add cooperation to what we\u2019re already doing, whether it\u2019s on climate change, whether it\u2019s on health, security, science and technology, and education.\u00a0 I was just at the Hanoi University for Science and Technology and saw some remarkable young Vietnamese innovators, including a robotics team that will be coming to the United States. \u00a0We think there\u2019s an area there for significant collaboration in building up science and technology in Vietnam and also deepening even more educational exchanges.\u00a0 We have many Vietnamese students in the United States.\u00a0 We want even more.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to see Americans come here.\nBut also the digital transformation, which is part \u2013 already part of IPEF, strengthening supply chains and building more resilient ones, deepening the work that we\u2019re doing together in the Mekong Delta.\u00a0 Each of these areas, whether it\u2019s an existing area of cooperation or one that we can add, I think would go to an enhanced partnership that we\u2019ll be working on in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Matt Lee with The Associated Press.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thanks, Vedant.\u00a0 Hi, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 A couple things.\u00a0 One, do you have any understanding of what the situation \u2013 what\u2019s going on in Khartoum right now in Sudan?\nAnd then more to the point of this trip, tomorrow you\u2019re going to be beginning almost three days of talks with your G7 colleagues in what is the first big international meeting since these leaks of the highly classified information.\u00a0 Whether or not you expect or worry that your colleagues in Japan might ask you about that or raise it as a problematic issue, what do you say to people who ask whether the U.S. can still be a trusted partner and ally given that this set of leaks is like the fourth major one in about a decade from Americans?\nAnd then lastly on Evan Gershkovich, is there any update on his situation in terms of getting consular access?\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that the Russians have said that they might be willing to arrange some kind of a swap for him.\u00a0 Is there anything to report on that front?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Matt.\u00a0 First on Khartoum, the major parties in Khartoum some weeks ago reached a very important framework agreement on how to proceed with a transition to civilian government.\u00a0 And there\u2019s been real progress in trying to move that forward.\u00a0 I spoke to General Burhan just a couple of days ago on that very topic, and there are still some remaining \u2013 important remaining issues that need to be dealt with.\u00a0 But I think there\u2019s a real opportunity to move forward on the agreed framework, and certainly that\u2019s what we\u2019re strongly supporting.\nIt\u2019s a fragile situation.\u00a0 There are other actors that may be pushing against that progress.\u00a0 But this is a real opportunity to finally carry forward the civilian-led transition, and one that we and other countries are trying to bolster.\u00a0 So we\u2019re very focused on that along with other partners.\nOn the intelligence leaks, what I can tell you is this:\u00a0 We have engaged with our allies and partners since these leaks came out, and we have done so at high levels, and we have made clear our commitment to safeguarding intelligence and our commitment to our security partnerships.\nWhat I\u2019ve heard so far at least is an appreciation for the steps that we\u2019re taking, and it\u2019s not affected our cooperation.\u00a0 I just haven\u2019t seen that.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard that.\u00a0 And of course, the investigation is taking its course.\u00a0 There\u2019s now, as you know, a suspect in custody but importantly as well, I know, measures being taken to further safeguard information.\u00a0 But to date, based on the conversations I\u2019ve had, I have not \u2013 not heard anything that would affect our cooperation with allies and partners.\nOn Evan Gershkovich, I don\u2019t have anything new to share.\u00a0 We continue to seek consular access.\u00a0 That has not yet been granted.\u00a0 It needs to be.\u00a0 This is a Russian obligation, and so we\u2019re looking to that.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve heard some of the comments that have been made, but there\u2019s nothing \u2013 nothing that I have to report on where this might go.\u00a0 We continue to call for his immediate release, and certainly we need to see consular access now.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, B\u00f9i Ki\u1ec1u Li\u00ean with Bao Chinh Phu.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam, how does it progress?\u00a0 How has it been progressing since?\u00a0 And what that relationship, the result of that relationship, the economic-wise and politically-wise?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s fair to say this has been one of the more remarkable evolutions in relationships that we\u2019ve seen in recent years and in recent decades.\u00a0 And it\u2019s one that is very gratifying to me and to the United States as a whole.\nLet me just give you one example.\u00a0 When we lifted the trade embargo in 1994, there was virtually no trade between Vietnam and the United States.\u00a0 Twenty years later in 2015, the first time that I was here as a representative of the United States, trade was roughly $45 billion between our countries.\u00a0 So it had gone up from virtually zero to $45 billion.\u00a0 Today, we\u2019re approaching $140 billion in trade.\u00a0 So just looking at that aspect of the relationship, we\u2019ve seen a dramatic, dramatic change.\nBut much more broadly than that, we\u2019re seeing the United States and Vietnam working closely together in virtually every area that matters to people in both of our countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in building the strong economic trade and investment relationship.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in the work that we\u2019re doing together now on climate change.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in the work that we\u2019re doing on building the resilience of our supply chains, which we know is so critical.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together to address the needs in the Mekong Delta, including on agriculture.\u00a0 In fact, our Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack will be here, I think, tomorrow following my visit.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve had a whole host of senior officials from across our government reflecting the full range of actions that \u2013 and activities that we\u2019re engaged in.\nBut whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy security, whether it\u2019s trade and investment, in science and technology, education \u2013 all of these areas, cooperation, collaboration between the United States and Vietnam has grown exponentially.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re also working very closely together in regional organizations like ASEAN, APEC, and collaborating to advance the international rule of law that both of our countries strongly adhere to and want to make sure is upheld and strengthened.\nAnd so in so many ways we become genuine partners trying to advance mutual interests and doing it in a way that reflects the interests of our people.\u00a0 As I said a moment ago, earlier today I had the opportunity to break ground for our new embassy compound, and that in and of itself is very symbolic of the relationship.\u00a0 The fact that we need that compound because we were doing so much together that our diplomatic presence is even more important than it\u2019s ever been.\nSo for us, for President Biden, for Washington, this is one of the most dynamic and one of the most important relationships\u00a0 we\u2019ve had.\u00a0 It\u2019s had a remarkable trajectory over the last couple of decades.\u00a0 Our conviction is that it can and will grow even stronger in the decades ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "U.S. Embassy Hanoi ", "location": "Hanoi, Vietnam", "date": "April 15, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you, everyone, very, very much.\u00a0 This really is a particular pleasure because this has been a day long in the making.\nI heard about this project, I think, the first time I was here as deputy secretary from Ambassador Osius, then Ambassador Kritenbrink.\u00a0 Marc, congratulations.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But thank you, in all seriousness, for your extraordinary leadership at a time of tremendous importance.\nTo my friend the foreign minister, we\u2019re so grateful not just for your presence but for our partnership every single day and for the work that you are instrumental in doing in bringing us to this day.\nAnd to the vice minister, to our colleagues from the city as well, the planning commission, thank you, thank you so much.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for this partnership, this collaboration.\u00a0 And it doesn\u2019t take that much imagination \u2013 maybe just a little bit \u2013 to see what this could be in just a few years\u2019 time, but also to see what it\u2019s going to represent in both symbolic and practical ways for the relationship between our countries.\nTo everyone who\u2019s here from the Government of Vietnam, from our embassy team, all colleagues past and present: \u00a0Thank you for all of the hard work that has gone to making this day possible.\u00a0 I know that it took a lot of work.\u00a0\nSo in a few moments, we will symbolically break ground on the new embassy campus here in Hanoi.\nYears in the making, this is the culmination of dedicated and often very creative engagement between countless Americans and countless Vietnamese diplomats.\nAnd again, that\u2019s something I saw firsthand when I was here in 2015 and 2016 as deputy secretary working together to find the land for the campus.\nNow, this groundbreaking \u2013 and the new embassy that we\u2019ll build \u2013 represents another significant step toward strengthening a vital partnership between our countries and between our people.\nBack in 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Hanoi to normalize diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.\u00a0 Opening the embassy was a key part of that effort.\nNow, back then, things looked a little bit different at the U.S. embassy.\u00a0 There were fewer than 30 American employees.\u00a0 Much of their work was done with a very exciting technology that let them communicate instantly with colleagues around the world: the fax machine.\u00a0\nSo we\u2019ve come a little bit of distance from those days.\u00a0 A few things have changed. \u00a0We have emails.\u00a0 And the small team that opened the embassy back then has grown to include more than 600 American and local staff.\nOver the last 27 years, similarly, the ties that connect our countries, Vietnam and the United States, have grown stronger and stronger.\u00a0 And that\u2019s happened in no small part because of our renewed diplomatic presence in Hanoi, because of our exceptional staff \u2013 at the embassy, at our consulate in Ho Chi Minh City \u2013 who have worked day-in/day-out to forge a relationship that\u2019s robust, that\u2019s dynamic, that\u2019s consequential, and that addresses the needs of the people in both of our countries.\u00a0\nToday, we are, as you\u2019ve head, celebrating 10 years of collaboration through our Comprehensive Partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019ve joined forces on everything from improving public health, to expanding inclusive economic opportunities, to accelerating the clean energy transition.\nWe\u2019re advancing together a free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific region, one that is at peace and rooted in respect for the rules-based international order.\u00a0 And we\u2019re continuing to work together to address the legacy of the war in Vietnam.\nFor nearly three decades, our embassy in Hanoi has been at the center of every one of these shared activities, and many more.\u00a0 And what the new facility will enable us to do is to build on that foundation for decades to come, meet modern challenges, and deliver for our people.\nIt\u2019s going to be eight stories tall.\u00a0 The building will be big enough to bring our entire team together under one roof, enabling both greater collaboration and greater efficiency.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have four times the number of consular windows as our current office, so that we can get visas and passports to more people more quickly.\u00a0 And over an estimated six years of construction, the project will provide good jobs for as many as 1,800 local workers, while adding $350 million to the Vietnamese economy.\nWhat\u2019s also powerful and important is that the embassy is going to reflect a fusion of our cultures and our nations.\u00a0 The complex was designed by an American company, inspired by a mix of Vietnam\u2019s topography and Hanoi\u2019s urban architecture.\nThe base of the building will be made from basalt \u2013 a rock that\u2019s found both in Vietnam and the United States.\u00a0 And the embassy\u2019s construction will embody our countries\u2019 shared commitment to environmental sustainability and resilience.\u00a0 We\u2019re building much of the embassy using recycled materials, and the design will both conserve energy and mitigate the risk of flooding from severe storms.\nWhen Secretary Christopher opened the embassy in Hanoi in 1995, he spoke about building a bridge of cooperation between our nations.\u00a0 But what no one could have anticipated, and what is plainly visible to all today, almost three decades later, is everything that building that bridge has enabled.\u00a0 With this new campus, we will be able to foster still more of those connections and all the relationships, the innovations, the opportunities that come with them.\nSo this is really a special day.\u00a0 And I was saying to the foreign minister, when the embassy is actually complete and built, I hope both of us are pulled out of our retirements and brought back to help actually open it.\u00a0 Thank you all very much for being here today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Secretary Manalo, Secretary Galvez, it has been an honor to host you at the State Department for the third ever \u2013 and first since 2016 \u2013 U.S.-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial alongside Secretary of Defense Austin.\u00a0 Today\u2019s meeting builds on the momentum of the high-level U.S. visits to the Philippines just over the past year, including by Vice President Harris, by Secretary Austin, and myself.\nThe Philippines is the United States\u2019 oldest ally in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our relationship is based on the shared interests and values of Americans and Filipinos, including our abiding commitment to democracy.\u00a0 For decades, we\u2019ve worked together to promote peace and stability across the region, and we\u2019re growing that effective partnership in scale and scope every single day, including through very productive, very rich discussions today.\nOur security alliance is an enduring source of strength for both of our nations.\u00a0 Today, we focused on ways to continue our close partnership under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement so that our forces can work even more closely together, including to provide humanitarian assistance and respond to disasters.\u00a0 Secretary Austin and I also reaffirmed the United States\u2019 unwavering commitment to standing with the Philippines against any intimidation or coercion, including in the South China Sea, and to preserving a region that\u2019s governed by international law where goods and ideas and people can move freely.\nWe also discussed deepening our robust economic ties, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity.\u00a0 We\u2019re working closely with other IPEF partners to build out this framework to help our economies grow faster and fairer so that all our people can reach their full potential, lead on issues shaping the 21st-century economy, and do it in a way that is sustainable for our planet.\nOne way that we\u2019re putting our partnership through IPEF to work is by collaborating to increase economic opportunities for women and girls in the Philippines.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing training in growing industries like data science and artificial intelligence, where women have been under-represented, and boosting digital literacy rates.\nAnd more broadly, as we discussed today, we\u2019re committed to expanding our economic cooperation across the board.\u00a0 Indeed, we discussed a number of areas where we can deepen our collaboration, cooperation in pursuit of that goal.\nTogether, we\u2019re stepping up to address global challenges that no country can solve alone.\u00a0 We discussed our shared efforts to combat the climate crisis and strengthen energy security.\u00a0 The United States is committed to helping the Philippines reach its ambitious goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent by 2030.\u00a0 To do that, the U.S. Government and critically, the private sector, are supporting the growth of the offshore wind market, the development of nickel and cobalt facilities that will help the Philippines sustainable process \u2013 sustainably process minerals essential to the clean energy transition.\nWe\u2019re also providing technical assistance and regulatory guidance to support the growth of the Philippines\u2019 civil nuclear energy program.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking to grow our cooperation through a 123 agreement on civil nuclear cooperation which will make it easier for us to share technical knowledge as well as nuclear material and equipment.\nWe\u2019re delivering solutions to the food security challenges impacting the Philippines like so many other countries.\u00a0 Philippines-based companies, with the support of the United States Government and the American private sector, are making impressive progress in developing climate-smart food systems, increasing their productivity, and the sustainability of their supply chains.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking forward to continuing this progress at the inaugural U.S.-Philippines Food Security Dialogue a little bit later this year.\nWe\u2019re able to do this work not only because of the partnership between our governments but also because of the partnership between our peoples.\u00a0 This year, we\u2019re celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Fulbright Program in the Philippines, the longest running Fulbright Program in the world.\u00a0 More than 22,000 Filipinos have come to the United States through the Fulbright and other U.S. exchange programs, enriching our communities with their perspectives and experiences, innovating and launching businesses, building enduring bonds between our people \u2013 bonds that to this day renew and revitalize the friendship between our countries.\nAcross all of these areas and more, the United States values and is proud of our robust and deepening partnership with the Philippines.\u00a0 Secretary Austin and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss in-depth how we\u2019ll make this essential relationship even stronger in the months and years ahead.\nSo really grateful to our colleagues for being here today, grateful to their teams at the hard work that\u2019s been done, but not grateful simply for their presence but also the spirit in which together we are working to strengthen the bonds between our countries.\nRicky, over to you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Tony.\u00a0 Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Senior Undersecretary and OIC Carlito G. Galvez, Jr., friends from the media, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\u00a0 I\u2019m very pleased to be here in Washington and to address all of you today.\u00a0 Some of you were with Secretary Blinken when we held our first meeting in our current capacities in Manila last August.\u00a0 We agreed then to work together in sustaining the positive momentum and trajectory of Philippine-U.S. relations, including by reconvening our 2+2 ministerial dialogue in 2023.\u00a0 And I\u2019m happy to report that we have in fact followed through on that commitment.\nToday is only the third iteration of our dialogue in the 2+2 format since it was established in 2012.\u00a0 After a seven-year gap since the second meeting in 2016, this meeting holds particular significance as it further reaffirms our shared commitment to advancing our common priorities as treaty allies and close partners amidst evolving regional and global security challenges.\nThe joint statement we will issue today, and the various areas it covers, demonstrates the breadth and depth of our bilateral relationship.\u00a0 We have reached a number of key understandings that the Philippines believes will truly elevate our relationship and translate into direct, substantial, and tangible benefits for our peoples and countries.\nAt today\u2019s meeting, we redoubled our commitment to modernizing the Philippine-U.S. alliance, recognizing that our partnership will need to play a stronger role in preserving an international law-based international order.\u00a0 This means ensuring the conduct of high-level and high-impact, high-value joint exercises, trainings, and other related activities.\u00a0 We especially welcome the United States pledge to fast-track and to ramp up support for the modernization of our defense, civilian law enforcement, and humanitarian assistance and disaster response capabilities, especially in the maritime domain, as well as the implementation of EDCA projects and investments in and around EDCA-agreed locations.\nI wish to point out that we also underscored the importance of equally ensuring that our modern alliance not only serves as an instrument as peace, but it shall also be a force for good that brings about sustained economic benefits to our two countries, down to our local communities.\nOur discussions and proposed ways forwards are aligned with the Philippines\u2019 priorities on agriculture, food security, promoting energy security as we transition to clean energy, boosting trade, and building resilience of our supply chains, as well as enhancing connectivity and digitalization.\u00a0 Our discussions focused also on areas such as economic cooperation, climate change, renewable energy, economic resilience, and economic security.\nThank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Manalo, and Secretary Galvez, I\u2019m honored to be here with you today for the third U.S.-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue.\u00a0 As you\u2019ve heard, this is the first of its kind in seven years.\nBut first, let me just say a few words about the story that I know many of you are tracking.\u00a0 I was first briefed on the reports of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and classified material on the morning of April 6th.\u00a0 And since then, I have been convening senior department leaders daily on our response, and I have directed an urgent cross-department effort.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve referred the matter to the Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal investigation.\u00a0 Now, I can\u2019t say much more while the Justice Department\u2019s investigation is ongoing, but we take this very seriously.\u00a0 And we will continue to work closely with our outstanding allies and partners, and nothing will ever stop us from keeping America secure.\nNow, let me turn to today\u2019s important discussions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come together at an historic moment in our alliance.\u00a0 For more than seven decades, the U.S. and Philippine forces have trained and fought alongside each other.\u00a0 And today we\u2019re building on those bonds to bring greater security, stability, and prosperity to the Indo-Pacific for the next 70 years and beyond.\u00a0 The commitments that we made today will spur even deeper cooperation to help ensure that we\u2019re poised to tackle the defining challenges of our time \u2013 together.\nWe all reaffirmed today that our Mutual Defense Treaty remains the bedrock of our cooperation.\u00a0 As Secretary Blinken and I have said clearly and repeatedly, the Mutual Defense Treaty applies to armed attacks on either of our armed forces, our aircraft, or public vessels \u2013 including our Coast Guard \u2013 anywhere in the South China Sea.\nAnd so today we built on our work together during my recent visit to Manila and discussed plans to operationalize the four new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement locations in Palawan and northern Luzon.\u00a0 These sites will support combined training exercises and interoperability between our forces to ensure that we\u2019re even better prepared for future crises.\nWe\u2019re proud of the investments we\u2019re making, and by the end of FY \u201923 we expect to have allocated more than $100 million in infrastructure investments at the new and existing EDCA sites.\u00a0 So those investments will spur job creation and economic growth in local Philippine communities.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also committed to swiftly finalizing the U.S.\u2013 Philippines bilateral defense guidelines, which charts our vision for alliance cooperation across all operational domains, including space and cyberspace.\nIn the face of coercion and gray zone aggression, Secretary Galvez and I agreed to redouble our efforts to strengthen our combined ability to resist armed attack by modernizing our armed forces.\u00a0 We also discussed near-term plans to complete a security sector assistance roadmap to support the delivery of priority defense platforms over the next five to ten years, including radars, unmanned aerial systems, military transport aircraft, and coastal and air defense systems.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on the some 500 defense engagements that our militaries conduct each year, and we\u2019re forging new ties between our militaries and expanding the breadth of our cooperation.\nYesterday, we celebrated the start of our 38th annual Exercise Balikatan.\u00a0 More than 17,000 troops are participating this year.\u00a0 It is the largest and most complex iteration in the exercise\u2019s history.\u00a0 Now the commitments that we made today will further integrate our strong bilateral ties into multilateral networks, including with Japan and Australia, and we discussed plans to conduct combined maritime activities with likeminded partners in the South China Sea later this year as we work to enhance our collective deterrence.\nOur alliance is ultimately guided by our deep and enduring commitment to freedom.\u00a0 So we\u2019re not just allies, we\u2019re democratic allies, and the United States and the Philippines are bound by a common vision for the future \u2013 a vision that\u2019s anchored in the rule of law and freedom of the seas and respect for the territorial integrity of sovereign states.\nAnd Secretary Galvez, Secretary Manalo, and Secretary Blinken, thank you for your leadership and your steadfast partnership as we build this future together.\nSecretary Galvez, the floor is yours, sir.\nOFFICER IN CHARGE GALVEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Foremost, my highest courtesies to the Secretary Antony J. Blinken and Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, to my most esteemed colleague Secretary Enrique Manalo.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\nFirst of all, we would like to take this moment to express our profoundest thanks to the U.S.\u00a0 We are grateful to the U.S. Government and the American people for their kind assistance in our current environmental sea disaster in containing the oil spill in Oriental Mindoro.\u00a0 Upon our request for assistance, the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Embassy, and the U.S. Navy manifested their unwavering support to its deployment of the Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, as well as the technical support provided by the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to help contain an oil spill.\nThe timely and efficient response of our allies in providing the technical and material support, amounting to more than $20 million U.S., was very instrumental in mitigating the impact of this environmental disaster on our coastal communities that may affect millions of Filipino people.\u00a0 The aid and cooperation demonstrates the strength of the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance, and we are very proud to be partner of the United States.\u00a0 And your commitment to assisting us in this time of need has reinforced the band of friendship and mutual trust between our nations.\u00a0 We will not forget.\nAs to vaccine, sir, I would like also to \u2013 like to reiterate our appreciation for the 3.6 million vaccine doses donated by the U.S. Government to the Philippines, which save millions of Filipino lives and help our economy to recover.\nToday, we have just concluded the third 2+2 ministerial meeting between the Philippines and the United States.\u00a0 And I am pleased to announce that it had been a most productive meeting, which expanded to even to economic security.\u00a0 The last time the 2+2 ministerial consultation were convened was in January 2016.\u00a0 The fact that we are able to convene once again highlights the continued importance and relevance of our partnership and the need for continued dialogue and cooperation on matters of mutual interest.\nIt is also noteworthy that this is the first time the meeting will be convened under the Marcos administration, which highlights the Philippine Government\u2019s commitment to strengthening our alliance with the United States.\u00a0 Our meeting today will set the direction that we would like to be the Philippine-U.S. alliance to take in consideration of our present-day realities and common security challenges.\nAlong this line, I wish to emphasize the strength and credibility of the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance, which is founded on a shared commitment to regional peace, stability, and security.\u00a0 Our partnership has weathered many challenges in the past and continues to stand strong today.\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to the Mutual Defense Treaty, which is our cornerstone of our partnership.\nOur defense establishments recognize the need to work together to enhance our interoperability, increase our defense capacity, and build our resilience against emerging challenges.\u00a0 To this end, we agreed to explore new areas of cooperation and deepen our existing partnership in key areas such as mutual defense, maritime security, and information/intelligence sharing, and joint sails and solidarity patrols.\nWe also welcomed the ongoing conduct of the biggest ever Exercise Balikatan, which involved 17,000 forces \u2013 12,000 U.S. personnel, 5,000 AFP personnel, and 111 Australian defense forces and observers from other likeminded countries, which capacitates our armed forces to train and operate together, improve interoperability, and enhance our respective capabilities.\nWith the announcement of the four additional sites where Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement agreed locations can be developed, and we reaffirm our commitment to work together in implementing the EDCA through the completion of both existing and potential projects.\nLastly, we discussed opportunities for future cooperation with likeminded partners in the region.\u00a0 We recognize that we cannot address such a wide range of security challenges and that we need to work with other countries who share our interest in accordance with our respective national laws and policies.\u00a0 We affirm the commitment to sustain regular exchanges through existing platforms, namely the 2+2 ministerial consultations, Bilateral Strategic Dialogue, the Mutual Defense Board, Security Engagement Board, and among others.\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize that the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance is strong and credible, and we are committed to modernizing our alliance to meet the evolving security challenges of the region.\u00a0 This alliance is for peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take three questions.\u00a0 First we\u2019ll go to Demetri Sevastopulo with\u00a0The Financial Times.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 I have questions for both sides.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, can you give us a sense of what kinds and numbers of military assets and personnel that you intend to position or rotate through the EDCA sites in the Philippines?\u00a0 And can you explain how specifically does this enhanced cooperation increase your ability to prepare for any possible conflict with China over Taiwan?\nAnd to Secretaries Manalo and Galvez, how will the EDCA sites be used if the U.S. and China go to war over Taiwan?\u00a0 And will there be any restrictions on what the U.S. military can do with the sites?\nAnd finally, Secretary Blinken, this is a China question.\u00a0 Your relations with China appear to be deteriorating continuously with only sporadic signs of positive developments.\u00a0 Is this the long-term future of U.S. relations with China, or is there some kind of a realistic way to turn things around?\u00a0 And when do you expect to go to Beijing?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, thanks for your question, Demetri.\u00a0 EDCA is a key pillar to our alliance.\u00a0 It provides us the opportunity to train together, to increase interoperability.\u00a0 And you know, Demetri, interoperability is not something that you can show up at the last moment and snap your figures and achieve.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that you\u2019ve got to work on each and every day.\u00a0 And so the addition of these EDCA sites puts us in a position to be able to not only train together but also respond to meet the needs of the Philippines in the event of a crisis like a natural disaster or a requirement to rapidly provide humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 And so I think it helps us not only work together, but it helps us address the needs of the Philippines as well.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s essential to our ability to strengthen our combined deterrence posture.\nI think it\u2019s a bit early to try to discuss numbers and specific timing of rotations, but certainly these are things that Secretary Galvez and I will continue to work on going forward.\u00a0 But again, it is a tremendous opportunity.\nI would finally emphasize that whatever we do in the future in terms of rotations and numbers of troops, it is a joint decision between the Philippines and \u2013 the Philippine Government and the U.S. Government.\u00a0 So again, a great opportunity.\u00a0 I\u2019m excited about the ability to increase interoperability and look forward to continuing our great work together.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0 Thank you very much for your question.\u00a0 What I can say at this stage is that the new sites that have been identified, the new EDCA sites, are mainly aimed at increasing or improving interoperability as well as addressing potential human, humanitarian disasters or climate-related disasters.\nAnd in operationalizing these sites, of course, much work still has to be done.\u00a0 We have to identify the terms and references, how these activities will be undertaken.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really at any stage yet to answer how they might be used.\u00a0 They\u2019re still open to discussion.\u00a0 But I think we have already reached an understanding that the basic elements of these sites would be, the basic purposes of these sites would be to address humanitarian disaster-related events, to increase and improve interoperability and training of Filipino and American assets, and also to be in a position to improve the interoperability and perhaps respond to other types of security challenges.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Demetri, with regard to China, you\u2019ve heard me say before, Secretary Austin and others say before, that the relationship between our countries is among the most consequential and also the most complex of any that we have, and the same could probably be said for many other countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re not reducing it to a bumper sticker, as \u2013 again \u2013 I\u2019ve said before.\u00a0 It has different aspects to it: certainly competitive, cooperative in other respects, and in some instances more adversarial.\nWhat we\u2019ve been working to do, first of all, is to make sure that when it comes to our own strategy and our own approach we\u2019re following through on it, making investments in ourselves and our strength at home.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that, aligning increasingly with partners around the world, whether that\u2019s in Europe and Asia, and we\u2019ve done that with greater convergence than I\u2019ve seen at any time with key partners on the approach to some of the challenges posed by China, and putting those assets together so that we\u2019re competing very vigorously in upholding our interests, upholding our values, and building our vision for the future.\nWhat I hear from countries around the world and what I believe is profoundly in our interest is for us to manage the relationship with China responsibly.\u00a0 And our goal is peace, security, stability, and creating opportunity.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to engage in a new cold war.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to contain China.\u00a0 But in doing that, in trying to advance a world that is peaceful, secure, stable, and with more opportunity, we\u2019re going to stand up very vigorously for our values and for our interests, and we\u2019re doing that with regard to China.\nWe\u2019re also prepared to work cooperatively with China where it\u2019s in our interest and their interest and, I believe, in the interests of the world.\u00a0 And there are a number of issues that we\u2019ve laid out \u2013 transnational challenges that no one country can solve alone where it would benefit all of us and benefit the world for us to find ways to work together.\nThrough all of this, it\u2019s, I believe, important to maintain channels of communication to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to each other clearly, and we\u2019ve certainly continued to do that even through what\u2019s been a challenging period in our relationship.\u00a0 I think as our two presidents agreed when they met in Bali at the end of last year at the G20, it would be important to continue to find ways to strengthen those channels of communication.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We look to do that in the time ahead.\nAnd when it comes to my own visit to China, when the conditions are right I\u2019ll certainly look forward to pursuing that.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, you just said that you first learned about the leaked documents on the 6th of April.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been online for months.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t U.S. intelligence, the rest of U.S. Government, see those leaked documents online for all those months?\u00a0 Is that an intelligence failure?\nAnd I\u2019d like to ask Secretary Blinken that same issue, as well as your conversations with Foreign Minister Kuleba of Ukraine.\u00a0 We have seen documents that indicate that Ukraine has crossed \u2013 with Ukrainian agents working for the government have launched drone attacks in Russia and in Belarus, contrary to commitments that they would not do that.\u00a0 Are you concerned that this would \u2013 will \u2013 undermine Western support for Ukraine?\u00a0 And can you talk about the overall damage that these leaks have caused to our reputation for handling intelligence with our closest allies?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, do you have concerns about sharing intelligence with the United States given the fact that these leaked documents were online for so many months?\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Thanks, Andrea.\u00a0 The documents that we are aware of are dated the 28th of February and 1st of March.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if there are other documents that are \u2013 that have been online before.\u00a0 These are things that we will find, find out as we continue to investigate.\u00a0 But the documents that we are focused on\u00a0thus far \u2013 28th of February and the 1st of March.\u00a0 Again, we will continue to investigate and try to determine the full scope of the activity.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But, sir, why did we know about it and why didn\u2019t you know about it before April 6th?\u00a0 That means that they were up for at least many weeks, months, before U.S. intelligence knew that they were in the public domain.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, they were somewhere in the web, and where exactly and who had access at that point we don\u2019t know.\u00a0 We simply don\u2019t know at this point.\u00a0 So \u2013 and again, I won\u2019t speculate, Andrea.\u00a0 I will tell you that we take this very seriously and we will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Andrea, my \u2013 I don\u2019t have much to add beyond what the Secretary said.\u00a0 Let me just say with regard to, broadly, allies and partners and these documents, we have engaged with allies and partners at high levels over the past \u2013 the past days, including to reassure them about our own commitment to safeguarding intelligence and, of course, our commitment to our security partnerships.\nWith regard to Ukraine itself, I did speak to Foreign Minister Kuleba today, and in speaking to him, among other things, I reaffirmed our enduring support for Ukraine and for its efforts to defend its territorial integrity, its sovereignty, its independence; reaffirmed the extraordinary support that we have provided to Ukraine along with dozens of other countries over the last year to help it defend itself, support that will be ongoing and indeed, as you\u2019ve seen just as recently this week, additional support that was provided.\nI\u2019m not going to comment on specific actions that Ukraine takes when it comes to defending its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, but we are determined to assist Ukraine in the efforts that it\u2019s making to regain the territory that\u2019s been seized from it, and I reaffirmed that commitment today in speaking to Foreign Minister Kuleba.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Are you concerned about cross-border attacks?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, I\u2019m not going to speak directly to any particular actions, and I\u2019m certainly not going to comment on these purported documents.\u00a0 But Ukraine has to make decisions about how it can most effectively defend itself against Russian aggression and take back the territory that\u2019s been seized from it.\u00a0 We give our advice as appropriate, we provide the support; that is well-known.\u00a0 But Ukraine makes the decisions about how it actually prosecutes the effort to regain its territory.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Oh.\u00a0 First let me also share the view of Secretary Blinken that we are very confident after \u2013 especially after today\u2019s meeting of the commitment to our alliance and our partnership.\u00a0 And I really don\u2019t want to jump to any speculation or jump to any conclusions at this stage.\u00a0 We have full confidence in the investigation that will be undertaken.\u00a0 And certainly we would have to wait for the results before we can even comment.\nBut just let me say that we are confident of the strength of our relationship and our growing partnership.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Will Mauldin of\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 First for Undersecretary Galvez, the mentioned exercise is going to take place later this year in the South China Sea.\u00a0 I wonder what countries would be involved in those exercises and whether there are any concerns that these exercises or the ongoing ones or different steps that the U.S. is taking with its allies and partners in the region would generate a response \u2013 a dangerous response from China.\nFor Secretary Austin, I wanted to ask:\u00a0 Irregardless of where the investigation into the documents take us or the veracity of the documents, they\u2019re posted online and definitely seen by the Russians as well as the Ukrainians.\u00a0 I wonder to what degree this will affect the tactics of the expected Ukrainian offensive this spring or summer.\u00a0 How \u2013 to what degree will their tactics need to change?\u00a0 To what degree will you recommend changes in those tactics?\nFinally, for Secretary Blinken, I wanted to ask about my good friend and colleague Evan Gershkovich.\u00a0 You found him wrongfully detained, and so I wanted to ask when your staff will be able to get consular access to him in Russia.\u00a0 What\u2019s taking so long there?\u00a0 And will there be any leverage that you can exert?\u00a0 Is there any leverage that you can exert to get Russia to provide that access and what strategies will you work on and will the administration be working on to free him?\nThank you.\nOFFICER IN CHARGE GALVEZ:\u00a0 The Balikatan exercise \u2013 this is its 38th activation, and it\u2019s been \u2013 we are doing the Balikatan yearly.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t expect any violent reaction considering that this exercise is intended for our collective defense with the U.S. and other allies.\nFor today, for this Balikatan, we have the participation of, as I have said earlier, 17,000 troops, including 12,000 Americans, 5,000 Filipinos, and 111 Australians.\u00a0 We have also observers from the ASEAN nations and also from other allies, and we are happy to say that\u00a0these exercises are varied exercises on counterterrorism, humanitarian response, and also on developing interoperability with our U.S. forces and also our Australian friends.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0Hey Will, thanks for the question.\u00a0 I just spoke with my counterpart in Ukraine today, Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.\u00a0 And we talked about a number of issues, but \u2013 as we typically do.\u00a0 But he and the leadership remain focused on the task at hand.\u00a0 And I have every confidence that they will do what good leaders, great leaders do:\u00a0 They will fight the enemy and not be driven by a specific plan.\u00a0 They have a great plan to start and \u2013 but only President Zelenskyy and his leadership really know the full details of that plan.\nSo they have much of the capability that they need to continue to be successful.\u00a0 We\u2019ve trained an enormous number of troops.\u00a0 We have provided a substantial number of platforms.\u00a0 And so I think he feels that he\u2019s in a \u2013 they\u2019re in a pretty good position.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll stay focused on continuing to generate security assistance capability so that they can continue to be successful whenever they choose to take up offensive operations.\nAnd again, sustainment will be there throughout.\u00a0 We\u2019ll stay connected with our allies and partners.\u00a0 We next meet for our next round of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on the 21st, and I look forward to seeing him and the rest of our colleagues at that meeting.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And Will, as to your question regarding Evan, yes, I made the determination yesterday that he is being wrongfully detained by Russia.\nPresident Biden had an opportunity to speak to his family today, I believe.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken to your colleagues, including leadership at\u00a0The Wall Street Journal, multiple times about Evan\u2019s situation.\u00a0 When I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov about a week ago now, just after Evan was detained, I of course pressed for his immediate release, but I also pressed for immediate consular access to him.\u00a0 The fact that Russia has not granted that access puts it once again in violation of international commitments it\u2019s made, commitments that are at the heart of diplomatic relations between countries and the ability of our citizens as well to be able to safely be present in other countries.\nI think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access \u2013 never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes \u2013 is going to do even more damage to Russia\u2019s standing around the world, a standing that has been in freefall particularly since its reinvasion of Ukraine last year.\nAnd I think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there lest they be arbitrarily detained, and in the context of being arbitrarily detained not even having access for the diplomats who are there to look out for their interests and who, as a matter of solemn international obligations that Russia has undertaken, should be allowed that access.\nI\u2019m not going to get into what measures, steps we\u2019re taking or might take to do that.\u00a0 I can simply tell you that we are engaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan\u2019s release.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, your Excellencies.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-bangladeshi-foreign-minister-abdul-momen-before-their-meeting-2/", "title":

Blinken  at a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "NATO Headquarters", "location": "Brussels, Belgium", "date": "April 5, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s always good to be back in Belgium, in Brussels, at the NATO Headquarters, which has become almost a home away from home.\u00a0 But this week, these last two days, this has genuinely been a historic NATO meeting.\nYesterday, on the 74th anniversary of the Alliance, I accepted Finland\u2019s membership documents to join NATO.\u00a0 Finland is now our 31st Ally.\u00a0 With this step, Finland is safer; NATO is stronger.\u00a0 We look forward to welcoming Sweden to NATO in the near future.\u00a0 Like Finland, it\u2019s militarily capable.\u00a0 It\u2019s a strong democracy, fully dedicated to upholding the commitments and values that underpin our Alliance, including Article 5.\nAt the NATO leaders summit last summer, the NATO Allies agreed on a new strategy for the first time in a decade.\u00a0 Since then, including at this ministerial, we\u2019ve been working to implement that strategy, making our Alliance stronger, more resilient, better positioned for the future.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on the Wales defense investment pledge to invest 2 percent of our GDP in defense.\u00a0 It is critical that we have the means to replenish stockpiles, to increase the readiness of our forces, to meet force generation commitments for NATO missions and operations, to keep pace with 21st century challenges.\nWe\u2019re developing new partnerships, including in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 At this ministerial, we welcomed the participation of Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, who share our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region but also recognize that many of the challenges that we face are interconnected and global in nature.\nAnd of course, the Alliance remains relentlessly focused on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 The NATO-Ukraine Commission met for the first time in five years, with Foreign Minister Kuleba\u2019s participation, to talk about ways that we can continue to help Ukraine in the weeks, the months, and indeed the years ahead.\nWhen the NATO foreign ministers last convened back in November of last year, President Putin was pursuing his new strategy to win his brutal war against Ukraine.\u00a0 Having suffered devastating setbacks on the battlefield, he tried to bomb and freeze Ukraine\u2019s civilian population into submission.\u00a0 He accelerated his campaign to weaponize energy against Ukraine\u2019s European partners so that they would decide that the cost of supporting the country were too high.\u00a0 And he continued to try to raise food and energy prices in some of the poorest countries in the world to manufacture a false choice between supporting Ukraine and making ends meet for their people.\nPresident Putin has failed.\u00a0 Thanks to the remarkable courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people and unprecedented support from Ukraine\u2019s partners, Ukraine endures.\u00a0 More than 50 countries have been providing security assistance.\u00a0 Dozens of countries jumped in to help Ukraine defend and repair its energy grid in the face of Russia\u2019s onslaught.\u00a0 We sustained and increased the pressure on Russia with unprecedented sanctions and export controls, which are having a dramatic and growing impact.\u00a0 The Kremlin\u2019s usable financial reserves are plummeting.\u00a0 Its budget revenues from oil and gas have been cut in half since last year.\u00a0 Hundreds, even more than a thousand, companies have fled the country and aren\u2019t coming back.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands of young people have fled Russia \u2013 literally Russia\u2019s future.\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated again our unity of purpose and our unity of action.\u00a0 And after this ministerial, I am confident that that will endure for as long as it takes for Ukraine to defend its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, its independence.\nYesterday, the United States announced our 35th drawdown of arms and equipment.\u00a0 That includes more ammunition for HIMARS, air defense interceptors and artillery rounds, as well as antiarmor systems, small arms, heavy equipment transport vehicles, and maintenance support.\u00a0 These contributions will continue to enable Ukraine to protect civilian infrastructure from missile and drone attacks and to hold and retake Ukraine\u2019s territory.\nThe United States and Ukraine\u2019s partners support meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve a peace, but not just any kind of peace.\u00a0 It has to be a just peace that upholds the principles of the UN Charter \u2013 sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence \u2013 and it has to be an durable peace that ensures that Russia can\u2019t simply rest and refit its troops and then relaunch the war at a time of its choosing.\u00a0 That\u2019s the kind of peace, a just and durable one, that 141 countries at the United Nations General Assembly endorsed just a few weeks ago.\nUntil that peace is achieved, the United States, together with allies and partners from around the world, will continue to provide the assistance that Ukraine needs to defend its territory and defend its people.\nThe story of NATO over the last year has been one of unity and resolve.\u00a0 Amid new challenges to our values, to a rules-based order, to our collective security, our Alliance has emerged stronger than ever and now larger than ever.\u00a0 As we prepare for Vilnius and beyond, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to meet the challenges of this moment and the time to come.\nSo with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Vivian Salama with\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Vivian.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I want to ask you about my colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who as of today has been detained in Russia for the last year \u2013 for the last week, sorry.\u00a0 Do you \u2013 it feels like a year.\u00a0 Do you anticipate that you will approve a designation of wrongfully detained for Evan, or do you need to wait however long it will take for the Russians to agree to grant him consular access for that to even happen?\nAnd secondly, prisoner swaps have occurred in recent years to bring a number of detained Americans home.\u00a0 Is there anyone that the Russians want or would be willing to exchange either for Evan or for Paul Whelan, who is also being held on espionage charges?\u00a0 And more broadly, are you concerned that there is a precedent being set now by our adversaries who are detaining Americans in the hope that maybe they would be some sort of prisoner swap in return?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks very much, Vivian. \u00a0First \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard me say this before \u2013 from my perspective, from the department\u2019s perspective, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of American citizens around the world, and that includes those who may be wrongfully detained, held hostage, otherwise kept from coming home, being with their families.\nIn Evan\u2019s case, we are working through the determination on wrongful detention, and there\u2019s a process to do that and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working through very deliberately but expeditiously as well.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll let that process play out.\u00a0 In my own mind, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s being wrongfully detained by Russia, which is exactly what I said to Foreign Minister Lavrov when I spoke to him over the weekend and insisted that Evan be released immediately.\u00a0 But I want to make sure that \u2013 as always, because there is a formal process \u2013 that we go through it, and we will, and I expect that to be completed soon.\nMore broadly, when it comes, first of all, to Paul Whelan, as I\u2019ve also said, there\u2019s a proposal on the table that\u2019s been on the table for some months.\u00a0 Again, with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I reiterated that Russia should move on that proposal so that we can bring Paul home.\u00a0 In any of these instances, there is a balance to be done between trying to bring home people who are being unjustly detained in one way or another and what it takes to do that.\u00a0 I believe that, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past and as a result as well of legislation that we have and other tools that we have, that even as we engage in efforts to bring people home, we can also increase the pressure and increase the penalties on those who would engage in the practice of unlawful, arbitrary detention of American citizens.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing, including, for example, implementing the Robert Levinson Act and other tools that we have.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Vitaliy Syzov with Freedom TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I have one question.\u00a0 Yesterday, after meeting with you, minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine said that he want to see some proposal from NATO during the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 Today, minister of foreign affairs of Estonia said that Ukraine should be provided with a roadmap of accession to NATO.\u00a0 What are your thoughts about this process?\u00a0 Each proposal could expect to get Ukraine during Vilnius Summit.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Our focus right now is relentlessly on doing what needs to be done to help Ukraine defend itself against the Russian aggression and, indeed, to put it in a \u2013 help put it in a position to retake more of the territory that\u2019s been seized from it by Russia.\u00a0 That\u2019s our intense focus.\nWe\u2019re also looking at what we can do over a longer period of time to build up Ukraine\u2019s capacity to deter aggression, to defend against aggression, and, if necessary again in the future, to defeat aggression.\u00a0 And a big part of that is bringing Ukraine up to NATO standards and to NATO interoperability.\u00a0 And I suspect that you\u2019ll see that focus continue at the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the summit, but we are very focused on these very practical steps that can be taken and need to continue to be taken to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards.\nOf course, NATO\u2019s door remain open \u2013 remains open.\u00a0 There\u2019s no change in that, but we have to be in this moment focused intensely on the weeks and months ahead, particularly as Ukraine prepares for a counteroffensive, again, to try to retake more of its territory, as well as work that needs to be done to continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards and NATO interoperability.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Kylie Atwood with CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Hi, Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you for doing this.\u00a0 It was a momentous week here, but there\u2019s a lot going on at home, so I have a few questions for you.\u00a0 Bear with me.\u00a0 In terms of what happened here, obviously, you said that NATO has become stronger this week with Finland joining, but how tangibly will Ukraine benefit from Finland joining NATO?\nAnd then my second two questions have to do with what is happening at home.\u00a0 First, President Tsai of Taiwan is meeting with Speaker McCarthy today in California.\u00a0 Do you support this meeting at this time?\u00a0 And how concerned are you about China already vowing that it will retaliate?\nAnd then my second question has to do with politics at home.\u00a0 Yesterday, the world watched as former President Trump was arrested.\u00a0 He\u2019s now the first current or former president to face criminal charges, and he\u2019s running for re-election to be president.\u00a0 Have any of your allies asked you about this while you\u2019ve been here at NATO?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your response to revive concerns among Allies that many of us have heard about the long-term reliability of the United States given the polarized nature of politics at home?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Kylie, last question first.\u00a0 As you know well, I don\u2019t do politics.\u00a0 I can tell you, though, that the question you raised about the proceedings in New York actually did not come up in my conversations with NATO colleagues, nor did I get questions about the durability of our approach.\u00a0 I think people are very focused on what we\u2019re actually doing, and what we\u2019re doing is a lot, including what I just went through in terms of the outcomes from this ministerial, the preparations for the leaders summit in Vilnius, the intense focus on everything we\u2019re doing to support Ukraine, to implement the new Strategic Concept for NATO.\u00a0 That\u2019s what everyone was talking about and focused on, and also, as I mentioned, the fact that we have the growing engagement between NATO and other partners, to include our partners from the Indo-Pacific, to include the European Union \u2013 its high representative was here as well today.\u00a0 That was the entirety of the conversation and our focus.\nIn terms of Finland\u2019s membership in NATO and Ukraine, look, in the first instance, irrespective of the \u2013 of that question, as I\u2019ve detailed at some length, a big focus of our meetings here over the last day and a half was on Ukraine and the support that virtually every NATO member is providing individually, as well as the support that NATO institutionally is providing, both in the immediate and also looking toward the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 I mentioned a moment ago work that the Alliance looks to do to help continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards, NATO interoperability, and I think that\u2019s something you\u2019ll see featured at the at the leaders summit.\nFinland\u2019s membership in NATO does two things.\u00a0 It, as I\u2019ve said, makes Finland safer because one of the things that resulted from Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was deep and growing concern among a number of countries that they could be next, and that created what I think is truly historic sea change in both Finland and Sweden, seeking membership in NATO, and thus seeking to benefit from its Article 5 guarantees.\u00a0 So Finland now benefits in that, but Finland also makes the Alliance as a whole stronger, and that\u2019s important in and of itself.\u00a0 I think it may have some additional benefits in the sense that, to the extent Russia thinks about expanding or broadening its aggression, the deterrent that NATO poses to that has now become even stronger.\nNATO is a defensive Alliance; it\u2019s not seeking to engage in conflict with Russia.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a defensive Alliance that has to have a strong deterrent, precisely because we want to make sure that countries think twice, think three times, and then don\u2019t engage in aggression.\u00a0 And I think Finland will \u2013 its membership in the Alliance adds to NATO\u2019s deterrence strength and, if necessary, its defensive strength.\nWith regard to President Tsai\u2019s transit of the United States, I think the first thing to emphasize is that these transits by high-level Taiwanese authorities are nothing new.\u00a0 They\u2019re private, they\u2019re unofficial, but they\u2019ve been going on for years, and President Tsai and her predecessors have done the same thing.\u00a0 In fact, every Taiwan president has transited the United States at one point or another.\u00a0 The meetings, the engagements that the president has also are very much in line with precedent.\u00a0 And similarly, our own approach to Taiwan has remained very consistent and unchanged, including our adherence to the \u201cone China\u201d policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Communiques, the Six Assurances, our opposition to any unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying that, given that, Beijing should not use the transits as an excuse to take any actions to ratchet up tensions, to further push at changing the status quo.\u00a0 And our objective remains the same: to have peace, to have stability across the Taiwan Strait, and to ensure that any differences that exist between mainland and Taiwan are resolved peacefully.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Rikhard Husu with \u2013 from YLE.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for taking my question.\u00a0 A follow-up on Finland:\u00a0 How do you see that Finland will strengthen the Alliance?\u00a0 And do you see that this decision to join can also strengthen the ties, bilateral ties between the U.S. and Finland, for instance in regard to a future defense cooperation agreement?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much.\u00a0 Well, the bilateral ties between the United States and Finland are already extraordinarily strong.\u00a0 But I think Finland\u2019s membership in the Alliance can, if it does anything, will only strengthen those ties, as well as Finland\u2019s ties to all the other members of NATO.\u00a0 But as I said before, what Finland brings to this enterprise is a country that has very strong military capacity, and equally important is a strong and vital democracy.\u00a0 And so both in terms of advancing the interests that bring NATO countries together and the values that we share, Finland is a very compelling member of the Alliance.\nAnd I think what\u2019s important, too, is that Finland and the NATO Alliance have been working closely together for years.\u00a0 What membership does now is it makes, in a sense, formal what\u2019s in many ways been the case for a long time, but it also provides Finland with the commitment of every NATO Ally to Finland and its security and its defense as a member of NATO and as a beneficiary of Article 5.\u00a0 But I would anticipate that, across the board, this has the effect of just further strengthening, deepening relationships, not only between the United States and Finland but between Finland and all the other members of NATO.\nWe also have now even more increasing overlap between membership in the European Union and membership in NATO.\u00a0 And that too has the effect of creating even greater convergence between the United States and Europe than we\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 In fact, I think in my experience now, doing this for 30 years in one way or another, there is more convergence than there\u2019s ever been between the United States and Europe on the big challenges and questions of our time \u2013 dealing with the Russian aggression against Ukraine; meeting some of the challenges posed by China; looking at new things emerging from cyberspace, emerging technologies and their impact on our security and our interests \u2013 much greater convergence in how we approach each of these challenges than we\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0 And I think Finland\u2019s membership in NATO is just one more expression of that, but it really is across the board, and it\u2019s something that, from my perspective, puts us collectively in a much stronger position to deal effectively with all of these challenges.\nWe started with \u2013 this administration started with the basic proposition that American engagement, American leadership is important.\u00a0 It makes a difference because in its absence, some else may try to fill the gap and maybe not in ways that advance our interests and values, or no one does, and then you\u2019ve got a vacuum that tends to be filled by bad things before it\u2019s filled by good things.\u00a0 But the flip side of that coin, the importance of U.S. engagement, is that for virtually all of the challenges that we\u2019re dealing with, no single country, even the United States, can really effectively address them alone.\u00a0 We\u2019re much better off when we\u2019re doing it in partnership, in alliance with other countries, and where we adopt a similar approach.\nThat\u2019s been the story of these last two and a half years: the strengthening of our alliances; creating new partnerships to deal with some of these new challenges, fit for particular purposes; and, fundamentally, a much greater convergence than there\u2019s ever been \u2013 between the United States and Europe, between the United States and Asia, Asia and Europe \u2013 on what we need to do to effectively deal with these challenges.\u00a0 And this ministerial just confirms that trend, confirms that convergence.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken Remarks Before U.S.-EU Energy Council Meeting\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "European Council Building", "location": " Brussels, Belgium ", "date": "April 4, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0High Representative Borrell, Josep, thank you. Thank you for bringing us together today and for continuing an ongoing discussion, an ongoing action that we\u2019ve had with the United States and the European Union on an issue that\u2019s critical in the lives of all of our fellow citizens. I\u2019m very much looking forward to pursuing the discussion we actually began earlier this morning. It\u2019s great to be joined, Tobias, by you, Commissioner Simson, our Deputy Secretary of Energy Dave Turk. Very good to be with everyone this morning.\nWhen this council met on February 7th, 2022, Russia was on the verge of invading Ukraine. Europe was on the verge of an energy crisis. President Putin bet that his threat of stopping gas supplies would deter Europe and the world from standing up to his aggression against Ukraine. He was wrong.\nHe then doubled down \u2013 stopping natural gas supplies to many European countries, dramatically reducing flows to others, forcing record-high prices on millions in Europe and around the world. He sought to wipe out Ukraine\u2019s critical energy infrastructure \u2013 damaging or destroying 50 percent of Ukraine\u2019s grid, leaving millions without reliable power and heat.\nAnd again \u2013 he failed. Ukraine stands \u2013 and stands strong. Europe stands \u2013 and stands strong. The world is reducing its dependence on Russian energy, accelerating the transition to the green economy.\nThis is possible, in no small part, because of the partnership between the United States and the European Union.\nThe U.S.-EU Energy Council has worked as never before to help make Europe more energy secure. The United States has more than doubled our supply of natural gas to the continent \u2013 exporting 56 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas last year. Because of these and other efforts, Russia\u2019s natural gas only accounted for about 16 percent of the EU\u2019s natural gas imports by the end of 2022 \u2013 compared to 37 percent in March of 2022. And as I mentioned, our supplies went up more than twofold \u2013 over 140 percent increase between 2021 and 2022.\nThe EU\u2019s leadership has been vital in this shift \u2013 for example, with its Save the Gas for a Safe Winter program, through which citizens voluntarily lowered their electricity use and used more energy efficient appliances. These and other efforts contributed to a 19 percent reduction in natural gas demand between August of 2022 and January of 2023.\nWe accelerated, as I mentioned, the clean energy transition. The U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security is helping our governments and private sector partners share information to boost energy efficiency and diversify supply, like deploying more heat pumps and smart thermostats.\nHere, too, the European Union has shown remarkable leadership, increasing its goal of energy from renewables from 40 percent to 45 percent by 2030. EU countries added roughly 50 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity last year \u2013 which together generated more electricity than natural gas in 2022.\nLast year, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in American history, and we\u2019re heartened that Europe too is working on ambitious clean energy incentives. Through the Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue, which President Biden and President von der Leyen launched last month, we are working together to make sure that these efforts are mutually reenforcing, so that our incentives create a positive feedback loop of innovation, investment for energy transition, jobs for our people.\nWe also come together to support Ukraine\u2019s energy needs. Together, the EU, the U.S., and our G7+ partners have delivered more than 4,000 power generators, 1,000 transformers, and more than 5 million pieces of equipment, like circuit breakers and cables, to help repair and replace the country\u2019s battered energy grid.\nToday, we\u2019ll talk about ways to continue rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. We\u2019ll also talk about our shared work to deploy new technologies like clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, among other efforts, to advance the energy transition across Europe and the United States.\nThese collective efforts are directly benefiting people on both sides of the Atlantic through more affordable, more reliable energy, good-paying jobs, and a safer, more sustainable future.\nToday\u2019s discussions will bring us one step closer to that future, and like everyone, I\u2019m eager to get the conversation started. So again, Josep, thanks so much for having us here today, and I look forward to our discussions.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-eu-high-representative-for-foreign-affairs-and-security-policy-josep-borrell-remarks-to-the-press/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

morning.\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0I\u2019m very happy to welcome you, Secretary Blinken, in Brussels.\u00a0We just had a very good bilateral meeting marking our great transatlantic cooperation.\u00a0Now we will co-chair the EU-U.S. Energy Council, and later we will see each other also at the NATO Ministerial.\nAllow me some words about our bilateral discussion.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, we start discussing and talking about the Russian war in Ukraine, the situation in Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, and the Middle East peace process.\nIt\u2019s more than one year ago that Putin start destroying Ukraine, and he seems determined to continue with his brutal bloodshed and destruction, and he still escalates further despite not achieving anything.\u00a0\u00a0His newest nuclear gamble \u2013 with nuclear weapons moved to Belarus \u2013 constitutes a new escalation and poses a direct threat to European security.\u00a0\u00a0And this comes, ironically, after Chinese President Xi visited Moscow and mentioned the need for peace and they agreed on the need to not deploy nuclear arms abroad.\u00a0\u00a0Some days later, Russia deployed tactical weapons \u2013 nuclear tactical weapons in Belarus.\nWe have been discussing with Secretary Blinken about the role of China on supporting Russia\u2019s blatant violations of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0\u00a0There is a clear expectation from a permanent member of the Security Council to stand up in defense of international rules-based order.\u00a0\u00a0And China has a moral duty to contribute to a fair peace.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot be siding with the aggressor.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot be militarily supporting the aggression.\nThis is our message to China, from today\u2019s meeting and from all the European Union\u2019s visits going to Beijing.\u00a0\u00a0Today, President von der Leyen will be in Beijing with French President Macron, Spanish Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez was there last week, and I will travel next week too.\u00a0\u00a0So, as you see, a lot of Europeans going to China.\nBut we have been clear with China that its position on Russia\u2019s atrocities and war crimes will determine the quality of our relations with Beijing.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, the European Union stands united and our transatlantic community remains also united.\u00a0\u00a0We are committed to continue supporting Ukraine in its self-defense, and we will maintain the collective pressure on Russia to stop the widespread violations of international law.\u00a0\u00a0We are doing everything we can militarily, politically, and providing financial support to ensure that Ukraine prevails.\nWe also talked about the Middle East, and we shared our concerns about the vicious cycle of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territories.\u00a0\u00a0The latest developments painfully demonstrate that the path towards a resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict is urgently needed.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciated the recent U.S. mediation efforts in Aqaba and Sharm el-Sheikh, and I also shared with you, Secretary Blinken, about my efforts together with partners in the Arab world to try to revive peace efforts by building on the Arab Peace Initiative and adding European peace contribution to it.\nWe also discussed about some topics in Africa.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, on Ethiopia, this was a major crisis, and now, fortunately, things start to move towards solving it.\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s one of the rare good news that we have in the world.\u00a0\u00a0And to sustain the current progress, it is important that the EU and U.S. continue working hand-in-hand.\u00a0\u00a0The message to both the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigrayans is to make them understand that we are watching the settling of the conflict and will only normalize our relations in a gradual way, step by step.\nOn Central African Republic, we exchanged views on the ongoing international efforts, including our own efforts, to help to stabilize the country so they did not have to rely on the Wagner mercenaries.\u00a0\u00a0You know that the Wagner mercenaries, this destructive group, has had a negative impact on each country where they are present, be in Central African Republic and others in the Sahelian area, contributing only to further destabilization and impacting negatively in the entire region.\nFinally, we are going to co-chair now the 10th EU-U.S. Energy Council, but this year is different from our previous meetings in Washington, and the past year has been marked by atrocities, war against Ukraine, and the unprecedented EU-U.S. coordination to support the country and to support our energy security in Europe.\u00a0\u00a0We, the European Union and its member-states, are the lead donors when it comes to energy assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0We have been able to get rid of the Russian dependency on gas, and we will discuss today about how to accelerate the green energy transition, reducing methane emissions, and launching a new global energy efficiency initiative.\u00a0\u00a0That also is a good news.\nThank you.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0And let me just start by thanking the High Representative, my friend Josep, for another very productive and timely meeting, building on the momentum that President Biden and European Commission President von der Leyen produced at the White House just last month.\nThis discussion today reinforced what has been evident to us for some time: U.S.-European Union relations have never been stronger or more important for advancing our shared interests.\nAfter more than a year of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, the stakes for our partnership could not be higher \u2013 for the transatlantic relationship; for Ukraine itself; indeed, for people around the world who are bearing many of the consequences of this aggression.\nThe United States and the EU continue to work in lockstep, together with a broad coalition of partners around the world, to ensure that Ukraine can defend itself, its people, its territory, the right to choose its own path.\nEuropean partners have spent about $13 billion in European \u2013 in military assistance thus far, on top of tens of billions more in economic and humanitarian assistance, extraordinary support for refugees who have come from Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0We very much appreciate the announcement from the EU that it will be providing an additional 2 billion in euros worth of ammunition through its European Peace Facility.\nTogether, we\u2019re freezing the assets of those fueling the Kremlin\u2019s aggression, deploying sweeping sanctions and export controls that are degrading Russia\u2019s capacity to wage war.\u00a0\u00a0The Kremlin\u2019s finances have been squeezed to devastating effect, forcing it to choose between pouring money into the war or providing for its own citizens.\u00a0\u00a0As one Russian billionaire starkly said of Russia\u2019s future: \u201cThere will be no money next year.\u201d\nThe United States and the European Union are further working together to defend the energy and food security of millions of people around the world who have been affected by President Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, to press for accountability for Russian atrocities, and to support meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve a just and durable peace.\nJosep and I also discussed the United States and Europe\u2019s unprecedented cooperation on energy security, and indeed, we\u2019ll take that up in more detail in a few minutes.\u00a0\u00a0We share a commitment to preventing a climate catastrophe, accelerating the global clean energy transition, building resilient, secure, and diversified supply chains for renewable energy \u2013 and doing it in a way that creates good-paying jobs and lowers costs for people on both sides of the Atlantic.\nRussia\u2019s weaponization of energy has underscored the urgency of that task \u2013 and an opportunity to accelerate our progress.\u00a0\u00a0And so, over the past year, the United States and Europe have thrown our energy security cooperation into even higher gear.\nIn 2022, the United States exported 56 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe: that is 40 percent of Europe\u2019s total imports; it\u2019s a 140 percent increase over our LNG exports to Europe the previous year.\u00a0\u00a0The European Union cut dependence on Russian gas from nearly 40 percent at the start of the war to about 15 percent by the end of 2022.\u00a0\u00a0That is extraordinary.\u00a0\u00a0When we convene the council in a few minutes, we will focus on how we can further reduce European dependence on Russian energy, and boost the Euro-Atlantic region\u2019s clean energy production.\nWe also spoke about our continued partnership on economic security.\u00a0\u00a0We have serious concerns about the challenges posed by economic coercion, by the weaponization of economic dependencies, and non-market policies and practices, including by the PRC, and we discussed ways to address these issues.\u00a0\u00a0Later this spring, we\u2019ll hold another meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, where these and other priorities will be on the agenda.\nAs Josep mentioned, we also did something of a tour of the world of challenging places and areas where our work together, our coordination, our cooperation can make a difference, from Ethiopia to the Central African Republic to the Middle East.\u00a0\u00a0And in all of these areas, the coordination between the United States and the European Union is as great and, indeed, I would say greater than it\u2019s ever been.\nFinally, running through our conversation was our focus on revitalizing our democracies and our democratic values \u2013 which bind us, and which brought hundreds of partners together just this week around the world and in Washington for the Summit for

is really a moment to just drop the mic and leave because \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 a few things I wanted to share with all of you, but I think the first and most important is this:\u00a0 Moments like this are important.\u00a0 We don\u2019t usually take the time, even half an hour, 45 minutes, to just press pause and reflect on something that we\u2019ve done, because there\u2019s just too much to do.\u00a0 And the inboxes are overflowing, and it\u2019s always move, move, move.\u00a0 But it is important to do that because when we\u2019re at our best, as each of you has been in this extraordinary chapter, it really is worth reflecting on.\u00a0 And I hope that it inspires, energizes, encourages each of us to keep going, to keep doing this, to keep with this calling that has drawn all of us together in this incredible enterprise.\nErin said something that is I think very powerful and it\u2019s that we get called upon to do lots of things in our careers here at State, other agencies.\u00a0 But there\u2019re not that many moments when you can really say and see directly that something you have done has actually changed someone\u2019s life, and changed it for the better.\u00a0 There\u2019s usually too many points of connection along the way to really see it and really feel it, but the experience that each of you has had \u2013 in this instance, I hope really makes that connection, makes it powerful, and is something that you\u2019ll take with you throughout your careers and throughout your lives no matter what you do going forward.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply the most powerful thing that we occasionally have an opportunity to do, and it really is worth reflecting on.\nTressa, my friend, my travel companion, colleague, this is the epitome of the person here who runs into the burning building every single time, no matter how challenging it is, and gets the job done.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen that again and again.\u00a0 I\u2019m so grateful once again to you for your incredible leadership in this instance.\nThe extraordinary team of volunteers \u2013 and that was a hugely important word, volunteers \u2013 that Mike shared with us.\u00a0 That just inspires me tremendously because, again, I\u2019ve seen it time and again in this department.\u00a0 When we\u2019ve had an urgency, when we\u2019ve had an emergency situation, when we\u2019ve had a daunting challenge, people have been raising their hands.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been standing up.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve been running \u2013 you\u2019ve been running \u2013 into the building, and that makes a huge difference.\u00a0 Your determination, your skill, your heart, which is also very apparent in the stories that we\u2019ve heard from Katherine, from Marta, from Josh, from Hannah, from Gail, from Michael \u2013 that truly is inspiring to me as well.\nAnd to everyone who is joining us today, including folks who are online, as well as everyone here in person, thank you for everything that you\u2019ve done; and thank you for sharing the stories.\u00a0 We know that for each of the six stories, seven stories that we just heard, there are hundreds more \u2013 from across the U.S. Government, from across NGOs \u2013 from people who stepped up to welcome the 222.\u00a0 And I hope that in some way, as well, we\u2019ll find a way to collect some of those stories and maybe share them with colleagues because \u2013 again, I think it\u2019s going to be incredibly inspiring to them.\nBut these doctors, these political leaders, these journalists, these priests, these others who all came together and found themselves together \u2013 as a result of your work \u2013 on that plane, they had one thing that connected them, one overriding aspiration, and that was to simply exercise their fundamental freedoms and to try to safeguard the freedom of their fellow citizens.\u00a0 Tragically, in Ortega\u2019s Nicaragua, that\u2019s a crime.\u00a0 It\u2019s why these activists were imprisoned for months and sometimes years; denied visits from their loved ones.\u00a0 Many were held in harsh conditions, little access to sunlight, to fresh air, writing materials, books.\u00a0 One prisoner recalled reading and re-reading the label on a tube of toothpaste.\nAnd as you\u2019ve heard, living with that constant fear that you could be pulled into another cell to be beaten up, to be tortured \u2013 the constant fear that you might even be executed.\u00a0 Living with that, every single day, is its own kind of horrific torture.\nBut it\u2019s precisely because of the power of their message, their actions, the alternative vision that they have for their own country and the way it should treat its own people \u2013 it\u2019s exactly why the regime stripped them of their citizenship soon after they came to the United States.\u00a0 That too speaks volumes.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also why we felt compelled to do what we could to bring them to safety. \u00a0And it\u2019s why the work that all of you did \u2013 and did together \u2013 was so important.\nNow, that work began, in large part, with our colleagues in Embassy Managua who negotiated with the Nicaraguan Government, creating a system to ensure that each of 222 prisoners was accounted for, and \u2013 when the moment finally came, during the early morning hours of February 9th \u2013 physically escorting them to the airplane and then to their freedom.\nKatherine talked about the \u2013 waiting for that final confirmation, and I know that\u2019s excruciating.\u00a0 And as this was all happening, and Brian and Erin and others were keeping me informed of what was going on, I have to admit, I wasn\u2019t so sure this was really going to come together.\u00a0 I had a funny feeling, oh, this is going to fall apart.\u00a0 It seems almost \u2013 almost too good to be true, but too good to be true because so much work actually goes into this.\u00a0 These things don\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 It takes the incredible effort that started in Managua to actually get it done.\nFrom there, more than 350 \u2013 more than 350 of our colleagues from the U.S. Government, as well as partners from the state of Virginia, NGOs \u2013 you all took over.\u00a0 You worked around the clock, you worked through the weekend, reuniting prisoners with their loved ones.\u00a0 You interpreted for them.\u00a0 You provided them with food, with clothing, with healthcare.\u00a0 You helped them through the jarring process of starting a new life far from their homes and their communities.\nAnd what I heard also in the stories that were told is I think you all responded in a powerfully human way, because I imagine as you\u2019re there with someone who has just had this absolute sea change in their life, you\u2019re thinking and feeling and understanding how totally jarring and disorienting that is \u2013 even in this incredibly positive way.\u00a0 And the humanity that you showed as fellow human beings in helping them navigate this particular passage \u2013 that in and of itself was hugely important.\nAnd indeed, it wasn\u2019t just what you did, it\u2019s how you did it: with care, with compassion, by asking each of our Nicaraguan friends how are you doing, are you okay, what do you need \u2013 probably a question they hadn\u2019t been asked in a long, long time.\u00a0 By arriving at the tarmac with American colleagues that they knew from the past, they were welcomed by familiar faces.\u00a0 And Marta, I know that must have had a powerful impact on them as well.\nAs one of the volunteers put it, \u201cThe whole operation was successful because we all cared too much to accept anything less.\u201d\nNow, because of this work, our Nicaraguan friends are beginning new lives across more than two dozen U.S. states, some now moving on to other countries as well.\u00a0 Some have already jumped back into activism \u2013 no surprise \u2013 rallying international support and pressure for a better future for their country at the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Summit for Democracy just this week.\u00a0 At the summit, we heard some of these voices.\u00a0 Others are starting the process of opening new businesses, continuing their studies, getting on with their lives that were so violently interrupted by the Nicaraguan regime.\nNow, in the months ahead, we have our NGO partners that will continue to support the recent arrivals\u2019 relocation.\u00a0 We have our embassy colleagues who will work to reunify family members in Nicaragua with their newly settled family members in the United States.\u00a0 So, this process goes forward.\u00a0 It carries on.\nAnd at the same time, for us, a government, we\u2019ll join our partners across the hemisphere and around the world to continue to push for a return to democracy and respect for human rights in Nicaragua, while also using all of the diplomatic and economic tools that we have to try to promote accountability for the widespread abuses from the regime.\nSo, in a very small period of time, in a very intense way, you gave us a reminder of who we are when we\u2019re at our best \u2013 which is not every day, but it was in the days that you were engaged in this mission: a country that stands with those on the side of freedom and human rights, and fights for our democratic values around the world.\u00a0 You\u2019ve demonstrated that with your service; you\u2019ve demonstrated that with your dedication.\nSo, I\u2019m so glad we just had a few moments together, again, to press the pause button, to reflect a little bit on what each of you has done, and to take that with you going forward because this career that all of you have been called to in a variety of ways, I know a lot of days can be frustrating.\u00a0 I know we pile on the work.\u00a0 The inbox gets higher, the resources seem to get \u2013 to shrink, and we\u2019re working on all of that.\u00a0 And I know there are days for each of us when we say, is it worth it?\u00a0 Maybe I should be doing something else.\nI hope and I believe strongly that this experience is a reminder of what an incredible pursuit this is, what an incredible responsibility we all have, but also what an incredible privilege it is to actually work for, represent your country, and try to make sure that the country that we love and share and the department that we love and share is actually operating at its best.\u00a0 In this instance it was because you were.\u00a0 And I just wanted to thank you on behalf of the President and as a fellow American.\u00a0 Thanks for exemplary work.\u00a0 Thanks for your service to our country.\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url":

more able to address the issues that matter most in the lives and livelihoods of their populations, whether it\u2019s protecting public health, advancing children\u2019s education, expanding economic opportunity.\nAnd we know that the pursuit of a stronger, freer, more democratic future is shared by people and governments from big and small countries, North and South, developed and developing.\nAs President Biden has said, democracy doesn\u2019t happen by accident.\u00a0 It requires constant effort, constant tending by each new generation \u2013 and by each of us.\u00a0 And indeed, we are at an inflection point when it comes to the future of democracy, where a defining question of this time is whether we are willing to do what it takes to make sure that democracies continue to deliver for their people, continue to thrive.\nThroughout this Year of Action, this group has answered that question with a resounding yes.\u00a0 Since the last Summit for Democracy, we have made \u2013 and we are delivering on \u2013 over 700 commitments that help us defend and strengthen democratic values and institutions.\nThese commitments include new laws and initiatives to combat corruption \u2013 like Ecuador\u2019s new National Anti-Corruption Strategy, the Dominican Republic\u2019s Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture, and Australia\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Commission Act.\nSteps to support a free and independent press \u2013 including the contributions of France, Slovakia, New Zealand, and the United States to initiatives that help independent news outlets become more financially stable and sustainable, and protect journalists, as well as the abolition of laws, as in Zambia, that could be used to silence government critics.\nGovernments have taken measures to bolster democratic institutions, including judicial reform in Albania and Angola; to encourage inclusive representation in government, particularly by women, members of the LGBTQI+ community, and other historically marginalized groups.\nAnd many have taken action to protect civic and human rights.\u00a0 The Democratic Republic of Congo passed landmark legislation to recognize indigenous peoples\u2019 land and cultural rights.\u00a0 Taiwan lifted barriers to prevent the recognition of transnational same-sex marriage.\u00a0 Nepal passed legislation to punish perpetrators of acid attacks and rape, to name just a few.\nThese national commitments are significant.\u00a0 They\u2019re making a difference, an actual difference, in the lives of millions of people around the world.\u00a0 And as we close this second Summit for Democracy, as we prepare for summits to come, we\u2019ll continue to help one another sustain, adapt, and build on our collective efforts.\nBecause President Biden believes deeply \u2013 as do I \u2013 that safeguarding our democracies is a collective effort, one that depends on our governments and on our people working together.\u00a0 Because all people, all nations, all sectors have contributions to make.\u00a0 And for sure, none of us has a monopoly on ideas, never mind good ideas.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why we tried to bring such a wide-ranging group of summit participants together to drive progress on shared priorities \u2013 from promoting youth engagement in politics, supporting an independent press, securing free and fair elections \u2013 and, as we discussed today, shaping the norms around the internet and emerging technologies.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why such a major focus of our work leading up to this summit, and in the months that will follow it, is on multilateral efforts \u2013 including Democracy Cohorts: innovative platforms that bring governments together with leading civil society and private sector groups.\nThis\u00a0shared fight against corruption is just one powerful example of why we need to work together across borders and with partners across our societies.\u00a0 And there has been \u2013 and I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019ve done it \u2013 real focus on combating corruption through our Summit for Democracy process.\nWe know that corruption is a transnational scourge.\u00a0 It discourages investment.\u00a0 It stifles competition.\u00a0 It deepens inequities.\u00a0 And maybe worst of all, it erodes public trust in government and institutions.\nEvery country, unfortunately, has experience in fighting corruption \u2013 experience that we need to be sharing with one another.\u00a0 Over the last 15 months, the United States, together with the Brookings Institution and the Open Government Partnership \u2013 which includes 76 countries, 106 local governments, representing more than 2 billion people, and thousands of civil society organizations \u2013 we\u2019ve been leading a new Financial Transparency and Integrity Democracy Cohort to do just that, to come together, to bring our experiences, our knowledge, and our efforts together in combating corruption.\nBringing these diverse perspectives together, the Cohort has worked to study the problem across regions.\u00a0 And it\u2019s crafting actual solutions based on lessons learned, based on best practices from member countries.\u00a0 Guidelines put together by the Cohort will help prevent bad actors from shielding illicit activity behind shell companies, stopping corrupt government officials and their cronies from enriching themselves, making sure that gatekeepers of the financial system \u2013 lawyers, accountants, investment managers \u2013 don\u2019t enable money laundering.\nThis work \u2013 this summit \u2013 is about looking inward at our democracies: recognizing our challenges, striving to do better by our people.\nAnd in a very profound way, I believe that\u2019s what distinguishes democracies: our willingness to confront these challenges \u2013 out in the open, transparently; to acknowledge our shortcomings \u2013 not to sweep them under the rug, not to pretend they don\u2019t exist.\u00a0 That is one of our greatest strengths.\u00a0 It\u2019s what we mean in the United States when we commit to the enduring task of forming a more perfect union.\nWe don\u2019t believe that we hold all the solutions \u2013 far from it.\u00a0 But we do know that when we join together with our fellow democracies, we make one another stronger, more resilient, more responsive to our citizens, and better able to do what we\u2019re here to do, which is to deliver for them \u2013 and, I hope, for the world.\nSo to each of you who are still here hanging in there at the end of the day, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your participation.\u00a0 Thank you for your engagement \u2013 but not just today, every single day \u2013 in doing this work.\u00a0 It matters.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a difference, and I can think of no recent time in history when it\u2019s been more vital.\u00a0 So thanks to everyone.\u00a0 Have a great evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-session-on-advancing-democracy-and-internet-freedom-in-a-digital-age-summit-for-democracy/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken.\u00a0 To build a more rights-respecting future, it\u2019s clear that democracies need to define an affirmative vision for how technology can promote democracy.\u00a0 Our first session, Advancing Democracy and Internet Freedom in a Digital Age, will help us think through how we might craft a world in which technology and democracy are mutually reinforcing.\nWe\u2019re joined today by three speakers; let me introduce them now.\u00a0 Jorge Arg\u00fcello is ambassador of Argentina to the United States.\u00a0 Nighat Dad \u2013 (applause) \u2013 Nighat Dad is executive director of Digital Rights Foundation.\u00a0 And Funke Opeke is CEO and founder of Main One.\u00a0 And I will now give the floor \u2013 (applause) \u2013 back to our moderator for this session, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Jeanne.\u00a0 So this is what I really like, because I actually get to ask the questions for once.\u00a0 And we have a great group of colleagues to hear from, to listen to, and to learn from.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really thrilled to be able to join each of you today and to, I think, focus on a few things.\u00a0 I think we all recognize that democracies have to make an affirmative case for how societies can leverage technology to actually advance, to make progress, and, as we were talking about just few minutes ago, to actually try to deliver positive results for our people.\u00a0 And I think we also recognize that the same human rights that we are so engaged in defending offline have to be also respected online, and this is one of the big challenges of our time.\u00a0 We have to have an internet, we have to have a digital ecosystem that respects and protects those rights, and each of you in different ways is engaged in that.\nSo a few things that I wanted to try to put on the table and invite our colleagues to talk about.\u00a0 First of all, my friend Ambassador Arg\u00fcello \u2013 Argentina is a member of the Freedom Online Coalition.\u00a0 We\u2019re very proud to chair this effort, and many in this room are members.\u00a0 As you\u2019re looking at it from Argentina\u2019s perspective, tell us a little bit about how you see Argentina working to advance internet freedom and to protect the space that we all have to share.\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0 Perfect.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary, Antony.\u00a0 Good morning to everyone here.\u00a0 First and foremost, I would like to stress that our country\u2019s highly honored to be part of this important event, as well as to be part of the second Summit for Democracy and endorse its final declaration.\u00a0 As you all know \u2013 and you probably know or you may know \u2013 our President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, the president of Argentina, was in Washington, D.C., yesterday in order to have a bilateral meeting with President Biden, which was held yesterday at the White House.\u00a0 Our Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero was part of the presidential delegation.\u00a0 He received the invitation to participate in this panel as a speaker.\u00a0 Unfortunately, he was called away for last-minute business and he is now in Buenos Aires for what he asked me to convey: his deepest apologies to you all.\nBut let me now turn to the topic that gathers us today.\u00a0 Information and communication technologies are in process of constant progress and have become fundamental tools that improve productivity for development, both economically and socially, fostering greater participation of societies and allowing better access to knowledge while promoting the strengthening of education in our countries.\u00a0 Likewise, and from the point of view of government interaction with citizens within the framework of truly democratic societies, these technologies have enhanced the capacity to provide quality, agile services with greater transparency, open communications, and greater participation.\u00a0 In this sense, increasing access to these technologies while strengthening connectivity and achieving the universalization of ICT services is a clear priority that allows us to avoid digital exclusion and reduce inequality \u2013 and reduce inequality.\nTherefore, aspiring to a knowledge society cannot be dissociated from the achievement of the highest possible levels of social inclusion.\u00a0 The achievement of one will not be fair or democratic if it is not built on the basis of the other.\u00a0 The adoption and implementation of technologies are still a challenge for many countries because, while some technologies make leaps of great magnitudes, certain technologies, groups, industries, sectors, workers go at a different pace and require a different policy approach.\u00a0 We must look closely at the different divides \u2013 gender, rural, industrial systems, security systems \u2013 and analyze together, with the private sector and civil society, which are the best policies to address those gaps.\nIn Argentina, ARSAT, the state-owned telecommunications company which operates the federal fiber optic network, plays a key role in connecting the unconnected, reaching the demand of small- and medium-sized companies, cooperatives, and rural areas.\u00a0 ARSAT, the company, was present some weeks ago here in D.C. for the SATELLITE Conference\u00a0and had many meetings with U.S. Government and companies to enhance cooperation in telecommunication and data centers.\u00a0 Also, it is important to highlight that in Argentina, fundamental human rights are protected by a solid legal framework guaranteed by our national constitution and in international treaties that have a constitutional hierarchy.\u00a0 The exercise of the rights of freedom of expression and association and the right to privacy is protected and guaranteed in the virtual and real world by the three branches of government.\nBearing this in mind, I would like to share with you some important milestones of our laws and policies regarding the ICTs.\nArgentina has a law which states that \u2013 and I\u2019m going to read \u2013 the search, reception, and dissemination of information and ideas of all kinds through the internet service is considered to be included within the constitutional guarantee that protects freedom of expression.\u00a0 Another law guarantees the complete neutrality of networks in all telecommunications services and ICT developments.\nNow, due to the boost we provide to the ICT sector, knowledge-based services represent the fourth \u2013 the fourth largest export complex in Argentina, and the development of Argentine technology companies with high levels of competitiveness is on the rise.\u00a0 We have also adopted a new knowledge economy law which broadens and deepens incentives into the sector.\u00a0 Likewise, under the firm conviction that certain vulnerable groups deserve special protection, in 2020 we sanctioned a law which creates a national program for the prevention and awareness of grooming or cyber bullying against children and adolescents, a crime that was also incorporated to our national criminal code.\nOn the other hand, regarding hate speech and its dissemination, it is worth mentioning that such crime is contemplated.\u00a0 As an open, multicultural, and multireligious society, in Argentina we strongly believe in our duty to work for an internet free of hate speech.\u00a0 Our rejection of online terrorism is clear and resounding.\u00a0 Argentina adhered to the Christchurch Call in September 2019.\u00a0 The call focuses on the delicate and sensitive balance between security considerations and freedom of expression and data privacy.\u00a0 Argentina has participated in many areas regarding the right of freedom of expression in digital context.\u00a0 We have adhered to a number of international instances, such as the Information and Democracy Forum or the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.\u00a0 Likewise, since June 2016, Argentina has been a member of the Freedom Online Coalition, and we are very proud to work in that sense.\nIn that regard, we wish the U.S. every success in its new chairmanship and reiterate our willingness to work together constructively.\u00a0 The Argentine Republic plays an active role in international and regional forums on issues related to human rights in the digital environment.\nFinally, Antony, and before giving back the floor to you, I would like to reaffirm our country\u2019s deep commitment to the development of information and communication technologies as fundamental tools for the empowerment of our peoples, with free access, without exclusion, which allows a true strengthening of societies, helping education and culture and access to information, as well as a better economic development.\u00a0 We \u2013 government along with the private sector along with the civil society \u2013 must tirelessly work together to make this happen.\nThank you very much, Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Ambassador, thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you for sharing that with all of us.\nLet\u2019s talk a little bit about digital inclusion.\u00a0 So, Ms. Dad, you are working to do exactly that: to try to make sure that women and girls, other marginalized communities are able to access technology and use it to thrive.\u00a0 So what I want to focus on here is your own experience through civil society in advancing rights and inclusion in the digital ecosystem.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Firstly, it\u2019s a pleasure to share this panel with esteemed panelists.\u00a0 As a civil society in past few years, we have had a front-row seat in seeing the role of digital technologies and internet in both advancing democracies and undermining institutions integral to a free democratic space.\u00a0 And holding these two realities together is important as we truly want to present a holistic picture of the role that technologies play in our democracies.\nThese two binaries also come as no surprise to me, having worked with young women and girls in Pakistan regarding their access to technologies and internet, which can be both as a liberating space in their lives but also abuse and violence not only online but offline as well.\u00a0 So it\u2019s really important that when we all are talking about digital rights, we center the experiences of marginalized groups \u2013 young women and girls, female journalists, women human rights defenders, activists \u2013 when we talk about democracy in the digital age, because\u00a0these experiences have a lot to teach us.\u00a0 And when it comes to technologies and digital spaces, there are two very main stakeholders who are dominating this space.\u00a0 One is governments around the world and the second is tech companies, platforms.\nOn one hand we have governments scrambling to acquire technologies and pass laws that would allow them to control the internet and dominate the pervasive narratives in these spaces.\u00a0 The loss of control over the information we consume and who gets to speak has been troubling for governments with long histories of interrupted and weak democratic rule.\u00a0 Even in countries where rule of law is strong, we \u2013 what we have seen is that they also struggle to come up with really good regulations, the regulations that respect international human rights framework.\nAnd on the other hand, we have powerful platforms dominating this space with so much space, profit margins, power to control content and our data, and often we have seen that \u2013 in my experience, the decade-long work, that we have seen that they are mostly unaccountable towards their \u2013 towards the governments but also mainly towards the users who should be the center of the conversation in these spaces.\nAnd this sort of throws up fundamental question about democracy:\u00a0 Do we want powerful tech companies to decide our democratic future?\u00a0 And while we are looking into these questions about governments and powerful companies, I think it\u2019s important to talk about solutions also, and there is this one solution which is self-regulatory model.\u00a0 It\u2019s an independent \u2013 Meta\u2019s Oversight Board that the company came up with a solution to hold itself accountable.\nBut the question is:\u00a0 Are they holding themself accountable independently and transparently?\u00a0 And the answer is that just this model that came up three years ago, where the people who are actually making decisions around content moderation of this platform are from diverse background.\u00a0 I sit on the board.\u00a0 I am from global majority.\u00a0 English is not my first language.\u00a0 I bring experiences of the marginalized groups not only from Pakistan but South Asia.\u00a0 But then telling companies sitting on this board that the decision that you are making are not truly democratic, are not following international human rights framework, and then come up with solution to tell them what they can do in these situations.\u00a0 And how we are making ourselves transparent is that \u2013 actually releasing our reports, the progress that we have made, the progress that the company has made so far.\u00a0 So I think these are the regulatory models I feel are so important to hold these companies accountable.\nAnd if I talk about my own personal experience as Digital Rights Foundation head in Pakistan, I feel that the global majority is actually at the end of \u2013 at the receiving end the decisions that the Global North, not only governments but the tech platforms, make.\u00a0 And there is very little say of the users, especially from Global South or global majority.\u00a0 There are such initiatives, local initiatives \u2013 if you look around, there are so many civil society organizations around the world who have been working on digital rights for such a long time.\u00a0 They have come up with local solutions.\u00a0 They have been part of international debates.\u00a0 But I think \u2013 and we\u2019ll speak about this later in the panel conversation as well \u2013 that these local solutions need to be taken into account in the global conversations.\u00a0 We cannot really come up with a top-down approach.\u00a0 I think we really need to see what people are locally doing, how they are contextualizing this issue, how they are holding their governments accountable who are coming up with bad regulations and laws while preserving speech in the online space, at the same time holding people in the Global North accountable, that what they are deciding can set bad precedents for the authoritarian regimes as well.\nThank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I think particularly the last point that you were making about the need to look to local solutions, to look to local ideas, to do this from the bottom up and the middle out not just the top down, is going to be vital to success and ultimately to having sustainable ways of doing things, because if people are not bought in, they will opt out one way or the other.\u00a0 So appreciate that very much.\nAccessibility.\u00a0 Ms. Opeke, tell us about how you are looking at this in the work that you\u2019re doing in Africa, and particularly operationalizing accessibility.\u00a0 We talked about this a little bit earlier, but we always run the risk with new technologies of having totally bifurcated worlds and those who have access to them, those who don\u2019t.\u00a0 And this is a vital part of your mission.\u00a0 Tell us how you\u2019re seeing it.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, and truly is an honor to be part of this distinguished panel.\u00a0 As you mentioned, Main One, which is a company that I run, was founded in 2008 to address the digital divide in Africa.\u00a0 It was informed \u2013 the vision was informed at that time with the reality that internet access was only a 10 percent penetration rate when the rest of the world was at 50 percent.\u00a0 Today we have 70 percent global internet penetration, but most of the African continent is at 50 percent or below.\nAnd so we set out to try to close that gap with a focus on West Africa.\u00a0 Now, how were we able to do that?\u00a0 Nigeria, which is the company that \u2013 country that I am from, had returned to democratic rule in 1999, and coming in 2001 on the heels of that was a liberalization of the telecommunications sector, which enabled private sector companies to deploy telecoms infrastructure for the first time to deliver to\u00a0citizens.\u00a0 And so coming on the heels of that, we were able to obtain licenses in Nigeria and Ghana, the first private licenses for open access submarine cables to connect West Africa to the rest of the world through Europe.\u00a0 Doing that, building that 7,000 kilometer cable, which initially served two countries in West Africa but is delivering a mix of services to 11 countries today, is part of what has enabled that growth in access to 50 percent.\nSo what really are the building blocks on which we did that, first, was the liberalization.\u00a0 And it is worth noting that not all African countries today have liberalized their telecommunications laws, which says in the \u2013 that the shortage of resources and the large infrastructure deficits that a lot of these countries face, they\u2019re not able to accelerate digital transformation of the economies because they\u2019re not enabling private capital to come in.\u00a0 The next step of our journey, of course, was private capital.\u00a0 And the African Development Bank was a key anchor, so having the kind of patient, more risk, higher-risk appetite capital to come into this market; obviously, skills; and then access to technology, where we had an American company with a depth of experience and capacity deploy the network for us.\nSo what do we see today is that the work is not done yet.\u00a0 And of course, as you go further down the pyramid and try to enable access and more inclusion, it does get more challenging. The word is\u2026what we have to do in these economics is to truly grow the market. \u00a0Because the value chain, in terms of realizing the return from investment in digital infrastructure, is simply not as mature as what you have in the advanced economies. \u00a0So there is a lot of partnering. \u00a0There is a need for patient capital to consider the affordability and also consider the provision of other elements in the value chain.\u00a0 Which is places like Lagos, Nigeria or Cape Town, South Africa or Nairobi, Kenya on the African continent your starting to see today.\u00a0 But there\u2019s still a lot more to be done.\nThe obvious returns are, there are successful companies of scale delivering the services on the African continent, so it proves that it can be done; and that delivering such infrastructure is also providing dividends for democracy, because as you have greater shared prosperity, job creation, financial inclusion, access to services, people are able to drive better outcomes, they\u2019re able to reduce unemployment rates for more people to work.\nAfrica, when you think of it, with 50 percent internet penetration of a population of 1.4 billion, that\u2019s about 700 million people.\u00a0 The average age on the continent is 19, who do not have access and constitute the workforce of tomorrow.\u00a0 So getting the access to those who have currently been excluded so they can form part of this fabric we are building is really critical.\u00a0 And that\u2019s \u2013 building the partnership to enable that is, I think, going to be critical to get there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I really want to underscore the point that you made about this not being a favor that one group of countries may be doing for another.\u00a0 It\u2019s profoundly in everyone\u2019s interests.\u00a0 And in the case of Africa, as you point out, the next 20 years we\u2019ll have one in four people on this planet being from and of Africa, so bridging these divides is going to be hugely important.\nI want to come back to one thing that you mentioned, then maybe we can go a little deeper on some of the things that people have already touched on.\u00a0 You mentioned the importance of private capital.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And of course, that\u2019s exactly right.\u00a0 And most of our governments, most of our systems, can\u2019t simply dedicate and direct state resources to some of these challenges.\u00a0 What we can do, what our comparative advantage is, is in catalyzing and leveraging private sector investment.\nBased on this experience, though, what do you see \u2013 and you\u2019ve touched on it a little bit \u2013 as some of the impediments to that?\u00a0 And then, are there any thoughts that you have about how that can be facilitated?\u00a0 You mentioned the need to actually make markets.\u00a0 I\u2019m hopeful, for example, that as the free trade area in Africa actually emerges and we get beyond this abnormal situation where African countries trade more with countries outside of Africa than they do with themselves, that will also help create markets that attract investment in an easier way.\u00a0 But are there other things that come to mind based on your experience?\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, understood about governments not being able to write checks, open checks to drive private infrastructure investment in developing countries.\u00a0 However, for the funds that have been identified, I believe helping to create the frameworks, a lot of these lesser developed economies do not have strong institutions.\u00a0 One of the areas where progress can be made and impacts can be driven is helping to strengthen the frameworks, helping to strengthen the work of institutions that are set up to establish and guide those examples.\u00a0 And I really think that\u2019s where the most impact can be made.\nAs you mentioned also with the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, implementation has not kept pace with expectations that were set a few years ago when the free trades agreement went into effect.\u00a0 So what can be done and based on the U.S. experience in setting up and working with such agreements to actually facilitate implementation and impact?\u00a0 I believe that\u2019s probably where the most impact can be had for the kind of checks that can be written by the U.S. Government.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 So we have an expression:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m from the federal government;\u00a0 I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I\u2019m from the federal government; I\u2019m here to help.\nFrom the perspective of civil society, what can governments be doing better, more effectively, to make sure that we\u2019re advancing inclusion, that we\u2019re making sure that in particularly underserved people, community groups, have the benefit of accessibility and also are not finding themselves in the situation where these tools and this technology is actually being used against them?\nMS DAD:\u00a0\u00a0I think for that, there has been a lot of conversation around including civil society in these conversations.\u00a0 I think, first and foremost, is we need to really see who are the people from civil society in these conversations.\u00a0 Are these only people from Western democracy and Global North?\u00a0 And if civil society from global majority is not part of this conversation, then why not?\u00a0 And I think that leads us to the conversation where civil society is being \u2013 the civic space has been eroded very slowly, very gradually, and no one even felt that.\u00a0 And I think what Western democracies who are setting good precedents, they can also hold those governments accountable, that why this is happening, why these civil \u2013 civil society cannot participate in these conversations if they are not truly liberated.\nAnd I think the second point is are they \u2013 do they have resources to do that?\u00a0 I think empowering them, not only making them included in these conversations but also do they have money to do that.\u00a0 And I think while I\u2019m saying these resources, I have seen people doing a lot of labor in these countries for \u2013 labor towards these companies, telling them what are the gaps that they have so that they can make these online spaces safer for their own communities, and telling government that the laws that they are making are problematic.\u00a0 So it\u2019s free labor; it\u2019s a thankless job.\u00a0 And I think what governments like U.S. can do is actually help empowering civil society, not only in their own jurisdiction but around the world, and hold other governments accountable what exactly they are doing to keep these space safer and freer for civil society.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAmbassador, any thoughts from the perspective of your country, your government, both on these questions of inclusion and these questions of accessibility?\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 Well, first of all, I would like to stress the importance of the battle we are facing, and allow me to congratulate you for calling for this gathering.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s very important to share the floor with my Nigerian and Pakistani friend.\u00a0 They do a very important work in their countries from the civil society.\u00a0 And something \u2013 what we must having clear is that they there must be an alliance between the government, the civil society, and the private sector.\u00a0 Otherwise we \u2013 it will not fly.\u00a0 And what we are trying to do is precisely \u2013 is to have it flying.\nIn the case of our country, we are working with different international initiatives.\u00a0 I wrote here the information for Democracy Forum \u2013 we have been working together in that sense \u2013 the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and the Freedom for \u2013 Online Coalition.\u00a0 These are our main activities we develop in the international field.\u00a0 And I would like to stress something that Funke just said:\u00a0 The work is not done yet.\u00a0 The battle is starting.\u00a0 Our democracy \u2013 the national democracy, the international democracy, the freedom is at stake.\u00a0 So we must take \u2013 be part of this discussion.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m cognizant of time \u2013 I want to make sure that we get some other people in on this conversation.\u00a0 So we have a number of \u2013 probably 600 experts in this audience today, but we can\u2019t hear from everyone.\u00a0 But there are a few people I\u2019d like to call on just to get perspectives and also any questions that you have for our wonderful panelists.\nSo Amalia Toledo from the Wikimedia Foundation, who\u2019s working on technology\u2019s impacts on human rights.\u00a0 Amalia, are you here?\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you to the panel.\u00a0 My question is (inaudible) digitalization happening across government \u2013 how can they ensure that tech companies are respecting the human rights of individuals?\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 If I may, I think that\u2019s a very important question because \u2013 and it needs a clear answer.\u00a0 There is only one way to guarantee that, and it\u2019s the development of a strong legal framework.\u00a0 So I want to reiterate there is an alliance to be \u2013 to put on the table between the government, the civil society, and the private sector.\u00a0 Otherwise, we won\u2019t be able to protect the right of freedom of expression, both, as you said, Antony, online and offline.\u00a0 So I think that that\u2019s our main target to play.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Other thoughts on this?\nMS DAD:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, I mean, yes, governments are powerful, and they are already bringing lot of regulations and laws to hold companies accountable.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s important that we look into other mechanisms where these platforms find themselves accountable as well.\u00a0 And one initiative I have already mentioned, like independent oversight body, which is truly independent, and which is also transparent.\nBut I would also like to be very cautious towards giving an only solution, like regulatory framework and laws, because it really doesn\u2019t work for everyone around the world.\u00a0 There are regulations and laws that we have seen that were made in the name of protecting young women and girls in the online space, cyber harassment, abuse, hate speech, disinformation, but those laws have been weaponized against the very same people.\u00a0 So I think we really need to see how those laws are being made, whether the governments are following international human rights framework, whether civil society is part of those conversations while these laws are being drafted and then implemented, and whether the judges are actually trained to develop good jurisprudence.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNext from our audience, Frane Maroevi\u0107 from the International Press Institute, who\u2019s working on advancing press freedoms around the world.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, excellencies and ladies and gentlemen.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be interested, as digitalization is happening across governments and different departments are working, how can\u00a0you ensure that it\u2019s all coordinated around the human rights agenda, that the human rights is at the focus of the work of each government department as they work on digitalization and promoting media freedom?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good question.\u00a0 Anyone want to jump in?\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Well, maybe that\u2019s for you, Secretary.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I was afraid you were going to say that.\u00a0 No, it\u2019s a hugely important question, and it goes to the work that we\u2019re trying to do to make sure that questions, obligations, responsibilities when it comes to human rights are infused in pretty much everything we do, including in places in our own department that might not naturally take that perspective into account when they\u2019re trying to formulate policy or advance policy.\nSo one of the challenges, I think, for particularly our organizations in government is to make sure that we\u2019re working horizontally as much as possible, because virtually everything we\u2019re talking about today connects to the equities of seven, eight, 10, 12 different offices in my own department, and it\u2019s the same, I\u2019m sure, for the ambassador and other colleagues in government.\nSo one of the things that we\u2019ve made a real effort to do is to make sure that in each of our bureaus, both from a geographic perspective but also a functional perspective \u2013 the human rights perspective and dimension is included in the deliberations.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019ve tried to bring together in the State Department, under one roof, all of these questions, to include the human rights dimension of technology in a new bureau that we stood up for Cyberspace and Digital Policy as well as for emerging technologies.\nSo partly this is a question of making sure that the direction, the responsibility to do that is clearly communicated, but it\u2019s also about setting up the mechanisms within government to make sure that that voice, that perspective is being included \u2013 and we\u2019ve tried to organize ourselves to do that.\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve had a similar experience.\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 Yes, I do.\u00a0 I agree with what you have said.\u00a0 I would add that our target, what we are pursuing when we talk about human rights, is a key word.\u00a0 We are trying to guarantee access.\u00a0 We are \u2013 for everybody, for everyone all over the world.\u00a0 We are trying to guarantee a true democratization of knowledge.\u00a0 That\u2019s human rights.\nAnd allow me to celebrate a decision made by the Biden administration.\u00a0 Argentina has a very firm stand in the human rights field, probably because of our own terrible experience during the last dictatorships in the \u201870s, but I said the international community is still celebrating the return of the U.S. to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations.\u00a0 We are working together.\u00a0 We are coordinating every action, not only between us but with all the members of the committee \u2013 the commission.\u00a0 But I think that is very important, and that will allow us to contribute to guarantee that everybody in \u2013 can engage in this public discussion.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0 I would like to speak from the standpoint of weaker democracies who \u2013 which governments are not necessarily inclined to protect human rights.\u00a0 And in such economies or such countries, what we\u2019re finding is access in and of itself starts providing citizens with a voice and a means of easier, faster information dissemination to call attention to the issues and actually push for their rights to be protected.\u00a0 So taking another \u2013 yes, there are governments that are working actively to promote human rights, but there are also governments who want to silence those dissenting voices, and the more access is enabled and is free and affordable, the more we\u2019re able to have those dissenting voices speak up.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s a very powerful point.\u00a0 I\u2019ll give you one other example, Frane, because you\u2019re working on press freedom every single day.\u00a0 One of the things we see from autocratic governance is an effort basically to use lawfare to silence journalists who are just doing their jobs.\u00a0 At this very summit a year ago, one of the initiatives that came out of it was standing up a fund to \u2013 that journalists, media enterprises, particularly small, independent media that usually doesn\u2019t have the resources \u2013 a fund that they can tap into if they\u2019re on the receiving end of bogus legal proceedings that are trying in effect to drive them out of business.\u00a0 That\u2019s just one initiative among many as we look at what is being done and how technology is being used or misused to try to silence voices, whether it\u2019s from media or from civil society or human rights defenders.\u00a0 We\u2019re also looking at what tools can we provide to help them more effectively defend themselves, and that\u2019s just one example.\nJohn Morris from the Internet Society, working on expanding internet access and freedom.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 At the Internet Society, we believe that the internet, the globally \u2013 the open, globally connected, secure, and trustworthy internet is a tremendous enabler of democracy, but increasingly decisions in government \u2013 by governments in democratic countries and non-democratic countries are threatening the internet\u2019s operations and its global nature.\u00a0 So my question is:\u00a0 How can we ensure that governments proactively assess the potential harmful impact on the internet from their policy proposals so that we don\u2019t inadvertently undermine both global speech, global internet access, and democracy worldwide?\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 I think we should stress the importance of the civil society.\u00a0 You have invited three of us; two of them come from the civil society, NGOs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s very important, because it\u2019s true that not every government works in this direction.\u00a0 Some governments do exactly the contrary.\u00a0 So the multilateral fora, the civil \u2013 the organizations from the civil society are called to play a key role in this issue.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, I couldn\u2019t agree more with that.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s imperative on us in government in particular to make sure that we have all of the different stakeholders in on the takeoff, not just on the landing, precisely because we need to make sure that we\u2019re factoring in these different perspectives, precisely because there are inevitably \u2013 to your point \u2013 second- and third-order consequences that we may not see because we\u2019re coming at it from one perspective that we need to be able to identify upfront before it\u2019s too late, and we actually have an effect that is not the one that we wanted to have.\nAnd it goes to a point I was making earlier when I was speaking, and I\u2019ve found this over 30 years in government, particularly when it comes to technology.\u00a0 The pace with which it\u2019s moving is so fast and the relative lack of expertise in government is such that we\u2019re constantly playing\u00a0catch-up, and just understanding \u2013 never mind trying to figure out what is the appropriate rule, norm, regulation that actually makes sense, doesn\u2019t have second- and third-order consequences that we don\u2019t like, that somehow balances the different equities that are in play.\nI think one of the answers to this for me, besides making sure that the stakeholders are at the table from the takeoff, is actually to make sure that in government itself we have more of this expertise and that it\u2019s not only, as important as that is, so-called outside stakeholders that are involved, but within our own institutions we have people who have come up in these disciplines, who bring that perspective to bear, and can make a huge difference in making \u2013 helping us to make policy.\nOne of the things that struck me some years ago in government was so much of what we do actually has a technological or innovative solution as part, at least, of the answer, what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But so many of us again are not coming up in these disciplines, and we need technologists, innovators, civil society, and others in the room, sometimes even just to tell us whether we need technologists, innovators, and civil societies in the room because, again, it\u2019s identifying a problem from the outset that we may not see.\nSo I think it just goes to this point that both of us are making, that unless everyone with an equity, a perspective, an experience on these questions is in on the takeoff, we\u2019re probably not going to have a smooth landing.\nSo we have a few minutes left.\u00a0 One of the things that I know bedevils all of us in different ways is how we think about dealing with disinformation and misinformation that\u2019s in our ecosystems, and to do it in a way that is protective of speech, not destructive of it, and to do it in a way, again, that uses \u2013 truth has now become a subjective word so I hate to use it \u2013 but that brings truth to bear.\nI\u2019m just wondering, from each of your perspectives, if this is something that you\u2019ve had to grapple with, to think about, and whether there are any ideas that you want to surface today in helping us think about it.\u00a0 Just throwing that out there.\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 We need a growing, transparent public discussion.\u00a0 This is the way we should follow to pursue the target.\u00a0 I want to share something with you.\u00a0 In Argentina, we are doing an experiment, an electoral experiment.\u00a0 We have called \u2013 I have mentioned government, civil society, private sector.\u00a0 We have called Facebook and Twitter.\u00a0 And there is a public agreement between the government, the political parties, and these two companies related to the electoral debate in Argentina, for example.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2013 what is the idea?\nThe idea is to guarantee transparency in the discussion, the possibility of having everyone on board, every sector on board, and particularly, I would like to stress, to guarantee a real public debate where everyone has the chance to participate.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s a \u2013 might be a new \u2013 in my country it\u2019s going to be a new tool that will provide a better solution \u2013 situation, sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I think that more conversation is needed.\u00a0 Education, awareness raising among stakeholders, government officials, judiciary.\u00a0 But at the same time, I think keeping an eye that there\u2019s always this tendency from the powerful actors to criminalize this kind of speech, and I think we have to be very, very careful, if governments are making these decisions, how civil society can be part of those conversation.\nAnd I believe that more speech is an answer and not banning the speech.\u00a0 And just want to mention one initiative that I\u2019m also part of is, because misinformation and disinformation has harmed women and girls online, female journalists.\u00a0 It has increased gender \u2013 online gender-based violence.\u00a0 And this global partnership on \u2013 to address tech-facilitated violence which, again, U.S. Government is taking the leading role and other governments are part of it \u2013 I think these are the kind of initiatives that we need more.\nAnd also like-minded governments are part of such kind of partnerships.\u00a0 We need to see how we can bring those governments which are not like-minded and how they are becoming part of these conversation.\u00a0 I think that that\u2019s much needed.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR OPEKE:\u00a0 Well, I think what you have are that the most powerful and motivated and the authoritarian voices then try to crowd people out and feed a lot of this misinformation.\u00a0 So I also agree that more conversation is required, but more \u2013 the broadening of access so that the advantage some of these people have in weaponizing, in being the loudest and the \u2013 sometimes the only voices or the strongest voices in the room, can be crowded out by broader sections of society.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Please.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Secretary, can I just \u2013 like just one last thing.\u00a0 I really want to commend the executive order that has been issued by the President Biden to ban spyware which violates human rights.\u00a0 And I would like to acknowledge that civil society has been doing a lot of work for years around this issue.\u00a0 And I think you guys have set a really good precedent for other governments, and we would like to see this kind of decision coming from other Western democracies and then hopefully from other regimes as well.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, you just heard it, so thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe are predictably out of time.\u00a0 I just want to see if anyone has any last things that they want to say, put on the table, that they didn\u2019t get a chance to say.\u00a0 Ambassador, anything?\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 I just want to thank you again.\u00a0 This is the way.\u00a0 This is the direction we should work on.\u00a0 So I want you to know that we will try to reproduce this scenario in our country following what you\u2019re doing here today.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Anything?\nMS DAD:\u00a0 I just want to say empower civil society.\u00a0 Give them resources.\u00a0 Make them part of these conversations in proper spirit.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s it.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good way to conclude.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you. (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-on-advancing-technology-for-democracy/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken on Advancing Technology for Democracy\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Washington Convention Center", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "March 30, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Jeanne, thank you so much for the introduction and for helping to move us along today.\nAnd I really want to first extend a very warm welcome to everyone who is here as well as to the many who are joining us online.\nNot long after its invention, Thomas Edison said of electricity: \u201cIt holds the secrets that will reorganize the life of the world.\u201d\nToday, we are again living through a time when technology is reorganizing the life of the world, the world that we all share.\u00a0 Every country \u2013 no matter its form of government, no matter its geography, no matter its size or power \u2013 is being transformed by new and evolving tools from biotechnology altering the building blocks of life, to artificial intelligence changing the production of knowledge, to the devices that we\u2019ve all got in our pockets redefining how we relate to each other as human beings.\nThe test we face as democracies is how we can shape this transformation in a way that maximizes its promise, that minimizes its dangers, and reinforces our core values.\nSo, today, what I wanted to do kick us off is to set out a few of the ways that we\u2019re working to try to meet this test, working together in government, with partners in the private sector and civil society \u2013 a test that as we meet it today, I think will do much to shape many, many years to come.\nPresident Biden likes to say that in many ways we\u2019re at an inflection point where the decisions that we\u2019re making now in the next few years are likely to shape the next decades.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of those moments that comes along every few generations where we\u2019re really at a point of inflection and our actions are going to make a big difference.\nSo first, we are focused on using technology to try to make our democracies a little bit healthier, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more inclusive.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on democracy\u2019s core strengths \u2013 our openness, our transparency, our adaptability, and the faith that we place in our citizens to make the system work better, to actually deliver results.\nJust a few examples of how governments here are using technology to shore up the foundations of democracy, to strengthen its institutions in ways that actually deliver results for people.\nIn the Maldives recently they introduced video technology that allows people to participate virtually in court hearings, freeing up time for judges, reducing costs for citizens.\nIn Estonia, as many of you know, citizens can go online to do everything from registering a new business, to paying their taxes, to requesting refills of medical prescriptions all within minutes.\nAfter Malaysia adopted legislation lowering the voting age from 21 to 18, the government was able to automatically register people online who were newly eligible to vote.\u00a0 Participation in elections shot up 25 percent, giving voice to more than 3 million additional voters.\nAnd of course, it\u2019s not just governments that are using digital tools to improve people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 Transparency advocates are creating open databases that allow members of the public to identify corruption in public works projects.\u00a0 Epidemiologists and researchers are sharing data to accelerate our understanding of deadly viruses and the creation of safe, effective vaccines.\u00a0 Climate scientists are using predictive models to help farmers make better decisions about when and where to plant, increasing agricultural productivity, reducing hunger.\nAcross these efforts, we\u2019re working to make sure that all people have access to digital tools and their benefits because one of the things that history teaches us is that leaps in technology too often deepen instead of diminishing inequities in our societies.\u00a0 And we have to have that constantly in mind as we look at how we\u2019re adapting and shaping the technologies of our time.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re making investments at home and around the world to try to close some of the digital divides \u2013 whether on gender, nationality, race, disability, geography, income, or any other factor \u2013 that perpetuate a lack of access to opportunity for underserved groups and underserved communities.\nHere in the United States to take one example, as many of you know, we passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that dedicates $65 billion to ensuring that everyone in our country has access to reliable, affordable high-speed internet \u2013 rural, suburban, urban; low, middle, high-income.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already helped millions of lower-income Americans and their households pay their internet bills, because as President Biden says, high-speed connectivity is no longer a luxury; it\u2019s a necessity.\nAnd we\u2019re helping partners around the world broaden access too, like the more than $260 million in financing the United States is providing to help upgrade infrastructure in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\u00a0 Rio is in the process of installing 5,000 public Wi-Fi access points, as well as public lighting systems that cut electricity consumption by up to 60 percent, while also lowering costs and cutting their emissions.\u00a0 And three-quarters of these investments will be made in neighborhoods where people live below the city\u2019s average income level.\nSecond, we\u2019re working with partners to update and establish as necessary rules and norms, so that technology is developed and used in ways that reflect our democratic values and interests.\nThat includes for old technologies, like the internet.\u00a0 We\u2019ve long promoted an open, interoperable, secure, reliable internet \u2013 principles that created the conditions for the internet to grow into a dynamic force for learning, for connection, for economic opportunity.\nBut everyone in this room knows, and colleagues who are joining us online know, that the internet is also growing more closed, more insecure, more siloed by the day.\u00a0 More countries are putting up firewalls and shutting down access, using the internet to try to control speech, quash dissent, spread misinformation and disinformation.\nSo we are using all the tools in our kit \u2013 from software to hardware, from trade to diplomacy \u2013 to defend our longstanding vision and stand against these and other threats.\u00a0 A year ago, we launched the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.\u00a0 It reaffirms our commitment to a single, open \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d that respects democratic principles and human rights.\u00a0 To date, more than 65 partners and counting have joined us in making this pledge \u2013 and taking action to make that pledge real.\nWe also recognize that we have to do better at addressing some of the risks that come with the open internet.\u00a0 People have important concerns about how platforms collect, exploit, and share our personal data, fan the flames of polarization and extremism, endanger women and girls, children, LGBTQI+ people, and other vulnerable groups.\nTackling these and other issues requires a delicate balance of the principles at the heart of our vision \u2013 such as between openness and security, between protecting speech and preventing incitement, between fostering innovation and limiting the power of Big Tech.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s more than obvious to say we do not yet have all the answers.\u00a0 We\u2019re all working on them, thinking about them, struggling with them.\u00a0 But we have to engage this.\nOur people and increasingly our companies are looking to democratic governments to help establish limits for how platforms can collect, use, and share citizens\u2019 personal data.\u00a0 We have heard that message.\nThat\u2019s why, in addition to using his authority to address these issues, President Biden has been urging Congress to pass strong bipartisan legislation to protect Americans\u2019 privacy.\u00a0 The President has also made clear that we need to be able to hold platforms accountable when they fail to address the harms caused by their technology, from the content they spread to the algorithms that they use.\nIt\u2019s also why we\u2019re stepping up to shape the rules and guidelines around emerging digital tools, like artificial intelligence.\nThe rollout of AI chatbots in recent months has demonstrated how quickly this technology is evolving, how big of an impact it\u2019s going to have on each of our lives.\u00a0 In October, we put out a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \u2013 five principles to try to guide the way we design, use, deploy automated systems in ways that protect our people and defend our democratic values.\nThese include the principle that people should be protected from unsafe or ineffective AI; that people should know when an automated system is being used and understand how it affects them.\nWe\u2019ve also developed a risk management framework to give individuals, organizations, and societies practical guidance on how to measure and manage the risks of automated systems, and make AI that\u2019s safe, that\u2019s accountable, that\u2019s fair, that protects privacy.\nThese principles and guidelines aren\u2019t meant to be the final word in navigating the extraordinary complexities around AI and other emerging tools.\u00a0 We know the technology is changing too fast for that.\u00a0 And speaking as someone who\u2019s in government \u2013 and again, you all know this, many from experience \u2013 government is constantly playing catch-up when it comes to technology.\u00a0 And at a time when things seem to be evolving more quickly than ever before, that game of catch-up is even more intense than ever before.\u00a0 But we have to find ways to create guardrails that will continue to strengthen and improve \u2013 that we\u2019ll continue to strengthen and improve on together with partners.\nThird big piece:\u00a0 We\u2019re doubling down on investing in democracies\u2019 ability to lead on technological innovation. Our ability to shape the digital landscape depends in significant part on maintaining our competitive edge in innovation.\u00a0 Democracies\u2019 free flow of ideas and information gives us a built-in advantage, but we can\u2019t take our own dynamism for granted.\u00a0 We have to continue to find ways to foster it, to catalyze it, to support it, to encourage it.\nAnd that\u2019s the basic idea behind the historic investment that President Biden and Congress have made through the CHIPS and Science Act, through the Inflation Reduction Act, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\u00a0 It\u2019s the biggest investment America has made in generations in revitalizing key industries, recharging our manufacturing base, leading the global energy transition,\u00a0and boosting basic research \u2013 something we\u2019ve gotten away from in recent decades \u2013 while also bolstering the resilience and security of the supply chains that underpin every single one of these efforts.\nAnd we\u2019re not just investing here at home.\u00a0 We\u2019re laying the foundation for innovation in democracies around the world, because leaps in rights-affirming and privacy-respecting technologies don\u2019t just benefit the countries where they\u2019re invented; they are good for people everywhere.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind the pledge we made at the recent Africa Leaders Summit right here in this Convention Center to dedicate more than $350 million toward digital transformation in African countries, which will unlock catalytic investments from the private sector on the continent.\nWe\u2019re urging allies and partners to make these investments too, because our collective competitiveness depends on it.\u00a0 And democracies are answering the call, such as the G7\u2019s unprecedented commitment to spend tens of billions of dollars on tech infrastructure around the globe in the coming years.\nFourth, we are pushing back vigorously on authoritarian governments\u2019 increasing use of technology to abuse human rights and undermine democracy.\nThat starts with shoring up our resilience against efforts by autocratic governments to sow distrust in democracy, to weaken our institutions, to reach across borders to target people in our countries.\nA key part of that is countering the disinformation and misinformation that authoritarian governments spread to polarize our societies.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that not only by exposing lies and manipulations, but by disseminating the truth through individuals, networks, independent media that local communities trust.\nWe\u2019re taking steps to protect the security of our citizens\u2019 data from authoritarian governments, particularly those with a track record of gathering such information to profile our people, to target those that they see as critics, to steal intellectual property.\u00a0 Protecting this information is also vital to preventing these governments from exploiting platforms to shape what our citizens see online.\nWe\u2019re working to thwart the efforts of autocrats to use technology to repress people within as well as beyond their borders.\nTogether with 35 fellow governments in the Freedom Online Coalition, we led an effort to develop a set of guiding principles to encourage the responsible use of surveillance technology, to prevent its misuse by bad actors, such as targeting people based solely on their race, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, political views, or any other classification that is protected by international law.\nWe\u2019re taking immediate steps to translate these principles into practice.\u00a0 Just this week, President Biden issued an executive order that bans the U.S. Government\u2019s use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our national security or that has been misused by foreign actors to abuse human rights.\nAnd we\u2019re working to help people living under repressive regimes get access to digital tools, including the uncensored internet.\u00a0 Last September, when the killing of Mahsa Amini by Iran\u2019s security forces sparked months of massive protests, the regime cracked down viciously \u2013 killing hundreds of people, imprisoning tens of thousands more, and routinely shutting down the internet.\nIn response, we teamed up with companies and civil society groups to help provide the Iranian people with ongoing access to the internet and other vital communications tools so they could continue to communicate with one another and with the outside world and shine a spotlight on the regime\u2019s abuses.\nNew reforms that we rolled out this week will make it easier for our government to provide similar support for people who are facing digital crackdowns in other countries.\nIt\u2019s not just Iran where the private sector and civil society are working with democratic governments to push back against digital authoritarianism.\u00a0 Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of last year, businesses and citizens from the United States and other democracies have been on the front lines helping Ukraine defend its independence, its right to exist, its very democracy.\u00a0 These volunteers have helped maintain connectivity for Ukrainian Government institutions and citizens, despite the relentless attacks, providing the Ukrainian Government with free access to a secure cloud to store sensitive national databases, helping to counter Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaigns on social media.\nCompanies and citizens from democracies have come forward because they believe technology should be used to affirm people\u2019s rights, not abuse them; and that it should empower people to define their own path, not allow others to use coercion and violence to choose that path for them.\nThis brings me to a final point that I want to leave you with, and it\u2019s the reason that ultimately we feel optimistic about democracies\u2019 ability to deliver in a period where technology is once again \u2013 as during Thomas Edison\u2019s lifetime \u2013 reorganizing the life of the world.\nFor all of the challenges that these disruptive technologies present, no system of government is better equipped to drive the forces that they represent in improving our people\u2019s lives than democracy.\nWe excel at innovation.\u00a0 We\u2019re nimble.\nWe encourage a multiplicity of voices and perspectives to find solutions.\nWe let the best ideas rise to the top, rather than assuming that the best ideas come from the top.\nWe believe our people have a vital role to play in the ongoing process of making our system better, of fixing its flaws.\nWe embrace vigorous and open debate within and across our democracies.\nAnd while we democracies may not be perfectly aligned \u2013 we may not agree on everything, on how to proceed, we don\u2019t try to be.\u00a0 Our willingness to try out different approaches \u2013 openly,\u00a0 transparently \u2013 lets us learn from one another, lets us adapt, lets us improve.\nIndeed, on all four of the priorities that I\u2019ve set out today \u2013 using technology to improve our people\u2019s lives in tangible ways, establishing rights-respecting rules for emerging technologies, investing in our innovation, and countering authoritarian governments\u2019 use of digital tools to abuse people and weaken democracies \u2013 on every single one of those lines of effort, our success ultimately depends on working effectively together.\nTo pass the test, we have to continue to build and broaden coalitions of allies and partners who share our democratic values, who are committed to putting them at the heart of our shared technological future.\u00a0 Whether they\u2019re in government or civil society, whether they\u2019re innovators or regulators, academics or activists, or simply citizens \u2013 we\u2019re counting on them, we\u2019re counting on you, to be part of this collective effort.\nAnd in fact, that\u2019s exactly what we see in the group gathered at the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what gives us confidence that our democracies will not only survive a truly unprecedented period of technological transformation, but \u2013 but \u2013 shape it to the benefit of our people and to people around the world.\nThanks so much for being here.\u00a0 Thanks so much for taking part in the summit, and I\u2019m now looking forward to a conversation with some colleagues.\u00a0 Thanks very much, everyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-opening-remarks-at-the-u-s-mexico-synthetic-drug-conference/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken Opening Remarks at the U.S.-Mexico Synthetic Drug Conference\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "date": "March 29, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHello, everyone.\nI\u2019m glad to join the U.S.-Mexico Synthetic Drug Conference.\nTo our Ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, and our Assistant Secretary Todd Robinson: Thank you for your commitment to making people safer and healthier on both sides of the border.\nAnd to our partners in the Mexican government, particularly Foreign Secretary Ebrard: Thank you for your leadership on this critical priority.\nToday, this group has gathered to discuss one of the most important challenges facing our people: illicit synthetic drugs.\nWe\u2019re all too familiar with the statistics.\nIn the United States, fentanyl is the leading cause of death among people between 18 and 49 years old. In 2021, we lost more than 100,000 Americans to drug overdoses; 70 percent of those were from synthetic opioids like fentanyl. And synthetic drugs are threatening lives around the world, including in Mexico.\nSynthetic drugs are easier to make, transport, and sell than plant-based drugs. They\u2019re more potent and dangerous. And they pose an extraordinary risk to our populations.\nPresident Biden is committed to ending this deadly epidemic. Our Administration has allocated over $24 billion in the last year to strengthen public health interventions, and expanded access to treatment, prevention, and recovery tools, including naloxone and fentanyl testing strips, which can help reduce overdose deaths. We\u2019re also working to target and disrupt trafficking networks in the United States, and arrest those who seek to profit off this epidemic.\nBut no one country or government can stop the spread of synthetic drugs alone. This is a shared problem, with shared responsibility.\nThat\u2019s why the United States is working closely with other governments \u2013 together with public health experts, doctors, business leaders, and law enforcement officials \u2013 to tackle this transnational challenge.\nMexico is one of our closest partners in this fight.\nToday, our nations are updating and adapting our long-standing partnership on transnational narcotics challenges, working to forge a comprehensive, agile, and effective approach to synthetic drugs.\nUnder President Biden and President Lopez Obrador, the United States and Mexico are acting to disrupt illicit supply chains and curb the production and distribution of legal chemicals used to make drugs, including through exchanges of forensic scientists.\nWe\u2019re targeting organized crime and drug traffickers, and intercepting drug shipments. In the last year alone, we used U.S. technology to seize over 1.3 million fentanyl pills together, \u00a0at borders, ports, and other checkpoints. And that\u2019s on top of the work our countries did individually to get drugs off our streets.\nOur countries are improving early warning systems, to track emerging drugs before they spread through our communities.\nWe\u2019re also working to prevent and treat addition, promote public health, and build safer communities, with the United States sharing what we\u2019ve learned to support Mexico\u2019s efforts.\nMexico and the United States are also working with other countries to address this crisis. Earlier this month at a G20 Ministerial, for the first time, the world\u2019s leading economies called for strong, international cooperation against illicit synthetic drugs: recognizing that this is a global health and security threat that requires the full force of our combined efforts.\nTo build on this cross-border collaboration, the U.S. and Canada committed to build a new global coalition against synthetic drugs. This coalition will launch this summer and bring together countries from around the world to develop and implement solutions to this crisis, from supporting public health measures, to growing our partnerships with the private sector. For example, we can help prevent the diversion of licit precursors into the illicit production of synthetic opioids through better information sharing, labeling, and \u201cknow your customer\u201d programs. I encourage countries who are interested in participating to get involved.\nSo much is at stake: The countless lives that can still be saved. Children who can still grow up with their parents. Communities that can remain whole.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s at the heart of our conference this week. And I\u2019m grateful to each of you participating, for contributing your expertise and leadership to help protect our people.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-status-of-women-is-the-status-of-democracy-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the State Department and welcome to the second Summit for Democracy.\nJen, to you for your remarkable leadership at the White House Gender Policy Council; to Kat, for yours here at the State Department on Global Women\u2019s Issues:\u00a0 We could not have a better team, a more dynamic duo, leading our efforts.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful to each of you every day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019re joined in-person and virtually by government leaders from around the world, as well as partners from across the United States Government, multilateral organizations, civil society.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for all the work that you\u2019ve doing every single day to advance women\u2019s equality and thereby advance democracy.\u00a0 These two things are inexorably linked, as you\u2019ve already heard.\nThe President has long believed that democracies are strengthened by the active participation of all citizens, particularly women and girls.\u00a0 And since day one, he\u2019s made advancing women\u2019s and girls\u2019 civic and political engagement a top priority of this administration.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re kicking off this session as one of the summit\u2019s first events \u2013 because the status of women is indeed the status of democracy.\nWe all know in this room and everyone who\u2019s listening in the rights of women in many parts of the world are under threat and under attack.\u00a0 Repressive governments are passing targeted laws to restrict women\u2019s fundamental freedoms, including the right to free speech and assembly.\u00a0 Extremist actors are disproportionately targeting women and girls, especially those from historically marginalized identities like LGBTQI+ people, women from racial, ethnic, and religious communities.\nBut it\u2019s not just in autocracies that women are being denied their full and equal rights.\u00a0 In far too many parts of the world, women and girls still do not have equal opportunities to study and work.\u00a0 Women journalists, advocates, politicians, and others are subject to persistent online harassment and abuse.\u00a0 Women who are victims of violence often do not have equal access to justice.\u00a0 Women are subject to discrimination that often puts them at a disadvantage \u2013 whether through double standards they face in the workplace, in access to reproductive rights, or in nationality laws, which can result in barriers to accessing education, health care, and property for themselves and for their families.\nBut, in the face of these forces, women and girls are leading the charge for their rights and for human rights and democracy around the world.\u00a0 And they\u2019re demonstrating the importance of having women at the decision-making table.\nIn Afghanistan \u2013 in the face of the Taliban\u2019s daily efforts to erase them from daily life \u2013 women are still protesting.\u00a0 They\u2019re still finding ways to document human rights abuses.\u00a0 They are still fighting for a brighter future for their country.\nIn Iran, courageous women are marching in the streets, under great threat to themselves, to call for \u201cwoman, life, and freedom.\u201d\nThe United States stands in solidarity with these women and all who are working for women\u2019s full, free, and equal participation around the world.\u00a0 Through our diplomacy, we\u2019re committed to supporting them and advancing gender equality worldwide.\nAt the last Summit for Democracy, the United States launched our \u201cSupport Her Empowerment \u2013 Women\u2019s Inclusion in New Security,\u201d or \u201cSHE WINS,\u201d as the acronym appropriately has it.\u00a0 This initiative, which supports local women and women-led civil society organizations \u2013 we\u2019re working to increase women\u2019s political and civic participation in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Papua New Guinea, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.\nIn partnership with Denmark, we\u2019ve also been leading the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse, a coalition of 12 countries focused on countering technology-facilitated gender-based violence.\nSoon, you\u2019ll be hearing from leaders like Phumzile Van Damme, a former parliamentarian in South Africa who shared her experiences as a target of online harassment \u2013 and who now works to combat this scourge, including as part of the Advisory Group to the Global Partnership.\nWe\u2019re heartened by the Global Partnership\u2019s initial progress over the past year.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen some member countries increase resources to combatting this issue at home, including by providing more trainings for those in the legal and justice systems, as well as for advocates working with survivors of online harassment.\u00a0 And it is so vitally important that their voices be heard and fully inform our efforts.\u00a0 Others are beginning to collect data to better measure online abuse and its effects.\u00a0 And as a whole, the Global Partnership has worked to build consensus on shared principles to better identify, prevent, and combat this urgent issue at venues from the G7 to the United Nations.\nSo today we have an opportunity to recognize some of these successes, but also \u2013 also \u2013 to recommit to the work that lies ahead in advancing gender equality.\nWhen we succeed, we not only do the right thing, but we also do the smart and necessary thing to make our countries more prosperous, to make them more secure, to make them a little bit more full of opportunity for all of our people.\u00a0 With the group that\u2019s assembled here, we\u2019ve got everything we need to continue making progress toward what is for us an absolutely essential goal.\nSo to each of you who is here today, to each of you who is listening in, thank you again for what you\u2019re doing every single day to advance this agenda.\u00a0 And thank you for helping us kick off the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 Again, what we\u2019re doing here today, what we\u2019ll be doing for the next few days, these are fully joined.\u00a0 And I can think of no more appropriate, no more important way, to kick off the summit than with all of you here today.\nSo welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking forward to some great discussions.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

everyone.\u00a0 Thank you all so much for joining.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to be with friends and partners from around the world as we prepare to open the second Summit for Democracy.\nIn his first year in office, President Biden launched the summit to look at the future of democracy, which we see is at an inflection point.\u00a0 Worldwide, we see autocrats violating human rights and suppressing fundamental freedoms; corrupting \u2013 and with corruption eating away at young people\u2019s faith in their future; citizens questioning whether democracy can still deliver on the issues that matter most to their lives and to their livelihoods.\nAnd we see authoritarian regimes reaching beyond their borders to coerce free and open societies through increasingly aggressive, revisionist foreign policies.\u00a0 Nothing illustrates the gravity of that threat more than Russia\u2019s brutal and unjustified war against Ukraine.\nIn February 2022, President Putin launched a full-scale war against the people of Ukraine: attempting to conquer their country, topple their democratically elected government, redraw their borders.\u00a0 Indeed, President Putin\u2019s overall objective was to erase Ukraine\u2019s identity as an independent, sovereign nation and absorb it into Russia.\nThis war is an attack not only on Ukraine, but on the international rules-based order that seeks to defend international peace and stability, and uphold, in the words of the United Nations Charter, \u201cthe equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.\u201d\nAnd as this group very well knows, the victims of Russia\u2019s aggression are not only Ukrainians but people all around the world.\u00a0 The Kremlin\u2019s war has exacerbated acute food insecurity, already at crisis levels due to COVID-19, climate change, and other conflicts, putting millions at risk.\u00a0 It pushed up the price of fertilizer, fuel, and food, making it harder for families in every part of the world to make ends meet.\nThe world has come together on multiple occasions at the United Nations General Assembly to condemn Russia\u2019s aggression and the atrocities that have come with it.\u00a0 Countries from the North and South, developed and developing, established and emerging democracies, have all called on Russia to end this war and pursue a just and durable peace in Ukraine.\nThe United States is committed to supporting meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve this.\nWe all know that for peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence.\u00a0 And for peace to be durable, it must ensure that Russia can\u2019t simply rest and refit its troops, and then relaunch the war at a time more advantageous to it.\nUkraine, under President Zelenskyy, has put forward a proposal that would forge such a peace.\u00a0 It would end the war and save countless lives.\u00a0 It would restore Ukraine\u2019s territory and respect its democracy.\u00a0 It would reconstruct the country and the economy.\u00a0 It would ensure that \u2013 radiation and nuclear safety.\u00a0 It would uphold the UN Charter and the will of the international community.\u00a0 And it would come to the aid of the millions around the world that have been affected by Russia\u2019s aggression.\nLast December, President Biden hosted President Zelenskyy at the White House, where they discussed Ukraine\u2019s peace formula.\u00a0 And today, we welcome fellow democracies who are standing with Ukraine on the path to a just and durable peace, because Ukraine\u2019s future and the future of the international order on which peace and security depend, that is what is at stake.\nSo that\u2019s why we\u2019ve come together today, and I really appreciate everyone joining.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very honored to have my friend, our colleague Foreign Minister Kuleba here to discuss Ukraine\u2019s peace plan.\u00a0 Dmytro, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Dear Secretary, dear colleagues, dear friends, excellencies, President Zelenskyy has asked me to convey his apologies for not being able to join you today.\u00a0 As you may have seen on the news, he is visiting regions of Ukraine bordering the front line and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.\u00a0 So I am grateful to you, Tony, for convening this important meeting that allows me to present President Zelenskyy\u2019s and Ukraine\u2019s vision for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.\nFirst of all, I applaud the United States for taking the lead around the world in defending democracy.\u00a0 This year\u2019s summit is vital, for democracy faces existential threats.\u00a0 Nowhere is this more acutely felt than in Ukraine.\u00a0 Although Russia seeks to destroy Ukraine, its aggression is not only about Ukraine.\u00a0 Russia also aims to destroy the world order based on international law and the UN Charter.\nFor more than nine years, our best sons and daughters have not only been fighting for their future, but also defending our common democratic values at the cost of their lives.\u00a0 In this fight, we are defending the entire democratic world.\u00a0 No other nation wants peace more than Ukraine, but peace at any cost is an illusion.\u00a0 For peace to be a lasting one, it needs to be just.\nThe cessation of Russia\u2019s aggression and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity are essential conditions for peace.\u00a0 Ill-advised concessions to the aggressor would only encourage Russia to intensify its attacks on democracy, giving it times to rebuild its military capabilities and resume the armed offensive against Ukraine.\u00a0 We need a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, and we know how to get that.\nTo that end, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as you are all well aware, presented our peace formula.\u00a0 This initiative is a clear plan of action that should not only bring peace to Ukraine but also restore the world order based on the norms and principles of international law.\u00a0 We notice that other nations are also putting forth their own initiatives.\u00a0 We appreciate their focus on a problem that jeopardizes global security.\u00a0 However, I would like to emphasize that the Ukrainian people will accept peace only if it guarantees the cessation of Russian aggression in full, the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, and the restoration of our state\u2019s territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders.\nUkraine\u2019s peace formula contains all of these just conditions for ending the war.\u00a0 Our peace plan has already been recognized and approved, including during the vote on the UNGA resolution, \u201cPrinciple of the United Nations Charter Underlying a Comprehensive, Just, and Lasting Peace in Ukraine\u201d end of quote.\u00a0 The resolution, which reflects many key points of the peace formula, was approved by 141 countries.\u00a0 The Group of 7 welcomed and supported Ukraine\u2019s efforts to advance the peace formula\u2019s vision of a comprehensive, just, and enduring peace.\u00a0 The European Union has endorsed the Ukrainian initiative.\u00a0 The same stance is taken in bilateral agreements with our partners.\nI am deeply grateful to the countries that have already stated their willingness to participate in the implementation of the peace formula.\u00a0 We are confident that by working together we will restore justice, protect democratic values, and restore respect for the UN Charter\u2019s principle.\u00a0 We want to involve as many countries as possible; we count on your help in this.\u00a0 And I believe that every democracy has to contribute to this cause.\nToday I will briefly reflect on some of the formula\u2019s details.\u00a0 The peace formula consists of 10 points that can be implemented one at a time or simultaneously.\u00a0 Their implementation should bring long-awaited peace to Ukraine and guarantee security to the whole world.\nThe formula\u2019s first point is about radiation and nuclear safety.\u00a0 Russia has resorted to nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats, which is completely unacceptable.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s military forces continue to occupy Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, preventing its employees from performing their duties effectively.\u00a0 Only by returning full control of the facility to Ukraine can this be stopped.\u00a0 Russia must withdraw its troops from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and cease its reckless and dangerous threats.\u00a0 The aggressor must follow the terms of the Budapest Memorandum, which guaranteed Russia\u2019s non-use of force, including nuclear weapons, in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s voluntary nuclear disarmament.\nThe formula\u2019s second component is food security.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s aggressive war is destroying global food supply chains.\u00a0 We are grateful to T\u00fcrkiye, the UN, and other partners for their assistance in implementing the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 It enables the distribution of grain to those in greatest needs.\u00a0 However, the problem is not completely resolved, and will not be resolved until Russia ends its naval blockade of Ukrainian ports and attacks on critical infrastructure.\u00a0 The Black Sea Grain Initiative should be expanded and continued to reduce the threat, and freedom of navigation in the Black Sea should eliminate it.\nEnergy Security is the formula\u2019s third element.\u00a0 And I would like to take this opportunity, Secretary, to thank you particularly, and also our French colleague, Catherine, and (inaudible), for organizing important meetings which boosted support for Ukraine\u2019s energy sector during the darkest months of winter.\u00a0 And I also take this opportunity to thank everyone who contributed to these efforts to help Ukraine with transformers, generators, and other equipment to survive winter.\nThe release of prisoners and deportees is the fourth component of the formula.\u00a0 Modern Russia is characterized by inhuman prison conditions, the unlawful deprivation of civil liberties, kidnapping, and forced deportation of children.\u00a0 We demand the immediate release of all Ukrainian political prisoners, war prisoners, and people who have been wrongfully detained, as well as the repatriation of those who have been deported both from Russian territory and from the temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories.\nThe fifth point of the formula is the implementation of the UN Charter and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have to dwell too much on that; we all understand what this point is about.\nThe formula\u2019s sixth point is the withdrawal of Russian troops and the cessation of hostilities.\u00a0 I want to be clear:\u00a0 Russia has to withdraw from every square meter of Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 There should be no misinterpretation of what the word \u201cwithdrawal\u201d implies.\nThe formula\u2019s seventh point is the restoration of justice.\u00a0 Let me stop here and give you a couple of details.\u00a0 The aggressor must pay for all damages caused to Ukraine.\u00a0 It is critical to establish an international compensation mechanism for Russia\u2019s payment of reparations.\u00a0 However, not all losses are recoverable.\u00a0 Nobody will be able to bring the victims of Russia\u2019s barbaric invasion back to life.\u00a0 Aggression is accompanied by heinous crimes, as evidenced by the murders in Bucha and Irpin, as well as the Russian torture chambers in Kherson and Izium.\u00a0 The exact number of civilian Ukrainians killed in Mariupol is unknown, but it is believed to be in the tens of thousands.\nThe responsibility for this lies not only with the Russian Federation\u2019s political and military leadership, but also with the ordinary executors.\u00a0 The memory of the innocent victims demands that all those responsible for these atrocities face just punishment.\u00a0 By issuing an arrest warrant for Putin, international justice has already given a proper assessment of his crimes.\u00a0 A special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine\u2019s effective work should further restore faith in justice.\nThe formulas eighth point is ecological security.\u00a0 And again, I think the damage \u2013 the damage inflicted on Ukraine\u2019s environment is uncomprehensible, and we have to focus our efforts on bringing responsible to account.\nThe ninth point of the formula is the prevention of war escalation and the repetition of aggression.\nAnd finally, the tenth point, the formula\u2019s tenth point, is confirmation of the end of the war.\nThese are very simple 10 points; they all make sense.\u00a0 And they have to be implemented, and we have to be united in ensuring that this formula is taken as the basis for the settlement.\u00a0 But the international community has always shown that it will not tolerate an insult to the principle \u2013 an insult to the principles of the UN Charter.\u00a0 And I therefore urge all countries to reaffirm their resolve and join efforts to put Ukraine\u2019s peace formula into action.\u00a0 Each country \u2013 I emphasize each country \u2013 can contribute to the cause of peace by participating in the implementation of specific points on \u2013 of this peace formula.\nThank you very much for your attention.\u00a0 And thank you for giving us this opportunity to highlight the peace formula by Ukraine.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Dmytro, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Thank you for walking us through it.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s very important, and it also underscores a couple of things.\nOne, I think we all have to be very much aware and beware of what may seem to be well-intentioned efforts, for example, to call for cease fires, which would potentially have the effect of freezing in place the conflict, allowing Russia to consolidate the gains that it\u2019s made, and simply use the time to rest and refit and then re-attack.\u00a0 And so what seems to be appealing on the surface \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t want the guns to be silent \u2013 can also be a very cynical trap that we have to be very, very careful of.\nAnd of course, I think it\u2019s safe to say, Dmytro, that no one wants peace more than the Ukrainian people because they\u2019re the ones who are suffering directly from its absence and from this aggression.\u00a0 But it has to be just and it has to be durable; otherwise, it\u2019s ultimately for naught.\nI\u2019d like to take the opportunity to just go around and hear from colleagues.\u00a0 Catherine, I know you have \u2013 you have another obligation.\u00a0 So I want to turn to you first and just get any reflections that you may have.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, colleagues, excellencies.\u00a0 Let me switch to French, if I may.\n(Via interpreter) First of all, I would like to thank the Secretary of State of organizing this meeting on the margins of the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 Thank you, Antony, and also applaud Dmytro\u2019s participation.\u00a0 And I would like to reiterate our full support to Ukraine for its freedom, its sovereignty, for its territorial integrity, for its security.\u00a0 Ukraine is also fighting for us and for our own security.\u00a0 Your resistance, your courage make us proud.\u00a0 To our Ukrainian friends, you know that you can count on France\u2019s support and that of the European Union.\nFor more than one year, Russian is waging a war of aggression, an illegal war, non-provoked, unjustified, unjustifiable.\u00a0 It is also conducting a war against the principle and values that we all share, against the rules to which we are all attached, first among which the Charter of the United Nations, international human rights and laws, and international law in general.\u00a0 We are not talking about Western values; we are talking about the common rules around the world.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also about respect for human dignity, everything that underscores the universal human rights.\nDmytro mentioned the meeting that we organized in Paris on December 13th.\u00a0 I would like to make reference to what we\u2019re able to do together, Dmytro, during the meeting of the Human Rights Council, which was organized in Geneva on February 27th.\u00a0 And there, we were able to organize an event that brought together more than 50 countries to condemn the Russian crimes, which are representative of war crimes and clearly war crimes against mankind.\u00a0 We all saw these images, these horrible images of civilians executed, massacred, violated, children deported.\u00a0 So at the Security Council in September, we were all together \u2013 I said it again at the Human Rights Council, I said it again at the G20 and at other opportunities; I\u2019m saying it again, once again:\u00a0 There will no \u2013 be no durable peace without justice.\u00a0 Justice must prevail.\u00a0 This is why the issuance by the International Criminal Court of two arrest warrants against Mr. Putin and Mr. Belova[1]\u00a0represents a major step in the collective fight that we\u2019re conducting against impunity.\u00a0 And I would like to call the party states to the Statutes of Rome to respect their international obligations in this respect.\nI also call upon the European Council to work now to strengthen the protection of children in Ukraine.\u00a0 We must do everything we can, starting by documenting human rights violations committed by the Russian troops against these children, including forced transfers and deportations.\u00a0 So to refuse Russia\u2019s victory, that does not mean that we want the victory of the West against the East or the North against the South.\u00a0 It is important to break these misrepresentations.\u00a0 These are lies.\u00a0 It is simply refusing that force should prevail over law.\u00a0 It\u2019s refusing the denial of the most fundamental laws and rules of international law, those which allow us to live in peace and stability.\u00a0 So we will not allow Russia to win; the stakes are much too high.\u00a0 Let\u2019s be united and let\u2019s move again together.\n(Inaudible) in France, as you know, so thank you for giving me the floor early.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Merci beaucoup.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci beaucoup \u2013 merci,\u00a0Catherine.\u00a0 Thank you, Catherine, very much.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to turn now to Jan, Jan Lipavsky for \u2013 from the Czech Republic.\u00a0 Jan, over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LIPAVSKY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Tony.\u00a0 Dear Dmytro, dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019m pleased that we have a chance to discuss this key issue right at the beginning of the summit.\u00a0 The Russian war against Ukraine has already taken too many lives and destroyed too many homes of innocent people.\u00a0 We all are desperately looking for peace.\u00a0 We all but one man wish to see the end of this war.\u00a0 The man is Vladimir Putin, and the International Criminal Court has finally charged him with war crimes and issued an arrest warrant against him.\nI\u2019ve heard a lot of comments suggesting that he will never appear before the ICC or special tribunal for prosecution of crimes of aggression, the establishment of which Czechia strongly advocates.\u00a0 I have also heard many voices suggesting that Ukraine will not have enough strength and capabilities to fully restore its territorial integrity; that it\u2019s not possible or that it\u2019s too risky and too dangerous to try to liberate Crimea; that Vladimir Putin will not give up the peninsula, that he will not give up Ukraine, which he so arrogantly claims he\u2019s entitled to; that the U.S., the European Union, and the West cannot sustain the long-term military and financial support of Ukraine because of our economic burdens.\u00a0 Many say that Ukraine is too weak and Russia too strong, that Ukrainians must negotiate and must compromise and give up some \u2013 some of its territory.\nThat is exactly what happened to Czechoslovakia prior to the Second World War.\u00a0 Many European leaders believed at that time that ceding of significant parts of my country in the autumn of 1938 to Hitler would bring peace.\u00a0 It was peace for our time, some of them said.\u00a0 And that is exactly what Vladimir Putin wants, force us and Ukraine to give in and accept his so-called peace proposals in order to prepare Russia for even bigger war.\u00a0 It is vital to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.\u00a0 It is not an option; it is a necessity.\nUkraine is by no means weak, because of Ukraine\u2019s citizens are strong.\u00a0 We saw this in the very first days of the Russian aggression, and we have been witnessing it every single day since.\u00a0 They are fighting not just for their territory and their homes, but for values we all share.\u00a0 Ukrainians are dying for freedom of speech, for democracy, for the simple principle that borders shall not be changed by force.\u00a0 We need to support the brave Ukrainians and make sure that they will have all the means to restore the territorial integrity of their country, including Crimea.\u00a0 We need to make sure that war crimes committed by Russian troops under the order of Putin do not go unpunished.\u00a0 Only then can peace be fair and lasting.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Jan, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Can we go now to Eli Cohen from Israel?\u00a0 Eli, over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COHEN:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, Tony, how are you?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good to see you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COHEN:\u00a0\u00a0Israel is a democratic country facing security challenges.\u00a0 We feel affinity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people as they fight for their independence and sovereignty.\u00a0 We know how it feels to fight for our homeland and identity.\u00a0 Israel \u2013 and actually, the lessons of the 20th century are clear.\u00a0 The international community should raise a voice loud, clear, and (inaudible).\u00a0 Early on, Israel has made a firm commitment to supporting Ukraine and upholding its territorial integrity.\u00a0 Despite the Russian annexation of Ukrainian territories, Israel has taken a (inaudible) by refusing to recognize this action.\u00a0 In addition, Israel (inaudible) action to promoting peace in Ukraine by supporting the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for comprehensive and lasting resolution to the conflict.\nThrough these actions, Israel has shown solidarity with Ukraine and made a commitment to promoting international peace and security.\u00a0 If we can be of any help in facilitating a peaceful resolution to the conflict, ending the tragedy and human suffering, Israel will be at the forefront of such (inaudible).\u00a0 The war within Ukraine is a clear challenge to the world\u2019s stability and order as we know it.\u00a0 We will not ignore the dangers.\u00a0 Iran\u2019s (inaudible) involvement in the war within Ukraine must be a wake-up call to all.\u00a0 Iran\u2019s IRGC is responsible for the use of advanced UAVs against civilian targets in Ukraine.\u00a0 Such transfers are a violation of Iran\u2019s obligations and go against the values and spirit of democracies around the world.\nIn this aspect, the international community must implement coordinated pressure to stop the Iranian activity.\u00a0 On my recent visit to Kyiv, I have personally witnessed the vast devastation the war brought upon Ukraine and the suffering of the people.\u00a0 In my meeting with President Zelenskyy and my friend Foreign Minister Kuleba, I emphasized that Israel strongly supports the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u00a0 On my visit, we have officially resumed the permanent presence of the Israeli embassy in Kyiv.\u00a0 This is a clear message of solidarity.\nI was actually honored to be a first, the first foreign minister from our region to visit Ukraine and to show Israel\u2019s support.\u00a0 Israel will continue to offer its assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0 We will continue our vast program of capacity building, focused on area of expertise in rebuilding resilience, and post-trauma and medical and para-medical assistance in the area of rehabilitation.\u00a0 The challenges of Ukraine, its people and leadership today are (inaudible).\u00a0 The challenges for the day after will depend on our concerted efforts.\nWe have (inaudible) for humanitarian and other aid.\u00a0 We are (inaudible) working closely with our friends in Ukraine.\u00a0 Israel (inaudible) experience will not (inaudible) taking into consideration other results.\u00a0 We will extend \u2013 and this is our government and its decision \u2013 extend our support hand to Ukraine.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Eli, thank you very much.\u00a0 Let\u2019s go now to the foreign minister of Italy, Antonio.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0 Hi, my friend.\u00a0 Thank you for organizing this debate on democracy.\u00a0 Dmytro, hi.\nI think it\u2019s very important to be very clear on this.\u00a0\u00a0Now the competition is between democracy and the technocrats.\u00a0\u00a0For this, it\u2019s important to work all together in defense of our values \u2013 democracy, human rights \u2013 but also we need to have a strategy not only in Ukraine, but also for stopping Russia.\u00a0\u00a0We need to work hard also in the Western Balkans.\u00a0\u00a0Italy is strongly engaged, of course, for supporting Ukraine at military level and for \u2013 in support to the population, but we are working hard in the Western Balkans for stopping Russia.\nWe need more Europe.\u00a0 We need more Italy in this region because the danger is to leave the Western Balkans in Russian hands.\u00a0 It\u2019s very, very important.\nWe need to do the same also in Africa.\u00a0 We need to be more present as democratic countries.\u00a0 We need to work hard for supporting growth, organize joint adventures for working together in favor of peace and democracy, because the competition is at the global level.\u00a0 The Russian are working everywhere.\u00a0 Wagner is present not only in Ukraine; it\u2019s present everywhere.\nFor supporting Ukraine, we need to be present also everywhere, because the competition is global.\u00a0 On Ukraine, of course, Italy is strongly engaged.\u00a0 The Prime Minister Meloni has been in Kyiv talking with President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 I want to thank also for the kind words of the Ukrainian Government with the Italians.\nAlso, three days ago, from Italy started the big mission for supporting civilian population, also with a football Italian organization.\u00a0\u00a0They are working hard also in favor of the young children without family in many Ukrainian region.\u00a0 For this, we are working not only in military sector, also in civil sector, because I think we need to help Ukraine \u2013 the Ukrainians, also, living a difficult moment this \u2013 during this season.\nWe need to help the Ukrainian soldiers \u2013 they are in Italy \u2013 but we need also to help all the Ukrainians in this difficult moment for achieving victory.\u00a0 I am optimistic on this, but in the same time we need to work for the peace.\u00a0 Peace is not the defeat of Ukraine; it\u2019s the victory of Ukraine.\u00a0 Peace is the respect of the international groups, and we are working on this because\u00a0 working in defense of Ukraine, we are working in defense of our values, in defense of democracy, in defense of human rights against the technocrats.\nThis is very important.\u00a0 Italy is strongly engaged.\u00a0 The Italian Government is strongly engaged on this in Ukraine, in the Western Balkans, in Africa, in South America.\u00a0 So thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Grazie, Tonio.\u00a0 Good to be with you.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nCan we go now to our colleague from Liberia, Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah?\nI think the picture may be frozen.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if we can get our colleague.\u00a0 I tell you what \u2013 why don\u2019t we come back and let\u2019s come back to him, and maybe we can go to our colleague from Malawi, Nancy Tembo, if you\u2019re there.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TEMBO:\u00a0Can you hear me?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Thank you, Nancy.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TEMBO:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, for convening this timely meeting.\u00a0 The meeting is indeed important since lasting peace is what the people of Ukraine would like to have in their land.\nThe Ukrainian people have, for over a year, experienced untold suffering, including death of loved ones, loss of livelihoods, displacement, and destruction of vital infrastructure.\u00a0 The war has also generated ripple negative effects on the global economy, more especially on developing economies such as ours.\nIn addition, the conflict has exposed the failure of the United Nations Security Council in safeguarding principles of the UN Charter when it\u2019s being violated by one of its own permanent members.\u00a0 On its flipside, the war has displayed the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people, who have put up with strong resistance against a superpower.\u00a0 They have shown us that everything is possible if there is a strong will and unity of purpose.\nSince the conflict began, the UN General Assembly in New York as well as the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva has passed several resolutions calling for an immediate withdrawal of Russia from Ukraine.\u00a0 Malawi has supported each and every resolution because it believes and respects the UN Charter, which promotes the sovereignty and equality of all states.\u00a0 These resolutions, while exerting political and diplomatic pressure on Russia to withdraw, have not really resulted in true cessation of hostilities on the ground.\u00a0 The atrocities and the negative impact of the war on Ukraine and the world economy continue.\nNow is indeed the time to move a step further by coming up with more concrete actions that would assure comprehensive, just, and lasting peace for the people of Ukraine.\u00a0 We believe that the two warring parties should be brought to a negotiating table for genuine dialogue aimed at ceasefire, and we mean \u201cgenuine\u201d \u2013 not just a break from the war but genuine dialogue.\u00a0 In addition, the United Nations Security Council should also live up to its expectations and mandate of safeguarding the principles of the UN Charter.\nAs a country, Malawi will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine in multilateral fora until there is positive change in Ukraine.\u00a0 I am confident that with such collaborative efforts by the international community, a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine is possible.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Nancy, thank you very much for joining us today.\u00a0 I appreciate it very much.\u00a0 And it looks like we have our friend from Liberia back online.\u00a0 Dee-Maxwell, back over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER KEMAYAH:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Sorry, I\u2019m in Lusaka, Zambia for the Democracy Summit.\u00a0 Our profoundest gratitude to the honorable President Biden and his cohost for organizing this Democratic Summit.\nHaving said that, I have the pleasure and duty to convey special greetings and warm felicitations from His Excellency Dr. George Manneh Weah, president of the Republic of Liberia, and in my own name, and congratulate His Excellency Mr. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine, and the government and people and the gallant men and women of Ukraine in arms for successfully holding out, protecting, and defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their great country in the wake of Russia\u2019s condemnable, unprovoked, and unjustified brutal invasion of Ukraine, as well as the illegal annexation of the parts of Ukraine since February 24, 2022.\nLet me extend my profound thanks and appreciation to the Honorable Antony J. Blinken, United States Secretary of State, for inviting (inaudible) participate in this important virtual discussion with the theme a just and lasting peace in Ukraine with His Excellency President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.\u00a0 We heartily commend President Zelenskyy, represented by the foreign minister of Ukraine, for the excellent presentation of Ukraine\u2019s 10-point peace plan.\nPermit me to reaffirm that Liberia strongly detests and condemns the Russian Federation in the strongest terms for its unprovoked attack on the peace-loving people of Ukraine and the illegal annexation of some regions of Ukraine, as well as Russia\u2019s repeated rhetoric and threat regarding its placement of nuclear weapons in Belarus and its potential use of said nuclear weapons in its unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.\nThe Republic of Liberia was founded by brave women and women of courage in pursuit of liberty, justice, and freedom for all.\u00a0 As a reasonable \u2013 as a responsible member of the community of nations, Liberia remains unwavering and strongly committed to the promotion and sustenance of the core values and principles of liberty, justice, human rights, freedom, respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, democracy, and humanity in general.\nAnywhere they are threatened around the world, Liberia has and continues to firmly cooperate with other nations in support of global peace, security, and international rule-based order.\u00a0 Respect for, supporting, and defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Liberia and any other nation, including Ukraine, is pursuant to one of the cardinal pillars of Liberia\u2019s foreign policy objectives and in line with the charter and principles of the United Nations and other relevant international treaties and protocols aimed at ensuring global peace and security and promoting the rights of all nations to self-determination.\nIn that premise, Liberia reaffirms its unreserved commitment, support, and calls for the urgent restoration of just, lasting, and comprehensive peace to Ukraine, and hereby endorses to the fullest the 10-point peace plan in its entirety as excellently presented by His Excellency President Zelenskyy of Ukraine through the foreign minister of Ukraine.\nIn conclusion, I wish to again thank His Excellency President Zelenskyy for the exemplary leadership and bravery he continues to demonstrate in leading his great country and the resilient people of Ukraine in the path of defending their independence, sovereignty, their integrity, and fundamental rights to liberty, freedom, justice, self-determination, democracy, and humanity in general.\u00a0 I wish us a fruitful deliberation as we continue to build strong global collaborative partnerships and step up the necessary imperative momentum in providing Ukraine with the most needed security, economic, logistical, and humanitarian assistance while strengthening and deepening the compelling endeavors of the international coalition and the defenders of the core values and fundamental principles of independence, human rights, defenders of democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and humanity to continue to hold the Russian Federation fully accountable for the gross violation and flagrant disregard for the charter and principles of the United Nations Charter and humanity in general.\nLiberia has co-sponsored, supported, and voted for every resolution related to this unprovoked aggression by Russia in Ukraine.\u00a0 And Liberia, under the astute leadership of His Excellency President Weah, and under my watch as minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Liberia, we will continue to provide unconditional support for the people of Ukraine.\nI thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mr. Minister, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 I greatly appreciate your intervention.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSantiago, I see you there.\u00a0 Any reflections?\nFOREIGN MINISTER CAFIERO:\u00a0 Yes, hello, Tony.\u00a0 Hello, Dmytro.\u00a0 Well, hello, everyone.\u00a0 I switch to Spanish.\n(Via interpreter) Once again, we are meeting here to deal with the serious situation in Ukraine to reach a peace and to get peace in Ukraine and the region, because this is imperative, and we have to mobilize all of us.\u00a0 And this is why I want to thank this meeting and the opportunity for me to take the floor, because Latin America, from Argentina, we express our firm position.\nTo start, we have to highlight that peaceful will not be possible if the cease \u2013 if the \u2013 if we don\u2019t get a ceasefire.\u00a0 Argentina condemns and we always condemned the invasion of Russia into Ukraine, and we reaffirm our commitment with the independence, unity of Ukraine.\nWe want peace in Ukraine that is a peace that can \u2013 that is \u2013 that can last, and in respect of the international law.\u00a0 We will reach this if we really respect the principles of United Nations, because we have to have a peaceful world, and we signed this in 1945; and respect of international law and the sovereignty of the states, and territorial integrity, and the solution in a peaceful manner; and respect of human rights.\nArgentina, during 2022 and the first time in the \u2013 in our history, we were the chair of the Human Rights Commission, and we were able to achieve during this time a task that was really highlighted by all the members of that commission.\u00a0 During this time, we expressed our concern about the attacks of \u2013 to human rights.\u00a0 This war started one year ago, and we have to insist that the human rights have to be respected, but we see the attacks on human rights and the infrastructure.\u00a0 We are concerned about violation of human rights, of international law, examples that were submitted into the 52nd meeting of the United Nations.\u00a0 These have to be classified as crimes of war, and we have to underline that we respect human rights and international law, and this is not optional.\u00a0 All these crimes have to be investigated, and responsible have to pay a price.\nWe need this to include the criminal sanctions and the non-repetition of this crime.\u00a0 Therefore, the humanitarian aid is fundamental for the survival of those that are most vulnerable.\u00a0 We really want to \u2013 free access to these areas that are so vulnerable.\u00a0 We will continue to lessen the suffering of the Ukrainian people.\nWe in Argentina and our White Helmets have really participated in these activities with the Ukrainian community.\u00a0 We also had two missions in the evacuation of Argentine and Latin American people that were in Poland and Ukraine.\u00a0 We know that dialogue and diplomacy is the only way out to avoid any suffering.\nThis war is a catastrophe for Ukraine, for its people, for Europe in general \u2013 not only for them, but the consequences will be dire for the whole world, and even if we are far away, but they are really suffering the energy cuts.\nAnd I want to remember what Pope Francis said:\u00a0 Please do not forget the Ukrainian people, because they suffer the crimes of the war.\u00a0 And we have to participate.\u00a0 Please, a ceasefire, an end to the conflict and to really reach a lasting peace and just peace, not only for Ukraine but for the world as a whole.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Santiago.\u00a0 And we now have a video from our friend from Japan, Foreign Minister Hayashi, who couldn\u2019t be with us live today but asked to be recorded so he could participate. \u00a0So let\u2019s go to Foreign Minister Hayashi.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0Distinguished participants, first, I would like to express my appreciation to Secretary of State Blinken for his initiative in organizing today\u2019s discussion.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine is an outrageous act that shakes the very foundation of the international order, which the international community has built up over a long period of dedicated efforts and sacrifices.\u00a0 This aggression is a serious violation of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and other principles of international law, including the UN Charter, and poses a clear challenge to the international order based on the rule of law.\nUnilateral attempts to change the status quo by force, such as Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, can never be tolerated anywhere in the world.\u00a0 From this point of view, Japan has consistently and strongly condemned Russia, imposed strict sanctions against the country, and provided global support for Ukraine.\u00a0 In order to bring Russia\u2019s aggression to an end as soon as possible, the international community should enhance its coordination more than ever and lay the united voice that unilateral change of the status quo by force is unacceptable.\nAt the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in February, which I attended, a resolution calling for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine was adopted with the support of the overwhelming majority of all member-states.\u00a0 The international community hopes that peace will come to Ukraine as soon as possible.\u00a0 But it must be not a mere ceasefire, but a just peace based on the principles of the UN Charter.\nWe should not allow the world to revert to the jungle, where brute force and coercion would prevail.\u00a0 We should protect the free and open international order based on the rule of law in which all nations, large or small, can make decisions freely under international law.\u00a0 From this perspective, during Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s recent visit to Ukraine, he conveyed to President Zelenskyy Japan\u2019s high regard for the peace formula that President Zelenskyy has been advocating as a path to a just peace.\nIn the G7 Pluses, where Japan hosts the presidency this year, I chaired a G7 foreign ministers meeting in February, and G7 foreign ministers underlined their commitment to upholding the international order based on the rule of law, and committed to actively working with Ukraine for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.\nIn order to stop Russia\u2019s aggression as soon as possible, Japan, as the G7 presidency, we maintain the unity of the G7 and other likeminded countries, and promote strict sanctions against Russia and robust support for Ukraine.\u00a0 At the upcoming G7 foreign ministers meeting in Karuizawa, Nagano, and G7 Hiroshima Summit, we would like to send a strong message to the world that G7 will never tolerate unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force anywhere in the world, or accept Russia\u2019s nuclear threats, let alone its use of nuclear weapons.\u00a0 The G7 is determined to uphold the international order based on the rule of law.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, thanks very much to our friend Foreign Minister Hayashi for joining us with these pre-recorded remarks.\u00a0 And thanks to everyone for joining us today.\u00a0 And Dmytro, thank you very, very much for being here, for sharing and going through the peace plan that President Zelenskyy has put forward.\nAll of us are committed to peace, but I believe also all of us are committed to making sure that that peace is a just and lasting one that respects Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u00a0 And as you heard today, Ukraine is proposing 10 common-sense principles that could serve as a roadmap to peace.\u00a0 This war could, of course, end tomorrow if President Putin so chose, by withdrawing Russia\u2019s forces from Ukraine.\u00a0 But meanwhile, we have a plan put forward many weeks ago now by Ukraine.\u00a0 I really commend the plan to each and every one of you and would ask you to consider the 10 principles and, of course, to stand with Ukraine on the path to a just and durable peace.\nWith that, we\u2019re adjourned for today with my thanks, and we\u2019ll be looking forward to seeing many of you in the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone, for joining today.\n\n\n\n[1]\u00a0Ms. Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url":

Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State", "audience": "FREEDOM ONLINE COALITION EVENT ATLANTIC COUNCIL", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "March 27, 2023", "content": "\n\nGood afternoon. It\u2019s good to be with you. Thank you, Rose, for your introduction and for all of the work that the Freedom Online Coalition is doing.\nIt is fitting to be here at the Atlantic Council for this event, because your mission sums up our purpose perfectly: \u201cshaping the global future together.\u201d\nThat is our fundamental charge in the field of technology and democracy\u2014how we use modern innovations to forge a better future.\nThat\u2019s what the DFR Lab strives to achieve through your research and advocacy. That\u2019s what the Freedom Online Coalition, its members, observers, and Advisory Network seek to accomplish through our work. Thank you for your partnership.\nMore than five decades ago\u2014seems like a long time ago, but really, very short\u2014the internet found its origins in the form of the first online message ever sent\u2014all of two letters in length, delivered from a professor at UCLA to colleagues at Stanford.\nIt was part of a project conceived in university labs and facilitated by government. It was an effort meant to test the outer limits of rapidly evolving technologies and tap into the transformative power of swiftly growing computer networks.\nWhat these pioneers intended, at the time, was actually to devise a system that could allow people to communicate in the event of a nuclear attack or another catastrophic event.\nYet what they created changed everything. How we live and work. How we participate in our economy and our politics. How we organize movements. How we consume media, read books, order groceries, pay bills, run businesses, conduct research, learn, write, and do nearly anything we can think of.\nChange didn\u2019t happen overnight, of course, and that change came with both promise and peril.\nThis was a remarkable feat of scientific discovery, and it upended life as we know it, for better and sometimes worse. Over the years, as we went from search engines to social media, we started to face complicated questions, as leaders, as parents and grandparents, as members of the global community.\nQuestions about how the internet can best be utilized; how it should be governed; who might misuse it; how it impacts our children\u2019s mental and emotional health; who could access it and how we can ensure that access is equitable, benefitting people in big cities, rural areas, and everywhere in between.\nBig picture questions arose about these tectonic shifts\u2014what they would mean for our values and our systems of government. Whether it\u2019s the internet as we understand it today or artificial intelligence revolutionizing our world tomorrow, will digital tools create more democracy or less? Will they be deployed to maximize human rights or limit them? Will they be used to enlarge the circle of freedom or constrain and contract it?\nFor the United States, the Freedom Online Coalition, and likeminded partners, the answers should point in a clear direction: at a basic level, the internet should be open and secure for everyone. It should be a force for free enterprise and free expression.\nIt should be a vast forum that increases connectivity; that expands people\u2019s ability to exercise their rights; that facilitates unfettered access to knowledge and unprecedented opportunities for billions.\nMeeting that standard, however, is not simple. Change that happens this fast in society and reaches this far into our lives rarely yields a straightforward response, especially when there are those who seek to manipulate technology for nefarious ends.\nThe fact is, where all of us may strive to ensure technology delivers for our citizens, autocratic regimes are finding another means of repression.\nWhere democracies seek to tap into the power of the internet to lift individuals up to their highest potential, authoritarian governments seek to deploy these technologies to divide and disenfranchise; to censor and suppress; to limit freedoms, foment fear, and violate human dignity.\nThey view the internet not as a network of empowerment, but as an avenue of control. From Cuba and Venezuela to Iran, Russia, the PRC, and beyond, they see new ways to crush dissent through internet shutdowns, virtual blackouts, restricted networks, blocked websites, and more.\nHere in the United States, alongside many of you, we have acted to sustain connections to internet-based services and the free flow of information across the globe, so no one is cut off from each other or the outside world, or cut off from the truth.\nYet even with these steps, none of us are perfect.\nEvery day\u2014almost everywhere we look\u2014democracies grapple with how to harness data for positive ends while preserving privacy; how to bring out the best in modern innovations without amplifying their worst possibilities; how to protect the most vulnerable online while defending the liberties we hold dear.\nIt isn\u2019t an easy task\u2014and in many respects, as I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s only getting harder.\nThe growth of surveillance capabilities is forcing us to constantly reevaluate how to strike the balance between using technologies for public safety and preserving personal liberties.\nThe advent of AI is arriving with a level of speed and sophistication we haven\u2019t witnessed before. It will not be five decades before we know the impact of AI. That impact is happening now.\nWho creates it, who controls it, who manipulates it will help define the next phase of the intersection between technology and democracy. By the time we realize AI\u2019s massive reach and potential, the internet\u2019s influence might really pale in comparison.\nThe digital sphere is evolving at a pace we can\u2019t fully fathom and in ways at least I can\u2019t completely imagine. Frankly, we have to accept the fact that the FOC\u2019s absolutely vital work can feel like a continuous game of catchup. We have to acknowledge that the guidelines we adopt today might seem outdated as soon as tomorrow.\nNow, let me be perfectly clear: I am not saying we should throw our hands in the air and give up. To the contrary: I\u2019m suggesting that this is a massive challenge we have to confront and a generational charge we have to embrace.\nWe have to set standards that meet this moment\u2014and that lay the foundation for whatever comes next. We have to address what we see in front of us\u2014and equip ourselves with the building blocks to tackle what we cannot predict.\nTo put a spin on a famous phrase: with the great power of these digital tools comes great responsibility to use that power for good.\nThat duty falls on all our shoulders, and the stakes could not be higher for internet freedom, for our common prosperity, for global progress.\nBecause expanded connectivity\u2014getting the two billion unconnected people online\u2014can drive economic growth; raise standards of living; create jobs; and fuel innovative solutions for everything from combating climate change to reducing food insecurity to improving public health to promoting good governance and sustainable development.\nSo we need to double-down on what we stand for: an affirmative, cohesive, values-driven, rights-respecting vision for democracy in the digital era.\nWe need to reinforce rules of the road for cyberspace that mirror and match the ideals of the rules-based international order.\nWe need to be ready to adapt our legal and policy approaches for emerging technologies.\nWe need the FOC, alongside partners in civil society, industry, and elsewhere, to remain an essential vehicle for keeping the digital sphere open, secure, interoperable, and reliable.\nThe United States believes in this cause as a central plank of our democracy and of our diplomacy.\nThat\u2019s why Secretary Blinken established our Department\u2019s Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy\u2014and made digital freedom one of its core priorities.\nThat\u2019s why the Biden-Harris Administration spearheaded and signed onto the principles in the Declaration for the Future of the Internet, alongside 61 countries ready to advance a positive vision for digital technologies.\nThat\u2019s why we released core principles for tech platform accountability last fall, and why the President called on Congress to take bipartisan action in January.\nThat\u2019s why we are committed to using our turn as FOC Chair as a platform to advance a series of key goals.\nFirst, we will deepen efforts to protect fundamental freedoms, including human rights defenders online and offline\u2014many of whom speak out at grave risk to their own lives and to their families\u2019 safety. We will do so by countering disruptions to internet access, combating internet shutdowns, and ensuring everyone\u2019s ability to keep using technology to advance the reach of freedom.\nSecond, we will focus on building resilience against the rise of digital authoritarianism, the proliferation of commercial spyware, and the misuse of technology, which we know has disproportionate and chilling impacts on journalists, activists, women, and LGBTQI+ individuals.\nTo that end, just a few hours ago, President Biden issued an Executive Order that, for the first time, will prohibit our government\u2019s use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our national security\u2014or that\u2019s been misused by foreign actors to enable human rights abuses overseas.\nOn top of that step, as part of this week\u2019s Summit for Democracy, the members of the FOC and other partners will lay out a set of Guiding Principles on Government Use of Surveillance Technologies.\nThese principles describe responsible practices for the use of surveillance tech. They reflect democratic values and the rule of law; adhere to international obligations; strive to address the disparate effect on certain communities; and minimize the data collected.\nOur third objective as FOC Chair focuses on artificial intelligence. and the way emerging technologies respect human rights.\nAs some try to apply AI to help automate censorship of content and suppression of free expression, FOC members must build a consensus around policies to limit these abuses.\nFinally, we will strengthen our efforts on digital inclusion. On closing the gender gap online. On expanding digital literacy and skill building. On promoting access to safe online spaces and robust civic participation for all, particularly women and girls, LGBTQI+ persons, those with disabilities, and more.\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: the FOC\u2019s work is essential, and its impact will boil down to what we do, as a coalition, to advance a simple but powerful idea\u2014preserving and promoting the value of openness.\nThe internet, the web, the online universe is at its best when it is open for creativity and collaboration. Open for innovation and ideas. Open for communication and community, debate and discourse, disagreement and diplomacy.\nThe same is true for democracy\u2014a system of governance, a social contract, and a societal structure that is strongest when defined by open spaces to vote, deliberate, gather, demonstrate, organize, and advocate.\nThis openness could not be more important. Because when the digital world is transparent. when democracy is done right\u2014that\u2019s when everyone has a stake in our collective success.\nThat\u2019s what makes everyone strive for a society that is free and fair, in our politics and in cyberspace.\nThat\u2019s what will give everyone reason to keep tapping into the positive potential of technology to forge a future of endless possibility and boundless prosperity for all.\nLet\u2019s keep shaping that future, together.\nSo, good luck with all your remaining work. There\u2019s lots ahead. And thank you so much for all that you do.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinken-with-colombian-foreign-minister-alvaro-leyva-at-the-u-s-colombia-high-level-dialogue/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Blinken With Colombian Foreign Minister \u00c1lvaro Leyva at the U.S.-Colombia High-Level Dialogue\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

I would like to welcome all of you, especially our guests from Colombia. Bienvenidos a todos. This is the 10th year we mark the \u2013 this High-Level Dialogue, and we are honored to host this year. The High-Level Dialogues present remarkable opportunities to engage at a deeper level on our shared interests. The dialogue continues to speak to the strength of the bonds between our two countries. We are especially honored today by the presence of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who will formally open the dialogue.\nMr. Secretary, welcome.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good morning, everyone. Wonderful to see you all here. And to our friends from Colombia, bienvenido. I just am particularly pleased to do this because I also have a little history with this. In fact, I\u2019ve taken part in these dialogues going back to 2015 and 2016 when I was deputy secretary of state. So as Brian said, this has been an ongoing and, I believe, very important process between our two countries.\nA very special welcome, \u00c1lvaro, to you. Wonderful to have you here for what is indeed the 10th dialogue between \u2013 High-Level Dialogue between our countries.\nI had the opportunity to lead our delegation to the last dialogue, in Bogot\u00e1, in 2021, and it\u2019s a testament to the strength of the relationship that this exchange, as I said, has continued, and indeed has expanded, across administrations in both of our nations.\nThe dialogue \u2013 like a two-centuries-old friendship \u2013 is built on a shared foundation of two vibrant democracies committed to ensuring that our people can reach their full potential.\nWe recognize that when it comes to tackling the global challenges that are affecting the lives of Colombians and Americans alike \u2013 from the existential threat posed by climate change to the unprecedented movement of people across our hemisphere \u2013 we\u2019re simply better off when we\u2019re tackling these challenges together. And the ripple effects of our cooperation on these and other issues extend far beyond our two countries. They extend to the hemisphere; indeed they extend to the world.\nAcross the upcoming dialogue, we will focus on concrete steps to strengthen our cooperation and work to deliver tangible results for our people. So let me just take a few minutes to highlight some of the areas where we are going to work to do that.\nWe\u2019ll continue working to help Colombia reach its ambitious climate goals, from providing ongoing technical assistance on wind and solar projects to strengthening protection of the Amazon.\nWe\u2019ll expand pathways for farmers, for textile producers, and other small- and medium-sized businesses in rural areas to get their products to global markets, and reap the benefits of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement.\nOur dialogue will also focus, of course, on improving civilian security. For decades, we have worked to strengthen cooperation on security and law enforcement, and that will continue.\nAt the same time, we recognize that to sustainably reduce violence, we have to tackle the root causes of insecurity \u2013 like corruption, like impunity \u2013 impunity for crimes \u2013 human rights abuses, and the lack of economic opportunity.\nThat\u2019s why we continue to partner on bolstering the rule of law and expanding access to justice. And it\u2019s also why USAID is investing $60 million over five years to expand opportunities for Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities.\nEnsuring equitable development is a central focus of the Ethnic Chapter of the 2016 Peace Accord. It recognizes that there can be no lasting peace without justice and equality for the country\u2019s underserved communities. Back in October, I joined Vice President Marquez at the extraordinary Fragmentos Museum; I had the honor of signing the United States on as the chapter\u2019s first international accompanier.\nAmbassador Murillo \u2013 who is here today \u2013 was with us in Bogot\u00e1 on that historic day. He has dedicated much of his life to giving voice to these communities, including the Ethnic Chapter.\nIn the time since we signed on as an accompanier, the U.S. embassy in Colombia, led by our Charg\u00e9 Michael[1] Palmieri, who is with us here today as well, has dedicated a full team supporting the Ethnic Chapter\u2019s implementation, building on our longstanding partnerships with both Colombia\u2019s Government and with civil society. And let me just give one example of those relationships.\nA few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to join our First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, in honoring International Women of Courage at the White House. The awardees included Josefina Klinger, a remarkable Afro-Colombia leader who rallied her community around transforming the national park where they live into an ecotourism destination, preserving the environment, providing a sustainable livelihood to local families.\nFor years, we have been a proud supporter of her organization, including when she was threatened by drug trafficking organizations for the work that she was doing.\nCountering these illicit groups and the flow of illegal drugs is a key part of our ongoing discussions on security, including here at the High-Level Dialogue. We\u2019re bringing a holistic approach to this challenge.\nThat means looking at ways to further reduce demand by investing in substance abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery for those who are struggling with addiction in our countries \u2013 because this is fundamentally a public health problem.\nAnd it means discussing ways to reduce supply \u2013 from strengthening interdiction by land and sea, to providing vulnerable communities with alternative ways to earn a living.\nThe dialogue also gives us an opportunity to deepen our joint efforts to address unprecedented migration across our hemisphere. Indeed, we are all experiencing unprecedented migration around the world. There are more people on the move, forcibly deplaced from their homes around the world \u2013 more than 100 million \u2013 than at any time since we\u2019ve been recording these numbers. Colombia was a crucial partner in shaping the Los Angeles Declaration, which has put its principles into practice in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. More than 1.5 million Venezuelans have been granted Temporary Protective Status in Colombia, allowing them to work, to send their kids to school, to access public health services.\nHere again, I had a chance to meet last time I was in Bogot\u00e1 with some Venezuelan families \u2013 this is back in October at the integrata centers \u2013 and heard first-hand how TPS has allowed them to become productive members of their new communities. Colombia is showing the way that migration, when it\u2019s managed safely, humanely, and as a region, can actually increase stability and can be an opportunity, not a burden, for communities.\nThe United States has been a steadfast partner in these efforts, providing more than $900 million in humanitarian, economic, development, and health assistance to Colombia, to help Colombia address the consequences of the Venezuela crisis.\nNext month, we will host our first-ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver, Colorado. The mayor of Bogot\u00e1, my host at the integrata center, will be there, along with the mayors of Cartagena, Barranquilla, dozens of other cities across the hemisphere, including in the United States. This summit will allow them to share best practices in tackling many of the issues that we discuss here.\nI think one of the things we know is that there needs to be and there is an integrated response across national governments, but these challenges also have answers in work \u2013 at a subnational level, between and among municipalities, between municipalities and the federal government, states, et cetera. Again, it\u2019s a reminder that important as this dialogue between our national governments is, there are U.S.-Colombian dialogues at every level of our societies \u2013 between our governments, businesses, civil society, and directly between our citizens.\nAnd I\u2019m convinced, based on the experience that we\u2019ve had over many years, that these dialogues are one of the most important ways to actually benefit our people, to benefit our communities, to benefit the region that we share.\nSo with that, thank you all for being here, thank you for your participation, for all the hard work that\u2019s gone into today, for all the hard work that will continue today and in the days that follow.\nAnd with that, \u00c1lvaro, the floor is yours. (Applause.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER LEYVA: (Via interpreter) Mr. Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken, it is a great honor for me to be here with you. I\u2019d first like to extend greetings from President Petro, and to, of course, President Biden. We are allies. And this is not new; we\u2019ve been for a long time. We are actually on the tenth High-Level Dialogue, and I have to say it\u2019s impressive. Look at the delegation we\u2019re bringing to you. Behind each and every one of these people there\u2019s a wise person, and I\u2019m not exaggerating. People who have great reputation on the moral and intellectual levels, and they have devoted their careers to the seven points that once again bring us here, which are the social and economic opportunities; public diplomacy; the environment and climate change; energy, mining, and infrastructure; democracy, good governance, and human rights; security, counternarcotics, and rural development; and migration.\nThese are issues that in the eighth and ninth dialogues were there, but they didn\u2019t have the significance that they have today. Today there\u2019s a geopolitical dimension; new things are happening every day; new visions are crystallizing on each one of these topics. And so today\u2019s conference goes beyond expectations. We are allies; we truly are, because we acknowledge that we have a new role in this world. Just to give you an example, we used to be a nation known for cocaine, but now we are one of the biggest sponges when it comes to observing solutions for seeking ways of putting an end to the disappearance of humankind. We\u2019re saving the planet, and so our relationship is thus modified. Because there\u2019s a new head of state, he has a discourse, but it\u2019s not surprising \u2013 there will never be a surprise coming from my administration, in our relationships, and certainly not with \u2013 in our relationships with our longtime allies, such as the United States.\nThis brings me to manifest something that is very important: migration. Migration is a political issue for many countries \u2013 for us, for the United States, for Mexico. That\u2019s why the President has managed to convince Mexico of the importance of celebrating as soon as possible a Latin American conference on migration.\nBangladesh had never been through Colombia. Afghanistan had never gone through Colombia. China had never gone through Colombia. But they\u2019re coming through Colombia too on their way north, and they\u2019re coming back. We not only have the migrants coming from Venezuela, which of course has its own circumstances, but we\u2019re seeing a phenomenon that touches the whole planet. So I wanted to tell you that, just as Mr. Petro said, we are going to celebrate that conference on migration as soon as possible.\nThe conference on drug trafficking \u2013 that stopped being a Colombian topic. There is a multinational organization that is impacting the globe. We saw that in Ecuador. In one single day, 11 attacks that left people dead. Talking to people \u2013 Lula, right after he took charge, he said, \u201cPresident Petro, Brazil \u2013 in Brazil the multinational drug enterprise is creating problems for us. We have to attack them with intelligence.\u201d So how best to do this? By using the knowledge that Colombia has and creating and celebrating a conference on migration that involves the whole continent to discuss drug trafficking, and we will not only comply with what was said in Havana, but also we will analyze demand because we\u2019re all in the same boat here. I think it\u2019s of the utmost importance to highlight the call that President Petro has placed upon all of us.\nIn terms of fighting greenhouse emissions, something completely new, we are going to hold \u2013 and I think Canada has already said yes \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a conference on the power interconnection grid from Patagonia, just so we can bring to the North electricity coming from renewal \u2013 clean energy methods. This is just to say that this High-Level Dialogue goes beyond business as usual, and we are going to need the U.S. to be present, to be by our side in each and every one of these topics, because we are the same people, the same continent, the same security, the same issues \u2013 perhaps a little bigger now up north, of course, given the global responsibility that the U.S. has in its role in the world. But each one of the people that you see here is an ally, and they can bring solutions \u2013 definitive solutions to the problems that are afflicting the world.\nI am very thankful for your presence. Please take into consideration this new vision that President Petro is bringing. He is trying his best to deal with continental circumstances, to deal with the problems afflicting humanity, and of course to deal with problems that are also happening in the U.S. We\u2019re all in the same boat, and we are guided by the same goal.\nThank you for being here today. (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Thank you, Foreign Minister Leyva. Thank you, Secretary Blinken. And with that powerful introduction, I have the honor to declare the 10th High-Level Dialogue open. I expect great things, and I am sure that you will deliver for both of our peoples.\nHave a great day. (Applause.)\n\nFrancisco \u2191\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-opening-remarks-before-the-house-committee-on-appropriations-subcommittee-on-state-foreign-operations-and-related-programs-on-the-fy24-department-of-state-budget-request/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Chairman Diaz-Balart, Chairwoman Granger, Ranking Member Lee, Ranking Member DeLauro, all the members of the committee,\u00a0thank you for the opportunity today to speak with you about the FY24 budget for the State Department and USAID. \u00a0But also, thank you day-in, day-out for the work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 This is critical for us.\u00a0 We appreciate deeply the work of this committee, and I really look forward to the year ahead as we work together to try to make sure, together, that we have the strongest possible tools to advance America\u2019s interests around the world.\nAnd second, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Lee, thank you for \u2013 both of you \u2013 for your strong and positive words about the State Department \u2013 the people of the State Department.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u00a0 I am so deeply honored for this period of time to be leading them and serving with them.\u00a0 And I deeply appreciate the appreciation you\u2019ve expressed for the work that they do, day-in, day-out.\u00a0 So thank you for that.\nAnd I could not agree more \u2013 we are at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over, and there is an intense competition underway right now to shape what comes next.\u00a0 The United States has a positive vision for the future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, that is prosperous.\nThis budget will help us advance that vision and deliver on the issues that matter to the American people, by preparing us to take on two major sets of challenges that are distinct but also interconnected and overlapping.\nThe first set is posed by our strategic competitors \u2013 the immediate, acute threat posed by Russia\u2019s autocracy and aggression, most destructively through its brutal aggression against Ukraine, and of course, the long-term challenge that is posed by the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nThe second set of challenges is posed by shared global tests that we have to meet, including the climate crisis, migration, food and energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly affect the lives of our fellow citizens, as well as their livelihoods, and people around the world.\nWith this committee\u2019s leadership and support, including through the FY23 Omnibus, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical position than we were a few years ago to take on these challenges.\u00a0 We have drawn enormous power from investments that we\u2019ve made here at home in our economic strength and technological edge, including through the Infrastructure Investment Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has never been stronger, and I think that\u2019s in part because we have reinvested in them, working to re-engage them, rejuvenate them, re-energize them.\nWe\u2019re expanding our presence in critical regions, like the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And we\u2019re leading unprecedented coalitions to confront aggression and address humanitarian crises around the world.\nThe FY24 budget request for the State Department and USAID meets this moment.\u00a0 The budget will sustain our security, our economic and energy and humanitarian support for Ukraine, so that we ensure that President Putin\u2019s war remains a strategic failure.\nThe budget will also strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC.\u00a0 President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 That\u2019s why this proposal asks for an 18 percent increase in our budget for that region for FY \u2013 over FY23.\u00a0 The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory proposals \u2013 I suspect we\u2019ll come back to those \u2013 for new, innovative investments to outcompete China, including by enhancing our presence in the region, ensuring that what we and our fellow democracies have to offer \u2013 including things like maritime security, disease surveillance, energy infrastructure, digital technology \u2013 is more attractive than the alternative being proposed.\nThe budget will help us push back on advancing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening democracies around the world including through supporting independent media, countering corruption, defending free and fair elections.\u00a0 And it will allow us to pay our contributions to international organizations because we do need to be at the table wherever and whenever new international rules, standards, norms are being decided that affect the livelihoods of our people.\u00a0 Wherever they\u2019re being debated and decided, we need to be there.\nThe budget will also allow us to continue leading the world in addressing these global challenges, from food and energy insecurity to climate and health crises.\u00a0 Just on that last point: we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which I believe is one the greatest achievements in our foreign policy over the last couple of decades.\u00a0 And to Ranking Member Lee, to you and others, for your strong support and leadership on this, I think it\u2019s been a great tribute and credit to our country.\u00a0 It\u2019s something I hear, as I travel, for example, throughout Africa.\u00a0 It saved 25 million lives.\u00a0 This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/AIDS while advancing health security more broadly through a new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I look forward to working with Congress to establish this year.\nThe budget will advance our efforts to modernize our department, including by expanding our training float, updating our technology, carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, including to make our overseas missions more accessible.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful for the progress that we\u2019ve already made together, including Congress\u2019s support in updating the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and the Accountability Review Board, to give us the flexibility to open new missions and to better manage the risks that our people face around the world.\nWe know there\u2019s more to do, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with Congress, working with this committee, to accelerate modernization efforts so that the department can better attract, retain, and support our first-rate workforce that you referred to.\u00a0 We\u2019re in a competition there, too, for talent, and I want to make sure we have a department that attracts that workforce and keeps them.\nFinally, the budget will further what is a personal priority for me that\u2019s been referenced today already, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan allies.\u00a0 Keeping our promises to those who stood by us and served with us remains an unwavering priority for me.\u00a0 The budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.\nWhen I took on this role, one of the things that I was dead serious about was working to restore Congress\u2019s place as an equal partner in our foreign policymaking.\u00a0 I really am serious and committed to that.\u00a0 I, Mr. Chairman, deeply appreciate the conversations we\u2019ve had and the work that I hope we can do together.\nSo with that, I welcome questions, comments.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

much.\u00a0 Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, very good to be with you.\u00a0 Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, to all the committee members here today, thank you for this opportunity to speak with you about our proposed FY24 budget for the State Department and USAID.\nAnd I think as you\u2019ve both laid out in different ways, we are meeting at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over, and there is an intense competition underway to shape, to determine what comes next.\nWe, the United States, have a positive vision for the future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, that is prosperous.\u00a0\u00a0 And it\u2019s our belief that the budget that we put forward will help advance that vision and deliver on issues that actually matter to the American people, particularly by preparing us to effectively meet two broad sets of challenges.\nThe first is the challenge posed by our strategic competitors \u2013 the immediate, acute threat posed by Russia\u2019s autocracy and aggression, most destructively, of course, through its brutal aggression against Ukraine, and the long-term challenge from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nThe second set of challenges is really posed by shared global tests, including the climate crisis, migration, food and energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly impact the lives and livelihoods of Americans and people around the world.\nWith this committee\u2019s leadership and support, including through the FY23 Omnibus, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical position than we were two years ago, hence our ability to deal with these challenges I think has been enhanced.\nWe have drawn enormous power from investments that we\u2019ve made in our own economic strength and technological edge at home, including through the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has never been stronger.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve been building on it, not only strengthening existing alliances and partnerships, but building new coalitions of countries and other institutions that are fit for purpose.\u00a0 We\u2019re expanding our presence in critical regions, like the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We\u2019re leading the unprecedented coalitions to confront aggression and address humanitarian challenges around the world.\nThe \u201924 budget request for the State Department and USAID meets this moment head on.\nThis budget will sustain our security, economic, energy, and humanitarian support for Ukraine to ensure that President Putin\u2019s war remains a strategic failure.\nIt will strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC.\u00a0 President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is why this proposal asks for an 18 percent increase in our budget for that region over FY23.\u00a0 The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory proposals \u2013 and we\u2019re happy to talk about why we proceeded this way \u2013 for new innovative investments to outcompete China, including by enhancing our presence in the region, and ensuring that what we and our fellow democracies are able to offer, including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean energy infrastructure, digital technology, is more attractive than any alternative.\nThe budget will help us push back on advancing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening democracies around the world, including through supporting independent media, countering corruption, defending free and fair elections.\u00a0 And it will allow us to pay our contributions to international organizations, because we need to be at the table wherever and whenever new international rules that affect the livelihoods of our people are being debated and being decided.\nThe budget will allow us to continue leading the world to addressing these global challenges, from food and energy insecurity to climate and health crises.\u00a0 And just on that last point, as you all know, we\u2019re celebrating now the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which I think is one of the greatest achievements in our foreign policy over the last decades.\u00a0 It\u2019s helped us save 25 million lives around the world.\u00a0 This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/AIDS, while advancing health security more broadly through a new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I look forward to working with Congress to establish this year.\nThe budget will advance our efforts to modernize the State Department, including by expanding our training float, updating our technology, carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, including to make our overseas missions more accessible.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful for the progress we\u2019ve already made together, including Congress\u2019s support in updating the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and Accountability Review Board to give us some of the flexibility that we need to open new missions and better manage the risks that we face.\u00a0 We know there\u2019s more to do, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with Congress to accelerate these modernization efforts so that the department can better attract, better retain, and support a first-rate workforce as they advance our interests in what is a very complex and fast-moving world.\nFinally, the budget will further a personal priority for me, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan allies.\u00a0 Keeping our promises to those who served alongside the U.S. remains an unwavering priority.\u00a0 This budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.\nWhen I took on this role, I committed to doing my part to try to restore Congress\u2019s place as an equal partner in our foreign policymaking.\u00a0 I\u2019m determined to continue to do that and very much appreciate the work that we\u2019ve been able to do with this committee over the last couple of years and look forward to the work ahead.\nAnd with that, I welcome any questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

everybody.\u00a0 And welcome back to those of us that were on the road with us last week.\nThe Secretary will make some very brief remarks and take a couple of questions before he has to head back upstairs for some engagements.\u00a0 Assistant Secretary Barclay and Ambassador Van Schaack, though, will hang back downstairs to answer some more Q&A once the Secretary departs.\nSecretary, the floor is yours.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Vedant, thank you.\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\nLet me just start with some very good news this morning, and that is the release of Jeffrey Woodke after more than six years in captivity.\u00a0 I want to thank the Government of Niger, where I was just last week, for its important assistance in bringing him home.\u00a0 I also want to thank our team, starting with Special Envoy Roger Carstens, all of those who have been working at the department to bring him home, tireless efforts, and I\u2019m very pleased that we are now seeing that come to fruition today.\nAs you know, I have no higher priority or focus than bringing home any unjustly detained American, wherever that is in the world.\u00a0 We won\u2019t rest until they\u2019re all home and, like Jeffrey, reunited with their families.\nThis morning, I\u2019ll be launching the 2022 Human Rights Report.\u00a0 But just before I turn to that, I want to speak to what\u2019s happening right now in Moscow.\nToday, and throughout this week, President Xi is meeting with President Putin in Russia.\u00a0 We expect that China may use this visit to reiterate calls for a ceasefire under its peace proposal.\nThe United States welcomes any initiative that advances a just and durable peace.\u00a0 China\u2019s proposal includes elements that we have long supported, including ensuring nuclear safety, resolving the humanitarian crisis, protecting civilians.\nAnd indeed, the first element calls for upholding sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all countries.\nThe fundamental element of any plan for ending the war in Ukraine and producing a just and durable peace must be upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nAny plan that does not prioritize this critical principle is a stalling tactic at best or is merely seeking to facilitate an unjust outcome.\u00a0 That is not constructive diplomacy.\nCalling for a ceasefire that does not include the removal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory would effectively be supporting the ratification of Russian conquest.\u00a0 It would recognize Russia\u2019s attempts to seize a sovereign neighbor\u2019s territory by force.\u00a0 It would enable Russia to further entrench positions in Ukraine.\u00a0 And a ceasefire now, without a durable solution, would allow President Putin to rest and refit his troops and then restart the war at a time more advantageous to Russia.\nThe world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia \u2013 supported by China or any other country \u2013 to freeze the war on its own terms.\u00a0 Such a move would violate the UN Charter and delay \u2013 defy, excuse me \u2013 the will of the 141 countries who have condemned Russia\u2019s war in the United Nations General Assembly.\nOne party to this conflict \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 has already put forward a just peace formula.\u00a0 If China is committed to supporting an end to the war based on the principles of the UN Charter as called for in point one of its plan, it can engage with President Zelenskyy and Ukraine on this basis and use its influence to compel Moscow to pull back its forces.\nRussia\u2019s purported annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, including vast areas it doesn\u2019t even control, and its ongoing, brutal attacks on civilians make clear that President Putin currently has no interest in such a peace.\nThat President Xi is traveling to Russia days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Putin suggests that China feels no responsibility to hold the Kremlin accountable for the atrocities committed in Ukraine, and instead of even condemning them, it would rather provide diplomatic cover for Russia to continue to commit those very crimes.\nNow, every year, I come to this podium for the launch of the Human Rights Report.\u00a0 I do so because the report embodies the importance of human rights for American diplomacy and for our vision of an open, free, prosperous, and secure world.\nHuman rights are universal.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t defined by any one country, philosophy, or region.\u00a0 They apply to everyone, everywhere.\nThis report makes a factual, objective, and rigorous accounting of human rights conditions around the world, looking at nearly 200 countries and territories.\u00a0 And, importantly, it applies the same standards to everyone: our allies and partners, and countries with which we have differences.\nThe goal of this report is not to lecture or to shame.\u00a0 Rather, it is to provide a resource for those individuals working around the world to safeguard and uphold human dignity when it\u2019s under threat in so many ways.\u00a0 And while this report looks outward to countries around the world, we know the United States faces its own set of challenges on human rights.\nOur willingness to confront our challenges openly, to acknowledge our own shortcomings \u2013 not to sweep them under the rug or pretend they don\u2019t exist \u2013 that is what distinguishes us and other democracies.\nThe report makes clear that, in 2022, in countries across every region, we continued to see a backsliding in human rights conditions \u2013 the closing of civic space, disrespect for fundamental human dignity.\nThe report details the appalling and ongoing abuses committed by the regime in Iran against its own people.\u00a0 In the wake of the tragic death of Mahsa Amini, authorities have killed hundreds of peaceful protestors, including dozens of children, and have arbitrarily detained thousands.\nIranian forces are using torture and gender-based violence against arrested protesters.\u00a0 Journalists and lawyers are harassed and pre-emptively detained.\u00a0 Sham trials and hasty executions are used to further intimidate the people of Iran.\nThe international community has come together to condemn and confront Iran\u2019s brutal crackdown, and we\u2019ll continue to act in support of the right of the Iranian people to speak out for their fundamental freedoms.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban relentlessly discriminates against and represses women and girls, so far issuing 80 decrees and \u2013 that restrict women\u2019s freedom of movement and their right to education and work.\u00a0 The Taliban\u2019s December edict barring female employees of non-governmental organizations from the workplace imperils the tens of millions of Afghans who depend on humanitarian assistance for their very survival.\nHuman rights have further eroded in Burma, where the military regime brutalizes the population.\u00a0 Thousands of activists have been killed by the authorities \u2013 including four pro-democracy leaders executed last summer.\nThe PRC continues its abuses, including genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs, repression of Tibetans, crackdown on basic rights in Hong Kong, and targeting of individuals on the mainland for exercising fundamental freedoms.\nIn Cuba, courts have issued draconian jail sentences to hundreds of people for protesting for their rights.\u00a0 And in Nicaragua, the authoritarian government continues to detain political prisoners and hold them in appalling prison conditions.\nThe 2022 Human Rights Report is also a reminder of the extraordinary courage of so many \u2013 activists, journalists, lawyers, government officials, regular citizens \u2013 who stand up to these abuses.\u00a0 Many do so at great personal risk of retaliation, harassment, detention, torture, even death.\nIn February, we celebrated ten Global Human Rights Defender awardees \u2013 individuals from around the world who are promoting and defending fundamental freedoms, from combatting slavery, to advocating for families of those forcibly disappeared, to demanding better wages and working conditions for low-income laborers, to representing political prisoners on death row.\u00a0 This report honors them.\nI\u2019m also proud of my colleagues here at the State Department \u2013 in Washington and at every post around the world \u2013 for not only reporting and documenting human rights abuses but also drawing on the power and purpose of American diplomacy to advance human dignity.\nNow, as you know, I recently traveled to Ethiopia, where I had a very productive discussion with Prime Minister Abiy and his team.\u00a0 I also met with Getachew Reda, the TPLF signatory to the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, who was just selected to be the leader of its interim administration.\u00a0 I commended both sides for reaching that agreement and the significant progress made in its implementation.\nWith this agreement in place, the fighting has stopped, humanitarian assistance is flowing, services are being restored, human rights[i] in northern Ethiopia are significantly down, Eritrean forces are leaving, the Ethiopian Government is taking the first steps toward transitional justice.\nBut, as I discussed with both sides during my visit, to build a durable peace, there must be acknowledgment of the atrocities committed by all parties, as well as accountability together with reconciliation.\nThe conflict in northern Ethiopia was devastating.\u00a0 Men, women, and children were killed.\u00a0 Women and girls were subject to horrific forms of sexual violence.\u00a0 Thousands were forcibly displaced from their homes.\u00a0 Entire communities were specifically targeted based on their ethnicity.\nMany of these actions were not random or a mere byproduct of war.\u00a0 They were calculated and deliberate.\nAfter the department\u2019s careful review of the law and the facts, I\u2019ve determined that members of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, Eritrean Defense Forces, Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front forces, and Amhara forces committed war crimes during the conflict in northern Ethiopia.\nMembers of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, the Eritrean Defense Forces, and Amhara forces also committed crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and persecution.\nMembers of the Amhara forces committed the crime against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer and committed ethnic cleansing through their treatment of Tigrayans in western Tigray.\nWe welcome the commitment that the parties to the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement have made to acknowledge the atrocities committed and their devastating consequences.\nThe Government of Ethiopia is taking the first steps by publicly releasing a detailed green paper of transitional justice options based upon best practices and building upon the experiences of other states emerging from periods of mass violence.\u00a0 It has invited experts from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to join the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to deploy a team of human rights monitors to conflict-affected areas to ensure that such acts have truly ceased.\nThe government is also holding public consultations about transitional justice, which, as I discussed with the prime minister, should be inclusive of all stakeholders and provide victims a voice.\u00a0 The process is benefiting from the advice of experts in the field, including members of my team who participated in a workshop on transitional justice with other international specialists just last week.\nFinally, and crucially, we urge the Government of Ethiopia and the Government of Eritrea, as well as the TPLF, to hold those responsible for these atrocities accountable.\nThese steps \u2013 acknowledgement, accountability, reconciliation \u2013 are key to breaking the cycle of ethnic and political violence that has gripped Ethiopia and prevented it from reaching its unlimited potential for so long.\nThe United States will partner with Ethiopia as it implements a credible transitional justice process for the benefit of all victims and affected communities.\u00a0 We will stand with Ethiopia as it honestly faces the abuses in its past, provides accountability for the harms committed against its citizens, and moves toward a future of lasting peace.\nWith that, happy to take a couple of questions before turning it over to my colleagues.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Matt, go ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and welcome back.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I\u2019ve got about 17 questions, but for the sake of \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Hold on, let me get my pen out.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But \u2013 yeah, but for the sake of both you and my colleagues, I\u2019ll narrow it down to just one.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And that has to do with the Ethiopia \u2013 and the decision you just made.\u00a0 As you noted, you were just there.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t you make this determination either while you were there or before you went?\u00a0 Were your conversations while you were there instructive in \u2013 did the \u2013 in making this?\nAnd then the other thing is \u2013 on this \u2013 you seem to suggest that you think that Ethiopian courts can take care \u2013 can deal with this.\u00a0 That is not so much the case as it relates to Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 And I \u2013 so I\u2019m just wondering why it is that you think that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Matt.\u00a0 Well, look, I\u2019m not \u2013 obviously not going to get into the details of private discussions that I had, but two things.\u00a0 First, this determination is the product of a lot of very deliberate, detailed work, and we are, when we make these determinations, very focused on doing that work, making sure that we have the facts, that we apply them to the law, and all of that takes time and focus.\nIt seemed appropriate to release the determination that we made as we\u2019re putting out the Human Rights Report.\u00a0 And beyond that, I\u2019d say that in terms of what happens next in Ethiopia, including what process they establish to provide for justice, for accountability, we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been determined.\u00a0 What has been determined and what I could see from my meetings and conversations last week is a commitment on all sides to engage in this process of transitional justice; an acknowledgement of the atrocities that have been committed \u2013 again, by all sides \u2013 in the course of this conflict in northern Ethiopia; and, I believe, a commitment to genuinely get to a better place that has to include accountability, that has to include, I think, reconciliation if we\u2019re going to have a truly durable peace.\nThat\u2019s what I heard on the trip, and again, I think the situation that we\u2019re seeing now in Ethiopia is vastly different than situations in other parts of the world in that, over the last four months, the steps that all sides have taken to implement the cessation of hostilities agreement has literally saved lives and changed lives for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t erase what happened over the last two years, which is why it is so important that we get this transitional justice process moving and that there is accountability as well as reconciliation.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Afghanistan?\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s go to Missy in the back.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Please, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Afghan situation also is very bad.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Any message for our new year?\u00a0 We celebrated our new year.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Nazira, I\u2019m going to call the questions.\u00a0 Missy, (inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Please \u2013 you guys don\u2019t give me opportunity.\u00a0 Any comment about Afghan women?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your message for our new year?\u00a0 We celebrated, but Afghan women crying.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, we \u2014\nQUESTION: \u00a0I know you don\u2019t give me a chance.\u00a0 Sorry, I have a lot of pain.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019ll say very simply \u2013 no, no, I\u2019m happy to address that.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say very simply that we deplore the edicts that the Taliban have promulgated repeatedly that fundamentally repress the rights of Afghan women and girls.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen this now time and again: denying them education, denying them the ability to work, denying them the ability to participate in the provision of humanitarian assistance that benefits all Afghans.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s safe to say from conversations with countries around the world that to the extent the Taliban is looking for more normal relations with countries around the world, that will not happen in so long as they continue to advance these repressive edicts against women and girls.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Missy, go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, thanks so much for coming to talk to us about the report.\u00a0 What would your response be to those that would say despite the content of the \u2013 contents of the report and despite all of the work that goes into it, that the issues that are flagged don\u2019t \u2013 are not sufficiently influencing policymaking, especially when it comes to countries where it is harder for the United States to have those tough discussions on human rights, like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Israel?\u00a0 What\u2019s your response to that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, we have those tough discussions across the board with friends, adversaries, competitors alike.\u00a0 So that \u2013 and the report itself makes that very clear.\u00a0 But in the day-in, day-out, it\u2019s the same thing.\u00a0 So we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not pulling our punches with anyone as \u2013 we call things as we see them.\u00a0 Sometimes we do it more publicly; sometimes we do it more privately.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to determine in each instance how we hopefully can be most effective in advancing human rights and advancing human dignity.\nSo I think it\u2019s safe to say, without getting into details, that we raise these concerns with everyone \u2013 again, friends, adversaries, competitors.\nAt the same time, as we\u2019re working in different ways with different countries, we have a multiplicity of interests that we\u2019re working on, and we always try to determine how we can most effectively advance them.\u00a0 Human rights is a central interest of ours; it\u2019s not the only one.\u00a0 And my responsibility is to make sure that we\u2019re doing our best to advance all of our interests however we can.\u00a0 But as this report makes clear \u2013 and it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s a very public report and that it applies the same standards to countries around the world, whatever their relationship with us \u2013 I think demonstrates the seriousness with which we take this issue.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave it in the very capable hands of my colleagues.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\n"}, {"url":

Those aggressions violate international law and the United Nations Charter, without which there cannot be an international community.\nThe United States, I would like to say it and recall it, as everybody knows is one of our major partners in terms of cooperation for development as well as in terms of cooperation for security and our security and defense.\u00a0\u00a0We have U.S. interventions in civil cooperation via the USAID efforts, that everybody here knows, as well as multifaceted efforts in priority sectors of our country.\u00a0\u00a0We also have United States action as part of our MCC national compact, which also works in priority sectors such as agriculture, irrigation, rural roads in order to create conditions for growth.\nWe have just signed recently in Washington a regional compact as part of the MCC with B\u00e9nin in order to reduce the cost of the corridor, which is a vital corridor for our country through which transit practically all of our exports and imports.\u00a0\u00a0So this cost reduction, this reduction of these timelines, is the essential goal of this compact that will allow us to have greater competitivity for economy.\nThe overall volume \u2013 of course, we also have military cooperation, which is very important the United States intervene in the training and the generation of the special forces battalion.\u00a0\u00a0The United States is presently equipping these battalions and general equipping of our armed forces, for our army and our air force and intelligence, as you know.\u00a0\u00a0And also this contribution for the United States allows our forces to be more effective and allows our country to be resilient against the aggression it faces.\nAll of these interventions by your country, the total volume today exceeds 1,000 billion CFA francs. It is a lot. This makes your country one of the main partners, both in development and in matters of defense and security. We also want to take this opportunity to thank you. And we know that this important commitment will be even more important in the future, in view of the conclusions of the last U.S.- Africa summit, where commitments were made by your country towards Africa and in line with the Agenda 2063 of the African Union. Therefore aligned with our priorities, once again, and knowing Ambassador Johnnie Carson, whom we have known here, we know very well that these commitments will be kept.\nIn conclusion, we must tell you that we owe a lot to the cooperation between Niger and the United States, to your commitment by our side, that explains the resilience of our country, of this system, of this democratic state in this chaotic environment. We owe it to our partnership, with you, we also owe it to our own commitment and our determination to defend our values and our system, and we also owe it to other partners such as France and other European countries. We want, in conclusion, to demonstrate by our existence, by our resilience, our model, that a stable democratic state is the only lasting response to the terrorist aggression of which our region is the target today. We want to demonstrate this, and the other alternatives -we are convinced- will be a failure compared to the path we have followed. This is the introduction I wanted to give you, in any case welcome to Niger, welcome Mr. Secretary of State. Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0Hello.\u00a0 Greetings.\u00a0\u00a0Assalamu alaikum.\u00a0 It is wonderful for me to be back in Niger.\u00a0 As the minister said, as it happens, I\u2019m the first American Secretary of State to be here in that capacity, but I was here in my previous job as deputy of secretary of state in 2015, and I\u2019m so appreciative of the incredibly warm welcome\u00a0that we\u2019ve had today.\nWe have \u2013 Niger and the United States \u2013 a deep but also growing bond.\u00a0 We have a genuine and responsive partnership that allows us \u2013 and increasingly \u2013 to deliver for our people on our shared priorities.\u00a0 I saw already back in 2015 the strength of that partnership, and I\u2019m honored to return today to see it move forward in very significant ways.\nAs President Bazoum has said, Niger is a young democracy in a challenging part of the world, but it remains true to the democratic values that we share.\u00a0 And Niger has been quick to defend democratic values under threat in neighboring countries.\nNiger\u2019s leaders have distinguished themselves in the face of other pressing challenges, from violent extremism to the climate crisis.\u00a0 In each case, Niger has prioritized inclusion, community engagement, pragmatic solutions.\u00a0 The United States is committed to the close partnership we\u2019ve forged together and to make it even closer.\nWe deeply appreciated the very thoughtful, the deeply experienced views that President Bazoum brought on questions of peace, security, and governance at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last December.\u00a0 And in many ways, that conversation was the starting point for the discussions that we\u2019ve had here today in Niamey.\nToday, I announced nearly $150 million in new humanitarian assistance to help meet needs in West and Central Africa and the Sahel created by regional instability.\u00a0 That assistance will support the provision of shelter, essential healthcare, emergency food, safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene services, and will also support vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers evacuated to Niger.\u00a0 And I have to say, the generosity of Niger \u2013 of its people \u2013 to so many refugees, so many displaced persons, is remarkable.\nWe are also supporting investments in the long-term security of Niger, investments that, you\u2019ve heard the minister refer to, help make Niger\u2019s law enforcement more effective in combating terrorism, strengthening border security, enhancing counternarcotics capacity, stemming trafficking, helping to investigate, prosecute, and ultimately reduce terrorism, violent extremism.\nWe\u2019re committed to continuing to invest in the resilience of democracies to a wide range of threats and challenges, from corruption to disinformation.\u00a0 And we continue to support a free and independent press, as we have done in Niger for decades.\u00a0 In the coming months, we\u2019re going to actually welcome another cohort of Nigerien media professionals to the United States, an opportunity to meet fellow journalists and practitioners, to exchange lessons learned and participate in training and other professional development opportunities.\nWe\u2019re also supporting President Bazoum\u2019s remarkable disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, and reconciliation program.\u00a0 I saw this for myself firsthand earlier today.\u00a0 Over the past couple of decades, what we\u2019ve learned is that to effectively counter violent extremism we have to find ways to pave alternative pathways that give former combatants an opportunity to build a real future for themselves.\u00a0 When I had a chance to meet earlier today with young people who\u2019ve completed this program, I heard about their experiences, their ideas for preventing the spread of violent extremism.\u00a0 And again, I think this program can and should be a model for many others.\nToday, the president, foreign minister, and I also talked about another threat to peace and prosperity, and that is the global food crisis.\u00a0 Now, this has been something that has been long in the making.\u00a0 A combination of climate change, of COVID, of various conflicts has created an almost perfect storm.\nNow over the past year, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine has just added fuel to an already burning fire, driving up food and fertilizer prices for Nigeriens, for many others, putting millions at risk of going hungry.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been supporting immediate interventions to help those facing acute food insecurity.\u00a0 Just since the aggression by Russia against Ukraine a year ago, we\u2019ve contributed an additional $13.5 billion to address food insecurity around the world, but most of that has gone to Africa.\u00a0 We\u2019re by far the largest donor to the World Food Program as well, and other international mechanisms that are helping to deal with food insecurity.\nWe\u2019re also supporting something called the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has brought Ukrainian grain to countries across Africa and lowered the prices worldwide.\u00a0 Now keep in mind, this initiative never should have been necessary in the first place, but one of the results of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was to block Ukrainian ports and prevent Ukraine from exporting grain and other food products to the world, which it\u2019s done for years.\u00a0 Thanks to very good work done by the United Nations, by T\u00fcrkiye, an agreement was reached to create this corridor to allow Ukraine\u2019s grain to reach world markets.\u00a0 Over 4 million metric tons of wheat have gone directly to developing countries as a result of this initiative.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of 8 billion loaves of bread.\u00a0 And so millions of people around the world \u2013 and especially here in Africa \u2013 rely on this initiative to help deal with food insecurity.\u00a0 It\u2019s imperative that it continue and it\u2019s imperative that Russia allow it to continue.\nBeyond emergency aid though \u2013 and this is maybe just as important, if not more important \u2013\u00a0 we are working together to make long-term investments in African food production capacity and resilience, because ultimately the goal that we all share is for African countries to be able to produce on their own the food that their people need, and for that matter be able to export it not just in the region that they happen to be in on the continent, but even to other places in the world.\nOne way that we\u2019re doing that here in Niger is through the Millennium Challenge Corporation\u2019s compacts that you\u2019ve heard the minister discuss.\u00a0 They simultaneously address a couple of the really big constraints to economic growth: lack of access to water and institutional barriers to trade.\nOne of the compacts for $442 million is strengthening irrigation infrastructure, climate-resilient production, and market access for agricultural products.\u00a0 And it\u2019s having a major impact in a country where four out of five people are employed in the agriculture sector.\nBy the end of April, we will have established 300 kilometers of roads, built vast irrigation networks, improved more than 1,000 kilometers of livestock corridors, provided literacy training to more than 5,000 people.\u00a0 In 2021, just a couple of years ago, a project that was funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation using satellite technology discovered five aquifers containing over 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.\u00a0 That has the potential to benefit millions of people here in Niger.\nWe\u2019re also supporting Niger\u2019s regional integration and its broader economic development.\u00a0 At the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last year, I joined President Bazoum and the president of Benin, President Talon, in signing another MCC compact that will bring the two countries together to have a regional transportation program that will facilitate trade between the two of them and facilitate the export beyond those countries of food products.\u00a0 It will make it faster and safer to transport and export goods from Niger along rehabilitated roads and across borders. Ultimately, it will connect Niger to bigger markets and even greater opportunities.\nIn all of our meetings, President Bazoum raised the importance of education, because he knows that the single most important contributor to the future of any country is its human resources and giving them the ability to reach their full potential.\u00a0 And that starts with education.\nUnder President Bazoum, Niger has prioritized building and improving girls\u2019 schools to ensure that they can get a good education and acquire the skills they need to participate fully in the economy.\u00a0 USAID is assisting this mission, including with programs to increase girls\u2019 primary school enrollment, provide career training opportunities, deliver distance education for girls who can\u2019t go to school because they live in a high insecurity area.\u00a0 We\u2019re a major contributor, the United States, to the Global Partnership for Education, which has identified Niger as a priority country and is providing nearly $200 million to strengthen the formal education system here.\nThere are so many other ways in which we are working together to deepen this partnership.\u00a0 And we began a discussion, a long discussion with our \u2013 between our teams.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to continue it shortly over dinner, because there\u2019s so much to talk about.\u00a0 But in all of this, I come back to the fact that Niger is really an extraordinary model at a time of great challenge \u2013 a model of resilience, a model of democracy, a model of cooperation.\u00a0 It\u2019s one that we deeply value and deeply respect.\nMODERATOR: \u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to the Secretary of State for those introductory words. We will now give the floor to the representatives of the media. We have a list, and it is not very long, I assure you. First we have Mr. Michael Crowley, New York Times. Go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Minister.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, we\u2019ve seen growing activity in the region by the Russian Wagner Group as countries turn to Russia to address their security concerns, given that the U.S. and also French efforts in recent years have not succeeded in quelling terrorist and extremist threats to these countries.\u00a0 I understand that you believe that working with the Wagner Group is bound to end badly for these countries, but I just wonder if you can talk about what specifically the U.S. and its allies can offer these countries that Russia cannot.\nAnd Mr. Minister, related to that, why do you think so many countries in this region have been turning to the Wagner Group for assistance?\u00a0 And what lessons do you draw from their experiences so far?\nIf I may just add a brief question for you, Mr. Secretary, on Ukraine.\u00a0 Poland\u2019s government said today that Poland will be sending fighter jets to Ukraine.\u00a0 Can we have your reaction to that, please?\u00a0 And does that change at all the Biden administration\u2019s thinking about potentially providing fighter jets of our own?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Michael.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 And actually, I\u2019ll just take the last question first, and then go to the broader question.\nWith regard to the decision by Poland to provide jets to Ukraine \u2013 look, these are sovereign decisions for countries to make, what they will provide to Ukraine to help it defend itself against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 And we, of course, are working closely with dozens of countries on these questions, but different countries are doing different things in response to what they have and what the perceived needs are.\u00a0 Our focus has been on doing everything we can to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, what it can use, and what it particularly needs in this moment, dealing both with the offensive that we\u2019re seeing from Russia across the eastern front, but also in preparation for its own actions in the weeks and months to come as it seeks to take back more of the territory that Russia has seized from it.\nSo we\u2019ve done this throughout in close consultation with the Ukrainians and with our partners.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said many times before, I think it\u2019s a mistake to get focused on any particular weapon system at any given time.\u00a0 We know that there are basic things that Ukraine needs, whether it\u2019s air defenses, whether it\u2019s artillery, whether it\u2019s ammunition, whether it\u2019s armored vehicles and the like.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, as you know, led a very, very successful process in bringing together dozens of countries to help find and coordinate that assistance.\u00a0 And at the same time, as I\u2019ve, again, said before, what\u2019s very important to us and our focus is not only making sure that the Ukrainians have the right weapon system, but again, they can use it \u2013 so depending on the system, that might require significant training \u2013 that they have the ability to maintain it \u2013 again, depending on the system, that can be more or less complicated \u2013 and that it fits into a comprehensive plan.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying that\u2019s been our approach all along, it remains our approach, and individual partner countries will, again, make their own decisions about what they can provide, when they can provide it, and how they provide it.\nWhen it comes to Wagner and the security question more broadly, first, what is I think the most effective way \u2013 and this is something where, again, Niger has really been in the lead \u2013 we know that dealing with insecurity, yes, requires taking steps on the security side of the equation, military side of the equation.\u00a0 That\u2019s necessary, but it\u2019s not sufficient.\u00a0 And the focus that we\u2019re bringing to bear, that Niger is bringing to bear, that other countries are bringing to bear that care about insecurity here because of the potential that it has to spread even well beyond the region and beyond the continent, is a comprehensive approach \u2013 one that\u2019s focused not just on the security steps that we\u2019re taking, but on good governance, on development, on creating opportunity, on being responsive to the needs of the people.\u00a0 And I think that is exactly the difference-maker \u2013 not at all what Wagner or any other groups of its like have to offer.\nAnd I think what we\u2019ve seen already, it\u2019s not just we know this is going to end badly; we\u2019ve already seen it end badly in a number of places.\u00a0 Where Wagner has been present, bad things have inevitably followed.\u00a0 The \u2013 it has not proven to be an effective response to insecurity, and at the same time we\u2019ve seen countries that find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, less independent as a result of an association with Wagner.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also seen Wagner engage in the exploitation of a country\u2019s resources, bring corruption with it, bring violence with it \u2013 overall worsening security, not improving it \u2013 and engaging in human rights abuses at the same time.\nSo this is not a recipe for success that I think anyone should be looking to.\u00a0 But yes, it is incumbent upon us to demonstrate through this much more comprehensive approach that we\u2019re taking to insecurity that we can actually deliver results.\u00a0 That was a big part of our conversation with President Bazoum earlier today, which, again, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue over dinner.\u00a0 But I think you\u2019re going to see very, very concrete results.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is this:\u00a0 I mentioned the disarmament and demobilization and reintegration program here.\u00a0 That, too, should be a model that\u2019s integrated in what we\u2019re doing regionally, because you can see the results.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU: \u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Well thank you, so I would like to complete the response of the Secretary of State. For us, the principle is that this war is up to us to wage, it is not up to our partners to wage war in our place. This is the misunderstanding among some. Therefore, it\u2019s up to our countries, it\u2019s up to us to fight, the goal is that our partners should only complement our efforts. That\u2019s our doctrine, that\u2019s what the doctrine should be, that\u2019s the misunderstanding that there was.\nIt\u2019s that others, the reactions that we sometimes see today on social media, is that it is said that our partners have failed in certain countries, to defeat the enemy \u2013 but that is a misunderstanding. The war is ours to fight. Therefore, we never had the illusion in our country of believing or of making the population believe that this war must be waged and carried out by our partners, in our place. That\u2019s the first principle.\nThe second principle is that, as the Secretary of State was saying earlier, we had a discussion about it, that this war is not being waged only with weapons. We do it holistically. We must first have resolved, or resolve at the same time, the problems of governance, the problems of national cohesion which have not been resolved elsewhere. Terrorists take advantage of flaws in terms of cohesion, social cohesion, national cohesion, that\u2019s why we have the tools to carry out this permanent negotiation between the communities, to effectively prevent a collapse at that level, to prevent an inter-community confrontation, and reduce it to the bare minimum. So this political fight we are carrying out at the same time as the war, it is a part of the war. It is one of the aspects of this war.\nThirdly, it goes without saying that we must not give up development while we are at war. This is why we say that the stabilization and recovery actions that we carry out in these areas affected by the war are also part of the conditions for success. So those are the three elements, as we see them, that condition success or failure.\nAs far as Wagner itself is concerned, with ECOWAS, the first press release we issued after the first rumors of Wagner settling in our sub-region, was to condemn that. It\u2019s been a long time since the West African space has known this, since \u201cExecutive Outcomes\u201d in Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was a South African mercenary company at the time, and obviously we consider that these kinds of elements, this type of heterogeneous force, mercenaries, we cannot accept in our AU space. There is an ECOWAS communiqu\u00e9 in this regard\nAnd what is the outcome today? It is that we find that Wagner is only present in failed or soon to be failed states. Let\u2019s take examples, I won\u2019t cite any, just look around you. Second, the outcome is more than catastrophic. I don\u2019t think there has been any progress in the successes of those countries, where Wagner is present. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a challenge for us. We are now fighting to demonstrate first that our vision, the way we wage this war is the right one, secondly that our democratic institutions can defeat terrorism. In fact, that there are no other alternatives, quite simply, in this fight to defeat terrorism, other than this model for a state. So here are some of the issues which we face, and I believe that the immediate future will prove us right. This is the answer I can give to your question. Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Thank you Minister of State.\u00a0\u00a0Moussa Kama, RFI.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Good evening Your Excellency, my question goes to the two ministers please. An answer in French would really please us, Mr. Secretary of State of the United States. My first question is on security. You have done a lot for Niger, the Nigerien army recognizes this; when will the United States be ready to finance military operations on our borders against the jihadists? My second question is on foreign policy. What will the United States do to bring democracy to our neighbors in Burkina Faso and Mali\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0What are you ready to do? Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0First of all, we have, and the Minister mentioned it, a partnership on security issues which requires significant funding insofar as together we train our colleagues in Niger, we bring important equipment precisely so that they can carry out the necessary operations, we coordinate all of that with others, and all that is a financial contribution because\u2026 all of it costs money. So there is genuine support that has lasted for years and we are strengthening it.\nBut I insist on the point that the minister brought up so well, that while doing this, this holistic approach is for us, for both our countries, the key to success. And there too, there is a very, very significant investment as mentioned for example, the Millennium Challenge Corporation projects. The Minister mentioned the total of our investments in these projects which are also very important to prevent people from falling into extremism and terrorism, and those amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.\nWe are talking with President Bazoum and the minister about the issues, the challenges that we see in the region, including the democratic backsliding, the military coups, which so far have not led to a renewal of a democratic constitutional process in these countries. We discuss it together, and I won\u2019t say more this evening, but I think that we must indeed all be very clear about the need of neighboring countries to restore their constitutional and democratic course.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0 I\u00a0think that what the Secretary of State said is enough, and earlier I told you about the volume of funding through USAID, through the MCC and through equipment, the training of our armed forces, through the intelligence they give us. For all of this I gave a figure, I said no less than 1000 billion CFA francs. I think that\u2026and in addition there are other types of interventions in the multilateral framework which we cannot evaluate here but which are enormous. We have seen for example the commitments of the World Bank. Today in Niger we are the second country after Nigeria in Africa, today, when it comes to World Bank commitments. All of this is a form of support from our partners also through this unprecedented multilateral effort, which was unimaginable a few years ago.\nTherefore, it\u2019s not limited to direct investment in terms of financing our operations, I think we\u2019re waging war, it\u2019s up to us to do so, I want to stress this, and that\u2019s important. The support of our partners, we need it on the strict military level as well as on the civil level \u2013 but not that they fight the war instead of us. This is extremely important. So if there is a misunderstanding in this respect we are not going to get out of it. So I think, and we welcome this commitment by the United States at our side and we think that this model, the bet we have made on democracy, on the stability of democratic institutions, to defeat terrorism, this bet will pay off. We are going to win this bet against the authoritarian model and the criminal model, the criminal groups, that we see elsewhere, it is not a model for us. It is a failure from the point of view of the fight against terrorism, in terms of security sensu stricto, and it is also a failure in terms of development prospects quite simply. Because, today, I don\u2019t think those behind Wagner have any other proposals in terms of development aid, in terms of civil aid, they don\u2019t have any other proposals than that. So here it is, time will tell who is right. We are certain that we are right. This is the answer I can give you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Thank you\u00a0 Minister of State. The penultimate question, William Mauldin from the Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 I wanted to follow up first of all on the RFE question, Mr. Foreign Minister, specifically about Burkina Faso, if you could help some of those \u2013 some of us who aren\u2019t from the region understand what\u2019s going on there in terms of that country and the Wagner Group.\u00a0 And do you think the U.S. should remain active in Burkina Faso despite the military coups?\u00a0 Maybe Mr. Secretary wants to answer that too.\nBut specifically for you, Secretary Blinken, I wanted to ask a little bit if you could \u2013 I mean, you were here, if I understand, as deputy secretary of state before.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sure there were efforts for humanitarian aid and other types of assistance back then in the economic and humanitarian space.\u00a0 What types of programs are working, or paint us a picture?\u00a0 Some of the programs you mentioned today with the Millennium Corporation, how, specifically, do you see that helping this country avoiding \u2013 falling into some of the pitfalls of extremism, hunger, and migrant crises that we\u2019ve seen before?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0As far as Burkina Faso is concerned, I simply note that there have been two successive coups. With ECOWAS we have a mediator who has an agreement at the moment with the military authorities for a way back to a normal constitutional life, for elections, within 24 months. So for the moment we are within the framework of this plan.\nSecondly, we note that the security situation has further deteriorated and we are very concerned about this continued deterioration of the security situation. As for the presence of Wagner in Burkina, we are not yet\u2026 we think, the information that we have does not allow us to say that Wagner is still in Burkina Faso. Our wish is that this country maintains the trajectory with ECOWAS. Secondly, that it does not continue this trajectory towards this organization which we qualify as criminal, mercenary, which ECOWAS has already condemned. We don\u2019t want this trajectory, in which they seem to be going, to come to a conclusion. We believe that, we want them to pull themselves together to reintegrate into the community and that we can, with them, move towards the end of the transition process and cooperate, fight together, against terrorism. This is our view but obviously it does not depend only on us. It depends on them too. But this is our wish.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, just to come back to something I said \u2013 and forgive me for repeating myself, but it does go directly to your question, and I think it\u2019s important.\u00a0 So we have these big projects, including Millennium Challenge Corporation projects that people hear about, and we talk about the very large sums of money that are involved in these projects.\u00a0 But what I\u2019ve seen, and the difference that I\u2019ve seen between when I was last here in 2015 and now, is the concrete results that this \u2013 these projects that we\u2019re doing together are actually delivering and concrete results that are having a direct impact on improving people\u2019s lives, creating opportunity, and creating a strong future.\nI mentioned this just a few minutes ago in my opening statement: by the end of April, we will have rehabilitated through the Millennium Challenge Corporation projects and other things that we\u2019re doing 300 kilometers of Nigerien roads.\u00a0 We will have built a vast irrigation network, which for, again, a country that is 70 or 80 percent in the agricultural sector, may be the most important foundational thing.\u00a0 We will have improved more than 1,000 kilometers of livestock corridors, just to cite a few things.\u00a0 But what does that translate into?\u00a0 It translates into people having much greater opportunity to actually cultivate the land that they enjoy, to bring their products to market in ways that they couldn\u2019t before, and as a \u2013 in the same time, create many new jobs.\nBeyond that, through AID and other partners, we\u2019re doing things like providing literacy training to thousands of people.\u00a0 That, again, enables them to participate much more effectively in the economy.\u00a0 I mentioned, too, this remarkable discovery \u2013 again, an MCC-funded project \u2013 of the five aquifers: 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.\u00a0 The impact that that\u2019s going to have as that water is actually brought to use on the agricultural system here on productivity and on sustainability I think will be dramatic.\u00a0 And again, that translates into livelihoods for people.\u00a0 It translates into opportunity.\u00a0 It translates for everyone into lower food prices, reducing food insecurity, and that\u2019s (inaudible).\u00a0 The bottom line is this:\u00a0 Through everything that we\u2019re doing as partners here, it\u2019s less about the program, whatever it\u2019s called; the amount of money, as great as it is.\u00a0 It\u2019s about the fact that it is actually producing concrete results, concrete opportunities, concrete development which is foundational to Niger\u2019s strength and resilience as a democracy.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0The last question is for\u00a0Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Niger, Madam Nadia Maman.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via\u00a0Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Good evening, my question is for Mr. Blinken. At present, given the evolution of the war in Ukraine, and the impact of this war on the world, does the United States intend to keep going as is or play the card of diplomacy?\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So with regard to Ukraine and to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, let me just say a couple of things.\u00a0 First of all, no one wanted this war.\u00a0 No one wanted this aggression.\u00a0 Maybe the only person who wanted it was Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 We worked very hard when we saw the storm clouds rising.\u00a0 We had information about what the Russians were planning to do.\u00a0 We tried to prevent it with diplomacy.\u00a0 And I spent months, as did my colleagues, engaging with Russia to see if we could head off its aggression.\nI think what we learned in the process is that the reason for this aggression is because Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine shouldn\u2019t exist as an independent country.\u00a0 In his mind, it\u2019s part of Russia, and so he tried to seize it back.\u00a0 I know that there are dozens of countries in Africa in particular who, having been on the receiving end of imperialism, can appreciate why it was so important to stand against it and to make sure that a country, a big country like Russia, couldn\u2019t simply try to erase another country by force \u2013 change its borders, eliminate its independence.\nThe minister said it very eloquently at the very start of this press conference.\u00a0 This is bigger than Ukraine.\u00a0 It really is about the principles that are at the heart of the international system that, after two world wars, countries came together and said we need, if we\u2019re not going to have another world war, territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty.\u00a0 And if we allow those principles to be violated anywhere, they\u2019re in danger everywhere, because the message to a would-be aggressor \u2013 if Russia can get away with what it did, what it\u2019s doing in Ukraine, the message to another would-be aggressor, maybe in Africa, maybe in the Middle East, maybe somewhere else is if they can get away with it, so can I.\u00a0 And that leads to a world of conflict.\u00a0 It leads to a world of violence.\u00a0 It leads to a world where countries that have imperial designs on others will carry the day.\nSo that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so important, I think, why so many countries around the world have stood against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 Just a few weeks ago, 143 countries at the United Nations \u2013 three-quarters of the countries in the world \u2013 stood up and voted in opposition to Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 At the same time, as we\u2019ve already talked about, we\u2019ve seen the terrible consequences that this aggression has had not just for people in Ukraine, but for people around the world because of the impact it\u2019s had, for example, on food insecurity.\u00a0 And we talked about this earlier.\u00a0 Ukraine was one of the biggest exporters of wheat and grain to the world, including to Africa.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s invasion stopped that and was blocking Ukraine from exporting its wheat and grain, including to Africa.\u00a0 Fortunately, we were able to get an agreement to allow Ukrainian grain and wheat to get out of Ukraine.\u00a0 And when I was in Ethiopia just yesterday, I saw the large bags of wheat and grain from Ukraine in Ethiopia.\nNow, the people who, more than anyone else, want this war to be over as soon as possible, are the Ukrainian people who are on the receiving end every day of bombs, of violence, of destruction.\u00a0 And like many other countries around the world, we would like to see the same thing, but there has to be a just and durable peace \u2013 just in the sense that it reflects the principles of the United Nations Charter, because if it\u2019s a peace that allows Russia to keep all the territory it seized by force, that\u2019s not justice; and durable in the sense that no one wants to see Russia repeat this a year or two or three years later.\nSo with those principles in mind, every day we are looking for ways to see if we can bring the war to an end.\u00a0 I see no evidence that right now Russia is interested in a diplomatic resolution, a negotiation that would end this war.\u00a0 And so the quickest way to end it is to continue to support Ukraine so that it is strong on the battlefield \u2013 and the battlefield is its own country \u2013 so that hopefully, at some point, Mr. Putin recognizes the reality that this has to stop, that he\u2019s not going to succeed, and he\u2019s prepared for diplomacy and for negotiation.\u00a0 When that day comes, we\u2019ll be the first to engage to try to end things.\u00a0 But as I said, in this moment, at least, I don\u2019t see any evidence of that.\nMODERATOR: \u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0We are at the end of this exercise, so your Excellencies, Mr. Minister of State, Mr. Secretary of State, thank you for answering questions from journalists.\u00a0Thank you so much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-at-a-disarmament-demobilization-reintegration-and-reconciliation-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "U.S. Logistics Center Warehouse", "location": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia", "date": "March 15, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had an enduring partnership when it comes to humanitarian assistance with Ethiopia, going back decades.\u00a0 And it\u2019s enduring because we\u2019ve had periods of famine, conflict, displacement, and yet throughout we have found ways, working with extraordinary partners like World Vision, like Catholic Relief Services, to make sure we were working with our partners to provide assistance.\nJust in the last couple of years, even with the conflict in Tigray in Ethiopia, we have provided about $3 billion worth of humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 And it\u2019s been very important to us that we do everything we can to make sure the people who are caught up in any of these human tragedies get the assistance that they need.\u00a0 And indeed, today I can share that we\u2019re going to be providing an addition $331 million in assistance through this joint emergency operations program to try to reach more people in Ethiopia who are in need of food security, and we think we\u2019ll reach another 13 million or so people being affected by drought in particular.\nBesides being enduring, what\u2019s so important is that it\u2019s intended for everyone in Ethiopia \u2013 not any particular group, region.\u00a0 We\u2019re active through our partners with the government in nine of the 11 regions in Ethiopia, trying to make sure that whoever\u2019s in need is getting assistance.\nAnd finally, as you\u2019ve seen a little bit of today, of course it starts with food, the most basic necessity, but it\u2019s broader than that.\u00a0 It includes everything from hygiene kits to sanitation to medicine to water.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to continue to do that day-in, day-out.\nBut a few other things that are so important.\u00a0 One is, as I said, we can\u2019t do this without a strong partnership with the government; we can\u2019t do it without strong partnerships with, as I said, remarkable implementing partners like Catholic Relief Services, like World Vision.\u00a0 And I\u2019m especially proud of the work that USAID \u2013 the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2013 is doing in country after country, including here in Ethiopia.\u00a0 As I like to say, USAID is where the rubber meets the road, where we\u2019re making a tangible difference in people\u2019s lives.\nAs a result of the cessation of hostilities agreement in Tigray, we now have humanitarian assistance flowing in very important ways.\u00a0 And that\u2019s reaching people who were not being reached before, and making a big difference.\nFinally, one footnote.\u00a0 You noticed that some of the food products here are from the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 And I would simply note that that just underscores the importance of making sure that the arrangements that have been put into place \u2013 necessitated, unfortunately, by the Russian aggression against Ukraine \u2013 the Black Sea corridor, making sure that grain could get out of Ukraine and able to reach faraway places in the world, that that continues.\u00a0 It\u2019s vital that that continues, it\u2019s vital that as it comes up for renewal that it be renewed.\u00a0 And we can see the impact if that doesn\u2019t happen, because it literally means that what you\u2019re seeing right here won\u2019t get here, won\u2019t get to many other places.\u00a0 It\u2019ll also have an impact on prices for people around the world.\nBut the most important thing is day-in, day-out, we\u2019re committed to this partnership with Ethiopia, doing our part in making sure that people have what they need.\u00a0 I\u2019m also very proud that the United States is the largest contributor by far to the World Food Program.\u00a0 Grateful for the work that WFP does every day.\u00a0 We provide about 50 percent of the World Food Program\u2019s budget.\nThe very last thing is this:\u00a0 As vital, as necessary, as urgent as this assistance is, we\u2019re equally committed to working closely with our partners in Ethiopia to help them develop and strengthen their own productive capacity.\u00a0 That ultimately is the most important thing that we can do.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m convinced, we\u2019re convinced, that in Ethiopia and many other partner countries in Africa, it\u2019s that long-term productive capacity that can be resilient to things like droughts, like climate change, like disease, that can take advantage of the extraordinary natural resources and expertise that already resides in these countries, that that is fundamentally the most important answer, so that we don\u2019t have to deal on an emergency basis with a lack of food or the impact of some kind of crisis.\nSo as we\u2019re working in this partnership to provide emergency support, we\u2019re equally focused on making sure that we\u2019re working together to provide the kinds of investments that will allow Ethiopia to fully realize the potential of its own productive capacity.\nMr. Minister.\nFINANCE MINISTER SHIDE:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Your Excellency Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Your Excellency Ambassador Tracey Jacobson, Mr. Sean Jones, USAID mission director for Ethiopia, dignitaries from Ethiopian Government (inaudible), on behalf of the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, it is an honor for me to warmly welcome Secretary Blinken and his team to Ethiopia.\u00a0 We are delighted to have the opportunity to further consult on our bilateral missions and particularly the economic cooperation between our two countries.\nToday there has been extensive discussion between the prime minister and with you, and a consensus has been reached to further enhance our strategic partnerships.\nAs you are well aware, the diplomatic relationship between Ethiopia and the U.S. dates back to over a century, and over the past several decades we have made considerable progress in elevating that partnership, which has become more strategic and vital for the goals and development of Ethiopia, and more broadly for the Horn of Africa, and particularly Ethiopia and United States partnerships is very strategic and important for our two-way mutually beneficial relationship, and also for the regional stability.\nThe United States is Ethiopia\u2019s largest humanitarian and development donor.\u00a0 I fully agree what you have said.\u00a0 Ethiopia has been receiving U.S. support in wide-ranging areas such as agriculture, trade, investment, climate and food security and health to state a few, Your Excellency.\nToday on the occasion of the launch of this USAID\u2019s new five-year Joint Emergency Operation Program, in the presence of Your Excellency, we\u2019d like to share our deep gratitude to the United States Government and the American people for their continued commitment in supporting our country\u2019s address urgent humanitarian challenges which have affected the most vulnerable.\u00a0 I acknowledge and sincerely appreciate that in 2022 alone, the U.S. provided more than 1.7 billion to respond to humanitarian needs driven by the crisis in northern Ethiopia and the civil drought in pastural areas in southern and southeast Ethiopia.\u00a0 Recently we have also received an additional 271 million to scale up the humanitarian assistance to drought and the country\u2019s affected communities.\nI fully welcome your initiative today to support it further.\u00a0 Excellency, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly highlight our recent achievement and key challenges.\u00a0 As most of you know very well, the last two years have been a challenging period for our country due to internal as well as global factors.\u00a0 Ethiopia, like the rest of the Horn of Africa, is confronted by multiple challenges.\u00a0 Our rains have failed for the five consecutive seasons in pastoral areas \u2013 the current drought being the most extreme in 40 years.\nMoreover, first, we had the problem with desert locusts, then COVID, and now the global food shortage has affected the lives \u2013 livelihoods and the economy.\u00a0 There are presently over 20 million people in need of humanitarian assistance while the conflict reconstruction needs are significant.\u00a0 This is on top of sustaining and deepening our economic reform agenda.\u00a0 This \u2013 all of the challenging environment has been exacerbated by the significant drop in external development assistance.\u00a0 With your visit, we do fully believe that the development potential will be fully unlocked.\nAs Ethiopia emerges from the divisive conflict of the last two years, we are getting up efforts for recovery and for communities and the economy from (inaudible) effect of the conflict and other successive shocks.\u00a0 The signing of the peace agreement on November 2, 2022 paved the way for a critical and inclusive recovery as well as for strengthening social cooperation among all Ethiopians.\u00a0 Since its signing, we have expedited the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict and the fully implemented restoration of basic services, utilities, banking, and other essential government services.\u00a0 We have progressed well on the resettlement and demobilization of ex-combatants and have established the National Rehabilitation Commission to implement the integration program for the nearly 250,000 ex-combatants.\u00a0 Here, I want to stress the criticality of timely reintegration of ex-combatants, which in turn we contribute to the peace consolidation.\u00a0 We are also working on establishing of the interim regional government in Tigray until elections have been held.\nWe have begun implementing immediate recovery interventions primarily using our own resources and by support of the World Bank.\u00a0 But we cannot do this alone as the financing need for the post-conflict reconstruction is substantial.\u00a0 Conservatively estimated close to $20 billion is needed over the coming five years.\u00a0 We need the support of our partners to meet this significant need to ensure that (inaudible) any development (inaudible) are passed, decades are not reversed, and the well-being of our cooperation is important.\nLet me underscore Ethiopia\u2019s determination to address underlying causes and drivers of fragilities through an inclusive national dialogue for which is essential to adequately address the grievances and the aspirations in our society and attain sustainable peace and democracy.\u00a0 The recently established National Dialogue Commission is working towards that objective.\u00a0 Mechanisms for transitional justice are also being set up to ensure justice and accountability to end perpetual acts of violence and advert impunity.\nWith regard to our reform agenda, Ethiopia remains committed to pursuing transformative economy reform to correct prevailing macro-economic imbalances, to remove obstacles to private sector development, and enhance productivity and job creation.\u00a0 Despite the headwinds of historic proportions, we preserve it with implementation of our key reforms, including financial market revitalization, telecom sector revitalization, subsidy for enhancing agricultural productivity, and debt management.\u00a0 We know that much more needs to be done, and we are ready to take bold actions on the most transformative reforms.\nWe are also working to address greening our economy.\u00a0 We are applying various strategies, including expanding renewable energy generation through diverse sources, as well as green legacy initiatives led by the prime minister, to cite a few examples.\u00a0 And we are already producing a lot of food in the country which is going to be vital for the future and currently.\nExcellency, wide humanitarian assistance is essential to save lives and address the short-term needs.\u00a0 Broader and long-term development, as you have mentioned, focuses critical for building our resilience and advancing our development aspirations and fostering inclusive and sustainable growth, and overall tackling the root cause of Ethiopia\u2019s vulnerabilities.\u00a0 Those conditions are key to sustain and consolidate development gains of recent years and to sustain peace and stability in the country.\nAs I conclude my remarks, let me reiterate my appreciation to the U.S. Government for their commitment to support Ethiopia during this challenging time, and I look forward to discussing and exchanging views on resuming and strengthening our longstanding partnership in trade, investment, full-fledge development assistance, and the cooperation (inaudible) shared goals, understanding, and mutual interest.\u00a0 U.S. Secretary, we count on U.S. to leverage broader support to Ethiopia from all our bilateral (inaudible) development partners as we forge ahead with recovery, development, and sustaining and deepening our reform agenda.\u00a0 I thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone.\n"}, {"url":

Blinken at a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Addis Ababa University", "location": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia", "date": "March 15, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good evening, everyone.\u00a0 It is great to be back in Africa, but also to make my first appearance to Ethiopia as Secretary of State.\nI\u2019m here in Ethiopia \u2013 and then on to Niger \u2013 to reaffirm the pledge that President Biden made at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit late last year.\u00a0 As he put it, the United States is \u201call in on Africa, and all in with Africa.\u201d\u00a0 That means the United States is committed to deep, responsive, and genuine partnerships on the continent, because we believe we can only solve shared challenges \u2013 and deliver on the fundamental aspirations of our people \u2013 if we work together.\nOne way we\u2019re doing that is making good on the commitment that we\u2019ve made to help partners in Africa deal with the huge challenge of food insecurity.\u00a0 Last year, 140 million people in Africa suffered from acute food insecurity \u2013 a crisis exacerbated by COVID-19, by climate change, by conflict.\u00a0 This led to shortfalls in commodities, fertilizer, and fuel, all of which spiked prices and created supply chain disruptions.\u00a0 To meet that challenge, the United States has invested $13.5 billion last year to reduce acute and chronic hunger worldwide, largely in Africa.\nAt the same time, together with African countries, we\u2019re supporting immediate interventions like the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has brought Ukrainian grain to countries across Africa as well as lowering prices around the world.\nOver 4 million metric tons of wheat have gone directly to developing countries as a result of that initiative \u2013 that is the equivalent of 8 billion loaves of bread.\u00a0 Millions rely on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 It cannot be allowed to lapse.\nBut we\u2019ve also heard loudly and clearly from African partners that emergency aid cannot be the only solution.\u00a0 So we\u2019re investing in sustainable, long-term African food production \u2013 working with our African partners on innovative solutions that will ensure that Africa not only meets needs on the continent but can become a supplier for the rest of the world.\nToday, American and African scientists are collaborating to devise climate-resilient, nutritious crops.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on international efforts to significantly increase yields in Africa, including by mapping and improving the quality of topsoil.\u00a0 We\u2019re employing satellite photography technology to discover new water resources \u2013 as we recently did in Niger, where five new aquifers have been found, containing over 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.\u00a0 And we\u2019re harnessing public sector financing tools to unlock private sector investment that will expand infrastructure, agribusiness, and trade.\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to meet with AU Chairman Faki to discuss the partnership between the United States and the African Union.\u00a0 We\u2019ll talk about how the United States can help the AU realize its Agenda 2063 to build an integrated, prosperous, and peaceful Africa.\u00a0 And how the United States can best support the AU\u2019s regional economic integration goals as the African Continental Free Trade Area gets up and running.\u00a0 And this is something that\u2019s going to make a huge difference as African economies become increasingly integrated, that will increase trade and investment among them, but it will also attract even more investment and trade outside of Africa.\u00a0 We have had to date in Africa the abnormal situation where African countries are doing more trade and investment with countries outside of the continent than they do among themselves.\u00a0 When the free trade area gets up and running, that will change and I think it will be a very powerful tool for economic growth.\u00a0 I\u2019ll also convey our continued support for African representation in multilateral institutions, to include the United Nations Security Council and the G20.\nAfrican-led solutions are increasingly making the difference on the challenges of the 21st century.\u00a0 One of the most powerful testaments to the importance of African leadership has been the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement to end the conflict and suffering in northern Ethiopia.\nThe conflict was absolutely devastating.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands killed.\u00a0 Widespread sexual violence against women.\u00a0 Millions forced to flee their homes.\u00a0 Many left in need of food and shelter, medicine.\u00a0 Hospitals, schools, and businesses were shelled and destroyed.\nThe Cessation of Hostilities Agreement is a major achievement and step forward, saving lives and changing lives.\u00a0 The guns are silent.\nAs the fighting has stopped, human rights violations declined.\u00a0 Humanitarian assistance is flowing, finally reaching nearly all communities in need, services are being restored in the Tigray Region, the TPLF is disarming, Eritrean and other non-federal forces are departing.\u00a0 The dedicated diplomacy of the mediators from the African Union, from Kenya, from South Africa, supported by the United States, was essential to securing this agreement.\u00a0 And the AU monitoring mechanism is a key to its full implementation.\nPrime Minister Abiy and the Ethiopian federal government and Tigrayan regional leaders should be commended for reaching this agreement and the significant progress in delivering on their commitments.\u00a0 These efforts have created the foundation to rebuild the communities that have suffered so in Tigray, Amhara, and the Afar regions.\u00a0 They need the help and support.\nI strongly urged the inclusion as well of women in decision-making roles as the agreement is implemented \u2013 especially in light of gender-based violence that was perpetrated during the conflict.\nToday, I first met with Prime Minister Abiy, and then with the signatories to the agreement \u2013 the heads of delegation of the Government of Ethiopia and the TPLF \u2013 to underscore our support for peace as well as the dividends it can yield.\u00a0 And those dividends are important.\u00a0 People need to see that peace brings concrete dividends in their lives.\u00a0 That starts, of course, with the cessation of violence, but we want to build positive things on top of that.\nWe welcome the commitments that the parties have made to acknowledging the atrocities committed and their devastating consequences.\u00a0 For our part, the United States acknowledges the human rights violations and repression committed during the past three decades \u2013 actions which sowed the seeds of future conflict.\u00a0 We and others were insufficiently vocal about those abuses in the past.\nRecognizing the atrocities committed by all parties is an essential step to achieving a sustainable peace.\u00a0 We urge Ethiopians to follow through on their commitments to each other to implement an inclusive and comprehensive transitional justice process that includes both reconciliation and accountability.\u00a0 Overcoming poisonous grievances and ethnic divisions is the only way to break the cycle of political and ethnic violence in the north, in Oromia, or anywhere else.\u00a0 As a partner in that effort, the United States is providing both technical and financial support.\nBuilding lasting peace is being made more complicated by the acute economic challenges that Ethiopia faces resulting from the conflict, resulting from drought, resulting from food insecurity.\nAs I conveyed to Prime Minister Abiy, the United States \u2013 as Ethiopia\u2019s largest bilateral donor, providing over $3 billion in humanitarian assistance since 2020 \u2013 we will continue to be there for Ethiopians.\nWe\u2019ll keep partnering on food security.\u00a0 Today I announced an additional $331 million in emergency food and humanitarian assistance that will reach millions of people, millions of Ethiopians affected by conflict, affected by drought.\nWe\u2019ll keep working together on public health, building on our many years of partnership to combat HIV/AIDS, and continue to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that we\u2019re all prepared for future pandemics.\nWe\u2019ll continue to support Ethiopia\u2019s economic development, investing hundreds of millions in health, economic growth, education, democracy, and food security every year.\nAnd we\u2019ll continue to support migrants and refugees, and victims of human rights abuse.\nIn all (inaudible), our mission is to build a strong partnership between the United States and Ethiopia that ensures we can meet the aspirations of (inaudible).\nSo I look forward to an important week of engagement with our partners on the continent, including the engagements that we had today, building on a stretch of high-level visits from the administration since the Africa Leaders Summit: Treasury Secretary Yellen, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, First Lady Dr. Biden, and soon Vice President Harris, as she visits Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia later this month.\nSo with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Daphne Psaledakis with Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 There\u2019s been reports of continued atrocities since the November ceasefire.\u00a0 Eritrean troops still remain in border areas, and Fano Amhara militia still remain in western Tigray.\u00a0 Are you concerned that (inaudible)?\u00a0 It\u2019s not working.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I got you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Are you concerned that reported continued rapes and the presence of these troops could impede an effective implementation of the deal?\u00a0 And what do you need to see from Ethiopia in terms of addressing accusations of atrocities during the conflict to reinstate AGOA trade benefits?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 As I said, what we\u2019ve seen since the agreement was reached (inaudible) has been very significant progress on all the necessary lines of effort and necessary commitments, and by and large the guns are silent, humanitarian assistance is flowing, services are being restored.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the TPLF disarm its heavy weapons.\u00a0 And we are seeing external forces moving out of Tigray, to include the Eritreans.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s not complete.\u00a0 It\u2019s a process.\u00a0 But we continue to see significant movement in the right direction to fulfilling the commitments that were made in the agreement.\nAs to human rights concerns and abuses, I just had an opportunity to meet with human rights advocates and experts a short while ago here in Addis, and these are people who are themselves present or their organizations are present in Tigray, and this includes the United Nations.\u00a0 And what they reported to me is a very significant drop in human rights violations and abuses in Tigray.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also heard that from other sources.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve been eliminated, and indeed, we are \u2013 we strongly urge all parties to the conflict to do everything possible to ensure that they cease entirely.\u00a0 But again, we\u2019ve seen what was described to me by independent experts as a very significant diminution in human rights violations.\nWith regard to our own engagement and assistance as the work continues, as this process of implementing the agreement continues, to include making sure that there are no ongoing, proceeding violations of human rights, to include making sure that the transitional justice process is stood up and moving forward in an inclusive and credible way, then our own ability to continue to move forward on our engagement with Ethiopia \u2013 to include economic engagement \u2013 will also move forward.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s next go to Million Beyene with The Addis Standard.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Recently (inaudible) and that is the State Department has shelved a (inaudible) designating violent human rights violations in Tigray as genocide, and why is that shelved?\u00a0 And is there any (inaudible)?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nAnd (inaudible) campaign to (inaudible)?\u00a0 And will they discuss (inaudible) principles?\u00a0 I mean for the human rights and protect the UN investigation, the UN investigator\u2019s office (inaudible).\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 Let me make sure I got your question correct (inaudible).\u00a0 I think I did.\nFirst, let me be clear that the United States, first of all, has regularly spoken out about human rights violations and abuses committed against civilians and has called for accountability for those responsible.\u00a0 A year ago I addressed this myself when I said that all parties to the conflict had committed atrocities.\u00a0 Significantly, the signatories to the cessation of hostilities agreement acknowledged the atrocities committed and the devastating impact that they\u2019ve had.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re very focused on making sure that that\u2019s stopped and ceases.\nThe reports that we have including just today from experts in the field show a very significant drop in human rights violations in Tigray.\u00a0 That\u2019s significant and important, but obviously we want to see it get to \u2013 as in anyplace else \u2013 get to zero and that all parties remain committed to not engaging in any kind of abuse.\nGoing forward, what\u2019s very important is something else I mentioned: the commitment that exists to a process of transitional justice, and that includes both reconciliation and accountability.\u00a0 And what I heard today from everyone I spoke to was a commitment to that process.\u00a0 So we will be watching that as it moves forward, and this is something, again, that\u2019s vital not just for us or for any other country.\u00a0 It\u2019s first and foremost vital to all Ethiopians, because having that kind of transitional justice, building reconciliation, though, and building accountability, is the only way, in our judgment, to make sure that the peace that\u2019s been achieved in Tigray is sustained.\u00a0 Getting at grievances, getting to justice, bringing people together \u2013 that is the way to make sure that peace lasts and that people can move on with their lives and the country can really move forward.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s next go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if I can get your reaction \u2013 these are sort of two broader questions \u2013 wondering if I can get your reaction to the U.S.-Russia drone collision.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering what you make of Russia\u2019s motives here, their statements about the U.S. being directly involved in combat operations and the Russians potentially wanting to retrieve the debris.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a risk here that this widens the war further.\nAnd second, just on the recent Iran-Saudi agreement that was brokered in part by China, do you view this as a sign of China sort of striding more confidently onto the diplomatic world stage sort of post-COVID isolation?\u00a0 Is that \u2013 especially combined with their Ukraine peace proposal and the foreign minister\u2019s recent comments about U.S. containment, is this a worry?\u00a0 Is this sort of new posture a worry for the U.S.?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, with regard to the drone, the incident is being investigated and we\u2019ll look to that investigation to draw any conclusions about what the intent might be \u2013 might have been, what the actions were.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019ll be in close coordination with allies and partners at the conclusion of the investigation.\u00a0 I can\u2019t speak at this point to the motive or to intent.\u00a0 But what I can say very clearly is this was a reckless and unsafe action.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll let the investigation proceed.\nWith regard to the agreement reached between Saudi Arabia and Iran with China\u2019s involvement, from our perspective, anything that can help reduce tensions, avoid conflict, and curb in any way dangerous or destabilizing actions by Iran is a good thing.\u00a0 And as you know, in this particular case, the Saudis and the Iranians have been talking for some time going back a couple of years, including in Baghdad and in Oman.\u00a0 And to the extent that China facilitated conclusion of this agreement to restore diplomatic relations, that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s valuable that countries, where they can, take action, take responsibility for advancing security, for advancing peaceful relations.\u00a0 And if this agreement actually bears out, and particularly if Iran follows through on the commitments that it\u2019s apparently made, again, that would be positive.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Bilal Abdulmalik, Ethiopian Press Agency.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Many Ethiopians believe that U.S. decision to revoke Ethiopia\u2019s privilege for AGOA is a politically motivated one.\u00a0 And after such progress, the U.S. still hasn\u2019t shown an interest to reverse the decision (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So as you know, the United States suspended Ethiopia from the AGOA trade preference program effective January last year, 2022, due to gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u00a0 And we did this as required by law.\u00a0 It\u2019s in law and we follow the law.\u00a0 Ethiopia has clear benchmarks for a pathway toward reinstatement.\u00a0 The administration will continue to work closely with the government to achieve that objective, which we share.\u00a0 And as I noted earlier, with the cessation of hostilities agreement, and particularly with its implementation, that\u2019s extremely important in moving down that path, and my hope and expectation is that will continue.\nJust for your information, the AGOA program itself is actually administered by the U.S. Trade Representative, and what they do is they have an annual review that brings together other parts of our government, looking at the eligibility requirements.\u00a0 But there will be that process.\u00a0 We\u2019ll participate.\u00a0 We actually hosted a ministerial meeting of AGOA during the Africa Leaders Summit in December, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to planning AGOA (inaudible) next year.\nBut the bottom line is certainly we share the aspiration of Ethiopia returning to AGOA.\u00a0 And as it continues to implement the cessation of hostilities agreement, it will \u2013 it\u2019s clearly moving in the right direction.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Please take a seat.\u00a0 And it is a special honor for me to be able to say, welcome to the White House.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And welcome especially to the 2023 International Women of Courage Awards Ceremony to all of you participating here in person and tuning in from around the world.\nFor 17 years now, U.S. secretaries of state have recognized International Women of Courage who are leading the charge for progress around the world.\u00a0 This year, for the first time, we honor the awardees here\u00a0at the White House \u2013 and that really is a reflection of just how highly President Biden, the First Lady, and this administration prioritize gender equality and human rights.\nDr. Biden, thank you for bringing us here today.\u00a0 But thank you more than that for everything that you\u2019re doing every single day to be such a remarkable role model to so many women around the world, and for your incredibly tireless efforts to lift up the voices of brave women everywhere around the world.\nMRS BIDEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So we\u2019re joined today by ambassadors from across the globe, who are essential partners in all of our efforts to make sure that women and girls can reach their full potential.\nWe have senior leaders from across the United States Government here: Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, our champion, our voice, at the United Nations.\u00a0 Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks.\u00a0 Under Secretary of State Uzra Zeya, our advocate for human rights.\u00a0 Jen Klein, Kat Fotovat, who are leaders of our global gender policy.\u00a0 And of course White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, also such a powerful voice for our country and for this administration around the world.\u00a0 And I also want to point out our team from the Bureau for Educational and Cultural Affairs.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with so many of you every single day in the work that you\u2019re doing.\nWe\u2019re also joined by members of the State Department\u2019s Locally Employed Staff.\u00a0 They\u2019re literally the lifeblood of our missions in every country in the world.\u00a0 To be here today, some of them have traveled from more than a dozen countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, and the Middle East.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you today as well.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd in the audience we have several previous winners of the International Women of Courage Award, who are continuing their inspiring work.\u00a0 And the First Lady and I had an opportunity to greet them, to be able to say in person what we were not able to do the last couple of years, which is:\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0and thank you for the incredible work that you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd, of course, last but not least, our guests of honor, this year\u2019s International Women of Courage.\u00a0 Welcome to all of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWhen Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice launched this initiative in 2007, she did so to honor women creating brighter futures \u2013 for themselves, for their communities, and for generations to come.\nSince then, this award has recognized more than 180 women from over 80 countries around the world.\nAnd that includes this year\u2019s honorees: 11 truly extraordinary people.\nAs you\u2019ll hear, these women are reporting on Russian atrocities in Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019re fighting for equal opportunities for women and girls in Mongolia.\u00a0 They\u2019re defending democracy in the Central African Republic.\u00a0 They\u2019re protecting indigenous land in Costa Rica.\u00a0 They\u2019re advocating for the rights of refugees, people with disabilities, the LGBTQI+ community.\nBecause of their work, and even as they do it every single day, they are faced with extraordinary challenges that, as you learn about them, read about them, are humbling.\u00a0 They, their loved ones in many cases, have endured harassment.\u00a0 They\u2019ve endured violence.\u00a0 Some have been imprisoned.\u00a0 Others have been subject of misinformation and online attacks day in, day out.\u00a0 And yet each and every one has refused to be intimidated.\nIn every region, there are other women doing this work who we can\u2019t name individually \u2013 in some cases because the attention would put them at even greater risk.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve found a new way to honor them.\nThis year, we\u2019re launching a group award, named after a pioneer and champion of equality, the great Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.\u00a0 We have \u2013 (applause) \u2013 we have several members of the Albright family here today to help us celebrate.\u00a0 I like to think I\u2019m an extended member of that family.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 For me, as I\u2019ve told our friends, I hear Madeleine Albright\u2019s voice in my head on a regular basis; the clarity with which she spoke and what she said continues to resonate and continues to inspire me in the work that I and my team are doing.\u00a0 But you honor us with your presence today.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\nAround the world, women \u2013 in all of their diversity \u2013 are often the ones on the front lines of change.\u00a0 And yet, at the same time, they face still greater obstacles to their political participation; they experience gender-based violence and human rights abuses; they hold less economic and social power.\u00a0 We are committed to changing that.\nDefending the rights of women and girls is rooted in our democratic values of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.\u00a0 And when we advance equality and defend the rights of women, we improve life for everyone.\u00a0 When peace is forged with the participation and the leadership of women, it\u2019s more likely to last.\u00a0 We know this from experience.\u00a0 Closing the gender gap in the global workforce would add $28 trillion to the global economy.\u00a0 And as Secretary Albright once said, we simply cannot build the future that we want without the contribution of women.\nThat\u2019s why President Biden has made gender equality and women\u2019s rights a priority of our foreign policy.\u00a0 Some of you know we recently launched the first-ever, cross-government Strategy on Women\u2019s Global Economic Security, to try to help reduce the enduring wage gap, to improve access to well-paying jobs, to dismantle barriers to women\u2019s economic participation.\u00a0 In December, the United States also updated our strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based violence globally, including new efforts to expand access to programs for historically marginalized communities.\nWe\u2019re also learning from \u2013 and teaming up with \u2013 governments, civil society, the private sector in other countries to work toward gender equality together, including, of course, the women that we\u2019re honoring today.\u00a0 One of those women \u2013 Hadeel Abdel Aziz \u2013 noted that, when it comes to advancing this struggle, success is \u201cnot about one big act\u201d \u2013 \u201cnot about one big act of heroism, but \u2026 one hundred small battles.\u201d\nTo our honorees, the United States is proud to be by your side, as you and others wage those hundred small battles, day in, day out.\u00a0 And we will be there and be there with you for the long haul.\nThat includes, of course, the First Lady of the United States, Dr. Jill Biden.\u00a0 The First Lady.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The First Lady delivered remarks.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights at the U.S. Department of State Uzra Zeya.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUNDER SECRETARY ZEYA:\u00a0 It takes courage to seek justice when the powerful stand against you.\nLaws can protect the innocent or persecute the oppressed.\u00a0 And when the rule of law becomes a tool of tyranny, or when the structures in place simply fail to live up to the promise of equality, fairness, and humanity, we appeal to a higher ideal: justice.\nThe women we honor today have worked tirelessly to ensure that their nations\u2019 legal systems protect all people, no matter their gender, beliefs, or background.\u00a0 And when those systems cannot \u2013 or will not \u2013 protect every citizen, they have fought to transform them.\u00a0 They have broken barriers, risen to new heights, and inspired other young women to follow their lead.\nBecause without women\u2019s rights, perspectives, and participation, there can be no justice.\u00a0 But when we all have the opportunity to shape our laws, we create systems that truly serve us all.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nAnd now, Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken will present the awards.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs the first woman to lead the Central African Republic\u2019s Constitutional Court, Dani\u00e8le Darlan became known as the \u201cwoman of iron\u201d for her refusal to be intimidated.\u00a0 She\u2019s spent her career working to ensure the law delivers justice to all, no matter their background.\u00a0 And in the face of enormous pressure to allow the president to rewrite the constitution to give himself an illegal third term, she refused, sacrificing her career to safeguard the rule of law.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs founder and executive director of Jordan\u2019s Justice Center for Legal Aid, Hadeel Abdel Aziz provides legal services to thousands of people every year who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to a lawyer.\u00a0 She works to educate people about their rights so that they know how to protect themselves and are empowered to do so.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDuring political unrest in Kazakhstan, which resulted in deaths and credible reports of torture, longtime civil rights advocate Bakhytzhan Toregozhina used phone calls to expose human rights violations during an internet blackout.\u00a0 She then founded a coalition to document violations and provide legal and mental health support to victims of torture and abuse.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPlease join me once more in congratulating these incredible women.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDEPUTY SECRETARY HICKS:\u00a0 It takes courage to seek peace when you are the target of violence.\nWhen wars are waged, when authoritarians seek to consolidate power, when conflict uproots and displaces families, women and girls shoulder many of the costs and consequences.\nThose who wish to harm and turn their violence on women and girls often do so because women and girls serve as a society\u2019s source of strength and a beacon of hope.\nIt\u2019s because when women use their voices to speak out against authoritarianism, their leadership can create lasting democratic change.\nWhen women use their voices to stand up for what\u2019s right against overwhelming odds, their voices can reverberate around the world.\nAnd when women have a seat at the table, they hold the power to lead their communities toward peace and prosperity.\nAnd that\u2019s the truth.\nStudies show that when women participate in peace negotiations, these talks are more likely to come to a just settlement and result in lasting stability.\nPeace is possible when we support the women working to make it a reality \u2013 by stopping conflicts before they begin, by addressing the root causes of discrimination and violence, and by working to end wars that have already begun and mitigating their harm.\nSo today, we salute several women leaders who are exhibiting extraordinary courage to seek peace when they themselves are the targets of violence; women who are using their strength to pursue gender equity and equality in the face of extreme cruelty and hate; women who are fighting for dignity and freedom for not just themselves but for others.\nIn our awardees, we see that our capacity for understanding and healing is stronger than the forces that try to tear us apart \u2013 and we are reminded that women belong everywhere the decisions are made.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nOn behalf of Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken, I\u2019m honored to present awards to the following women.\nIn Mongolia, Brigadier General Bolor Ganbold is the first female staff officer in her country to be assigned to a United Nations peacekeeping operation \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and the first female general to serve in the Mongolian armed forces.\u00a0 Brigadier Ganbold has served in peacekeeping missions around the world, and she has advocated for gender equality in peacekeeping forces and her country\u2019s military, so that women and girls can be properly protected during and after conflicts.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn Costa Rica, Doris R\u00edos has dedicated her life to fighting for indigenous women\u2019s rights to life and dignity and for the reclamation of indigenous lands.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 In the face of threats of violence and attacks against her and her family, she has created a seat at the table for indigenous women to make the world more peaceful and just.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn Argentina, Alba Rueda is a transgender woman who was kicked out of classrooms, barred for sitting for exams, refused job opportunities, subjected to violence, and rejected by her family.\u00a0 But in the face of these challenges, she worked to end violence and discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community in Argentina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAfter women were barred from schools in Afghanistan, Zakira Hekmat secretly finished high school and won a scholarship to study in T\u00fcrkiye, eventually becoming a doctor.\u00a0 After seeing the difficulty refugees faced, she founded the Afghan Refugee Solidarity Association to advocate for the rights of all refugees and women.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt is my privilege and honor \u2013 to honor each of you for your important contributions to human rights and for making the world a more peaceful place.\nCongratulations, and thank you for your courage.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome White House Press Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS JEAN-PIERRE:\u00a0 It takes courage to speak when those in power want to stay \u2013 want you to stay silent.\nIn a world where lies and distortion are easy to sell, one of the most powerful weapons that we have is the truth.\nBecause corruption thrives in darkness, dictators and authoritarians seek to control criticism and define the stories that we tell.\u00a0 They threaten journalists and those who speak out, so they can control knowledge and hide their crimes \u2013 selling their people false stories of peace and success.\nBut when we illuminate the shadows, we can expose the damage they create \u2013 lighting a path forward for those trapped in the dark with the knowledge and the strength to rise and demand change.\nThis group of journalists, broadcasters, and war correspondents spread truth, courage, and empower other women and girls to use their voices for democracy, freedom, and justice.\n(A video was played.)\nAnd once again, Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken will present the awards.\nThrough her independent YouTube news channel, Roha TV, veteran Ethiopian journalist Meaza Mohammed shares stories of those who are often silenced.\u00a0 Despite three arrests in under one year, she continued to raise her voice, advocating for survivors of gender-based violence and urging accountability for crimes committed against them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWhile helping evacuate women and children from areas affected by war, Ukrainian military veteran Yuliia Paievska secretly documented Russian forces-committed atrocities during the 2022 siege of Mariupol.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 She smuggled a memory card to the Associated Press in a tampon, and was forced to destroy another with her teeth before being captured by Russian forces and tortured for information.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Since her release, she has continued to raise her voice for her people, pushing for peace and independence for Ukraine.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs a broadcaster journalist, Ras Adiba Radzi became a household name.\u00a0 After a car accident and brutal assault permanently paralyzed her from the waist down, she used her platform to advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities \u2013 (applause) \u2013 first as a reporter, and now as a senator in Malaysia\u2019s parliament and the first female chair of the national Malaysian news agency, Bernama.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWhile Polish journalist Bianka Zalewska was combating Russian misinformation in 2014, her car was shot, causing accident that broke her spine.\u00a0 Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, and in the face of intimidation and death threats, she continues her work documenting war crimes, lifting up stories of refugees, and training other journalists to effectively counter misinformation.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPlease join me in a round of applause for all of our awardees.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD:\u00a0 Hello, everyone.\u00a0 It really is a privilege to present this new award \u2013 one that honors our first female Secretary of State, the late Madeleine Albright.\nSecretary Albright showed so many women, including myself, how to lead with moral clarity and with courage.\nHer legacy lives on in those still fighting for gender equality and universal human rights.\nIt is fitting that this award recognizes not just one woman, but the bravery, the fortitude, and collaboration of a whole movement.\nIt speaks to the outsized impact of Secretary Albright\u2019s example and life of service.\nWhen the Albright family \u2013 who is here with us today \u2013 learned about this award, they asked that another trailblazing leader \u2013 one who knew Secretary Albright well \u2013 be part of this ceremony: Secretary Condoleezza Rice.\nSecretary Rice created the International Women of Courage award in 2007, and though she couldn\u2019t join us today, she wanted to take part in this very special ceremony.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nAnd I wish they could be here to hear your applause.\nI\u2019m proud to present the Madeleine K. Albright Honorary Group International Women of Courage Award.\nThis inaugural award goes to women and girls in Iran, who \u2013 in the wake of the brutal killing of Mahsa Amini \u2013 have inspired us all.\nAll Mahsa wanted was to live a normal and happy life.\u00a0 She dreamed of starting a family after finishing her studies.\nBut these hopes and dreams were crushed.\u00a0 They were crushed by the tyranny of Iran\u2019s so-called \u201cmorality police.\u201d\nThe Iranian Government probably thought this would just be another footnote in a long record of violence and discrimination against women.\nBut this time \u2013 this time it was different.\nThe Iranian people \u2013 led by women \u2013 took to the streets in peaceful protest.\nThey followed in the footsteps of brave women before them, who sacrificed so much in the name of freedom.\u00a0 Through neighborhoods and classrooms, out of apartment buildings and car windows, the protesters chanted throughout Iran and around the world, creating a global chorus demanding gender equality and human rights.\nBut for all the hope this movement represents, we must never forget how the Iranian regime has responded.\nThey have tortured peaceful protesters.\u00a0 They have arrested tens of thousands of people.\u00a0 They have badly injured and killed Iranians in bloody crackdowns.\nThe international community must continue to condemn the regime\u2019s repression and violence.\nAnd we must back up our words with action.\nThat\u2019s why the United States led a successful effort to remove Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women.\nAnd it\u2019s why we are working to hold those complicit in these abuses accountable.\nTo all the women and girls across Iran \u2013 know this:\u00a0 We will continue to stand with you in your fight for women, for life, and for freedom.\nSo everyone, please join me in recognizing the courageous women and girls in Iran.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you.\nI now have the honor of introducing another courageous woman who has been an unwavering champion for vulnerable populations in Malaysia.\nWhen a car accident and a brutal assault paralyzed Senator Ras Adiba Radzi from the waist down, she dedicated her life to advocacy.\nTo raise awareness, Malaysians across the country saw her on TV, in parliament, and at the Paralympics.\u00a0 They heard her commentary.\u00a0 They heard her poetry.\u00a0 They heard her fierce call for justice.\nIn May 2020, she became Malaysia\u2019s representative for people with disabilities \u2013 and later that year, she was appointed the first female chair of the Malaysian National News Agency.\nSenator Ras Adiba Radzi embodies \u2013 she embodies what it means to live a life in service to others.\u00a0 Please join me in welcoming her to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS RADZI:\u00a0\u00a0Assalamu alaikum, or peace be upon you.\nI\u2019m Senator Ras Adiba Radzi, a representative of the 2023 International Women of Courage Award.\u00a0 Before I begin, I would like to thank the First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, the Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, and the U.S. Department of State for giving me the opportunity to speak today.\nI\u2019d have to say that I\u2019m thoroughly impressed by the amazing work done by my fellow finalists in their respective countries.\u00a0 Let\u2019s give them a big hand.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Among others, I am joined by women who are fighting against gender-based violence, for the rights of indigenous persons, and for the rule of law.\nHonorable guests, I was born able-bodied and became permanently paralyzed from the waist down after several incidents.\u00a0 I became a spinal-cord-injured person following a car accident in 1995, a brutal assault a year later, and finally in 2002 when I fell after climbing a ladder.\nSince then, I have committed my life to fighting for the rights of persons with disabilities in my country, Malaysia.\u00a0 I witnessed discrimination and stigma as persons with disabilities and then on my team and I fought and fought and fought.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, I have been working tirelessly to create awareness on the importance of accessibility in infrastructure, disability inclusion, job opportunities, inclusive education, housing, and upholding our rights, among others.\nI and my team then founded an association to empower persons with disabilities called OKU Sentral.\u00a0 In May 2020, the Malaysian king, His Majesty the King Al-Sultan Abdullah, appointed me as a senator in the upper house parliament of Malaysia to represent persons with disabilities.\u00a0 In November 2020, I was appointed the first female chair of the Malaysian National News Agency, BERNAMA, after 53 years of its establishment.\nDistinguished guests, in the area of sustainable development, all of us here aim to create a world which is inclusive, equitable, and sustainable, a world in which no one is left behind and opportunities be made available for all, for a secure, stable, and successful nation.\u00a0 Without the role and contribution of women, a nation will not be able to progress as it is today.\u00a0 It is vital for all parties to respect the contribution of women in all areas: economy, social, politics and culture.\u00a0 Women\u2019s involvement is crucial, as they are an important asset to a country.\nSo let\u2019s, again, give a big round of applause \u2013 and actually I feel like hugging them all \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 especially to the women here and to women across the world who have excelled in their roles and contributed towards a prosperous nation worldwide. We are at a pivotal moment for women\u2019s rights.\u00a0 For us, receiving this International Women of Courage Award is very, very much significant for our people in each of our countries.\u00a0 This will be an integral part of spreading awareness and will celebrate the activism and transformative power of women and girls.\nHonorable guests, this opportunity is indeed an honor for me to share my views and experience, especially concerning the protection and social participation of persons with disabilities in Malaysia with everyone here today. Despite the increasing awareness around persons with disabilities, there is no denial that there\u2019s discrimination in this polarized world, exists to the detriment of our disabled friends.\u00a0 It exists because of a prevailing mindset, a stereotypical way of looking at the disabled.\u00a0 What the community needs to understand and to accept is that persons with disabilities are entitled to the full range of civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights, as stated in various human rights instruments, the same as everyone else.\nOn that note, and as we speak, the Malaysian Government is in the midst of amending the Persons with Disabilities Act 2008 to have an Anti-Discrimination Act for Persons with Disabilities like the United Kingdom\u2019s and the Americans with Disability Act 1990 or ADA.\nEsteemed guests, raising awareness of basic human rights and the right to be free of discrimination among women, children, and persons with disabilities is the fundamental aspect in which we must continue to work on.\u00a0 Without such awareness, it is extremely difficult to bring about justice and change.\u00a0 The increasing number of hate crimes, racist remarks, and instances of ableist behavior shows that we must act quickly to protect the most vulnerable communities.\nHence, I would like to take this opportunity to call on the 195 governments of the day in the world to ensure that the marginalized and vulnerable groups \u2013 women, children, including persons with disabilities \u2013 are not left out and rise to the clarion call of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda: leave no one behind.\nBefore I end my speech, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the late Judith Heumann, a leader in the disability community, advocating for persons with disabilities and has been the mother of the disability rights movement since the \u201970s.\u00a0 We will miss her terribly.\u00a0 But myself and the rest of us, I promise you, will continue to be her voice.\u00a0 As she puts it, we are leaders of inclusiveness and community, of love, equity, and justice.\nHonorable guests, me standing here today \u2013 in my standing wheelchair \u2013 means a whole lot, especially for my countrymen, Malaysia.\u00a0 So I\u2019d like to say in Malay\u00a0sejuta doa mencapai bintang, which means a million prayers has now reached the skies.\nTerima kasih\u00a0or thank you for this honor, and from the bottom of my heart,\u00a0assalamu alaikum.\u00a0\u00a0(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome Acting Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women\u2019s Issues at the U.S. Department of State Kat Fotovat.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR FOTOVAT:\u00a0\u00a0What an honor it is to close out such a historic day, such a historic event.\u00a0 Happy International Women\u2019s Day to all those around the world and to our amazing Women of Courage we honor today.\u00a0 What an incredible ceremony.\nI must say, I am rendered nearly speechless by the senator\u2019s remarks.\u00a0 Your resilience, determination, and grit in the fact of extreme adversity and your resolve to continue to fight for women\u2019s rights as human rights, to achieve a better future for us, is both humbling and energizing.\nI couldn\u2019t also help but think of my dear friend and personal hero Judy Heumann, whose funeral I attended just this morning.\u00a0 Judy was a leader of the international disability rights movement who said, \u201cI simply refused to accept what I was told about who I could be.\u00a0 And I was willing to make a fuss about it.\u201d\u00a0 Through your work, senator, and the work of all of our awardees, Judy\u2019s legacy of defending the rights and communities facing discrimination will live on.\u00a0 You and all of our International Women of Courage awardees are truly inspirational for your courage and, as Judy noted, to make a fuss about it.\nI\u2019m so honored to be here at the White House today to join First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Secretary Blinken, and the other distinguished speakers who joined us to pay tribute to the recipients of the Secretary of State 2023 International Women of Courage Awards.\u00a0 The IWOC Award is truly a centerpiece and guiding force behind my office\u2019s work to lead the Department of State\u2019s efforts to promote the rights and empowerment of women and girls worldwide, and it is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and assistance.\nToday, our awardees join a truly incredible group of more than 180 women from more than 80 countries who have received the International Women of Courage Award since 2007\u00a0in recognition of the exceptional courage, strength, and leadership all of you have shown, advocating for peace, justice, human rights, and gender equity and equality, often at great personal risk and sacrifice.\u00a0 I hope this award will elevate your advocacy work and bring greater international attention to the issues that you are fighting for.\nEvery day, as my colleagues and I carry out our mission, working with our partners to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, advance women\u2019s economic security, and promote the women, peace, and security agenda across the globe, we draw inspiration from fearless women\u2019s rights champions like the courageous women who are \u2013 we are gathered here to honor today, and also from their advocates, defenders, their family members, government allies, civil society leaders, and journalists who are also in this room today championing gender equity and equality, not just in words but in action.\nToday, on International Women\u2019s Day, the U.S. Government reaffirms our commitment to the safety and full participation of women and girls in decision-making at all levels and as foundational to peace, stability, and economic growth of all nations.\nI\u2019d also like to quote Secretary Albright, who said, \u201cIt took me a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nTo our 2023 Courage Awards, thank you again for using your voices and being the voice for those who can\u2019t use theirs.\u00a0 Let us all commit to using our voices to amplify those facing oppression, crisis, and in conflict in places like Iran, Ukraine, and Afghanistan, and all over the world.\nCongratulations\u00a0to our awardees, and thank you for all you have done to give women and girls everywhere a fighting chance.\u00a0 We stand with you and for you.\u00a0 And thank you, everyone here today, joining us to celebrate these truly amazing and courageous women.\u00a0 Happy International Women\u2019s Day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

you to the business end of the Raisina Dialogue after yesterday\u2019s inauguration.\u00a0 For us at ORF and at the Raisina Dialogue, this is a very special day.\u00a0 Many years ago, 2017 if I recall, we toyed with the idea of bringing the admirals from Quad together.\u00a0 I can see the Pacific Command table here, and the Pacific Command was instrumental partner in trying to cajole others to join in to having and discussing the possibilities of Quad being an actor, being a player, being a contributor to the world at whole.\u00a0 Let me tell you, all capitals are very shy, and everyone was asking us at that time should we probably involve another country, someone else, so that it doesn\u2019t look like Quad, that doesn\u2019t feel like Quad, we can try and dilute it a little.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0from\u00a0that\u00a0time many years ago to today when we have the Quad Squad sitting here, we have come a long way.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0we are thrilled and thank you all of you very \u2013 for joining us, and it\u2019s a fantastic day for Raisina.\u00a0 So let me start with Minister Wong.\u00a0 Minister Wong, you\u2019ve just stepped out of a meeting.\u00a0 You had a formal meeting this morning\u00a0of\u00a0\u2013 with your colleagues.\u00a0 Let me ask you: How does this group add to your agenda?\u00a0 You are now writing Australian foreign policy future.\u00a0 How does this meeting help in your individual agenda in Australia?\u00a0 And\u00a0certainly\u00a0since you are focused on the Pacific and ASEAN, how can Quad be a complementary actor, a supportive actor, perhaps even a contributor to your own assessment and ambitions in that region?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0Well, can I start with a complementarity point because I think that answers the first part of your question?\u00a0 I mean, the complementarity of this configuration with the architecture of the region, some of which you referenced, I think is demonstrated from Australia\u2019s perspective by our geography and by our interests.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nSo\u00a0in terms of our geography, we are the smallest economy here.\u00a0 We\u2019re the most \u2013\u00a0southern most\u00a0economy here.\u00a0 We are bounded on one side by the Indian Ocean and the other side by the Pacific, as it,\u00a0Asia \u2013\u00a0ASEAN in particular, to\u00a0our north the countries of ASEAN.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0for us, our interests lie in a world which is being reshaped and a region which is being reshaped in working through this and the architecture of the region to ensure a region which I describe as stable, peaceful, secure, and respectful of sovereignty.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0our geography and our interests lead to complementarity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I also believe that there is a tangible complementarity in the sense that there are things that we engage with Pacific Island nations on, things with which we engage with the ASEAN \u2013 countries of the ASEAN region on, issues on which we engage in this grouping, and they are all aligned with our interests in economic development, in prosperity, in stability, and in the protection of sovereignty.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Since you\u2019re also in the very first year of your \u2013 of the new role that you\u2019ve assumed, and to the Indian audience that\u2019s hearing you, what is Australia\u2019s assessment of India\u2019s role in the region, in your life?\u00a0 And by inference, perhaps also where are we headed in the bilateral?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0I mean, India is \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0And can I request you to bring the mike closer to you?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0Right.\u00a0 I could answer the question in power terms and in influence terms.\u00a0 I could talk about the extent to which India is a critical power, a great power in the region, that there is no reshaping of the Indo-Pacific with the attributes that Australia would seek without India.\u00a0 I\u2019d also make the point \u2013 and I think we\u2019ve seen that in not only in how Jai engages with the world and his narrative around it, but also Prime Minister Modi.\u00a0 India is a civilizational power \u2013 brings a different perspective to some of the challenges of these times.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m going to come back to you, Minister Wong, but let me now turn to Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 One of the big conversations in India and other parts of the Indo-Pacific certainly is around how distracted is America with the conflict in Europe and how committed is it to continuing to engage in this region.\u00a0 Is Quad an interim consultative group even as the real action unfolds with your old allies and in the old world?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think the very fact not only of our presence here today but our presence and engagement day-in, day-out, including through the Quad and the work that we\u2019re doing not only during the meetings that we have but in between, is powerful evidence of the fact that, as you might say, we can run and chew gum at the same time.\u00a0 And for us the future is so much in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our engagement throughout the region,\u00a0both through the Quad and in other ways,\u00a0is as comprehensive and as deep as any time I can remember.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I think what we talked about yesterday\u00a0in the course of\u00a0the G20 was also illustrative of this, because even as we\u2019re rightly focused on what is happening in Ukraine as a result of the Russian aggression, not just because it matters to Ukrainians and to Ukraine and to Europe, but because it matters to the entire world.\u00a0 The principles that underlie the entire international system that are necessary for trying to keep peace, the stability that grew out of two world wars are being challenged, being aggressed along with Ukraine.\u00a0 And part of the reason that countries way beyond Europe are also so focused on this and are working to support Ukraine and deal with the challenge is because they know it could have an effect here.\u00a0 If we allow with impunity Russia to do what it\u2019s doing in Ukraine, then that\u2019s a message to\u00a0wouldbe\u00a0aggressors everywhere that they may be able to get away with it too.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut having said that, you saw\u00a0yesterday\u00a0and you see today in this meeting of the Quad an equally intense focus on the issues that are having an impact on the lives of\u00a0all of\u00a0our fellow citizens where the Quad is a force, I believe, for good, positive, affirmative action.\u00a0 What\u2019s in so many ways important about it is this: first, we start with the proposition that virtually none of the challenges that our people are facing and that people around the world are facing can be effectively dealt with by any one country acting alone, whether it\u2019s the United States, whether it\u2019s India, whether it\u2019s Japan, whether it\u2019s Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd given that basic premise, it makes sense for us to start by finding likeminded groups of countries with which to tackle these challenges.\u00a0 And the great power of the Quad is you have four likeminded countries united in their basic values, united in their basic interests, bringing different strengths, different experiences, different comparative weights to tackling these problems.\u00a0 And not only tackling for\u00a0ourselves, but\u00a0actually creating\u00a0a\u00a0global commons\u00a0good, particularly for other countries in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years\u00a0in particular is\u00a0translated that into very practical projects, very practical \u2013 in a sense \u2013 offerings, so that we\u2019re creating for other countries in the region a positive choice and a positive partner.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that \u2013 obviously we did this on vaccines under \u2013 during COVID.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing it on infrastructure for some time.\u00a0 We are now engaged very much in working together to help countries deal with humanitarian situations, disasters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd of course, we\u2019re working on things that are\u00a0really critical\u00a0in ways that may not be so obvious to countries throughout the region, which is what\u2019s called maritime domain awareness: giving countries the capacity, the tools, to have a full picture of everything that\u2019s happening in their maritime space, which is affecting the lives of many of their citizens; for example, illegal fishing.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0I think not only are we not distracted; on the contrary, we\u2019re more deeply engaged than ever, and the Quad is one of the most critical vehicles for that engagement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Secretary, our bilateral relationships, India-U.S. bilateral relationships, have taken a step forward with this latest critical and emerging technologies agreement, a lot of excitement, a lot of coverage.\u00a0 Can the Quad elevate itself to collaborate on critical defense technologies, or is that going to be the \u2013 preserved for AUKUS and for the old partners?\u00a0 Does Quad have a vision for also working together on building the defense for future?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019d say two things.\u00a0 First, of course this is not a military grouping.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that kind of alliance.\u00a0 But one of the things that we are doing through the Quad is trying to bring together not only governments but academia and other experts to look at where we might\u00a0collaborate together\u00a0on new technology, on innovation, and whether that has benefits in other areas remains to be seen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut clearly, our four countries\u00a0in particular are\u00a0very well-placed to increase in a variety of ways our collaboration on emerging technology and on innovation, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll also do through the Quad.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Minister Hayashi, is Quad relevant for Japan\u2019s maritime security concerns?\u00a0 How is it important for what\u2019s unfolding in East China Sea?\u00a0 Do you think it is a feel-good talk shop consultative group, or do you think it has the potential to be able to put together something that will be of use to you when things get rough?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Thank you, thank you.\u00a0 Like Tony said, this Quad is not for security issues nor military issues, but practical cooperation like everybody said.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0since your question is about might and security, this is not directly for the security, but through\u00a0those cooperation\u00a0and including four\u00a0of\u00a0us, and then the\u00a0(inaudible) Blue Pacific areas like Pacific Island countries and ASEAN\u00a0and also\u00a0South Asia.\u00a0\u00a0This understanding and mutual understanding and cooperation, then the \u2013 there will make some combined will to cherish the same value\u00a0like\u00a0democracy, freedom, and that will eventually help to have more security assurance environment for all of us.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Okay, it\u2019s not a security actor.\u00a0 The other important area that\u00a0Japan\u00a0is focused on is connectivity, and it is investing in infrastructure across the region.\u00a0 Do you think Quad can have an agenda for connectivity and infrastructure?\u00a0 Do you think it could be an actor and contribute to that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Yes, through our bilateral ODAs\u00a0and also\u00a0through some international institutions,\u00a0we\u2019ve\u00a0been already in many decades doing some infrastructure\u00a0and also\u00a0economic cooperation in these areas.\u00a0 But on the top of that this Quad is not only bilateral like Japan and some countries, but this is\u00a0a\u00a0Quad\u00a0as a whole will\u00a0be coordinating all those efforts of four countries so that we can do much better than just one plus one plus one is four.\u00a0 One plus one plus one plus one is four, but\u00a0the\u00a0one plus one plus one plus one could be six, seven or eight by coordinating and listening.\u00a0 We have now eight ears to listen to all those needs of the\u00a0countries, and\u00a0communicate and coordinating in the Quad like we did in this morning.\u00a0 We can listen\u00a0more\u00a0and we can do more.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Eight ears, but you also have four tongues, and we\u00a0have to\u00a0be watchful there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut let me ask you the last final question for this round to you, Minister Hayashi.\u00a0 The China factor.\u00a0 Many of us have a very strong economic relationship \u2013 Japan certainly does \u2013 with China.\u00a0 China disapproves of the Quad, and in some sense, you\u00a0have to\u00a0navigate that as well.\u00a0 How does Japan do that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0like we said, like I said, this not a military but this is just practical\u00a0cooperation\u00a0and we don\u2019t\u00a0trying\u00a0to exclude anybody.\u00a0 This is an open architecture.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0one thing we would like to say is to just abide by the law, of international law, international institutions.\u00a0 And\u00a0as long as\u00a0even China\u00a0abide\u00a0by the rule of the international norm\u00a0and also\u00a0act like \u2013 act under the international institutions, standards, and laws, then this is not conflicting issues between China and the Quad.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Let me turn to you, Minister Jaishankar, and perhaps you can enlighten us.\u00a0 Why was Quad in some ways dead on arrival 10 to 15 years ago when the first avatar was being discussed, debated, even considered, to today India hosting the Quad panel discussion at Raisina Dialogue?\u00a0 What changed, why did it change, and how does this really reflect how you assess the importance of the region and the group in the region?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS\u00a0MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Well, Samir, I don\u2019t think it was dead on arrival.\u00a0 It was dead a few months after arrival, and there\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s important to understand why, because by some coincidence I happen to be associated with different phases of the Quad.\u00a0 I take the Quad back to Boxing Day 2004 when the Indian Ocean tsunami happened.\u00a0 It so happened at that time I was the country coordinator for our external coordination and response.\u00a0 Then in 2006 when Prime Minister Abe came to India, he\u00a0before coming had this idea that the Quad could be an effective way of dealing with the challenges.\u00a0 There was\u00a0actually a\u00a0Quad meeting \u2013 if my memory serves me right \u2013 in Manila in 2007, and then, as you say, it didn\u2019t work out.\u00a0 If you ask\u00a0me\u00a0why didn\u2019t it work out as opposed to what happened 10 years later \u2013 because it was revived 10 years later, 2017, at the level of\u00a0under secretaries, vice ministers; I was foreign secretary then \u2013 \u201917 it was revived, then \u201919 it became a foreign\u00a0ministers\u00a0level.\u00a0 And when the Biden administration came in in \u201921, it became a summit level.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0what\u2019s the difference between \u201917, \u201919, \u201921, as opposed to 2007?\u00a0 One, I think there was greater strategic clarity on the part of all the countries concerned.\u00a0 Two, our own inter-state relations changed during this period.\u00a0 If I were to look at India\u2019s ties with the U.S., it became much deeper; with Japan\u00a0also\u00a0it grew; and I think the real big change has been in the last decade with Australia.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0in a way, Quad is working in 2023 partly, as I said, because we have greater strategic clarity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI also think we have leaderships with a greater sense of purpose who are less encumbered by baggage.\u00a0 But to me, a big difference is\u00a0actually our\u00a0inter-state relationship, which has today become so much more confident and so much deeper.\u00a0 So, in fact, the one point I would differ with Minister Hayashi \u2013 actually, I hope one day it will be 1,111, the one-one-one-one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 When you walked in, all of you seemed quite at ease, and there was a bit of a relaxed feel, vibe to it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 There\u2019s always a relaxed feel when we meet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0what did you discuss inside the room?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 A lot of things, but if my colleagues would indulge me, we\u00a0actually today\u00a0captured some of our discussions in the form of a statement.\u00a0 I think that statement would have been put out or will be put out.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0if you ask me what were the new things which came out today, we agreed on a counterterrorism working group; we agreed on cooperating more closely with the Indian Ocean Rim Association; we agreed that there would be a \u2013 we had earlier worked out a HADR Quad initiative, so the standard operating procedures for that, which I think the military people would obviously see as a prerequisite for their cooperation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI think we coordinated on the UN to make sure that the processes of the UN are respected and the workings of the UN sort of stay true to its spirit.\u00a0 I was personally happy that there was a stronger expression of support from all of us collectively to the reform of the UN, to the fact that there would be intergovernmental negotiations on the reform.\u00a0 I also see that on \u2013 when it comes to sustainable development goals, which all of us are committed to, we believe that they should be pursued comprehensively, not cherrypicked for political convenience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe will be doing our maritime security working group very shortly in Washington, and we discussed \u2013 among other things, one of the outcomes we agreed on was that the listings of terrorists \u2013 the counterterrorism side listings \u2013 should not be politicized.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0these were some of the outcomes.\u00a0 So, I mean, there were a lot of things which I can\u2019t tell you, so \u2013 but this is the public side of what we can tell you.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0I thought collectively I should be putting it out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 And how do you respond to this common refrain that most politicians seem to indulge in from the Quad countries that this is not against anyone, we are not a security grouping, we are not a military grouping.\u00a0 Why are we apologetic?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t think \u2013 look, we are not apologetic.\u00a0 I do believe \u2013 because I keep reminding people of 2004, because to me, if your origins are in common good, there\u2019s a lot \u2013 there\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0innate virtue in your existence, okay?\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0we do stand for something.\u00a0 What I would not like to be defined as is standing against something or somebody, because that diminishes me.\u00a0 That makes it out as though some other people are the center of the world and I\u2019m only there to be for them or against them.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think \u2013 actually, I think I\u2019m the center of the world, but that\u2019s a different matter.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Okay, so I\u2019m going to turn to \u2013 as is custom here, I\u2019m going to turn to our young fellows.\u00a0 We have 48 young fellows from 33 countries who are spending two weeks with us, and typically we go to a couple of them for every session to hear their thoughts, their questions for all of you.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0I\u2019ll turn to \u2013 first to Teesta and then to\u00a0Kirtbir.\u00a0 Teesta, introduce yourself very briefly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning, ministers.\u00a0 My name is Teesta Prakash and I\u2019m from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra, and my question to you is:\u00a0 How do we build a regional consensus in the Indo-Pacific given the four Quad countries sit on the periphery of the Indo-Pacific?\u00a0 How do we then include Southeast Asia?\u00a0 How do we bring the Pacific Islands with us to really sort of create a regional narrative for what is a second \u2013 not a security, perhaps, but an economic architecture?\u00a0 How do we bring the region along with the four Quad countries?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 And can I just add to that \u2013 because all of you have also invoked the term \u2013 look, all of you have started speaking like each other, and that worries me.\u00a0 All of you\u00a0say\u00a0\u201cASEAN centrality.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 It\u00a0actually makes\u00a0me happy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 You\u00a0say\u00a0\u201cASEAN centrality,\u201d and we keep thinking what\u00a0does that really mean.\u00a0 Does it mean that beautiful flower arrangement in the middle of the room when four of you are sitting?\u00a0 What does it really mean?\u00a0 So \u2013 sorry, the second question,\u00a0Kirtbir.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Let me go to the second question and then I\u2019ll come to you.\u00a0 Can we take a second question?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks, Samir and panelists.\u00a0 I\u2019m\u00a0Kirtbir\u00a0Chahal.\u00a0 I work for the British Government.\u00a0 Similar question to narrative, but how do you think the Quad can reconcile their strategic interests in and their competing visions for the Indo-Pacific?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd given the Quad are already discussing supply chain resilience and economic resilience more broadly, are Quad members likely to increase market access for each other to further strengthen that economic cooperation and truly move in the same direction?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 So now we will turn to the panelists.\u00a0 First one was to you, ma\u2019am, so over to you, Minister Wong.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0 Well, I might \u2013 I think the nub of the first question goes really to complementarity.\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to not be provoked by the flower arrangement analogy just for the moment.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But it goes to complementarity, and I think if we can start where \u2013 perhaps where Jai started, which is think about what we are for, not what we are against.\u00a0 What are we for?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI think\u00a0where we are very likeminded is we have a view about the attributes of the region we inhabit, and that region \u2013 and people will use different words; some say open and inclusive; some might say stable, secure, free of \u2013 where sovereignty is respected \u2013 but the point is we do have a view about that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe see the Quad, I would say, as a bit of a lighthouse.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0 That was for you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0 But we conceive it as enabling choices, and I think it enables choices in two ways.\u00a0 It enables choices by these countries working for a region with the attributes that enable choices, and it also enables choices by virtue of the practical work that we seek to do together; sometimes through all four in the work streams that Jai described; sometimes collaboration, whether it\u2019s in the Pacific, where Australia and Japan or Australia and India might work together in a particular country \u2013 this project is a good one for you to do, this is a project we\u2019ll do, this is what we\u2019ve done, but that sort of practical cooperation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I don\u2019t feel the dissonance that I know some commentators feel and that is underpinning a couple of the questions as between the different architectures, because as an Australian, the region in which we live demands the engagement at multiple levels in multiple contexts.\u00a0 We have \u2013 we are the first dialogue partner of ASEAN, so our commitment to ASEAN centrality is historic and real, but it is also geographic.\u00a0 And we do not see our engagement with our friends and partners up here on the stage as doing anything other than enhancing that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, ASEAN centrality.\u00a0 India also has its own neighbors who it\u00a0has to\u00a0take into account\u00a0\u2013 their views, their conditions.\u00a0 Is there a time to \u2013 just taking this question forward, are we creating enough mechanisms to engage with these countries?\u00a0 We are four big countries in the region, in the periphery, as Teesta mentioned, so what is the mechanism to reach out, to take them along, to sometimes respond to anxieties?\u00a0 You are going to create ripples.\u00a0 And perhaps also the second question of\u00a0Kirtbir\u00a0on connectivity and congruence within the Quad.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, let me start with coming back to the first question and just adding to what Penny said I think very eloquently.\u00a0 Our proposition is not to say to countries in the region, \u201cYou have to choose.\u201d\u00a0 Our proposition is to offer a choice, to offer an affirmative alternative.\u00a0 And the more we\u2019re able to do that \u2013 and do that in practical ways \u2013 I think the more cohesion you\u2019re going to see throughout the region.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve already discussed in\u00a0a number of\u00a0very practical areas that\u00a0actually answer\u00a0the needs of countries in different parts of the region, that\u2019s exactly what the Quad is doing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSecond, to Penny\u2019s point \u2013 and I think this is very important \u2013 we really look at this as variable geometry, which is to say there are different collections of countries \u2013 some in formal alliances, some in looser partnerships, some working together on a bilateral basis, some in slightly larger groupings \u2013 and the idea really is to make sure that we\u2019re fit for purpose for any\u00a0particular challenge.\u00a0 And so it may be that the Quad can focus on certain things where the\u00a0particular attributes\u00a0of our countries brought together make sense.\u00a0 There are other places where different groupings of countries, whether in existing alliances or new partnerships that we form, make the most sense because it addresses the\u00a0particular interests\u00a0or\u00a0particular attributes\u00a0that those countries can bring to the table.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I think you\u00a0have to\u00a0think of it that way.\u00a0 This is not a rigid thing, and that\u2019s I think the mindset that the four of us have, although now maybe it\u2019s the five of us.\u00a0 I think, Samir, you\u2019re now an honorary member.\u00a0 Maybe \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 sort of the fifth Beatle, as it were.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re taking.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd the other thing I think it\u2019s important to understand is this is an ongoing conversation, and one of the strengths that we have is \u2013 and we just had a meeting over breakfast, but it\u2019s just picking up the conversation that\u2019s happening virtually all the time in some fashion among the four of us or among some subset of the four of us.\u00a0 And that also gives it great power because there\u2019s tremendous continuity, and what we\u2019re working on most now is translating the vision that we brought to this into very concrete, practical things that address very concrete, practical needs of countries throughout the region.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Would you guys have a WhatsApp group?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Okay, I\u2019m sorry, that was not a question.\u00a0 Minister Hayashi, your responses to ASEAN and \u2014\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 It all has been said.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to add anything on those comments already made, but is this a group or what?\u00a0 This is a kind of \u2013 not a band like the Beatles, the member is\u00a0fixed\u00a0and they always play together in 10 years, but this is more like a, more kind of soft group, so that even within the Beatles, Paul McCartney can release the album by solo.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And \u2013 so yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo those are the things that could be a band, but everybody is really one harmonization with (inaudible) 50th anniversary for ASEAN.\u00a0 So that information we can share with four of us here so that any idea relating to that could be \u2013 I can absorb from those three friends here.\u00a0 So those are the situation we are facing, and it\u2019s very nice to talk over these issues surrounding the area, because we have a trust between four of us and a trust for \u2013 like I said at the beginning \u2013 the same values and same values such as democracy, freedom, and everything.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0without worrying about those big conditions, we can\u00a0really freely\u00a0talk within this and communicate.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the only things that I would like to add.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Dr. Jaishankar?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Which part, the Beatles part, or the \u2013 (laughter).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Go ahead.\u00a0 I mean, you always come up with interesting inputs, but the two questions that were posed: ASEAN in our context, perhaps India\u2019s own neighbors; and, of course, the whole challenge of offering choices, as Secretary Blinken mentioned.\u00a0 Are we in \u2013 are we able to give countries more agency by offering more choices?\u00a0 Or are we still sending them to the same shop?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 No, I think we do offer more choices.\u00a0 We do collectively offer something different.\u00a0 My own sense over this\u00a0last \u2013 especially after 2017, when I look at individual countries in Southeast Asia, or I\u2019ve just come back from\u00a0actually the\u00a0Pacific Islands \u2013 that countries are interested.\u00a0 Many of them by the way are themselves looking at Indo-Pacific as a changing theater, what \u2013 how should they define their interests, advance their interests.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0my sense is that the interest in the Quad, the enthusiasm for it, the willingness to work with it are growing.\u00a0 But at the end of the day, the Quad is the Quad.\u00a0 The Beatles didn\u2019t take \u2013 they did keep Pete Best out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0the serious point is that when we look at what can we do \u2013 and I\u2019m, again, using maritime security as the easiest example \u2013 that there was a time after 2004 when we all worked together.\u00a0 We understood the value of what today we call the LEMOA, that \u2013 the moment we get logistics access to each other that somewhere our ability to operate\u00a0actually multiplies.\u00a0 And in the initial years, it was difficult.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0when we talk about the changing world, among the changes is we ourselves have changed.\u00a0 Our attitude towards the world has changed.\u00a0 Our understanding and comfort levels with each other has also changed.\u00a0 I do remember a period when, even in our own system \u2013 and I would say frankly in each one of our systems \u2013 because it was something we hadn\u2019t done before, there was that hesitation.\u00a0 And what we are discovering, I mean, really with almost every Quad meeting \u2013 we have this kind of rolling conversation, and it\u2019s not a WhatsApp group.\u00a0 We have this rolling conversation, and people keep throwing up ideas.\u00a0 Some work; some don\u2019t; some are realized more practically, more quickly.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a kind of \u2013 I would say a very easy, practical arrangement that this has come about.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m very uncomfortable with sharp definitions: you do this, you don\u2019t do this, you are for this, you are against this.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s four countries who have decided that by working together that they would naturally advance each other \u2013 our own national interests but also do much good for the world.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0my final question to the panelists as we conclude, you started off responding to the tsunami, a major humanitarian actor at that time.\u00a0 Today, we are facing two or three big crises at this\u00a0particular moment: food, debt, climate.\u00a0 Is Quad doing enough?\u00a0 What should it be doing better?\u00a0 Let me start with Secretary Blinken and then come down the panel and close with you, Dr. Jaishankar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say\u00a0on\u00a0one level we\u2019re never doing enough because the demand is extraordinary.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re living in a time where there is a greater multiplicity of challenges than at any time at least that I\u2019ve been engaged in these issues over 30 years \u2013 more complicated, more interconnected.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0the demand is huge and maybe the demand exceeds even the supply that we can bring.\u00a0 But precisely to the point that Jai was just making, one of the things that we\u2019re, I think, getting pretty good at is adapting quickly and looking quickly at what are the challenges that we really\u00a0have to\u00a0engage and seeing how we can make the Quad a useful vehicle for doing that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn each of the areas you described, we are\u00a0actually working\u00a0together,\u00a0taking action, certainly exchanging ideas; and as I said, in many cases trying to turn to those into concrete initiatives.\u00a0 But the demand is\u00a0great\u00a0and we\u00a0have to\u00a0respond to it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s interesting right now in this very moment, you have Quad countries that are also chairing in this moment the G7, the G20, APEC; and that too gives us an ability to amplify \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0To coordinate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 and as we\u2019re working and coordinating among each other, that also has the benefit of strengthening and making more cohesive the agendas of these other groups.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Minister Hayashi.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, like Tony said, demand is always more than we can supply, I think, as a Quad.\u00a0 But like in case of Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, right after \u2013 that was 24th of February, but in March, we had a summit video conference on Ukraine issues and concurred that we cannot accept this to destroy the international norm such as never change the status quo by force.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0like those case shows that we can always communicate and confirm that we \u2013 from \u2013 we are on the same page for those issues, and then that makes\u00a0more smooth\u00a0carrying out of the \u2013 every\u00a0measures\u00a0we can take.\u00a0 So that\u2019s still working in that way too.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Minister Wong.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0I think one of the greatest strengths of this grouping is by virtue of what we do together, it enhances our capacity for collaboration.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0you \u2013 we could \u2013 obviously there are existing work streams; they are\u00a0practical\u00a0and they are real.\u00a0 As both Tony and Yogi have said, we could always do more in that the need in a world that is increasingly disordered, as your conference explicates, is always greater.\u00a0 But this group does have a capacity to collaborate quite flexibly in addition to what we might have announced and what we\u2019ll try and deliver on.\u00a0 And I think for me as a foreign minister in the smallest of the Quad members, that is extremely useful.\u00a0 It \u2013 and it is a real strength in this collaboration.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Jaishankar, final words.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0\u00a0Look, I obviously concur with my colleagues, and I think the more we do with each other, then more possibilities\u00a0open up.\u00a0 To me right now, there are three big issues that the world needs to address and the Quad needs to address \u2013 and Quad can address, can make a difference: one, more reliable and resilient supply chains; two, the whole \u2013 the digital challenge \u2013 trust and transparency when it comes to technologies, how do we deliver more secure digital existence; and third, connectivity.\u00a0 And I do see these as three big issues which in different ways the Quad needs to do together\u00a0and also\u00a0do with other countries, and I do expect that to be a greater part of our agenda.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0thank you very much for this very frank, friendly conversation this morning.\u00a0 I think that might be the good attribute for Quad: frank, friendly, and flexible.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s what Minister Wong said \u2013 flexible.\u00a0 So frank, friendly, flexible, and fun could be the takeaways from this wonderful conversation.\u00a0 Please join me in applauding the esteemed guests for their contributions.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Leela Palace", "location": "New Delhi, India", "date": "March 2, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good evening, everyone, and apologies for doing this so late.\u00a0 I hope I\u2019m not disrupting people\u2019s dinner plans.\nWe just finished a marathon day at the G20.\u00a0 We came together to focus on solving some of the most consequential problems affecting people of our nations and the world.\u00a0 And let me begin by thanking our host, India, for setting out an ambitious agenda for this meeting, and for its presidency of the G20.\nWe met here in Delhi roughly one year after President Putin launched his war of aggression on Ukraine, and one week after 141 countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly for a resolution that expressed the support for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, in accordance with the United Nations charter and its principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and deplores the human rights and humanitarian consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 Not a single G20 member voted with Russia to oppose that resolution.\nThe chair\u2019s statement by India today reaffirmed the declaration issued by the G20 leaders last year in Bali, which \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cstrongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 Russia and China were the only two countries that made clear that they would not sign on to that text.\u00a0 Eighteen members of the G20 also reaffirmed that it is \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cessential to uphold international law and the multilateral system. \u00a0This includes defending all of the purposes and principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nations and adhering to international humanitarian law,\u201d end quote.\nEvery G20 member \u2013 and virtually every country, period \u2013 continues to bear the cost of Russia\u2019s war of aggression, a war that President Putin could end tomorrow, if he chose to do so.\u00a0 The United States didn\u2019t want this war.\u00a0 We worked hard to prevent it.\u00a0 Like most countries, we want to focus on the fundamental challenges affecting the daily lives of our people. So even as we stand with Ukraine while it defends itself, as any nation would do in that position, we\u2019re also determined to keep working with other countries to deliver solutions to these shared challenges.\nAnd that is exactly what we did today at the G20.\u00a0 These challenges include the unprecedented food security crisis around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to do two things at once \u2013 get food to the hungry now, but also help countries build up their agricultural productivity and resilience so that they\u2019re less vulnerable to future shocks.\u00a0 The United States is leading on both fronts.\u00a0 In addition to funding more than half of the World Food Program\u2019s entire budget, we\u2019ve contributed $13.5 billion to fight hunger over the last year alone, and we\u2019ve committed more than $11 billion over the next five years to boost countries\u2019 resilience and nutrition.\nAfrican countries in particular have told us time and again that, more than aid, what they want is help building the sustainable capacity to feed their own people, and we\u2019re teaming up to do just that.\u00a0 Now the unprecedented levels of food insecurity have been driven primarily by climate, by COVID, and by conflicts, but the crisis has been worsened intentionally by President Putin, who\u2019s weaponized the hunger of people across the globe.\nThanks in large part to UN Secretary-General Guterres and T\u00fcrkiye, the Black Sea Grain Initiative loosened Russia\u2019s stranglehold on Ukraine\u2019s ports, allowing more than 22 million metric tons of grain and other food \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of eight billion loaves of bread \u2013 to leave Ukraine\u2019s ports through global markets.\u00a0 And that\u2019s lowered the price of food for people everywhere.\nToday, Russia is again slow walking the export of food from Ukraine.\u00a0 And with the Black Sea Initiative set to expire on March 18th, Russia has refused to commit to renewing it.\u00a0 The message that countries sent at today\u2019s meeting is clear \u2013 extend the Black Sea Grain Initiative and strengthen it and do that without delay.\nWe also discussed ways to counter the proliferation and trafficking of illicit synthetic drugs, like fentanyl and methamphetamine.\u00a0 In the United States alone, fentanyl killed more than 70,000 people last year.\u00a0 It\u2019s the number-one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49.\u00a0 No country can tackle this problem alone.\u00a0 Disrupting supply chains of precursors, preventing the diversion of legal chemicals to illegal uses, dismantling the transnational criminal groups that foster corruption and profit off of others\u2019 suffering, these are challenges that demand a coordinated global effort.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that, for the first time, G20 ministers called for a strong, international cooperation to counter illicit synthetic drugs, and it\u2019s why I proposed to my fellow ministers today at the G20 that we create a focused line of effort to bring together governments, international and regional organizations, private sectors, and others to tackle this problem.\u00a0 This is a law enforcement and security issue, but it\u2019s fundamentally a public health issue and an increasingly global one.\nToday, we also discussed other challenges, where people around the globe expect our countries to work together, like addressing the climate crisis, helping communities adapt to the inevitable changes it\u2019s causing, strengthening global health security, so that we\u2019re better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future health emergencies.\nI also had the opportunity to speak on the margins of today\u2019s meetings with counterparts from Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and, of course, India.\u00a0 And let me first commend the Indian presidency and Foreign Minister Jaishankar for securing G20 consensus on a broad set of agreements, reflected in the Chair Summary and Outcome Document.\u00a0 That\u2019s a first for G20 foreign ministers.\nNow Minister Jaishankar and I speak so frequently that we just pick up right where we left off, working to elevate our Strategic Partnership in concrete ways, supporting India\u2019s very ambitious G20 agenda, advancing the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, which President Biden and Prime Minister Modi launched at the G20 Summit in Bali last May, engaging our shared commitment to human rights and democratic values.\nTomorrow the foreign minister and I will join our counterparts from Japan and Australia for a meeting of the Quad, where key areas of focus will include protecting the free and unrestricted movement of goods and people across our seas, and boosting cooperation against \u2013 around humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the importance of which has been brought once again into sharp relief by the devastating earthquakes in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria.\nOur engagement with the Quad and the G20 are just a few of the examples of how the United States is weaving together alliances and partnerships to enhance our capacity to deliver for our citizens.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I began this trip in Central Asia, where I joined my counterparts for the C5+1 ministerial.\u00a0 The more of these partnerships that we build, strengthen, and stitch together, the more we\u2019re able to effectively tackle transnational challenges that affect our people, broaden opportunities for Americans, bolster our security, and advance our interests.\nAnd what we\u2019re seeing in Delhi, in Astana, in Tashkent, and beyond is that countries want to partner with the United States, because they see us showing up to solve shared problems, fostering inclusive economic growth, investing in our own competitiveness, and standing up for the international rules of the road that benefit all countries, including the right of every country to choose its own path, free from violence, coercion, and threats.\nLastly, I spoke briefly with Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Lavrov on the margins of our G20 meeting today.\u00a0 I urged Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision, and return to implementing the New START Treaty, which places verifiable limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation.\u00a0 Mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s also what people around the world expect from us, as nuclear powers.\u00a0 I told the foreign minister that, no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship, the United States will always be ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did, even at the height of the Cold War.\nI also raised the wrongful detention of Paul Whelan, as I have on many previous occasions.\u00a0 The United States has put forward a serious proposal.\u00a0 Moscow should accept it.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined to bring Paul and every other American citizen who is unjustly detained around the world home.\u00a0 We won\u2019t rest until we do.\nFinally, I told the foreign minister what I and so many others said last week at the United Nations, and what so many G20 foreign ministers said today: end this war of aggression; engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace.\u00a0 President Zelenskyy has put forward a 10-point plan for a just and durable peace.\u00a0 The United States stand ready to support Ukraine through diplomacy to end the war on this basis.\u00a0 President Putin, however, has demonstrated zero interest in engaging, saying there\u2019s nothing to even talk about unless and until Ukraine accepts \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d while doubling down on his brutalization of Ukraine.\nIndependent of what Russia does, we showed here in Delhi what we will do: deliver results on the problems most affecting our peoples\u2019 lives.\u00a0 Our hosts are committed to doing this over the course of their G20 presidency.\u00a0 For that, and for their leadership and hospitality, I\u2019d like to close by expressing my gratitude to India.\nAnd with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 There\u2019s been rising concerns in recent years about democratic backsliding and human rights issues in India, including the rights of religious minorities, and recently with a move against the news organization the BBC.\u00a0 Did you raise U.S. concerns about these issues with your Indian counterpart today, and are you concerned at all that the situation might worsen heading into next year\u2019s federal election in India?\nAnd secondly, Reuters has reported that the U.S. is speaking with allies about potential sanctions for China if it sends lethal aid to Russia for use in Ukraine, as you\u2019ve warned about in the past.\u00a0 Can you comment at all on those discussions and more broadly about your conversations with counterparts today relating to China\u2019s relationship with Moscow?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, on India, we\u2019re the world\u2019s two biggest democracies.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to an enduring project, both of us \u2013 in our case, as our founders put it, striving to form a more perfect union.\u00a0 That\u2019s part of our national ethos.\u00a0 It\u2019s a project for both of us, India and the United States, in different but also complementary ways.\nSo we have to work together to show that our democracies can actually deliver on our peoples\u2019 needs, and we have to continue to hold ourselves to our core values, including respect for universal human rights, like freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, which makes our democracy stronger.\u00a0 So we regularly engage with our Indian counterparts to encourage the Indian Government to uphold its own commitments to protect human rights, just as we look to ourselves to do the same thing.\u00a0 And in most conversations that I have with my counterpart, Foreign Minister Jaishankar, this is an issue that we discussed, again, as we did today.\nWith regard to China and its support for Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, as we\u2019ve said from the start \u2013 and as President Biden made very clear to President Xi going back to the very beginning of the Russian aggression \u2013 were China to engage in material, lethal support for Russia\u2019s aggression or were to engage in the systematic evasion of sanctions to help Russia, that would be a serious problem for our countries.\nWhen I saw Senior Foreign Policy Official Wang Yi in the margins of the Munich meetings just a week or so ago, I raised with him our very real concern that based on information we have, China is considering supplying lethal military assistance to Russia.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not seen it do that yet, but we\u2019ve seen it considering that proposition.\u00a0 And what I shared with him again was that this would be a serious problem for us in our relationship with China, and I made clear that there would be consequences for engaging in those actions.\nSo I\u2019m not going to detail what they would be, but of course we have sanctions authorities of various kinds that would certainly be one of the things that we and others would look at.\u00a0 And I say others because this concern that China is considering providing lethal military assistance to Russia, this is a shared concern.\u00a0 And many other partners have raised this, and not just raised this with us, but \u2013 it\u2019s my understanding \u2013 have raised it directly with China, including here today in Delhi.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Let\u2019s next go to Maha Siddiqui with NDTV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, even though there\u2019s been an outcome statement and the chair summary, in two successive ministerial meetings we\u2019ve not seen consensus in the form of a joint communique.\u00a0 Do you see that as a set back in the run up to the summit in September, and were you perhaps able to communicate this to your Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov when you met him on the sidelines today?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So I think what we\u2019ve seen here, as I mentioned, is actually a first, which is an outcomes document which reflects shared agreements on a number of issues by all of the foreign ministers represented here today.\u00a0 And in the particular case of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, you have virtually everyone in the G20 signing onto what had already been stated in Bali \u2013 and the two holdouts of course were Russia and China.\u00a0 So I think we see broad consensus across the G20 to work together, to act together, and to make commitments together.\nPrime Minister Modi said today that we should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those that we can.\u00a0 And I think what we saw today is a very good reflection of what the prime minister said \u2013 that is work and agreement on a whole series of lines of effort that the G20 will take to address the issues of greatest concern to people around the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s been the focus of the United States.\nWe want to make sure that, even as we and dozens of countries around the world are standing up for the basic principles at the heart of the UN Charter that are being trampled on by Russia and its aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re at the same time also working every single day to address the concerns of people around the world on the issues that are really affecting their lives \u2013 whether it is food insecurity, whether it\u2019s climate change, whether it\u2019s creating economic opportunity, building global health resilience, et cetera.\u00a0 All of those things we\u2019ve advanced on yet again here at the G20, and my full expectation is that, when the leaders get together, you\u2019ll see further very concrete outcomes that reflect that consensus.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Simon Lewis, Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Just to follow up a little bit on what you just discussed on the G20 today, Prime Minister Modi also mentioned in his comments today that multilateralism is in crisis and talked about the architecture of global governance having failed.\u00a0 I wonder if you agreed with that assessment.\u00a0 And since the G20 failed once again to reach a consensus, putting a slightly finer point on it, can this forum still function with Russia as a member?\u00a0 And just to add on your conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I wondered why was it that you felt that this was the moment to raise those issues with the foreign minister.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, [Simon].\u00a0 First, I\u2019d say that of course Prime Minister Modi is right that there are real challenges to the multilateral system, and those challenges in many ways are coming directly from Russia, which has been violating the very principles that lie at the heart of that system and that the system was designed to uphold.\u00a0 And so that is a challenge.\u00a0 And we see that playing out as well, for example, with the United Nations Security Council, where we have two countries in particular that tend to block the attempted actions of the council to address some of the most urgent global concerns.\nOn the other hand, what we\u2019ve seen, I think, speaking very powerfully and eloquently, is the multilateral system in a variety of ways.\u00a0 Three quarters of it coming together at the UN General Assembly to condemn Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine and to insist on a just and durable peace \u2013 that\u2019s the multilateral system.\u00a0 And we see it here today at the G20 thanks to India\u2019s leadership.\u00a0 As I said just a moment ago, even as we\u2019re focused on making sure that Russia can\u2019t succeed in its aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re equally focused on engaging and solving problems that affect people around the world and that they expect us to be focused on, and we\u2019re doing that through the G20.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that through other multilateral organizations, everything from the G7 and numerous other organizations, including other organizations that are within the UN system.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working together on food security, on energy security, on climate, on global health.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019re delivering results.\nSo all of this is to say that, yes, of course, there are real challenges.\u00a0 The prime minister\u2019s right.\u00a0 But I think we\u2019ve demonstrated, including here today in Delhi, that we can find workarounds.\u00a0 And those workarounds, when we have an outlier, can be found in the outcomes document that hopefully has been distributed to everyone.\u00a0 And again, it demonstrates real consensus and real commitment to work together to tackle issues that are affecting people in their daily lives.\u00a0 And as I said a moment ago, I\u2019m also convinced that when the leaders get together to finalize some of these commitments, you\u2019ll see very strong results.\u00a0 And again, from the perspective of the United States, this is exactly what our people expect of us and what the world expects of us.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Suhasini Haidar,\u00a0The Hindu.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, I want you to just follow up on two of your answers already.\u00a0 You just said that you expect strong results when the leader summit happens at the G20.\u00a0 Just how do you see that happening?\u00a0 How do you see the road ahead for the G20 process given that now the document actually names Russia and China as holding up the consensus as well as not agreeing to the previous G20 statement that they had signed on to?\u00a0 They say, of course, that they have their reasons for doing that, but do you really think a joint statement can be forged in the next few months?\u00a0 Do you think the G20 process itself is in peril?\nAnd if I could do a follow-up on Iain\u2019s question about the restrictions on a number of agencies, including NGOs, I wanted to ask specifically about restrictions on American agencies, apart from climate change NGOs as well as human rights NGOs \u2013 specifically about funding restrictions placed on American agencies earlier like the Ford Foundation but now like the National Endowment for Democracy, the Center for Disease Control, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and others.\u00a0 Is that something that you raised with your Indian counterparts?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So two things.\u00a0 First, you\u2019re \u2013 just to make sure that I understand, you\u2019re referring to restrictions that India would place \u2013 would have placed on these organizations.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken up these questions in the past and we have discussed the importance of NGOs and civil society being able to function effectively and freely wherever they are in our own country and here in India.\u00a0 So to the extent that issues have come up related to NGOs, we\u2019ve discussed them directly with our Indian counterparts.\nAs to projecting to the leaders\u2019 summit, first of all, I don\u2019t want to spoil the show.\u00a0 We\u2019ll let the leaders do their work and show the results.\u00a0 But whether that\u2019s reflected in a joint statement, whether it\u2019s reflected in a chair statement that shows that the overwhelming majority of the G20 countries agreed to work together on a course of action, honestly I don\u2019t think that makes a big difference.\u00a0 If there are going to be an outlier country or two, when you have 18 of the 20 agreed on what needs to be done and committed to working together to do it, again, that is effective multilateralism in action \u2013 effective in actually addressing the world\u2019s concerns.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s what you saw today, and I am absolutely convinced that you\u2019ll see that when the leaders get together one way or another\u2026\nMR

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Hyatt Regency Hotel", "location": "Tashkent, Uzbekistan", "date": "March 1, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Good to see you all.\u00a0 So this is my first visit to Uzbekistan, and let me express first of all my gratitude to the president, to the acting foreign minister, and to all the people I\u2019ve had an opportunity to meet with over the course of this day for what\u2019s been an extraordinarily warm welcome.\nThe partnership between our countries dates back to Uzbekistan\u2019s independence.\u00a0 It\u2019s grown much closer in recent years.\u00a0 Across all of my engagements here, what I come away with is a mutual and enthusiastic commitment to strengthening that partnership even further.\nThat starts with deepening our ties with Uzbekistan\u2019s young people.\u00a0 Over the past five years, the United States has invested $25 million in English-language education, teaming up with the government to train 15,000 Uzbekistani English teachers, providing English-language textbooks to some 10,000 schools.\u00a0 And I had an opportunity to witness some of the work that we\u2019re doing today sitting in on a class with some really extraordinary young people who are only three or four months into English-language education and already sounded incredibly fluent.\nThis is about more than just learning a language.\u00a0 It\u2019s about empowering rising generations of Uzbeks to use their new skills to compete for jobs in markets that demand English proficiency, enabling connections with English speakers across the region and the world, opening doors to exchange programs in the United States, which can create new opportunities for people in both of our countries.\nAnother way that we\u2019re expanding opportunity is by supporting the full implementation of President Mirziyoyev\u2019s reform agenda.\u00a0 The progress that Uzbekistan has made on labor rights shows just how transformative that agenda can be.\u00a0 For 11 years, more than 300 companies banned Uzbek cotton from their products due to the use of child and forced labor.\u00a0 In partnership with national and international labor groups and human rights organizations, the government worked to eradicate this pervasive practice, not only passing a new labor code, but ensuring that it was enforced.\u00a0 Last year, the International Labor Organization determined that Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton sector was free of child and forced labor.\u00a0 This is a historic achievement and it\u2019s a model for countries around the world facing similar challenges.\nIt\u2019s already making a tangible difference in the lives of Uzbek workers, farmers, businesses.\u00a0 Wages are up.\u00a0 Private investment is increasing.\u00a0 People of all ages, including children, are no longer being forced to pick cotton in abusive conditions.\u00a0 We look forward to working with the government to promote similar efforts in other sectors, as well as to fully implement the president\u2019s reform agenda.\u00a0 That includes delivering on commitments to defend religious freedom and press freedom and strengthen protections for vulnerable populations \u2013 issues that I discussed today with the president.\nI also underscored the importance of Uzbekistan fully and transparently investigating allegations of human rights violations committed by law enforcement officers during the July 2020 \u2013 2022 unrest and holding accountable those responsible.\nIn addition to strengthening the U.S.-Uzbekistan relationship, we\u2019re also working together to deepen regional integration.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Saidov and I just came, as you know, from the C5+1 meeting in Astana, where I announced a new commitment to work with Congress to provide an additional $25 million to catalyze economic growth in Central Asia.\u00a0 That brings our total investment in the region since our meeting on the margins of the UN General Assembly last September to more than $66 million.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on diversifying trade routes, fostering greater private investment, providing job training.\nAnd let me emphasize that so much of the work that we\u2019re doing in these \u2013 in these programs and with the investments we\u2019re making from our government really serve as a catalyst for increasing private sector investment.\u00a0 I think the opportunities that the private sector is already engaged in are significant and everything I\u2019m seeing suggests that there is growing enthusiasm, interest, focus on investing here and investing in other countries in Central Asia.\nIt\u2019s also how we provide the support that matters.\u00a0 The United States is making these and other investments in Central Asia openly, transparently, in a way that empowers people across the region to shape their own future, and that meets high labor, human rights, environmental standards.\u00a0 That\u2019s how investment should work.\nWe\u2019ll have a chance to build on these efforts next month in Samarkand when the United States sends a high-level delegation from across our government to a meeting of the U.S.-Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework.\nSo the bottom line is this.\u00a0 A more connected, a more cooperative Central Asia will be better able to determine its own future and deliver for its people\u2019s needs.\u00a0 The United States is committed to supporting that vision.\u00a0 One of the things that we\u2019ve learned over many, many years is that the investments that we make in these partnerships benefit our partners, but they also benefit us, creating potentially new markets for our own products, our own investments, creating new opportunities to partner with countries in meeting global challenges where Central Asia can make a real difference, and just developing new friendships that benefit our country across so many different aspects of our society in many different ways.\nAnd that\u2019s fundamentally why I\u2019ve come here, and I want to emphasize that this is not just a matter of one visit; it\u2019s the work that we\u2019re doing day in, day out, including through our embassies, through our engagement with the private sector, through engagements with civil society and other groups.\u00a0 And we\u2019re in it for the long haul.\nIn our meetings today, I also had a chance to thank the government for its generous aid to the people of Afghanistan, from electricity to emergency humanitarian assistance, especially to women and girls.\u00a0 And we applaud Uzbekistan for repatriating more than 400 family members of terrorist foreign fighters from Syria and Iraq whose reintegration the United States will continue to support.\nFinally, this visit to the region comes against the backdrop of the one-year anniversary of Putin\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 This continues to be a cause for hardship for people around the world, including here in Central Asia.\u00a0 The second- and third-order consequences of this aggression continue to be felt.\u00a0 Indeed, few regions have been more acutely affected than Central Asia, including Uzbekistan, where people continue to shoulder increased food and energy prices.\u00a0 As always, this is hitting the most vulnerable the hardest.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the United States has provided more than $16 million in emergency food aid to this region since President Putin launched his aggression against Ukraine.\nThis hardship makes Uzbekistan\u2019s generosity even more remarkable.\u00a0 The government, the people of Uzbekistan have stepped up to provide food and medical assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0 They continue to host tens of thousands of Russian citizens who fled their country after President Putin launched his war.\nRussia\u2019s invasion has also fostered deep concern across the region.\u00a0 After all, if a powerful country is willing to try to erase the borders of a sovereign neighbor by force, what\u2019s to stop it from doing the same to others?\u00a0 Countries across Central Asia understand this.\u00a0 So does the United States, and so do partners and allies around the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve been committed and remain committed to standing for the sovereignty, the territorial integrity, the independence not only of Ukraine, but for countries across Central Asia and, indeed, around the world.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll go to our first question from Ed Wong of\u00a0The New York Times.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Hey, Ed.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 He\u2019ll survive without the microphone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to follow up on your comments on the Ukraine war.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mm-hmm.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 First, you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re somewhat skeptical of Moscow\u2019s talk of possible negotiations, and you say that the main aim of the U.S. Government right now and European allies is to help Ukraine on the battlefield, yet many of the non-aligned or neutral countries that you\u2019re meeting with this week here and also at the G20 say that they would like to see peace talks open sometime soon, and I expect that pressure will increase.\u00a0 How do you address that?\u00a0 And some have even favorably looked at China\u2019s talking points on that, and I know you\u2019re skeptical of that.\nSecond, at the G20, Russia and China will both be sending their foreign ministers.\u00a0 Do you plan to talk to them one on one or talk to them in a group setting, and what do you plan to say to them about the Ukraine war?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Second \u2013 second part of the question first.\u00a0 No plans to see either at the G20, although I suspect that we\u2019ll certainly be in group sessions of one kind or another together.\nSo the first thing to say is this:\u00a0 No one wants peace more urgently than the people of Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019re the victims every single day of Russia\u2019s aggression, and if they could have peace yesterday, they\u2019d take it and so would we and so would countries around the world who are suffering, as I said, from the second- and third-order effects of Putin\u2019s aggression.\nNow, we all know the simple truth that the war could end tomorrow \u2013 it could end today \u2013 if President Putin so decided.\u00a0 He started it; he can stop it.\u00a0 It\u2019s, on one level, as simple as that.\u00a0 And we should never lose sight of that fact.\u00a0 No one should lose sight of the fact that we have an aggressor and we have a victim, and to have any kind of equivalence between the two, including suggesting who is more committed to peace, I think, is profoundly wrong.\nSecond, if Russia, President Putin, were genuinely prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy necessary to end the aggression, of course we\u2019d be the first to work on that and to engage.\u00a0 But there is zero evidence of that.\u00a0 To the contrary, the evidence is all in the other direction.\u00a0 Just listen to President Putin\u2019s own words.\u00a0 To cite just one example, he said recently, and publicly, that unless and until Ukraine recognizes what he called \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d there\u2019s nothing to even talk about.\u00a0 In other words, unless and until Ukraine accepts the fact that Russia has seized their territory and gets to keep it, they won\u2019t even talk.\u00a0 That\u2019s obviously a nonstarter and it should be a nonstarter not just for Ukraine or for us, but for countries around the world.\u00a0 And I think that certainly resonates here in this region, where every single Central Asian country feels very strongly about their territorial integrity, their sovereignty, their independence \u2013 all of which, of course, were very, very hard-won.\nSo the real \u2013 the real question is whether Russia will get to a point where it is genuinely prepared to end its aggression and to do so in a way that is consistent with the United Nations Charter and these very principles.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I think what you \u2013 what you hear around the world, and you saw reflected in the resolution that was passed at the UN General Assembly by 141 countries, is the strong desire for peace, but for a just and durable peace, just in that it\u2019s consistent with the principles of the UN Charter in terms of territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence, and durable, as I\u2019ve said before, so that we don\u2019t leave things in a place where Russia gets to simply repeat this exercise a year or two years or three years later \u2013 it rests, it rearms, and it reattacks.\u00a0 So I think that\u2019s what we need to be focused on.\nIn terms of the proposal that China put forth, as I\u2019ve said and as others in the government have said, look, there are some positive elements there, including things that China itself has said several times in the past \u2013 very similar to elements that are in Ukraine\u2019s own proposal that President Zelenskyy put out some time ago.\u00a0 But if China was genuinely serious about this, the very first principle it put out \u2013 sovereignty \u2013 it would have been spending all of the last year working in support of the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s full sovereignty.\u00a0 And of course it\u2019s been doing the opposite in terms of its own efforts to advance Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war, blocking and tackling for Russia in international organizations, and, as we\u2019ve made clear recently, now contemplating the provision of lethal military assistance to Russia for its aggression against Ukraine.\nSo China can\u2019t have it both ways.\u00a0 It can\u2019t be putting itself out as a force for peace in public while it, one way or another, continues to fuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Davlat Umarov from Gazeta.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Gazeta\u2019s website.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, during your visit in \u2013 oh, I\u2019m really sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, during your visit in Kazakhstan you mentioned that U.S. is trying to demonstrate its commitments to Central Asian countries as a steadfast partner.\u00a0 You announced even today about additional $25 million to the initiative and also as well as licensing the companies that are working with sanctioned Russian companies.\u00a0 In that regard, I\u2019d like to ask:\u00a0 What are the expectations of the United States from countries of the region, and in particular from Uzbekistan, to be ensured in their commitment as reliable partners, keeping in mind the ongoing war in Ukraine and close ties of the region with Russia and China?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Well, first, what we have been trying to demonstrate throughout this visit, but again, more than that, every single day in our engagement with countries throughout the region \u2013 and by the way, the meeting that we had in Kazakhstan of the C5+1, I think that\u2019s the fourth meeting that I\u2019ve participated in with my colleagues \u2013 but every single day we\u2019re engaged to build the strongest possible partnerships with all of the Central Asian countries.\u00a0 And it starts with our enduring support for their sovereignty, for their independence, for their territorial integrity, and our determination that each be able to determine their own futures consistent with those principles.\nWhat I think we also know very well is that Central Asia is in a complicated part of the world with longstanding relationships with different countries based on history, based on geography, and that\u2019s something that we well understand.\u00a0 But I think we also see each of these countries looking to multiply and deepen their relationships and partnerships with other countries around the world.\u00a0 And in that, the United States wants to be a steadfast partner and a partner that works with them to create new opportunities for people in this region and new opportunities for us to work together.\nNow, as I said earlier, we\u2019re also very well aware of the consequences that the Russian aggression against Ukraine has had for people in Central Asia, and I\u2019d say two things about that.\u00a0 First, the immediate consequences have been, in one way or another, a rise in energy and in food prices, and then, more generally, inflation.\nNow, there\u2019s a simple reason for that.\u00a0 Putin has tried to weaponize energy in his effort to subjugate Ukraine, and in weaponizing energy and trying to hold it back, deny it from different places \u2013 that has contributed to rising prices.\u00a0 We\u2019ve worked very hard to make sure that there was enough energy on world markets to keep prices down.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come directly to the assistance of the \u2013 of countries that were directly targeted by Putin using the energy weapon, but these effects, again, have been felt here in Central Asia as well, and we\u2019re working to mitigate them.\nFood \u2013 Putin also weaponized food.\u00a0 He blocked the breadbasket of the world, Ukraine, from exporting a lot of its grain and food products.\u00a0 And it was only because of the very good work by the United Nations and T\u00fcrkiye that we were able to establish this Black Sea grain corridor that allowed food once again to \u2013 grain and other products to come out of Ukraine and to reach world markets.\u00a0 The majority of that is going to countries in the developing world and in the Global South, but even countries that aren\u2019t directly receiving it are benefiting from the fact that with more Ukrainian food products on the market, the more prices are held in check and are lower.\nSecond part of the equation is this: sanctions, export controls that are being imposed by dozens of countries \u2013 not just the United States \u2013 on Russia.\u00a0 And again, to step back \u2013 it\u2019s not as if we woke up one day and said, oh, let\u2019s impose sanctions and export controls on Russia.\u00a0 The reason for those sanctions and export controls is because of the Russian aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 And countries came together both to support Ukraine in defending itself from the Russian aggression, but also to try to impose costs and pressure on Russia to get it to change its conduct, to stop the aggression, and to make it more difficult for Russia to continue that aggression.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what this is all about.\nBut we\u2019re looking at this very closely.\u00a0 We appreciate the work that countries have done to help prevent the evasion of sanctions, because Russia is looking for ways to nonetheless acquire products and otherwise engage in sanctioned activity.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working closely with governments throughout the region, helping them understand exactly what the sanctions require and, as necessary, looking to see what we can do to mitigate the negative effects that they\u2019re feeling.\u00a0 And this includes, in some cases, issuing licenses for trade where that makes sense, and we\u2019ve been engaged in that \u2013 in that process as well.\nFinally \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry for going on so long, but it\u2019s important \u2013 a big part of the work that we\u2019re doing here is to help the region diversify trade relationships, to build new partnerships and relationships with other countries, including with the United States, so they\u2019re not dependent on any one country or any one source for trade and investment, and at the same time to increase trade and investment within Central Asia itself.\u00a0 There\u2019s a very strong potential market here, and the more connectivity we have among the countries of Central Asia, the more collaboration we have, the stronger that market\u2019s going to be, the more investment it\u2019s going to attract from outside of Central Asia.\nSo we\u2019re working on all of that.\u00a0 And as I noted yesterday and again today, we\u2019ve made some significant new investments to try to do that \u2013 to increase and strengthen the climate, the environment for private sector investment, to strengthen connectivity among these countries, and to help them diversify their trade and investment relationships.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Next we\u2019ll go to Barbara Usher with the BBC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I wanted to follow up on that, what you\u2019ve just been talking about, with a different angle.\u00a0 You say that you\u2019re not asking Central Asian countries to choose between the U.S. and Russia or between the U.S. and China, but you are asking them to divert trade routes away from Russia and China.\u00a0 So isn\u2019t this a new version of the Great Game, which has historical resonance here, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware?\nAnd if I might add briefly, you spoke quite positively about the reforms of the president.\u00a0 Did you also perhaps advise him against trying to change the constitution so that he can extend his term?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Barbara.\u00a0 I think what many countries have recognized, both in Central Asia and beyond, for a variety of reasons in recent years, is that there is tremendous benefit in having a multiplicity of partners when it comes to \u2013 when it comes to trade, when it comes to investment, when it comes to supply chains of one kind or another.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen what disruptions in any one partnership and connection can do, and those disruptions might come from anything from conflict to COVID to climate change.\nSo this experience, I think, is causing countries to look very hard at where they may have dependencies, and it\u2019s in their interest, I think, to find ways to diversify, multiply, expand their relationships, their partnerships, including when it comes to trade and investment.\u00a0 And of course that doesn\u2019t \u2013 that doesn\u2019t need to be something that\u2019s zero-sum.\u00a0 These things can be additive, and countries will benefit tremendously from the increased investment that they\u2019re getting, the increased opportunity that that\u2019s creating.\nSo that\u2019s the recognition that we\u2019re seeing and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to support, to help, and to be a strong partner in helping to achieve.\u00a0 And it really runs the spectrum of things that we\u2019re engaged in with countries here.\u00a0 I mentioned a little while ago the work we\u2019re doing here in Uzbekistan on English-language training.\u00a0 It so happens that at this moment in history \u2013 it was different before; I\u2019m sure at some point in the future it\u2019ll be different \u2013 but right now English happens to be the primary currency for international engagement, whether that\u2019s for businesses, whether that\u2019s for governments and diplomacy, whether that\u2019s for people-to-people connections, whether that\u2019s for the internet.\nAnd so it\u2019s a profound advantage for countries and in some ways even a necessity to build up the proficiency, especially among young people, in the English language, and that\u2019s going to make people much more able to be competitive in a global economic environment, a global world in which, as I said, English is right now the main connective tissue.\u00a0 So that\u2019s just one way in which we\u2019re helping to put countries in a position where they can very effectively diversify their contacts, their connections, their work with other countries.\nWhen it comes to the reform agenda that the president has put forward here, we talked about that at some length today during our meeting.\u00a0 We applauded the steps that had been taken.\u00a0 I noted as well the importance not only of having the strong vision but of fully implementing it, and of course that remains an important work in progress.\u00a0 We talked about the importance of media freedom, having a strong space for civil society, and we did discuss briefly as well the constitutional reform process.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Nikita Makarenko.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Blinken, we feel an enormous pressure from Russian propaganda here, and it really shapes minds of our people, so we, our local media, try to struggle with it.\u00a0 Is there any plans the United States going to help us in this struggle?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, thank you.\u00a0 Well, I think it only underscores the importance of having a strong, vibrant, and well-resourced local media.\u00a0 And one of the things that we discussed today, including with the president, was the importance of that, the need for that in part to be able to deal with misinformation coming from Russia or from any other source.\u00a0 So we have programs, as you know, to support independent media but also in our own engagements with other governments urging them to do what\u2019s necessary to create the right environment in which media can grow, can flourish, and can bring a diversity of voices and a diversity of views to the public.\nAnd with that information, let people make up their minds about what\u2019s right and wrong, what\u2019s good policy and what\u2019s bad policy, what\u2019s an appropriate direction or not.\u00a0 But it\u2019s certainly true that Russia has built up a very strong and long-enduring propaganda and misinformation system that is felt here and is felt in other parts of the world.\u00a0 And the best answer to that, of course, is the strongest possible environment for genuinely free, independent, open media to bring the facts to people and let them make up their minds.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0One more question.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-an-english-language-learning-event/",
