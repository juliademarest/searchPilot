You could have picked another place \u2013 another time and place for us to have this occasion, but you picked Port Moresby, you picked our nation\u2019s capital, and you picked Papua New Guinea \u2013 and we sincerely appreciate you very much for this kind gesture.\nToday, in our bilateral meeting, you were witness to the signing of our Defense Cooperation Agreement.\u00a0 That was a culmination of many years and months of engagement with Pentagon, engagement with Washington, engagement with U.S. officials and our team.\u00a0 I just want to stress this point: It wasn\u2019t shoved down our throat.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t forced upon us; it was a mutual agreement.\u00a0 A conversation was held expressly on the need for Papua New Guinea to have our defence force assisted, supported, stepped up.\nPapua New Guineans, you must know you have domestic security issue, as well as closer to home security issues.\u00a0 We cannot forever remain in (inaudible) in as far as our defence force is concerned.\u00a0 Our defence force needs to be stepped up and supported.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had similar defense cooperation agreement with Australia, Indonesia, and other nations we enjoy strong long-term partnerships with.\u00a0 We have every right also, in the same vein, to engage in a straight partnership with United States of America, where we have had no problem with similar defense force cooperation agreements \u2013 have been foundation of our relationship.\nAnd today, the defense force cooperation comes with a backdrop of elevating what was originally the umbrella status of force agreement that kept us together.\u00a0 We are now elevating that to a specific relationship exclusive for U.S.A.-PNG military cooperations and military engagements and partnership.\u00a0 There is nothing for us to be fearful about.\u00a0 I just want to needless repeat but for emphasis because of a lot of misconception and confusion out there in the public.\u00a0 This agreement is subsidiary to a treaty \u2013 it\u2019s below the treaty level.\u00a0 This agreement in no way breaks or encroaches into our country\u2019s legislations, (inaudible) the fundamental constitution of our country or every other (inaudible) legislations we have.\nThis agreement is congruent to the 1975 Visiting Forces Act, the 1975 Visiting Forces Act.\u00a0 James Marape was still a child in 1975, when the fathers of this nation saw it important to have an act called the Visiting Forces Act to ensure we\u2019re engaged in partnership with nations of similarities, nations where we have common bond, where exchanges can be made possible.\nAnd so, I just want to inform the educated out there, especially those of you who want to pick a political bone with me \u2013 let\u2019s not confuse everyone.\u00a0 We are a nation of rule of law.\u00a0 If you feel that this agreement encroaches into one iota of our constitutional law of the land, make reference to the supreme court.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure the court will find \u2013 I\u2019m sure the court will find that what we have done is within the gambit of the constitution of our country and all subsidiary legislations.\u00a0 It is meant to ensure that our country\u2019s domestic as well as sovereign security is secured, beefed up, bumped up, and prepared for any challenges \u2013 not just military challenges, but more importantly, challenges of disaster, challenges of social issues, and every other challenge we go through, including securing our country to be a country known to have secured the security issue and prepared for investments that we are trying to attract into our country.\nMy conversation with India is not just purely on politics; my conversation with U.S.A. is not purely on politics.\u00a0 But more importantly, deep inside \u2013 and Secretary Blinken knows this; those who worked with us on this one knows this \u2013 we want American-based investors to come to our country.\u00a0 We want Indian-based investors to come into our country.\u00a0 We are looking at diversifying our economic base, and growing it \u2013 and make it stronger so that government can in turn look after our citizens.\u00a0 That is foundationally not so today because of the weak security structure we have in our country.\u00a0 Strengthening our defense force, strengthening our police, strengthening our court system, ensuring that our democracy is secure is a key foundational interest of the state to make sure our country is secure.\nIt is in this vein that we are in partnership with the biggest democracy on the face of Planet Earth, and I just want to encourage our people, please don\u2019t be \u2013 don\u2019t think that something suspicious of funny is behind this.\u00a0 It was a work over many years that has culminated over \u2013 into a six month of robust conversation between Port Moresby and Washington, (inaudible) and Washington, our own military head official or former head official as well as Pentagon and Washington officials.\u00a0 Today is a result of many weeks, months, and years of work.\nAnd I will be making available to the public, as we complete due process of key documents to be made known to public in the very near future \u2013 possibly in days, this agreement will be made public to everyone for all of us to understand.\u00a0 The United States of America is always transparent about matters that is of importance to the public.\u00a0 They too, I would believe \u2013 and I don\u2019t like to speak for Secretary Blinken, but they too will make known to public, their own country, they will report \u2013 they have a duty to report back to their country the agreement that we\u2019ve signed.\u00a0 And for matters of transparency for the people and citizens of Papua New Guinea, people and citizens of U.S.A. will know exactly what we\u2019ve signed.\nI just want to conclude by saying what we\u2019ve signed does not encroach \u2013 or affect, rather \u2013 Papua New Guinea\u2019s own relationships we have with other nations we trade with, or we have relationships with, be it military or government-to-government relations.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 It does not affect \u2013 whether in China or Australia or United Kingdom or Japan or India or any other nation, for that matter \u2013 this agreement does not in one way, shape, and form stop Papua New Guinea from continuing on doing business with those we do business with.\u00a0 So, I just want to inform everyone to have a bit of understanding that your government is in the business of securing your future and your economic future as we (inaudible) on these matters.\nOther matters we discussed with Secretary Blinken on behalf of President Biden, (inaudible) ways continuing issue on the climate change, our energy and security, our (inaudible) greater regional security in the region.\u00a0 You would have been informed earlier that we did sign a subsequent agreement called a (inaudible) agreement that secures PNG\u2019s maritime borders and our resources found in our seas.\u00a0 That sort of conversation was also held in the Pacific Island Leaders Meeting, the concern of care for our resources and the security of our seas; all conversation made \u2013 Secretary Blinken was very generous with his time and ears.\u00a0 He sat through, listened to our conversations (inaudible), but a substantial part of Pacific Island and U.S.A. engagements were put to a work-in-progress mode.\u00a0 And we will arrive in Washington in September of this year, hopefully for substantial progress where United States is making a greater commitment to respond to some of the key development challenges we face in the region, including (inaudible) issues and the other insecurity issues that (inaudible).\nOn this note, Secretary Blinken, I have not stolen your time now.\u00a0 There is now space for you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I just have (inaudible) the discussions that we held and (inaudible).\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a few questions (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Prime Minister, thank you so much.\u00a0 And I fully endorse everything you said.\u00a0 And you can speak for me, because you do it so eloquently.\u00a0 And I can only fully agree with everything that you said.\u00a0 But thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the incredibly warm reception, and thank you for the incredibly productive day \u2013 both on a bilateral basis between the United States and Papua New Guinea, but also with all of our regional partners \u2013 discussing and making progress on issues that are critical to our shared future.\nThere is an old Hawaiian saying that translates loosely to \u201cunited to move forward.\u201d\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s the spirit in which we all came together today as Pacific nations.\u00a0 Our partnership is crucial to how we deliver for our people, how we meet their needs and aspirations, and advance our common vision for the region \u2013 one that is free and open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.\u00a0 Or, as your 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent puts it, a \u201cresilient Pacific region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity that ensures all Pacific peoples can lead free, healthy, and productive lives.\u201d\u00a0 It is a powerful, positive ambition that we share.\nAt this forum we\u2019ve built on momentum from the first U.S.-Pacific Island Summit last fall.\u00a0 There in Washington, President Biden pledged to open a new era in our partnership \u2013 one of mutual respect, trust, and benefit.\u00a0 As I had an opportunity to tell Pacific leaders at our meeting today, over the past year the United States has been listening to you, engaging with your governments, working to deliver on our summit announcements that align with your broader vision.\u00a0 And together, we\u2019ve made considerable, tangible progress on many of the commitments in a short period of time.\u00a0 Together, we are super-charging our climate action.\nToday, I announced that the United States will support the PIF in standing up the new Pacific Resilience Facility.\u00a0 This Pacific-owned, Pacific-led solution will drive investment into climate adaptation and resilience in front-line communities.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re boosting our bilateral security relationship to ensure that the Blue Pacific remains a place of peace and prosperity.\nThe prime minister and I just signed, as he mentioned, two agreements which will boost cooperation between Papua New Guinea Defence Forces and the U.S. Coast Guard to help build up the Defence Forces\u2019 capacity, and help combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\nTogether, we\u2019re driving progress to expand trade, investment, and business initiatives that can lift up all communities.\u00a0 In Papua New Guinea specifically, we\u2019re working with Congress to provide over $45 million in new programming on sustainable and inclusive development, public health, and energy security.\u00a0 And later this year the Department of Commerce will lead a first-ever U.S. business delegation to Pacific Island countries to explore opportunities in energy, in transportation, in health care, tourism, and telecommunications.\nTogether, we\u2019re modernizing and enhancing the Compacts of Free Association.\u00a0 These are the bedrock of U.S. engagement in the Pacific.\u00a0 We just signed our agreement with Palau today, in this room.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful to President Whipps for his partnership.\u00a0 Tomorrow, we\u2019ll sign our agreement with the Federated States of Micronesia.\u00a0 And I look forward to finishing negotiations with the Republic of the Marshall Islands soon, to ensure that this arrangement reflects the realities and the challenges of our time.\u00a0 As part of these agreements, the United States will commit $7.1 billion to the Freely Associated States over the next 20 years.\nTogether, we\u2019re also strengthening ties between our peoples.\u00a0 We are very excited to announce the return of the Peace Corps to the Pacific Islands, and that we\u2019re launching new educational exchanges to share skills and expertise, and forge enduring connections that will benefit our communities.\nSo, we\u2019ve got a lot to work on, a lot to accomplish together.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re expanding our diplomatic presence in the region, delivering on our commitments last year.\u00a0 We\u2019ve opened two new embassies, one on the Solomon Islands, the other just two weeks ago in Tonga.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working to do the same in Vanuatu and Kiribati by the end of this year.\nWe\u2019ve named our first ever envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, Ambassador Frankie Reed, who will continue to engage throughout the region to strengthen our partnerships.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to strive to meet the Pacific where it is, (inaudible) Pacific leaders and through the Pacific Islands Forum.\u00a0 We\u2019ll encourage other partners to do the same, including through the Partners in the Blue Pacific, to support the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\u00a0 And in that regard, we very much welcome India\u2019s engagement with countries in the region.\u00a0 That, too, is a very positive development for the future that we all want.\nSo Prime Minister, to you, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for this partnership at a critical time for the region that we share.\u00a0 And thank you for the work that we\u2019re doing every day to build it, to make it stronger, to deliver on our shared vision.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Any questions?\u00a0 We\u2019ll just take two or three questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We will first go to Gorethy Kenneth from\u00a0The\u00a0Post-Courier.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Prime Minister, (inaudible), the line credit \u2013 the line of credit program with India and Papua New Guinea (inaudible).\u00a0 Was it \u2013 will it be extended or was it extended?\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0The prime minister took note of this fact, and he is taking it back to his country.\u00a0 We \u2013 for us, as a country, it\u2019s important we also diversify our source of support.\u00a0 India has opened up that facility \u2013 those facilities.\u00a0 We\u2019ve asked them to go back and maintain the facility and expressed the (inaudible) invite to procure a source.\u00a0 So, he said he\u2019ll take back to his officials.\u00a0 We don\u2019t run other forms of government.\u00a0 We run democratic form of government (inaudible) our systems to go back to (inaudible) said he would look at (inaudible).\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Jack Moore from AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to speak to us.\u00a0 My question is for you, Secretary.\u00a0 Given the inroads that China has made in the Pacific in places such as the Solomon Islands, how important was it for Washington to secure the deals today with Papua New Guinea and renew with Palau to counter Beijing\u2019s rise and influence in the region?\u00a0 And how satisfied are you with the outcome?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, I\u2019d say a few things.\u00a0 First, the agreements that we reached, the work that we\u2019re doing, is not about any other country.\u00a0 It\u2019s about our relationship with the Pacific Islands and the shared vision that we have for this region.\nAnd as you heard the prime minister say, while we signed the Defense Cooperation Agreement today, the ship (inaudible) agreement \u2013 these are very important in helping to strengthen Papua New Guinea\u2019s capacity.\u00a0 We\u2019re working across the board on issues of direct concern to people of Papua New Guinea and throughout the region, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s investment, whether it\u2019s building up healthcare systems.\u00a0 But this is grounded in \u2013 I think what\u2019s fair to say is a shared vision that we have for a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nAnd we talk about that a lot.\u00a0 And I just want to be clear about what we mean by that when we\u2019re talking about a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We need a region where countries are free to choose their own path and their own partners, where problems will be dealt openly, transparently. \u00a0Goals will be reached in a transparent way, (inaudible) fairly, and goods, ideas, and people can float freely and lawfully across the land, the seas, the skies, and in cyberspace.\u00a0 That\u2019s the vision that we have, as well as making sure that the citizens in our countries have the opportunity to reach their full potential, providing the support necessary to do that.\nBut this vision doesn\u2019t exclude anyone.\u00a0 We welcome contributions by other countries, including the PRC \u2013 the regional development \u2013 so long as they adhere to the highest standards, including in areas like transparency and the rule of law.\u00a0 If all of us are going to be engaged in a region as partners \u2013 well, if there\u2019s going to be a race, let it be a race to the top.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re all about, and we want to simply see anyone who\u2019s engaged engage in a way that advances the shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nBut as I said, the focus that we have is on building and strengthening these partnerships on their own terms, not with regard to any other country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Take a final question from Tim Swanston from ABC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m happy just to talk loudly if you can hear me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I appreciate what you\u2019re saying that this isn\u2019t about any other countries, but ultimately, China has made very serious inroads with respect to the defense and security arrangement here in the Pacific.\u00a0 Now that the Defense Cooperation Agreement is being signed, under what kind of timeframe would you like to see U.S. military or U.S. assets placed in PNG?\u00a0 And what bases are you looking at of importance to the island states?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0What we\u2019re focused on is what our partners here are working and trying to achieve in strengthening their capacity.\u00a0 As you heard the prime minister say, there\u2019s a focus on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief.\u00a0 That\u2019s the main import of what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But the main point is that, as you heard the prime minister say, we\u2019ve had this basic arrangement going back to 1975.\u00a0 So, this is simply updating and modernizing what has been a longstanding agreement between our countries just to make sure that we can work together as effectively as possible.\nAnd as I said in the first instance, we want to make sure that we\u2019re being responsive to some of the challenges that the PNG faces.\u00a0 There are other challenges that I mentioned that \u2013 where these agreements will be very helpful \u2013 for example, the issue of illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing.\u00a0 This is something that is having a devasting impact on livelihoods in the Pacific Islands, as well as the ecosystem that is so vital to nourishing these economies.\u00a0 So, this could \u2013 I think the work that we\u2019re doing with PNG can be of a real assistance there.\nYou heard the prime minister talk about other concerns with regard, for example, to (inaudible), where again these agreements will help.\u00a0 But that\u2019s the immediate focus of what we\u2019re looking to do, but it\u2019s all on the basis of simply bringing up to date and modernizing agreements that have been there for a long, long time.\u00a0 And I would emphasize, again, something the prime minister said: these are being done in a fully transparent way, respectful of PNG\u2019s institutions, of its sovereignty.\u00a0 These are agreements that we reach together, not agreements that anyone is imposing on anyone else, and they take away no freedom of action from the PNG.\u00a0 And as the Prime Minister said, we\u2019ll be making these publicly available \u2013 as we always do, as we complete the process of finalizing the agreements in our respective countries.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary, if I could just add one or two more lines \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 the presence of China, let me inform everyone, China is (inaudible) and people have no interest whatsoever with what they do in other nations.\u00a0 We have a healthy relationship with Chinese Government, and they are important and big trading partner, but we are moving into finalizing this agreement.\u00a0 We did not need to tell anyone else what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But they have given assurance to us in our conversations that we have every right to engage with U.S.A. as much as we have with them.\nAnd so, I just want to inform Papua New Guineans in the first instance and the media, we\u2019re trying to play out from this issue of China versus U.S.A.\u00a0 The Secretary of State correctly has stated this has nothing to do with the bigger issues, the headline issues that keep on going off every now and then.\u00a0 Papua New Guinea invited U.S.A. to move beyond just an ordinary agreement to a specifically defense-focused agreement.\u00a0 In my view, that strengthens our Defence Force, and they will come in at the invitation of our Defence Force, and not at their own will.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that must be clear that everyone in the Pacific \u2013 upon our invitation, they come in.\nThat is subsequently a question on when that needs to be done that dwarfs other agreements and other processes.\u00a0 This is just a framework agreement that now (inaudible) this element of specific relationship with U.S.A. like we\u2019ve never had before.\u00a0 And I want to assure Papua New Guinea\u2019s \u2013 particularly with China (inaudible) to do with our internal security issue to ensure that our military is now responsive to the challenges of 21st century, living in this part of Planet Earth.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Prime Minister.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0All right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And let me just say one last thing if I could.\u00a0 The ocean that we share is called the Pacific.\u00a0 And our ambition is for it to remain exactly that: an ocean of peace.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do together.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0All right.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone (inaudible).\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "APEC Haus", "location": "Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea", "date": "May 22, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, everyone.\u00a0 And I have to say I\u2019m very tempted to say, \u201cWhat the prime minister said,\u201d and leave it at that because I could not and cannot say it more eloquently than he just has.\u00a0 But let me first say good afternoon to everyone.\u00a0 It is truly wonderful to be here in Papua New Guinea, to be joining the prime minister, to be joining the defense ministers, to be joining the entire team.\nMr. Prime Minister, we\u2019ve spent a good bit of time together, including a visit to the Oval Office with President Biden during the Pacific Island Summit last year.\u00a0 And you heard this from the President himself during your call a few days ago, but he asked me again to reiterate to you, to all of our friends in Papua New Guinea, his regrets for being unable to be here today.\u00a0 The President values deeply our nations\u2019 longstanding partnership and believes our cooperation is critical to addressing a series of shared challenges that are facing our people.\u00a0 And he\u2019s eager to welcome you, to welcome other Pacific Island Forum leaders, back to Washington for a second summit later this year.\nWe are deeply invested in the Indo-Pacific because our planet\u2019s future is being written here.\u00a0 Papua New Guinea is playing a critical role in shaping that future.\u00a0 That leadership is on display this week as you\u2019ve welcomed 16 delegations for the U.S.-Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting to make progress on priorities that we\u2019ve established together, from tackling the climate crisis to improving public health to enhancing disaster preparedness and response.\u00a0 And the United States is proud to partner with Papua New Guinea on these same priorities because they\u2019re our priorities too.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together as regional security partners.\u00a0 We\u2019re boosting our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific though the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.\nWe\u2019re driving economic opportunity through partnerships between our businesses, which are bringing tens of billions in new investment to Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 And we are teaming up to bring preventative, lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment to people here in Papua New Guinea so that they can continue to lead healthy and productive lives.\nSimply put, we are committed to growing all aspects of our relationship.\u00a0 And to that end, today, as you\u2019ve from the prime minister, we\u2019re signing two agreements on defense and on maritime cooperation.\nThe Defense Cooperation Agreement, drafted by Papua New Guinea and the United States as equal and sovereign partners, will enhance the PNG\u2019s Defence Force\u2019s capability to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, including through providing medical care and temporary shelter to those who are affected by crises.\u00a0 The agreement will also make it easy for PNG and U.S. forces to train together in new ways and in more places as part of our joint effort to uphold peace and security across the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We will be fully transparent of the details of the agreement, which contains elements from our previous agreement and updates to reflect our shared commitment to deepen cooperation on issues that matter most to people here as well as in the United States.\nAnd as you also heard from the prime minister, the Shiprider Agreement will allow the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and the U.S. Coast Guard to deepen cooperation to combat illicit maritime activities, including illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which we know is destroying livelihoods and threatening green ecosystems that nourish Pacific Island economies.\nAt more than 2.4 million square kilometers, the PNG\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone is one of the largest in the South Pacific.\u00a0 That poses a tremendous economic opportunity but also a serious challenge for monitoring, for controlling, for surveilling that vast expanse of maritime area.\u00a0 Under this agreement, our forces will be able to board one another\u2019s vessels, share technical expertise, and ultimately better patrol the seas together.\u00a0 This is vital to protecting livelihoods for generations to come.\nFor nearly 50 years, Papua New Guinea and the United States have worked together to deliver prosperity for our people and promote security and stability for the region.\u00a0 You heard the prime minister speak eloquently to that shared history.\u00a0 But I think what\u2019s so important is that shared history is also a living history, and together \u2013 even as we\u2019re inspired by so much that we\u2019ve done in the past \u2013 we are working together to shape the future.\u00a0 That\u2019s the task before us.\u00a0 And Mr. Prime Minister, we are very much looking forward to taking our partnership to the next level.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

very much.\u00a0 And colleagues, it is a great honor to be with all of you, to be with our Pacific Island partners.\u00a0 Prime Minister, I\u2019m really grateful to you as our host for welcoming all of us to Papua New Guinea.\nPresident Biden was very much looking forward to being here and to addressing Pacific Island Forum leaders before events in Washington required him to be there.\u00a0 He felt it was important for me to represent him to underscore to you our commitment to the region.\u00a0 And in fact, I\u2019m carrying with me a formal invitation from the President for Pacific leaders to come back to Washington this fall for a second summit to continue conversations and develop new initiatives that are critical to our collective future.\u00a0 I know that the President is eager to welcome you in Washington again.\u00a0 The first summit was historic.\u00a0 Our second summit will help us really shape history together.\nThis is the second opportunity that I\u2019ve had to be with the Pacific Island Forum.\u00a0 I very much appreciated the discussion last year in Fiji.\u00a0 Vice President Harris also addressed that meeting virtually.\u00a0 And in between those events, senior officials from across our government have regularly traveled to the region.\nWhen President Biden launched the Pacific Island Summit last year, he pledged a new era of cooperation and partnership to deliver for our people. \u00a0An era of mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual benefit with the United States and the Pacific Islands working together to advance a shared vision for the region that\u2019s free, that\u2019s open, that\u2019s connected, that\u2019s prosperous, that\u2019s secure, that\u2019s resilient.\nSo we sometimes have formulas, phrases that we repeat to each other on a regular basis, and \u201cfree and open\u201d is one of them.\u00a0 What do we actually mean by that?\u00a0 Well, for our part \u2013 and I think this is a shared view among everyone at this table \u2013 when we talk about free and open we mean a region where countries are free to choose their own path and their own partners; where problems can be dealt with openly, rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly; and goods, ideas, and people will flow freely and lawfully across land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nOver the past year, the United States has been listening hard, listening to you, engaging with your governments, working to deliver on our summit announcements and align with your vision.\u00a0 Today, I think we can actually point to substantial progress on many of those commitments, acknowledging that more work needs to be done.\u00a0 And Prime Minister, I take very much to heart what you said about the need to have clear lines of visibility and accessibility so that we can continue to move forward on the agenda we set for each other.\nBut if you just look at what we\u2019ve managed to accomplish over the past year as well as where we\u2019re going.\u00a0 I think we do see tangible progress.\u00a0 We\u2019re enhancing our diplomatic engagements in the Pacific.\u00a0 Last year, we inaugurated our new embassy building here in Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 I had a chance to visit it this morning.\u00a0 It\u2019s an extraordinary facility, really a state-of-the-art building that I think reflects the value that place on our partnership.\nWe recently opened two new embassies in Solomon Islands and Tonga.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to do the same in Vanuatu in Kiribati.\u00a0 We sent our first ever U.S. envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, Ambassador Frankie Reed, who is here with us today and has been hard at work to deepen our relationships across the region.\u00a0 America\u2019s future is here in the Pacific.\nWe\u2019re strengthening our partnerships on public health, the climate crisis, economic growth, and other key regional priorities that respond to people\u2019s needs and expectations.\u00a0 By September, we\u2019ll open a new USAID mission here in the Pacific Islands based in Papua New Guinea to advance those efforts.\nWe\u2019ve also helped Pacific Island countries unlock more than half a billion dollars from international organizations to help communities manage the growing impacts of climate change, a challenge that we know President Biden feels strongly is existential for the Pacific Islands and on which the Pacific Islands have all led in the global community.\u00a0 Today, I am very pleased to announce the United States plans to be among the founding partners to support PIF in standing up the new Pacific Resilience Facility to support investments in adaptation and resilience.\nWe\u2019re updating and enhancing the Compacts of Free Association with our close partners in the Freely Associated States.\u00a0 A little later today, we\u2019re signing agreements with Palau, tomorrow with Federated States of Micronesia, and we\u2019re looking forward to entering negotiations with the Republic of the Marshall Islands very soon.\nAs part of these agreements, the United States will commit more than $7.1 billion to the Freely Associated States over the next 20 years.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also included an enhanced South Pacific Tuna Treaty.\u00a0 We just completed negotiations on a new 10-year economic assistance agreement which will support livelihoods across the region, boost our cooperation on priorities like combatting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\u00a0 We know how essential, how vital this is, to virtually all of our partners in the region.\u00a0 We know the damage that it does to livelihoods and the threat that it poses to ecosystems that are quite literally nourishing your economies.\nWe\u2019re advancing shared prosperity across our region by connecting American and Pacific companies and boosting trade and investment through new initiatives and new dialogue.\u00a0 We launched a new transportation partnership and strategic infrastructure initiatives aimed at unlocking over $450 million in financing for clean energy connectivity and for digital infrastructure.\u00a0 We held the first U.S.-PIF dialogue on trade and investment a little bit earlier this year and look forward to a ministerial level dialogue very soon.\nAnd today, I can announce that our Department of Commerce will lead a U.S. business delegation to the Pacific Island countries in the coming year to look at concrete opportunities in energy, in transportation, in health care, in tourism, in telecommunications.\u00a0 We\u2019re putting together a very strong delegation of leading American enterprises, and we very much look forward to doing that in a few months\u2019 time.\nAlso deepening the already incredibly vibrant ties between our people, we\u2019re partnering with Johns Hopkins University to welcome the first cohort of Pacific leaders at the U.S. Pacific Institute for Rising Leaders program this fall.\u00a0 That will (inaudible) the region\u2019s brightest minds on the key priorities that (inaudible) time.\nAnd we\u2019re returning the Peace Corps to the region with volunteers already on the ground in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, and preparing to arrive in Vanuatu (inaudible) later this year.\nWe\u2019re committed to building on all of this momentum generated in the last year, including by working through the Partners in the Blue Pacific to support 2050 strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\nSo in short, I think we\u2019re making demonstrable progress on the agenda we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\u00a0 There is more that we can do, more that we will do, more that we have to do.\u00a0 But it was very important for me to be here today to hear from all of you, our partners, on how we\u2019re doing, how we can do even better, and how we can deepen all of the work that we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\nSo thank you for the honor of joining you today.\u00a0 I\u2019m so grateful to all of our colleagues for being here.\u00a0 I\u2019m very much looking forward to this conversation, to listening to everyone\u2019s ideas to everyone\u2019s priorities to ensure that the United States is a strong, reliable, effective partner in the Pacific Islands in the future that we are building together.\nThank you very much, Prime Minister.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

together some of our brightest minds, our best universities, our boldest companies, offers incredible promise for the future.\nAnd as the ambassador said, it\u2019s hard to know standing here today all that this is going to produce.\u00a0 But I can say with great confidence that it\u2019s going to stand both of our countries \u2013 and actually the world \u2013 in very good stead.\u00a0 This is an extraordinary collaboration that we\u2019re initiating today.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be a part of it.\nAnd to all of the leaders who are here from U.S. and Japanese industry, from educational institutions, kicking off these new initiatives today from IBM, from Google, from Micron, from Tokyo Electron; Universities of Tokyo, Hiroshima, Tohoku, Chicago, Purdue, Boise State \u2013 this is a extraordinary list but an extraordinary group of institutions, of individuals \u2013 partners, now, in this endeavor.\u00a0 And I really want to thank you for making this happen and thanking \u2013 and thank you as well for making up such an incredible team.\nThe collaborative efforts that we\u2019re launching today are about improving the lives of our people.\u00a0 That\u2019s fundamentally what it comes down to \u2013 now, but also for generations to come.\u00a0 We all know that semiconductors power everything from the devices we all carry in our pockets to the artificial intelligence that\u2019s reshaping the production of knowledge.\u00a0 They are the foundation upon which future innovation will be built, from quantum computers and biotechnology to precision medicine to renewable energy.\nMaintaining our shared edge in these technologies is not just crucial for expanding opportunities and delivering tangible benefits for our people.\u00a0 It will also allow us to shape the rules and norms around emerging technologies so that they\u2019re developed and used in ways that reflect the values that we share.\nAnd it\u2019s not just what we\u2019ll work on that makes these new partnerships critically important, but how we\u2019ll work together.\u00a0 We\u2019re investing in the best ecosystems for innovation, bringing together extraordinary research universities, extraordinary companies, and our governments.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be stronger, we\u2019ll be more nimble, we\u2019ll be more dynamic, because the United States and Japan will build these synergies in unison rather than in isolation.\u00a0 And I\u2019m especially excited by the young minds who are going to be brought to bear on this partnership.\u00a0 That to me is one of the most inspiring parts of this initiative.\nWe know this formula delivers because collaboration across our borders and sectors has already yielded some of the world\u2019s most transformative breakthroughs.\u00a0 Just to cite two examples for this morning out of so many that we all know about, the first is from 1986, when America\u2019s Motorola combined its microprocessor with Japan\u2019s Toshiba\u2019s design and manufacturing technology, producing one of the earliest and biggest leaps in semiconductor technology.\nThe second started back in the 1950s, when, after finishing his PhD at the University of Tokyo, a Japanese meteorologist, Manabe Syukuro, went to work at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0 Over the coming decades, he and American colleagues developed the first models that were used to simulate climate change, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 2021.\u00a0 Even as he pursued his own research, Manabe \u2013 who is now 91 years old \u2013 has mentored generations of rising American and Japanese scientists at Princeton and Nagoya Universities.\nUltimately, that\u2019s what this Memorandum of Cooperation In Education is all about.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just maintaining but expanding the pipeline of rising American and Japanese thinkers, innovators, technologists, so that they can shape emerging technologies for the good of our nations, for the good of the world.\nSo I am confident that no one can do it better together than our countries, our institutions, our people, and Rahm and I \u2013 well, maybe not Rahm \u2013 I\u2019ll be long retired when we get a chance to see the extraordinary innovations that I know this partnership is going to produce.\u00a0 So thank you all so much for being part of this, and we very much look forward to seeing the future that we\u2019re going to be building together.\u00a0 Thank you all very, very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMINISTER NAGAOKA:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good morning, distinguished guests.\u00a0 I am Keiko Nagaoka.\u00a0 I am the minister in charge of education, science, and technology.\u00a0 So shortly after my (inaudible), Ambassador Emanuel had his (inaudible).\u00a0 So he has an office in the Ministry of Education, but that is not true.\u00a0 But I think it is worth a office because he has been visiting us so many times and we have been holding so many frequent meetings, so I think his visit deserves that we give him an office.\nSo Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Ambassador Rahm Emanuel and distinguished guests from U.S. and Japan universities and representatives of (inaudible) companies, good morning.\u00a0 Today I am truly grateful to sign the Memorandum of Cooperation together with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 So this is the first MOC to be concluded between the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and the Department of State.\u00a0 A reference was made to this MOC during the U.S.-Japan summit meeting held earlier.\u00a0 We anticipate that the signing of MOC would contribute greatly to the expansion of cooperation in education between the U.S. and Japan, present and into the future.\nLast week, during the G7 education ministerial meeting which I chaired, G7 nations which share the democratic value of freedom, peace, and rule of law have reached agreement to promote cooperation in education.\u00a0 So the declaration was adopted, and only after the adoption of the declaration we were able to start a concrete action through the signing of this MOC, and I\u2019m truly grateful for that fact.\nGoing forward based on this MOC, our ministry and the Department of State will strengthen cooperation in the secondary and higher education, as well as in research.\u00a0 And at the same time, we will start holding policy dialogue between the two agencies on a regular basis.\nAs for the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, we hope to further promote exchange in education between the U.S. and Japan.\u00a0 Based on the second set of the recommendations, titled Initiative to Promote Overseas Study of (inaudible) Relations Who Will Shape the Future, which as known as the J-MIRAI project \u2013 this was compiled in the Education Future Creation Conference in April.\u00a0 We hope to further accelerate our cooperation.\nIn addition, along with the MOC, I welcome the conclusion of partnership agreements by the companies and universities of both nations on quantum and semiconductors, both of which are strategically critical to the U.S. and Japan.\u00a0 Under these partnerships, we have high expectations that the cooperation of the U.S. and Japan will further evolve in these critical sectors and will foster talent with skill sets that can shape the next generation.\u00a0 And I hope that such cooperation will further expand moving forward.\nAs the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, we wish to cooperate closely with the Department of State.\u00a0 I would like to ask your kind support and cooperation on this matter so that we can further strengthen our cooperation in education sectors and promote educational exchange.\u00a0 And needless to say, with the conclusion of MOC, the U.S. embassy officials \u2013 and not to mention Ambassador Emanuel \u2013 I would like to offer \u2013 express my gratitude for the U.S. embassy officials and Ambassador Emanuel.\u00a0 With that, I would like to conclude my remarks.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The memorandum was signed.)\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Dirksen Senate Office Building", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 16, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, State and Foreign Ops Chair Coons, Ranking Member Graham, distinguished members of the Appropriations Committee, thank you for this opportunity to testify before you today.\u00a0 Thank you for bringing us all together.\nI\u2019m very pleased as well to be here with Secretary Austin, Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 This administration is committed to leading a bipartisan, whole-of-government China strategy that advances U.S. interests and values and delivers for the American people.\nAnd to your point, Chair Murray, I think we do stand at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over.\u00a0 There is an intense competition underway to shape what comes next.\nChina represents the most consequential geopolitical challenge that we face today: a country with the intent and, increasingly, the capability to challenge our vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous international order.\nWe cannot dictate Beijing\u2019s path.\u00a0 We cannot wait for China to change its trajectory.\u00a0 But we can put ourselves in a position of strength to compete intensely to shape the broader strategic environment around China and to advance our vision.\nWe do not seek conflict with China or a new Cold War.\u00a0 We\u2019re not trying to contain China.\u00a0 And in fact, the United States continues to have a comprehensive trade and investment relationship with China, as do most of our allies and partners.\u00a0 We are, however, resolutely for de-risking and diversifying, not decoupling.\u00a0 That means investing in our own capacities and in a secure, resilient supply chain, pushing for a level playing field for our workers and companies, defending against harmful trade practices, and ensuring that the United States and allied technology is not used against us.\nWe\u2019re also committed to working with allies and partners to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific \u2013 one that is at peace and grounded in respect for a rules-based international order.\nWhen we talk about \u201cfree and open,\u201d what we mean is this:\u00a0 We mean countries being free to choose their own path and their own partners, and that problems will be dealt with openly, not coercively.\u00a0 Rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly.\u00a0 Goods, ideas, and people will flow lawfully and freely across the land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nThe world is watching how we \u2013 and Beijing \u2013 manage this relationship.\u00a0 And it\u2019s in our best strategic interest to do so responsibly, in a way that promotes security and prosperity and delivers solutions on shared challenges that matter to the American people and to people around the world.\nLast year, I had an opportunity to set out the administration\u2019s comprehensive PRC strategy to \u201cinvest, align, and compete.\u201d\nWe have made historic investments here at home \u2013 including the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 to strengthen our ability to compete.\nWe\u2019ve aligned our approach with key partners in Europe and Asia and beyond, working methodically to elevate our engagement around the world \u2013 and as a result, we have achieved greater convergence on how to deal with the challenges that China poses than ever before.\nAs we compete, we will work to maintain open lines of communication at all levels with the PRC to avoid miscalculation, to prevent competition from veering into conflict.\u00a0 Senior-level engagements over the past few weeks demonstrate that commitment.\nWe will purposefully engage China, not as a favor, or with engagement as an end in and of itself, but in ways that reflect our values and where we can find areas of cooperation that are in our mutual interest. That\u2019s what the world expects of responsible powers.\nSo we\u2019ll push for progress on priorities like the climate crisis, macroeconomic stability, public health.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to press the need to curb the flow of precursors that exacerbate fentanyl and synthetic opioids and the crisis that they pose.\u00a0 And I very much appreciate the leadership of this committee on this most urgent challenge for the United States.\nWe\u2019ve heard from members in both parties, on both sides of the Hill, that this unprecedented challenge requires an ambitious resource strategy.\u00a0 We very much agree.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the President\u2019s proposed FY2024 State Department budget aims to do: to give us the resources and the agility to advance our strategy.\nThis budget positions the United States to up our game in the Indo-Pacific: the frontline of our competition with China. \u00a0The Indo-Pacific is the most dynamic and fastest-growing region in the world \u2013 50 percent of the world\u2019s population, 60 percent of global GDP, eight of the top 15 U.S. export markets.\u00a0 It supports 3 million jobs here in the United States, provides about $900 billion in foreign direct investment to our country, and it\u2019s driven about 75 percent of global economic growth over the last five years.\u00a0 China, as it happens, invests a full 50 percent of its assistance and economic and diplomatic resources in the Indo-Pacific.\nOur budget proposal will allow us to further deepen our diplomatic footprint in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 from new missions in the Pacific Islands, to a surge of new positions in the region and beyond, including in the areas of greatest contestation with Beijing like technology, economics, and regional and international organizations.\nBeijing understands that diplomacy is a critical tool.\u00a0 It\u2019s why it\u2019s invested heavily in building up its own diplomatic capacity, its own diplomatic reach, and in fact it\u2019s increased its diplomatic budget last year at a faster rate than its military one.\u00a0 And today, it has more diplomatic posts around the world than the United States.\u00a0 If we\u2019re serious about this competition, we have to demonstrate the same diplomatic seriousness of purpose across the board.\nNow, we\u2019re not demanding that other countries \u201cchoose\u201d between us and China \u2013 but rather, we aim to offer a more attractive choice.\u00a0 If we can spark a race to the top, so much the better.\u00a0 That would be to everyone\u2019s benefit.\u00a0 Our budget sets us up to work with likeminded partners to strengthen our offer, and ensure it\u2019s relevant and responsive to the needs and aspirations of people around the world.\nThat\u2019s why the budget includes $2 billion in new investments in high-quality, sustainable infrastructure, rather than low-quality, opaque, extractive projects that leave countries mired in debt.\nIt would invest $2 billion to bolster Indo-Pacific economies and help the United States compete in areas where the PRC currently dominates and in key priorities for the region, including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean energy, digital technology, underseas communications cables, critical mineral mining.\nAnd it contains over $7 billion to extend our economic engagement with the Freely Associated States via the Compacts of Free Association.\u00a0 That\u2019s a critical component of our Indo-Pacific and National Security Strategy.\nAltogether, these funding streams ensure that we can meet a generational challenge and demonstrate our long-term commitment on issues that matter most to key countries in the region \u2013 so that the United States remains the partner of choice.\nDuring this decisive decade, our efforts and investments \u2013 together with our partners \u2013 will determine whether we succeed in advancing our shared affirmative vision for the international system, or whether the PRC can erode or replace the global rules and norms that guarantee peace, security, and stability in the world.\nI\u2019m grateful for this committee\u2019s partnership to sustain the resources and policies required by this challenge and very much look forward to taking your questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-on-the-2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken On the 2022 Report on International Religious Freedom\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Treaty Room", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 15, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Twenty-five years ago, President Clinton signed the International Religious Freedom Act into law.\u00a0 And that gave us a range of new tools to give voice to the persecuted, to empower advocates, to promote religious freedom around the world.\nAt that time, President Clinton noted that freedom of religion was a bedrock American belief.\u00a0 And he said that, and I quote, \u201cWhen we promote religious freedom, we also promote freedom of expression, conscience, and association, and other human rights.\u201d\u00a0 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms this same interdependence.\nReligious freedom is also vital to stable, secure societies.\u00a0 When each person is respected for their beliefs, they are more empowered to reach their full potential, which in turn lifts entire communities and societies.\nToday the State Department is releasing the 2022 International Religious Freedom Report, which provides a fact-based, comprehensive view of the state of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world.\u00a0 This report wouldn\u2019t be possible without the contributions of our civil society partners around the globe who help to shine a spotlight on abuses and advocate for victims of religious persecution.\u00a0 We are grateful for their vital work.\nThis report assesses the actions of countries that are our partners and those with whom we have disagreements, evaluating all by the same standards.\u00a0 Its aim is to highlight areas where freedom of religion or belief is being repressed, to promote accountability, and ultimately drive progress toward a world where freedom of religion or belief is a reality for everyone everywhere.\nOver the past year we\u2019ve seen real progress in some parts of the world on expanding religious freedom as people demanded their rights.\u00a0 Civil society groups pushed for change and governments listened.\nBelgium formally recognized its Buddhist minority, which entitles Buddhist religious organizations to teach their faith in state schools and eventually to apply for federal funding to do so.\nLawmakers in Brazil codified religious freedom guarantees for Afro-Brazilian indigenous communities at the municipal and state levels across the country.\u00a0 They also passed legislation making it a crime carry out discriminatory acts against any religious practices.\nCanada and the European Union both created new offices to combat Islamophobia, while Croatia appointed its first special advisor for combatting anti-Semitism.\nIn the Central African Republic, the country\u2019s special criminal court continue to prosecute cases of religious-based violence and other human rights violations against civilians since the military coup in 2003.\nAnd more broadly, civil society and other concerned governments around the world have successfully secured the release of many who\u2019ve been detained, even imprisoned, for exercising their freedom of religion or belief.\nNow, that\u2019s the positive news.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the report also documents the continuation and, in some instances, the rise of very troubling trends.\u00a0 Governments in many parts of the world continue to target religious minorities using a host of methods, including torture, beatings, unlawful surveillance, and so-called re-education camps.\u00a0 They also continued to engage in other forms of discrimination on the basis of faith or lack of faith, like excluding religious minorities from certain professions or forcing them to work during times of religious observance.\nGovernments use anti-conversion, blasphemy, apostasy laws, which ban the act of leaving a faith, to justify harassment against those who don\u2019t follow their particular interpretation of a theology, often weaponizing those laws against humanists, atheists, and LGBTQI+ individuals.\nAround the world, citizens and civil society organizations stepped up to counter these acts, often at great personal risk.\u00a0 NGOs like Campaign for Uyghurs and Uyghur Human Rights Project are documenting the genocide and crimes against humanity against predominately Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China.\nHuman rights defenders are sounding the alarm on attacks on the Catholic Church by the Ortega-Murillo regime in Nicaragua.\u00a0 Lawyer Martha Patricia Molina Montenegro\u2019s reporting exposed more than 160 attacks against the church and its members since \u2013 in 2022, from desecrations to arbitrary arrests.\u00a0 One of those unjustly detained was Rolando Alvarez, a bishop who criticized the regime\u2019s crackdown on civil and religious liberties and was promptly labeled a \u201ctraitor to the homeland\u201d and sentenced to 26 years in jail.\nPeople across Iran, led by young women, continue peaceful protests demanding their human rights, including freedom of religion, galvanized by the killing of Masa Amini, who was arrested by the so-called morality police because her hijab did not fully cover her hair.\nAmidst the Burma military regime\u2019s ongoing repression of religious minorities, thousands of teachers from Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, and other religious backgrounds continue to teach the importance of human rights, including religious freedom and respect between religions.\nThe United States will continue to stand with and support these brave advocates for religious freedom.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep advocating for religious freedom in countries where the rights are under attack, both publicly and directly in our engagement with government officials.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep working to defend and promote religious freedom here at home, including through the interagency group that President Biden created in December to combat religious bias and discrimination.\nWe defend the right to believe or to not believe, not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because of the extraordinary good that people of faith can do in our societies and around the world to promote peace, to care for the sick, to protect our planet, to expand opportunity for underserved communities, and so much more.\nSo this is an enduring commitment of this administration.\u00a0 This report released today reflects the picture that we see \u2013 saw emerge in 2022, but we are acting on the findings and observations of the report every single day in our efforts around the world to advance freedom of religion and belief.\nThe person who is leading our efforts in that regard is Ambassador Rashad Hussain.\u00a0 It is my pleasure to turn the podium over to him now.\u00a0 Rashad.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR HUSSAIN:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to thank President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Secretary Blinken for their sincere commitments and strong leadership of our global efforts to advance freedom of religion or belief for all people.\u00a0 Let me also take a moment to express my gratitude to our dedicated colleagues at the office of international religious freedom and U.S. embassies and consulates around the world for their remarkable work.\u00a0 They assemble and draft this report after engaging directly with governments, with civil society, and faith actors of every background, and by conducting their own meticulous research.\u00a0 And they are motivated by their unshakable commitment to the idea that saving even one person or improving even one life is well worth their effort.\nThis historic year marks a quarter century since the passage of the International Religious Freedom Act.\u00a0 During these 25 years, the report has served as an invaluable tool for anyone seeking to understand and address religious freedom conditions in any country around the world.\u00a0 So if you ever wonder whether the religious persecution of any group in any part of the world escapes our attention, the answer is in the country-by-country analysis in this report.\nThe role of the International Religious Freedom Office is to work with governments and civil society to expose, counter, and prevent restrictions on religious freedom.\u00a0 The report helps us tailor our diplomatic strategies to the circumstances in particular countries and to inform our policy decisions, and it identifies positive actions as well and trends that we will seek to support.\nNone of this work, of course, is possible without the tenacious leadership of civil society, including the dedicated leaders who are joining us today.\u00a0 So thank you so much for your partnership.\nI\u2019d like to share some key findings from this year\u2019s report regarding religious discrimination and hatred at the governmental and societal levels and describe what we are doing to address it.\nFirst, far too many governments continue to freely target faith community members within their borders.\u00a0 Russia, a Country of Particular Concern for the second year in a row, continues to target faith communities within its borders and beyond.\u00a0 Brave people of faith in Russia who dare to speak against its brutal war against Ukraine are targeted for repression.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China seized, imprisoned, and banished predominantly Muslim Uyghurs to re-education camps.\u00a0 They continue the repression of Tibetan Buddhists, Chinese Christians, and Falun Gong practitioners \u2013 many of whom are fleeing the PRC\u2019s abuses.\nIn Afghanistan, members of communities that do not toe the Taliban\u2019s narrow theological line must hide their religious identity or flee for their lives.\u00a0 In Saudi Arabia, we recognize the important recent moves to increase interfaith dialogue and religious tolerance.\u00a0 Publicly practicing any faith other than Islam, however, remains illegal.\nIn India, legal advocates and faith leaders from across the country\u2019s diverse religious communities condemned a case of extreme hate speech against Muslims in the city of Haridwar, calling for the country to uphold its historical traditions of pluralism and tolerance.\u00a0 And the Burma military regime continues to repress the Rohingya population, causing many to flee their homes.\nOur report also describes our response.\u00a0 We address these concerns directly with governments.\u00a0 We meet with and listen to victims.\u00a0 We partner with civil society and we also urge other countries and multilateral organizations to speak up, to build coalitions, and decry violations and abuses of the freedom of religion or belief.\nAs we do this work of advocating for people all around the world, we are sometimes asked:\u00a0 Who are you as the United States to speak to other countries about their human rights conditions?\u00a0 Well, I believe that we are uniquely situated to stand up for religious freedom around the world for a number of reasons.\u00a0 First of all, we are ourselves a country founded on religious freedom, founded by individuals fleeing religious persecution themselves.\u00a0 They felt so strongly about this right that they enshrined it in the First Amendment in our Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights.\u00a0 And we are a country of immigrants.\u00a0 People come to the United States from all around the world and demand that their elected representatives and government official promote our values in their homelands.\u00a0 They would have it no other way.\u00a0 So who are we to stand up for religious freedom around the world?\u00a0 In many ways we are representatives of the rest of the world gathered here in the United States.\u00a0 And we also don\u2019t walk away from discussing our efforts to form a more perfect union here at home.\nA second theme and trend the report highlights is the increase of government restrictions on access to holy sites and places of worship.\u00a0 We have all seen the sad pictures of Ukraine\u2019s civilians sifting through the rubble of their beautiful and most historic churches destroyed by Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression.\u00a0 Uyghurs have witnessed the PRC Government destroy or repurpose their mosques or cemeteries.\u00a0 Authorities also destroy the monasteries of Tibetan Buddhists and expelled monks and nuns.\nOn my trip to Jerusalem and the West Bank last month, I joined services at al-Aqsa Mosque, attended the Holy Fire Ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and visited the Western Wall during the convergence of Ramadan, Orthodox Easter, and Passover.\u00a0 I sat down with government leaders as well as leaders of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities to discuss the importance of religious coexistence and protecting access to these religious sites.\nThird, many countries continue to legislate and enforce apostasy, blasphemy, and anti\u2011conversion laws and related polices.\u00a0 These laws are direct attacks on the right to freedom of religion or belief.\u00a0 They criminalize religious expression and justify discrimination and harassment against members of minority religious groups or others who do not conform with the dictates of the approved theology.\nFourth, the report shines a light on the need for governments to ensure equal access to primary services for all, including education.\u00a0 Despite the near universal consensus among Islamic scholars regarding the right to education for women and girls, the Taliban in the name of religion continues to rob women and girls of this fundamental right.\u00a0 In Nigeria, yesterday Leah Sharibu turned 20 years old but remains captive to the Islamic State in West Africa Province after being kidnapped six years ago.\nOn the sidelines of last year\u2019s UN General Assembly, I unveiled Pathways to Respect, an effort that highlights the importance of educational initiatives to prevent and combat hatred.\u00a0 Many of these efforts, such as the 2016 Marrakesh Declaration play a critical role in educating public broadly, not just in the formalistic classroom setting; on the rights of religious minorities.\u00a0 I would be remiss not to mention the countless young people who have been forced to flee their homes based on their beliefs regarding religion and find themselves locked out of any educational at all.\u00a0 I had the opportunity to visit some of them in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.\nFinally, in addition to discriminatory laws and policies, the report describes growing bigotry at the societal level in many places around the world.\u00a0 Let me note the ongoing and deeply disturbing proliferation of anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim hatred, and xenophobia that target religious and non-religious communities.\u00a0 We are seeing increasing links between these forms of hatred and between those who propagate them at home and abroad.\u00a0 Earlier this year, I traveled with Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt to the Holocaust sites on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.\u00a0 We continue to participate in the White House-led interagency effort to combat anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hatred.\u00a0 And on March 15th, the anniversary of the Christchurch massacre, the United States joined with countries around the world on the First International Day to Combat Islamophobia.\nDespite the challenges we face, and in many ways because of these shared challenges, defenders of human rights are building a global movement to respond.\u00a0 The 42 members of the International Religious Freedom of Belief \u2013 or belief \u2013 Freedom of Belief Alliance[i]\u00a0collaborate to call for the release of prisoners of conscience, advocate for laws promoting religious freedom, and partner with civil society to promote respect and tolerance around the world.\nThe International Contact Group and civil society coalitions of religious, non-religious, humanitarian, and development organizations cast light on religious freedom violations.\u00a0 They give voice to those who are locked away or forcibly disappeared.\u00a0 And in London last July, I had the honor to join thousands from countries around the world at the International Religious Freedom or Belief ministerial.\u00a0 The Czech Republic will serve as this year\u2019s host.\nReligion can be such a powerful force for good in the world.\u00a0 Societies who seek to restrict it or use it to

Blinken At the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement Ceremony\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "National Academy of Sciences", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 11, 2023", "content": "\n\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Vilsack, Ambassador Branstad, and distinguished guests, my name is Ramin Toloui, Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs here at the State Department.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a pleasure to welcome you to the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement Ceremony.\nFor more than 30 years, the World Food Prize has recognized individuals who advance the cause of food security and nutrition around the world, and the State Department\u2019s collaboration with the World Food Prize goes back more than 20 years, actually to one of my predecessors and fellow Iowan Al Larson.\nAnd in 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell participated in this announcement ceremony.\u00a0 And the reason is the same as the reason that the Nobel Committee awarded Norman Borlaug the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970: food security is essential to global welfare, security, and peace, and elevating and celebrating the individuals whose scholarship, leadership, and activism advance the cause of global food security benefits us all \u2013 Americans and people around the world.\nAnd it\u2019s not about just the prize itself.\u00a0 Concurrent with the award ceremony in October, Des Moines also hosts the Borlaug Dialogue, which brings together scholars and practitioners for panels and seminars dedicated to the various critical food security issues the world faces today.\nAt last year\u2019s dialogue, it was a particular delight for me to meet the USDA Borlaug Fellows.\u00a0 These are young scholars from around the world who are selected to come to the United States and spend time at U.S. universities around our country on research collaborations, and so I met scholars from Egypt, Philippines, Tunisia, Algeria.\u00a0 And what was so exhilarating was getting to hear their passion for the problems that they were working on that came from their experiences in their local communities.\nAnd the idea that they would come to the United States, spend time at research organizations, and then take back to their communities the knowledge that can help solve the problems that are important to their lives was really what it was \u2013 what this collaboration \u2013 what the Borlaug Dialogue was all about.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just the \u201cwhat\u201d; it\u2019s the \u201chow\u201d through these global partnerships, and that\u2019s something that Norman Borlaug believed in very deeply.\nOn a personal note, as a native of Iowa City and fourth generation Iowan myself, it was rewarding to see the excitement of these young scholars and welcome them to my home state.\nSo with that, let\u2019s get down to it.\u00a0 Now, to introduce the new World Food Prize Foundation President and Former U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, I welcome World Food Prize Foundation COO Mashal Husain to the stage.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS HUSAIN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you Assistant Secretary Toloui for your very gracious introduction.\u00a0 To all our guests here this morning,\u00a0khushamdeed.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the manner in which friends are greeted in my country of heritage, Pakistan.\u00a0 Dr. Norman Borlaug often heard this phrase of welcome from farmers in the villages of Punjab, working to increase food production and prevent famine across South Asia.\u00a0\u00a0Khushamdeed\u00a0to all of you and welcome to the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMy own lifelong cross-cultural journey has taken me from my native Pakistan to living in Tanzania, the Philippines, and in Thailand and has ultimately brought me to the place from which Dr. Borlaug\u2019s \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d emanated, Iowa, where I found my purpose at the World Food Prize.\nSecretary Blinken, on behalf of our president, Ambassador Terry Branstad, Janis Ruan, and the entire Ruan family, as well as our board chair Paul Schickler, and our counsel of advisors, I want to thank you and your exceptional State Department staff for your invaluable collaboration.\nThis special gathering continues the tradition that began in 2004, when the first laureate announcement was held in partnership with the State Department.\u00a0 As a special surprise that year for Dr. Borlaug, who had just celebrated his 90th birthday, the State Department presented a cake with 90 candles.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He blew out the candles and made a wish.\u00a0 When asked what he wished for, he replied that this ceremony could take place with the State Department every year.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So Mr. Secretary, today, you are still making Dr. Borlaug\u2019s wish come true.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I know Julie Borlaug, his granddaughter who is here, is especially grateful to you and to Secretary Vilsack for your instrumental roles in carrying forward his legacy and this wonderful tradition.\nThe World Food Prize promotes Dr. Borlaug\u2019s legacy of global peace through agriculture and champions the values that drive us to create a better world.\u00a0 We do so by holding our annual Borlaug Dialogue addressing critical and cutting-edge conversations in food security.\u00a0 We do so by inspiring our next generation of agricultural innovators and by awarding our World Food Prize.\nSince 1987, 52 laureates from 21 countries and the United Nations have been recognized for their achievements in confronting hunger, poverty, and malnutrition.\u00a0 Now to reveal our 53rd World Food Prize laureate, it is my great honor to introduce the president of the World Food Prize, former U.S. ambassador to China, and the longest-serving governor in the history of the United States, Ambassador Terry Branstad.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR BRANSTAD:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mashal, for that very kind introduction.\u00a0 Thank you to Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack, for joining us for this very important celebration.\nWe are grateful to all of you for the strong partnership between the World Food Prize Foundation, the State Department, and the Department of Agriculture.\u00a0 This laureate announcement is a great legacy of collaboration which dates back nearly 20 years.\u00a0 Thank you also to all the members of the Iowa congressional delegation, many of which are here with us today, to support. Your support is also very much appreciated.\u00a0 I would especially like to thank the Greater Des Moines Partnership and Jay Byers, who\u2019s joined us today along with his team.\u00a0 This is the most Iowans that I\u2019ve seen in Washington, D.C. \u2013 (laughter and applause) \u2013 the most Iowans in Washington, D.C. since we dedicated the statue of Norman Borlaug in Statuary Hall in 2014 on his 100th birthday.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI am thrilled to be attending my first laureate announcement and I\u2019m honored to be here with all of you.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always been a strong supporter and advocate for the World Food Prize Foundation and served as governor when Dr. Borlaug partnered with Iowa businessman and philanthropist John Ruan, Sr. to move the World Food Prize to Des Moines.\u00a0 There wouldn\u2019t be a World Food Prize today if it were not for the ongoing commitment and vision of the Ruan family.\u00a0 We are very grateful for their dedication to this important work.\nAmbassador Quinn is also with us today in the front row.\u00a0 He is responsible for taking the World Food Prize Foundation to the very successful progress it\u2019s made over the last 25 years.\u00a0 Ambassador Quinn, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAll of us Iowans are proud of our native son, Norman Borlaug.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug and I are both of Norwegian heritage, and we share roots on farms in northern Iowa.\u00a0 In fact, Dr. Borlaug grew up on a farm in Howard County, and I grew up on a farm just two counties away in Winnebago County.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his lifetime of work to feed a hungry world.\u00a0 He is the guiding light behind the World Food Prize, which honors significant achievements in improving the world\u2019s food supply.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug\u2019s granddaughter, Julie, is here with us today.\u00a0 Julie, thank you for continuing your grandfather\u2019s legacy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI also want to thank Dr. Gebisa Ejeta, who is the 2009 laureate, for his service as chair of the independent group of experts who select the World Food Prize laureates.\nToday, I have the honor of announcing the 2023 World Food Prize laureate.\u00a0\u00a0 Our 53rd laureate has built a model of work directly with farmers to restore farmland and food security after devastating conflict.\u00a0 Through this work, she has shown more than a million people living in war-torn regions a way forward to restoring peace and prosperity through agriculture.\nHere\u2019s how it works.\u00a0 First she partners with demining organizations to clear land mines.\u00a0 Then she works with farmers to replant fields with modern agriculture practices.\u00a0 Our laureate has worked in nine countries to confront the daunting challenge of rebuilding food systems and livelihoods after conflict.\u00a0 She started by partnering with wineries in her home state of California to raise funds to remove land mines in Croatia and replant vineyards and orchards.\u00a0 Then she took this model to Afghanistan.\u00a0 After clearing land mines there, she helped farmers \u2013 including more than 5,000 women \u2013 produce high-quality crops.\u00a0 She built agriculture value chains and provided market support and development.\nHer organization is one of the few U.S. non-profits that\u2019s still operating in Afghanistan.\u00a0 In Vietnam, she partnered with the State Department and with others to clear unexploded bombs, making it possible to plant more than 1.6 million black pepper trees.\u00a0 Her work shows the world the vital role agriculture must have in the resilient recovery from conflict and restoration and peace.\nFor making her mission to turn mines to vines, I am so pleased to announce that the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate is Heidi K\u00fchn.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHeidi K\u00fchn is the founder and CEO of the non-profit Roots of Peace.\u00a0 We are pleased to have here with us her husband Gary and one of her four children, her son Tucker.\u00a0 Thank you to the K\u00fchn family.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYeah, stand up.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nToday, Heidi is actually in Azerbaijan.\u00a0 As we speak, she\u2019s working in Azerbaijan to remove land mines \u2013 which is her Mother\u2019s Day tradition.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI want to also welcome Ambassador Ibrahim from Azerbaijan, who I think is also here.\u00a0 Ambassador, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 An honor to have you and many other ambassadors here.\nIt will be our honor to present the World Food Prize at the beautiful Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines on October 26th.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 This will culminate the event of the 2023 International Borlaug Dialogue from October 24th through the 26th, which will be held in person as well as virtually.\u00a0 Our theme this year is \u201cHarnessing Change.\u201d\nAgain, I want to say thanks to all of you for coming today.\u00a0 I hope to see you all in Des Moines in October \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as we celebrate our 2023 laureate.\u00a0 Again, thank you for being here, and\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to Heidi K\u00fchn as our new laureate.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR FOWLER:\u00a0 Good morning.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Good morning.\nMR FOWLER:\u00a0 I\u2019m Cary Fowler.\u00a0 I\u2019m the Special Envoy for Global Food Security, and I feel like I should say I\u2019m not from Iowa.\u00a0 I think I\u2019m the first one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The office of secretary of state is not where you would expect to find a farmer sitting behind the desk.\u00a0 And indeed, I \u2013 not sure that there has been one sitting behind that desk since the first secretary of state, who was Thomas Jefferson.\u00a0 Jefferson famously said that the greatest service that can be rendered to any country is to add a new crop to its cultivation.\u00a0 Norman Borlaug, the inspiration for the World Food Prize, effectively did that by giving new life and added productivity to one of the world\u2019s oldest staple crops: wheat.\nSeveral weeks ago, our next speaker appeared before a Senate committee, and among other things \u2013 after all, it was, I think, a hearing that lasted several hours \u2013 mentioned the importance of adapting crops and the importance of soil fertility to food security.\u00a0 I can imagine that both Thomas Jefferson and Norman Borlaug would have approved.\nIn our community, Mr. Secretary, it\u2019s a high honor to be mentioned in the same sentence with Thomas Jefferson and Norman Borlaug, but that honor belongs to you.\u00a0 It belongs to you for the priority that you\u2019ve given to combatting food insecurity, the guiding spirit behind the World Food Prize.\nSo it\u2019s my privilege to introduce my boss and our Secretary of State, Antony Blinken to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Welcome to Iowa Day.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 This is a shameless promotion for the state.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I\u2019m glad that Cary mentioned that he\u2019s not from Iowa because I was going to ask: Is there anyone here who is not from Iowa?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And it turns out that apparently, Cary, you and I are probably the only people who are not, although maybe we should do a little bit of digging into the birth records to find out.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut thank you, my friend, for that truly lovely introduction, humbling introduction.\u00a0 To you, to Under Secretary Jose Fernandez, Assistant Secretary Toloui, to the entire team in our Office of Agricultural Policy, thank you for what you\u2019re doing every single day to fight global hunger.\nAnd it\u2019s particularly inspiring to be here with many of the people who are leading what is a whole-of-government mission to advance our commitment to food security.\u00a0 Agriculture Secretary Vilsack, USAID Assistant Administrator Dina Esposito, and many of members of Congress who are with us today, it\u2019s wonderful to have you here, wonderful to have your partnership in this absolutely essential \u2013 it\u2019s hard to think of a more essential \u2013 effort that we make around the world.\nAnd Ambassador Branstad \u2013 maybe I should say governor because once a governor, always a governor, especially if you happen to the longest-serving governor in the history of the United States.\u00a0 And Secretary Vilsack, Governor Vilsack, the longest-serving Democratic governor in the State of Iowa.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nBut Terry, thank you to you, to everyone at the World Food Prize Foundation for the absolutely vital work that you\u2019re doing to inspire action and support outstanding individuals who are improving global food security, including, of course, this year\u2019s remarkable laureate, Heidi K\u00fchn.\nIt\u2019s wonderful that members of her family are here.\u00a0 I thought how inspiring that someone who has just won one of the most significant awards any of us can give can\u2019t be here.\u00a0 Because what is she doing?\u00a0 She\u2019s actually doing her work in the field, helping to remove landmines in Azerbaijan.\u00a0 I think that in and of itself is an extraordinary tribute to Heidi and the work that she does.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo as you\u2019ve heard, for more than 25 years, Heidi has led a movement to remove landmines from former conflict zones and plant crops in their place \u2013 turning fields of death into gardens of life.\nIn total, by harnessing the collective power of governments, businesses, international organizations, Heidi\u2019s non-profit, Roots of Peace, has, as you\u2019ve heard, removed over 100,000 landmines.\u00a0\u00a0 And not just removed them \u2013 this is what\u2019s so extraordinarily powerful \u2013 restored the land that is now being used by over a million farmers across nine countries, helping to feed people and create economic opportunity for so many.\nNow, we know that today conflict remains the largest single driver of food insecurity.\u00a0 The ten worst food crises in the world have all been caused or worsened by conflict.\u00a0 Seventy percent of the hungriest people in the world live in regions that are affected by war and by violence.\u00a0 And, often, even when the violence ends, hunger remains.\nOver the last year, millions more have been affected by conflict beyond their borders, as the Kremlin has tried to leverage food as a weapon in its aggression against Ukraine.\nFood insecurity, of course, is also being worsened by other intersecting challenges \u2013 COVID\u201119 and its disruption of global food supply chains and the climate crisis that\u2019s killing crops around the world.\u00a0 Hundreds of millions of people face food insecurity across our planet.\nSo for me, for the State Department, this is of course first and foremost a human issue, but it\u2019s also a national security issue, as well as an economic issue.\u00a0 In the United States, we are deeply committed to addressing it on all of these fronts.\nWe\u2019ve long been the largest single donor of global food assistance, something that I\u2019m immensely proud of.\u00a0 Last year, we contributed $13.5 billion to these efforts \u2013 when we had the Russian aggression exacerbate the problem, we doubled down on what we were doing.\u00a0 We provide more than 40 percent of the World Food Programme\u2019s budget every year.\nWe\u2019re also working to sustain the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has facilitated the delivery of more than 29 million metric tons of food from Ukraine to the global market since July.\u00a0 Now, this initiative never should have been necessary in the first place.\u00a0 It never should have been necessary because Russia should not have invaded Ukraine.\u00a0 It never should have been necessary because once Russia invaded Ukraine, it shouldn\u2019t have gotten into the business of blockading Ukraine\u2019s ports and preventing food from going around the world to people who desperately need it.\u00a0 Nonetheless, it was necessary.\nThe United Nations, T\u00fcrkiye did an extraordinary job in helping to set it up.\u00a0 But the fact that it succeeded over the last months in getting so much grain to so many places around the world is a very powerful thing.\u00a0 This includes eight million tons of wheat.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of roughly 16 billion loaves of bread, most of which has gone to low-income countries, including under the auspices of the World Food Programme.\nJust as we\u2019re focused on the acute humanitarian challenge of hunger, we\u2019re also addressing long-term food insecurity \u2013 including by working closely with partners across the globe.\u00a0 Because none of us can solve this complex problem alone, and also because what I\u2019ve heard time and again, especially from engaging with my counterparts around the world \u2013 foreign ministers from Africa and other places \u2013 is again and again:\u00a0 Yes, we need, we\u2019re grateful for emergency assistance, but what we most want is the ability to sustain the production for ourselves.\u00a0 And so the more that we can contribute to that, the more that we can help countries build resilient, sustaining productive capacity, that really is the objective.\nWe\u2019ve heard from partners again and again:\u00a0 Emergency food aid cannot be the only solution. And so we are investing in sustainable, long-term food production.\nLast May, we helped launch the Roadmap for Global Food Security, which calls on countries to fight hunger for generations to come \u2013 not just next month, not just next year, but for generations to come.\u00a0 Today, more than 100 countries have signed on and pledged to take swift, concrete steps toward building stronger, more resilient food systems, from improving access to markets for farmers to boosting the productivity of crops.\nWe\u2019re putting a special focus on adapting agricultural to \u2013 agriculture to the changing environment that we\u2019re all experiencing.\u00a0 We\u2019re helping farmers learn techniques that make their crops more resilient.\u00a0 Dr. Fowler is doing extraordinary work, along with international organizations, researchers, and donors, to improve healthy soil and identify regional crops that can thrive in Africa despite climate change.\u00a0 This focus on soil and seeds is absolutely essential for the future.\nWe also expanded USAID\u2019s Feed the Future program last year, from 12 target countries to 20, which will help farmers produce more crops, raise healthier livestock, and grow their businesses.\u00a0 The work that USAID is doing every single day on the frontlines of this effort is absolutely central to our efforts.\nPartnerships \u2013 across governments, science, business \u2013 that\u2019s at the heart of so much of our work on food insecurity.\u00a0 It is critical to our success.\nAnd when it comes down to it, it\u2019s the pioneers and visionaries like Heidi K\u00fchn who are such a big part of this process.\u00a0 They bring a spirit of innovation to this work.\u00a0 They bring a spirit of determination to this work, and they are quite literally forging new paths toward progress.\nIt\u2019s of course a special honor to be in the long, extraordinary shadow of Norm Borlaug.\u00a0 Hard to think of a fellow citizen who\u2019s done more for the world over so many years.\u00a0 And Julie, a reference has been made to you.\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 Are you here with us today?\u00a0 And if so, stand up \u2013 if not, we send our greetings to you.\u00a0 We send our greetings to the entire family.\u00a0 The efforts that Norman made to make our planet a little bit more just, a little bit more stable, a little bit more peaceful.\nTo this year\u2019s winner of the prize, thank you for carrying on that extraordinary tradition.\u00a0 And thanks to all of you for being here today and for your efforts every single day to help feed our planet.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, thank you for those wonderful remarks.\u00a0 We now return to the Iowan portion of the programming.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And it\u2019s my honor to introduce another leader on food security here and abroad, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY VILSACK:\u00a0\u00a0When I ran for governor in 1998, I wore a sweatshirt that said: I wasn\u2019t born in Iowa, but I got here as fast as I could.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So Tony, Dr. Fowler, there\u2019s still hope.\u00a0\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIt\u2019s an honor to be here today to acknowledge the work of Heidi and Roots [of] Peace.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s somewhat of a framing device for the last month that I\u2019ve experienced as Secretary of Agriculture.\u00a0 Several weeks ago I was in Vietnam visiting with the prime minister about our relationship.\u00a0 And what a phenomenal experience it is to be in Vietnam, a person my age; to have the experience of being welcomed by a leader and have the conversation and discussion substantively talk about the important role of agriculture in building relationships and friendships between two countries who in a lifetime had been at war.\nIt was interesting to me because at the tail end of our conversation, after we\u2019d gotten through all of the trade issues and some of the substantive issues, the prime minister turned to me and he said, \u201cWe still need help.\u00a0 We still need help removing explosive devices from our fields.\u00a0 We still need the United States to work with us to allow our farmers the opportunity to farm.\u201d\u00a0 So Heidi\u2019s work obviously incredibly important and ongoing, tragically.\nI then traveled to Japan, another country at one point in time that we were at war, and had the opportunity to visit with the agricultural minister, whose first comment about the relationship between the United States and Japan was focused on the hog lift that Iowa farmers were engaged in when a tsunami hit Japan and wiped out their hog industry, and the importance and significance of that relationship that is still valued today.\u00a0 As Ambassador Branstad knows, we\u2019ve both been to Yamanashi, we both know how important that connection has been.\nAnd then I come back home, and this week we invited folks who are engaged in our AIM For Climate Initiative.\u00a0 Now, this is an initiative that is right down Norman Borlaug\u2019s sweet spot.\u00a0 It is about science, it\u2019s about innovation, it\u2019s about agriculture and the role of embracing and enabling farmers to continue to be productive, sustainable, and profitable.\u00a0 We welcomed the largest number of agricultural ministers that have ever assembled in Washington, D.C. \u2013 over 50 nations represented at our Aim For Climate Summit.\nAnd during the course of the conversations that we had with a number of noted guests, Norman Borlaug\u2019s name was mentioned, world food laureate prize \u2013 World Food Prize laureates\u2019 names were mentioned frequently, because there was a recognition and understanding that in order for us to deal with the existential challenge that we face in agriculture and in food security of continuing to be productive at a time when climate is changing and threatening our capacity to produce, it is science and innovation that is at the heart of how we\u2019re going to approach this issue.\nNorman had some great advice for policy makers, and that advice was take it to the farmer.\u00a0 If you provide farmers the information, if you provide them the resources, there isn\u2019t anything they can\u2019t do.\u00a0 There isn\u2019t any problem they can\u2019t solve when it comes to growing and raising food.\nIt\u2019s been an extraordinary journey, and the World Food Prize allows us every year in October to focus the world\u2019s attention on the importance of agriculture, on the importance of farmers, on the significant contribution they make not just to food security but to overall peace and security, as witnessed by the fact that we\u2019re now working with Vietnam, we\u2019ve always worked with Japan.\u00a0 And during the course of the G7 meeting that was in Japan, the minister from Ukraine came on by video and talked about the necessity and need that when this war ultimately is over \u2013 and we hope it is over as soon as possible \u2013 the expectation is that the United States of America will work collaboratively with Ukraine to rebuild their agricultural economy.\nSo in acknowledging Heidi\u2019s work, in acknowledging the work of the laureates in the past, we really live the opportunity to remind ourselves of the importance of vision; the importance of a man, Norman Borlaug, whose vision still today impacts our ability to produce; the vision of John Ruan and John Ruan\u2019s family in allowing this great opportunity to continue.\nSo I\u2019m pleased to be here today.\u00a0 I\u2019m pleased to acknowledge Heidi and her family for the work that they do.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known her for quite some time.\u00a0 The passion \u2013 the unfortunate thing was she\u2019s not here today, because if she were, you would understand and appreciate the passion that drives her.\u00a0 And that is the same passion that drove Norman Borlaug.\u00a0 It is the same passion that has driven every one of our laureates.\nSo this is a day of celebration, a day of acknowledgment of the work of one person to make a difference.\u00a0 But at the end of the day, it is ultimately a celebration of the power and significance of agriculture and of farmers everywhere in the world.\u00a0 And that is indeed a cause for great celebration.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Vilsack, for those remarks.\u00a0 It\u2019s now my honor to introduce Dina Esposito, assistant to the administrator for the International Development Bureau for Resilience and Food Security at the U.S. Agency for International Development and deputy coordinator of the Feed the Future program.\nDina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS ESPOSITO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Assistant Secretary Toloui, and good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be here with those of you in Washington, and welcome to those of you joining virtually online as well.\u00a0 I am thrilled to be here and to be adding my voice to those we\u2019ve heard today and celebrating the World Food Prize Laureate Heidi K\u00fchn.\u00a0 Heidi K\u00fchn\u2019s leadership of Roots [of] Peace has shown us how agriculture can be a peacebuilder in the wake of conflict, not only rebuilding food systems in economies but by restoring hope and helping survivors envision and move towards a brighter future.\u00a0 We don\u2019t actually always think about this connection, how agricultural development can spur peace.\u00a0 Roots of Peace has shown us that making this connection can lead to transformative results.\nFor 26 years, Heidi has been a thought leader, bridging peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance, and economic growth to show how agriculture can help people cope and sow the seeds of a positive future.\u00a0 In conflict zones there\u2019s a tendency to focus on the searing experience of the war itself, and we often forget that these zones are still places of possibility, where people live, work, raise their families; where smallholder farmers \u2013 many of them women \u2013 need to rebuild and sustain livelihoods despite cycles of conflict.\u00a0 We must keep this at the forefront of our efforts.\u00a0 More conflicts rage today than any time since the Cold War, and more people are displaced than ever before.\nAnd when conflict strikes, it severely disrupts agriculture and food systems.\u00a0 A farmer may not be able to plant or travel to markets.\u00a0 She may have to cope in dangerous ways \u2013 by eating less, feeding her children less, traveling farther afield for goods, or quickly selling off her assets.\u00a0 Wages, extension services, and inputs are adversely affected too.\u00a0 And all of this further damages farmers\u2019 ability to make the adjustment they need to adapt to a changing climate, further fueling vulnerability.\u00a0 The better we understand these connections, as Heidi K\u00fchn has, and the earlier we take action on them, the better we can achieve our shared goal of a more food-secure and peaceful world.\nConflict is the largest driver of global food insecurity worldwide.\u00a0 And as the world\u2019s provider \u2013 largest provider of humanitarian assistance, we at USAID often hear, as Secretary Blinken also said, this refrain in fragile and war-torn places:\u00a0 Thank you for the relief assistance, but please help us rebuild so we can take care of ourselves and our families.\u00a0 Because of visionary partners like Heidi and Roots of Peace, we are able to do just that, to integrate what are often siloed efforts of peacebuilding, conflict prevention, community resilience, and long-term development, bringing them together in a shared vision.\nAnd we\u2019re investing in lasting food security in communities around the world through the U.S. Government\u2019s Feed the Future global hunger initiative.\u00a0 USAID is proud to call Roots of Peace a partner in this work.\u00a0 In fact, this year marks 20 years since USAID and Roots [of] Peace first began working together.\u00a0 This was in Afghanistan, where decades of war left the country\u2019s farming infrastructure in ruins and its market linkages broken.\u00a0 Through Heidi and her team\u2019s efforts, smallholder farmers benefited from training, tools, and market support they needed to increase their harvests and their incomes.\nIt\u2019s just one among \u2013 one example among many of how Roots [of] Peace has shown us through their work that we can help sustain livelihoods, even in conflict-affected settings.\u00a0 It is this simple but powerful insight that Heidi K\u00fchn acted on so many years ago, and for which we and the world are profoundly grateful.\u00a0 Again, my thanks to Heidi for her groundbreaking work and well-deserved recognition as the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Dina.\u00a0 And to close our ceremony, I\u2019m pleased to welcome to the stage Jose Fernandez, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, to give closing remarks.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUNDER SECRETARY FERNANDEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Full disclosure:\u00a0 I\u2019m not from Iowa.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But two years ago, I participated in the race across Iowa, the RAGBRAI.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And for six days and nights in 100-plus degree weather, across 500 miles of soybeans and corn fields, I experienced the warmth and the hospitality of Iowans \u2013 hospitality and pork chops.\u00a0 (Laughter, applause.)\u00a0 And \u2013 I haven\u2019t had a pork chop since.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us today.\u00a0 Thank you to the World Food Prize Foundation for inviting us.\u00a0 And thank you to the National Academy of Sciences for allowing us to use this beautiful venue.\u00a0 I would like to add my congratulations to our winner, the 2022 [1] \u00a0prize laureate Heidi K\u00fchn for her amazing work, her courageous work in converting heavily mined war zones into healthy and productive agricultural lands.\u00a0 We at the State Department believe that we must make global food assistance more resilient in the face of armed conflicts such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while also responding to the critical threats that are posed by the climate crisis, climate crisis whose impact on global food security and global agriculture and fishery systems are increasingly severe.\u00a0 We\u2019re fortunate to have talented, far-seeing, innovative partners like Heidi K\u00fchn and the World Food Prize Foundation to help us tackle these twin challenges.\nAnd as we end today\u2019s ceremony, it should be clear to everyone who\u2019s here in person and also participating virtually how seriously the U.S. Government takes this issue \u2013 through pioneering\u00a0 climate-resilient and food security initiatives, what Cary Fowler is doing now at the State Department or working with government, with embassies, with companies, with researchers, with philanthropies around the world to drive investment and innovation towards our most pressing challenges.\u00a0 And we\u2019re grateful to the World Food Prize Foundation for this \u2013 for advancing these goals, as well as to everyone here in this room.\nLet me thank Secretary Blinken, Secretary Vilsack, my colleagues in EB, and Assistant Administrator Esposito for their personal engagement.\u00a0 I\u2019d also like to thank Ambassador Terry Branstad \u2013 thank you, sir \u2013 and the entire World Food Prize Foundation for their commitment to strengthening global food security and food systems.\nThe State Department and our government partners look forward to participating in the October Borlaug Dialogue in Des Moines \u2013 and I look forward to being there as well \u2013 and our efforts throughout the year to advance common objectives to build sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems.\nSo thank you again.\u00a0 Thank you again to everyone for joining us today, and once more,\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to the 2023 World Prize Laureate, Heidi K\u00fchn.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\u00a0\n[1] 2023\n\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s really wonderful to have my friend, the foreign minister, back at the State Department.\u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Manuel, welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to have you.\nAs always, with such a close ally and friend, there is no shortage of important issues that we\u2019re tackling together.\u00a0 And the conversation that we had today, not surprisingly, reflected that.\u00a0 We covered a lot of territory together, and let me just share some of the important points.\nOne of the areas we discussed was deepening our cooperation in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 Spain has long invested in expanding economic opportunity for people across the region, and it\u2019s a key partner in supporting implementation of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which brings a regional approach to promoting safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.\u00a0 We are grateful for Spain\u2019s commitment to work with us on these Regional Processing Centers that we\u2019re establishing, which will expand access to people in the Americas who seek safe and legal migration options to come to the United States and potentially to Spain.\nThese innovative centers will allow people to stay in their own countries and determine their eligibility for lawful pathways to the United States, making them less likely to undertake the dangerous and costly journey to the border to seek asylum.\u00a0 And the centers will be a referral point for humanitarian refugee protections in other countries, including Spain.\u00a0 Spain has already received hundreds of thousands of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean.\u00a0 It\u2019s committed to increase the number of people that it accepts from the region.\u00a0 Madrid recently created an innovative new pathway itself that will work with the private sector to match the skills of people seeking protection with the needs of Spanish businesses.\nI also thanked Jos\u00e9 Manuel for Madrid\u2019s unwavering support and partnership with and for Ukraine as it defends its people and its territory against Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression.\u00a0 Spain\u2019s assistance has come in all forms: robust military aid, including the recent revision of Leopard 2 tanks; air defense systems; ammunition; humanitarian aid, including ambulances specially equipped to tend to the needs of women and girls; and of course, the generosity of the Spanish people, who have now welcomed more than 173,000 displaced Ukrainians into their communities.\nSpain has made clear that marshaling ongoing support for Ukraine \u2013 and for the principles at the heart of the United Nations Charter, including respect for a nation\u2019s sovereignty, territorial independence \u2013 will be a central focus of its upcoming presidency of the Council of the European Union.\u00a0 This is just one of the many ways that Spain is demonstrating leadership in rallying allies and partners around our shared interests and shared values.\nSpain has also played a key role in shaping the Strategic Concept that we and our allies adopted at the Madrid Summit of NATO that sets out a vision for strengthening transatlantic security in the face of unprecedented challenges.\u00a0 And Madrid has led by example in delivering on the commitments we made in deploying additional troops to bolster NATO\u2019s eastern flank, to strengthen the defenses of our Alliance.\nWe also discussed how to strengthen our longstanding efforts to defend and promote human rights.\u00a0 And to that end, we\u2019re very pleased, as we just did, to welcome Spain to the Global Equality Fund, a partnership between governments and the private sector to support those on the front lines of advancing the human rights of the LGBTQI community and people around the world.\nWith Jos\u00e9 Manuel\u2019s signature, Spain becomes now the 18th government to join this effort, which has dedicated over $100 million to civil society organizations and human rights defenders in more than 100 countries.\u00a0 Every year, that support takes the form of training and tools that make local advocates safer and more effective, and emergency assistance and legal aid to human rights defenders and LGBTQI+ persons who face violence and abuse because of who they are, who they love, or what they do.\u00a0 Our efforts are helping to change the views of individuals and communities, and chipping away at enduring prejudice and abuse.\u00a0 We will be even stronger with Spain as a partner.\nWe also touched upon a number of other important issues of mutual concern, including shared concern about the situation in the Sahel and the work we can do there together to help stabilize countries that are in very difficult situations.\u00a0 We engaged on a number of issues relating to Spain\u2019s upcoming presidency of the European Union.\u00a0 And of course, we discussed how we can build on our cooperation across all of these priorities and many others when President Biden hosts President S\u00e1nchez at the White House later this week.\nThis includes accelerating our joint efforts to cut carbon emissions and increase energy security, expanding inclusive economic opportunities, fostering entrepreneurship, and deepening our educational exchanges and scientific collaboration \u2013 something we spent some time discussing today \u2013 all priorities that will benefit the people of our nations and people around the world.\u00a0 With that, Jos\u00e9 Manuel, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) First of all, I would like to thank Tony Blinken for his hospitality and warmth during this trip to Washington.\u00a0 The Secretary of State is a good friend with whom I have had several meetings already, and these meetings have always been extremely fruitful for the relationship between our two countries.\u00a0 Spain and the U.S. share values and interests, such as the fight against climate change, preserving the environment, defending democracy and human rights.\u00a0 And on the international stage, we defend an international rule-based order and we work together on this within NATO, the G20, the UN, organizations in which we share the defense of these common values.\u00a0 These are the foundations upon which our relationship is based, and we would like to continue to build upon this to create stronger ties in the future.\nIn May, we signed the Madrid Declaration.\u00a0 This was the first U.S.-Spain declaration signed in two decades, which has strengthened our bilateral relationship even more in many areas.\u00a0 And one year later, the excellent state of our bilateral relationship is shown with the meeting that we just had and the meeting that our president of government will hold with President Biden this Friday.\nThis bilateral relationship is based on many ties: our businesses, which have a significant presence in both countries; our universities, who cooperate very closely; and we are also united by the strengths of our languages.\u00a0 We have talked about many of these issues, areas of cooperation today \u2013 our defense cooperation, our migration agreement via which Spain and the U.S. will work together in order to promote safe, humane, orderly, and regular migration from Latin American countries.\u00a0 We discussed Palomares as well as the renewal of the Scientific Cooperation Agreement to continue to promote working together with NASA, especially the Artemis program.\u00a0 We just signed an MOU to work together in one additional area: protecting the human rights of LGBTQI people through the world Equality Forum.\nWe unfortunately for many months have done \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the unjust, illegal war against Ukraine, and we talked about the transatlantic ties that tie the U.S. and Europe.\u00a0 Regarding the situation in Ukraine, I have discussed with Secretary Blinken the unconditional support of Spain as long as necessary with that country.\u00a0 We support Ukraine in its defense against the violation of its territorial sovereignty.\u00a0 This will \u2013 we will maintain this until peace comes once again to the borders of Ukraine and Ukraine is able to recover total sovereignty.\nWe also discussed how the Sahel is increasingly \u2013 has increasing geostrategic importance.\u00a0 We have discussed in NATO the threats that come from the southern flank, and we will continue to work to strengthen stability and development in the Sahel and coordinate our cooperation missions via AECID and USAID.\nThe transatlantic unity is key.\u00a0 It\u2019s always key, but it\u2019s even more so in moments like these \u2013 unity among Europeans, but also transatlantic unity with the U.S., which is a natural ally to Spain in many areas: health, energy, food security.\u00a0 In all of these areas, cooperation with the United States is vital.\nWe also spoke of the next EU summit during the presidency of Spain.\u00a0 This will be one of our priorities because we think that the entire Atlantic should become closer.\u00a0 There must be closer ties between our shores and we must create more stability and growth.\nIn sum, I would like to once again thank you for your hospitality, Tony.\u00a0 We will continue to work on these foundations of our relationship of friendship and cooperation, and that is why this week will culminate, then, with the meeting between President Biden and President S\u00e1nchez, which will show once again the excellent relationship that binds our countries.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Andrea Mitchell from NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister and Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good to see you, Andrea.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, as you know, China is the largest holder of U.S. debt.\u00a0 With the gridlock now in Washington, are you concerned that China and Russia will try to take advantage of the economic chaos that could ensue here and the gridlock right now, and that would damage the credibility of American democracy and economic power around the world?\nAnd I\u2019d also like to ask you what your message is to U.S. companies \u2013 companies working in China that are being raided by the police under their new law, their counterespionage law, that accuses them of espionage for sharing data with the United States.\u00a0 What do you recommend that American companies do?\u00a0 Is there anything the U.S. can do to protect them?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, your prime minister was recently in Beijing.\u00a0 China\u2019s foreign minister is now on tour in Europe and has threatened reprisals against the EU if it sanctions the Chinese companies that have supported Russia\u2019s war machine.\u00a0 Would you \u2013 is the EU \u2013 should the EU punish Chinese companies and retaliate against them despite the risk that China will have reprisals against the EU?\nThank you both very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much, Andrea. \u00a0On the debt ceiling, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the White House and our colleagues there.\u00a0 I think, as a general proposition, it\u2019s proven time and again to be a bad bet to bet against the United States.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the conversations that are going on now.\nWith regard to the treatment of some of our companies and other companies in China, I\u2019ve seen those reports and we obviously have concerns.\u00a0 I mean, one of our general concerns \u2013 and it\u2019s a concern shared by many allies and partners \u2013 is the way some of our enterprises are treated in China, certainly treated in a way that\u2019s not reciprocal to the way that many Chinese enterprises are treated, businesses are treated, around the world.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one of the challenges that I think a number of countries have.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we talk to the Chinese about.\u00a0 To the extent, of course, that China wants to have a positive business environment that attracts foreign investment, that attracts foreign businesses, the actions that it takes with regard to those businesses will have a big impact.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) China is a country \u2013 due to its demographic weight, its military capabilities, its economic weight \u2013 is extremely important for global challenges such as climate change or such as using the influence that it has on Russia and Vladimir Putin in order to achieve peace as soon as possible in Ukraine, because the war in Ukraine is a \u2013 it\u2019s not a European war, but it is a war in Europe.\u00a0 It\u2019s a war against the principles of the UN Charter, and China is a permanent member of the Security Council.\u00a0 So it is in that spirit that we work with China.\nWhat we want with every country worldwide is equal conditions under which we receive the businesses of any country in the world and where our businesses are able to go to those countries.\u00a0 And in Europe, all European countries are open societies.\u00a0 We believe in free trade and we believe in a relationship with all countries on the planet.\u00a0 We do always require equal conditions for the businesses that we receive and for our businesses that go to any other country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Eduard Ribas from EFE.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 I would like to ask the minister about the migration agreement with the U.S.\u00a0 Could you clarify how many migrants will be received by Spain, during what time, and especially what migratory status would these migrants have in Spain?\u00a0 I would also like to know if you\u2019ve celebrated any agreements to transfer the Palomares territories and when that would happen, when that transfer might happen.\nAnd for Mr. Secretary, same topics.\u00a0 Are you planning to expand the migration agreement with Spain to other European countries?\u00a0 And there is any U.S. commitment to keep the contaminated lands from the nuclear accident of Palomares?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding the migration agreement and the details of the agreement, the ministry of the interior and the ministry of inclusion, which are the two ministries in charge of deploying and implementing the agreement in and of itself, they will provide all the details in this regard.\nWhat I would like to point out is that this agreement responds to a shared vision vis-\u00e0-vis a very complex phenomenon, which is migration.\u00a0 We need to offer protection to people who for different reasons may need our protection to seek refuge and asylum in each of our countries.\u00a0 We also need to show that irregular migration, the migration that puts so many innocent lives at risk, people who only want to legitimately improve their lives but they choose the wrong path, that is not the only path that exists.\u00a0 There\u2019s also safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.\nAnd when all of us have labor markets, we have needs in these labor markets \u2013 we need labor in very specific industries.\u00a0 So we would also like to show what we\u2019re doing already with other countries through migration programs, circular migration programs.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to show that that migration path, the regular, orderly, safe path exists.\u00a0 And in the end, this is the best tool that we can use to discourage irregular migration.\u00a0 And of course, Spain will also be one of the countries that will join any initiative that may help our Latin American brothers and sisters with whom we share so many things, and so many of them area already living perfectly integrated in Spain and they promote our economic development and prosperity.\nWe discussed \u2013 I was saying this earlier \u2013 the Palomares area.\u00a0 I would like to state that both parties are willing \u2013 this is a complex issue technically speaking.\u00a0 It\u2019s been 60 years that this has been ongoing, and there are a series of technical issues that we need to solve and we need to expedite before making final decisions.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to the Regional Processing Centers, these are centers that give would-be migrants the opportunity to stay in their own countries and to determine whether they have a legal pathway to come to the United States, or to Spain, because Spain is participating in this process, and Canada has also indicated its interest in participating.\u00a0 That means that, again, a would-be migrant can stay in their own country, go to one of these centers and find out whether they qualify for a legal pathway, including, as Jos\u00e9 Manuel laid out so clearly, a worker or labor-related pathway so that they can perhaps fill a gap that exists in a given country when it comes to its labor market.\nSo we are very pleased and appreciative that Spain is participating.\u00a0 As I mentioned, Canada is participating as well; conceivably other countries could.\u00a0 Needless to say, in the case of Spain, there\u2019s a particular logic because, one, the needs of the labor markets in Spain; two, the shared language makes it particularly interesting and attractive.\nWith regard to Palomares, just as the minister said, first, we recognize the importance of this issue.\u00a0 And as he said, it goes back many years.\u00a0 We conducted remediation after the 1966 accident at Palomares.\u00a0 We now anticipate that negotiations related to further cleanup efforts will restart soon, and we very much look forward to working with our Spanish partners on this.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Tracy Wilkinson from\u00a0The Los Angeles Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, thank you.\u00a0 For Secretary Blinken, please, Spain \u2013 and like many countries in Southern Europe, those especially who have ties with the so-called Global South \u2013 have been more reluctant to join in the Ukraine mission.\u00a0 So you\u2019ve listed a couple of steps here today, and I just wondered if this is \u2013 if you\u2019re satisfied, if you\u2019d like to see more coming from Spain and countries like it.\nY para el Ministro Albares,\u00a0in English:\nFollowing on my colleagues\u2019 questions on immigration, you talked about the\u00a0misi\u00f3n compartida, the shared mission.\u00a0 Is it difficult for Spain to continue to receive more immigrants and refugees given you mentioned the many who have come from Ukraine, already several \u2013 several thousand from Venezuela and Cuba, and not to mention Northern Africa?\u00a0 So I just wonder how politically that goes over.\nAnd then second question on that issue, and last question, the United States talks about the root causes of immigration a lot, and one of those root causes is just dire, dire poverty.\u00a0 Do you \u2013 some of that poverty is exacerbated by sanctions that the United States maintains on Cuba and to a lesser extent Venezuela.\u00a0 And I wonder if you would think it a good idea for the United States to ease up on some of those sanctions.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Happy to start, Jos\u00e9 Manuel.\u00a0 Tracy, thanks very much.\u00a0 I have to tell you I don\u2019t share the premise of the question.\u00a0 Spain has been unwavering in its support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u00a0 It\u2019s made that crystal clear not only through what it says but through what it does.\u00a0 I mentioned earlier the very strong support when it comes to making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression and to retake territory that\u2019s been seized from it by Russia, including the provision of very important weapon systems through the process that we put in place, the coordinated effort that Secretary Austin has been leading.\nYou\u2019ve seen strong support for EU sanctions on Russia to continue to exert pressure on Russia for the aggression.\u00a0 The humanitarian support has been remarkably strong, both in what it\u2019s provided to Ukraine and also in the generosity of the Spanish people in taking in more than 175,000 Ukrainian refugees.\u00a0 So we have seen from day one extraordinary solidarity and a strong sense of common purpose and common action when it comes to supporting and defending Ukraine.\nThe other aspect of this that\u2019s so important is this:\u00a0 Even as we together and with many other countries are working to defend Ukraine, to help Ukraine defend itself and to deal with the Russian aggression, we are relentlessly focused on the many issues that are affecting people all around the world.\u00a0 You mentioned the Global South.\u00a0 If you look at the agenda that we just had at the recent G7 meeting of foreign ministers heading toward the leaders meeting coming up, I\u2019d say two-thirds of that was on the issues that are of most concern to people around the world and including in the Global South, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s food security, whether it\u2019s global health, whether it\u2019s finding ways to advance inclusive economic growth, whether it\u2019s meeting the development goals that the international community has set for itself.\nPart of the challenge, of course, is that the very aggression by Russia against Ukraine has actually exacerbated some of these problems, and we\u2019ve made that crystal clear.\u00a0 We are the solution to the problems, not the cause of the problem.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s been clear in the focus that we brought, including, for example, on making sure that the Black Sea Grain Initiative is extended.\u00a0 You have a situation now where Russia continues to try to use food as a weapon in its war against Ukraine.\u00a0 And Spain, the United States, many other countries are determined that that not happen because the victims in this case are people throughout the Global South who desperately need the food and desperately need to make sure that food prices are held \u2013 are held in check.\nSo I think we\u2019re both deeply appreciative of Spain\u2019s engagement and leadership on Ukraine, but also together very focused on this broad array of issues that are of fundamental concern to people around the world.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, I\u2019d like to continue along the lines that Tony Blinken was mentioning.\u00a0 I wanted to correct that mistaken perception of our support for Ukraine, which is total since day one.\u00a0 And I said it today publicly but I\u2019ve said it on many other occasions:\u00a0 It will be there for as long as necessary.\nSpain denounced from day one the illegal and unjustified aggression of Russia towards Ukraine.\u00a0 We supported the 10 packages of sanctions from the EU towards Russia.\u00a0 We have supported the use of the European Peace Facility to purchase weapons for Ukraine.\u00a0 We were with the U.S. to meet with the International Criminal Court to prosecute for the war crimes present in Ukraine, and we do have police officers from our scientific police in Ukraine helping to collect evidence.\u00a0 We provided the largest humanitarian aid package ever provided by Spain to another country.\u00a0 We have received 170,000 Ukrainian refugees under (inaudible) specific statute and we are of course willing to receive more if this unfortunate humanitarian catastrophe were to continue.\u00a0 We have provided military equipment to Ukraine that includes Leopard tanks, anti-air batteries.\nAnd of course we do speak with our friends about what is now called the Global South.\u00a0 We talk to our Latin American friends, we talk to our African friends, because as Tony very rightly pointed out, there is a food crisis, there is an energy crisis that is a global crisis and affects all of these countries.\u00a0 And we want to send the message that of course we are completely committed to Ukraine, but we are not forgetting the needs of all of these countries.\u00a0 That is why Spain has tripled its cooperation programs for development in Africa.\u00a0 In January I talked to all African Union ministers and I announced a package of millions of euros for the African Union and for insecurity situations.\nWhen it comes to migration, this phenomenon \u2013 this is your second question \u2013 and Spain knows this issue very well.\u00a0 We, as a country, have a land border with Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s 14 kilometers away from Africa, and we are very familiar with the complexity of migration.\u00a0 And one thing we do know is that this is a global phenomenon, and therefore we must act together.\u00a0 And this is the spirit with which we are going to start to work with the U.S. and Canada now, as we do with many other countries, and we do this in the EU as well.\u00a0 We will do this in order to tackle this phenomenon, which includes irregular migration, but there are many other issues when it comes to migration.\nWe cannot just become resigned and \u2013 resigned to the fact that the Mediterranean and the Atlantic will be the grave of thousands of innocent people who desperately want to improve their lives.\u00a0 And we need to tackle the root causes as well, because while the inequality between different countries is what it is, we\u2019re facing structural \u2013 a structural problem, and structural problems do not have one solution; rather, there is management, and part of this management is improving development cooperation programs as Spain is doing to promote regular migration programs like what we\u2019re doing with the United States, and we do this in many other ways as well.\nAnd regarding Cuba and Venezuela, Spain has a very special \u2013 in the best sense of the word \u2013 relationship with all Latin American and Caribbean countries.\u00a0 We are an authentic community of an Ibero-American family, and we want \u2013 what we want for all Latin American countries is the exact same thing that we want for Spain: prosperity, democracy, and freedom.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Sara Canales, La SER.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) And I will not discuss the decisions of other countries.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, this week the U.S. has agreed to send two additional destroyer ships to the Spanish naval base in Rota, increasing the number from four to six.\u00a0 How will this increase in military presence impact global security?\u00a0 Why now?\u00a0 And could we see more U.S. military presence in Spain?\nAnd then Latin America will be a big priority during Spain\u2019s turning presidency of the EU \u2013 oh, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 EU, yeah.\u00a0 How can the U.S. through this relationship with Spain benefit from this?\u00a0 What message does this send to the competitors such as China?\n(Via interpreter) Regarding Title 42, Minister, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and political divisions in the U.S. regarding the border as of Friday.\u00a0 Are you worried about this uncertainty in Spain?\u00a0 Are there guarantees from Washington, assurances that the situation can be kept under control?\u00a0 How have other EU countries seen this agreement?\nAnd when it comes to Palomares, you\u2019ve talked about complexity, but could it be resolved before 2024?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 So we were very pleased to be able to sign the Defense Cooperation Agreement with Spain, the enhanced agreement, and I think it\u2019s simply a reflection of the fact that one of the important aspects of our relationship is our cooperation in the realm of defense.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re joined together as NATO Allies.\u00a0 Spain is playing a critical role in NATO.\u00a0 In fact, the work that it\u2019s done since the Russian aggression against Ukraine to help reinforce the eastern flank of NATO is essential to the work of the Alliance and making sure that all of our members are defended.\nAnd in this context but also in the broader context of shared security interests, having stronger defense coordination, cooperation between us is important.\u00a0 That is one aspect of the relationship.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to predict any future deployments one way or the other; that\u2019s really up to our military experts and officials to determine.\u00a0 But we\u2019re very pleased that we were able to reach this agreement and strengthen and deepen even more the cooperation that we have on defense.\nAnd again, I emphasize it\u2019s on defense.\u00a0 The work that we\u2019re doing together is to defend our people, to defend our interests, to defend our values, to defend ourselves at a time when there are increasing challenges to our common security.\nWith regard to Spain\u2019s EU presidency, we welcome it for a number of reasons.\u00a0 One is, exactly as you say, the close relationship that we have, the extraordinary breadth and depth of our dialogue, I think will also be very beneficial when it comes to the relationship between the United States and the European Union, something that we have invested in very significantly over the last two and a half years.\nThe entire premise of President Biden\u2019s approach to foreign policy and to U.S. engagement in the world starts with the re-engagement, the re-energizing, the rejuvenation of our core partnerships and our core alliances, and one of our core partnerships is with the European Union.\u00a0 We have an extraordinarily rich agenda with the EU.\u00a0 One aspect of that agenda is how we see some of the challenges posed by China, and I think what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is a remarkable convergence in the approach that we\u2019re both taking.\u00a0 And I think if you look at the different articulations of policy that have put out, as well as the work that we\u2019ve actually been doing \u2013 including, for example, through the Trade and Technology Council \u2013 with the EU, you see that convergence.\nAnd I think there\u2019s a shared understanding that the relationship that we all have with China has aspects that are clearly competitive.\u00a0 There may be aspects that are adversarial, and it\u2019s our determination to make sure that competition does not veer into conflict.\u00a0 And there are aspects that can and should be cooperative because they\u2019re important things that might be important to our citizens as well as to people around the world that we should look and find ways to do together.\nAnd I think the EU, European partners, have very much the same perspective.\u00a0 The EU is one place where we can really continue to work on the details of how that convergence of views translates into specific policies, and having Spain in a leadership role I think will only advance those efforts.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding migration, there\u2019s several things.\u00a0 Migration is a global phenomenon, and we see it everywhere worldwide, and this is a challenge that we need to tackle from a \u2013 using a multilateral approach.\u00a0 Spain has a way of handling this challenge which includes constantly fighting against the mafias that smuggle human beings, a political dialogue with the origin and transit countries to offer regular pathways for migration \u2013 orderly migration \u2013 and to protect those who do warrant refuge and asylum in our countries.\nAnd especially we must \u2013 we fight against the deeply rooted causes of migration, and that is why this year we passed a new law for development cooperation that puts Central America and Africa at the center of our cooperation.\u00a0 And we have tripled our cooperation programs in many countries.\nNow, when it comes to the Palomares soil, there are technical aspects there that we must discuss at the technical level, not at the political level, and that is where we will set the different stages that must be followed.\u00a0 The important thing is that the will is there in our dialogue.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-freedom-house-2023-annual-awards-ceremony/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Conrad Hotel  ", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 9, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\nLet me start by thanking my good friend of so many years, Mike Abramowitz, for the honor of joining Freedom House tonight and helping you to celebrate the 2023 Annual Freedom Awards. \u00a0Now, we have to be honest with people; we\u2019ve known each other for a while, going back to our college days.\u00a0 We both wrote for our college newspaper. \u00a0Or, more accurately, I wrote for Mike because on the Crimson he held the title of president back then.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThere\u2019s something else you need to know about Mike.\u00a0 I tended to write a lot of opinion pieces read by, if I was really fortunate, one or two of my roommates and a family member too.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I was always trying to get Mike to write more opinion pieces.\u00a0 And his answer back then in being reluctant to do that was I just don\u2019t know, I really see both sides and I just have trouble coming out on one side or another.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well, something\u2019s changed in all those years, because I know, we know Mike, as being someone who is resolutely, ferociously on the side of democracy, freedom, and human rights.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe have here tonight leaders from across the Executive Branch, Congress.\u00a0 I think Chairman Mike McCaul is here, Representatives Swalwell and Panetta, others.\u00a0 Your presence reflects the bipartisan commitment to standing up for universal freedoms, universal rights, to standing up for democracy.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to be able to work with you and other members in Congress every single day to try to uphold that agenda.\nNow, when this organization was founded eight decades ago, the specter of Nazism loomed over Europe. \u00a0In the rise of Hitler, the men and women of Freedom House saw a threat not only to freedom on the continent, but to life and liberty everywhere. \u00a0And so they threw their full weight behind pushing President Roosevelt to enter World War II to join the fight against fascism.\nEver since, Freedom House has taken on challenges to freedoms everywhere \u2013 from standing up against McCarthyism, advocating for civil rights, to, in our time, protecting human rights during the pandemic, combatting transnational repression.\nThe Freedom Index that Mike spoke about is one of the most powerful tools that we in government have.\u00a0 Being able to refer to an objective, unbiased source that shows us the trajectory for good or back of democracy in our world, it helps guide our work and it is that unimpeachable document that we can use to try to leverage progress in country after country.\u00a0 And indeed, what we see today 71 years later is Freedom House helping lead the charge to defend and advance freedom and human rights in what is, I think everyone in this room knows, an extremely challenging and difficult time.\nGlobally, just to focus on the human rights dimension, governments have jailed upward of a million people just for exercising their fundamental human rights and defending the human rights of others. \u00a0That includes one of tonight\u2019s Freedom Award recipients: Russian journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza \u2013 sentenced to 25 years for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, and also for a lifetime of courageous work to seek a better future for his fellow Russian citizens.\nMillions of others are defending human rights on the frontlines, often at extraordinary personal risk. \u00a0People like Aida Ghajar, the first journalist to publish Mahsa Amini\u2019s name after her death. \u00a0We\u2019re honored that Aida is here to accept tonight\u2019s second Freedom Award.\nFor months now, Aida and hundreds of thousands of Iranian women, girls \u2013 with the support of many of their male compatriots \u2013 have demanded their basic freedoms be respected, even in the face of the most brutal repression.\nCountless journalists are working to expose and report on the truth in extremely dangerous conditions.\u00a0 Today, we were devastated to learn of the death of an AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in eastern Ukraine. \u00a0Our thoughts are with his family, with his loved ones, with the entire AFP family.\nJust a week or so ago I had the chance to welcome back to the State Department another remarkable journalist, Ben Hall from Fox, who traveled with me at the beginning of my tenure in this job and then was grievously wounded in Ukraine doing his job \u2013 trying to cover the war and bring its realities to people around the world.\u00a0 It was just a wonderful thing to have Ben back at the State Department back on the job after coming back from truly horrific injuries.\nBut he, so many others who are on the frontlines trying to make sure that they\u2019re shining a light on what\u2019s going on in the darkest recesses of Earth, more important than ever.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a lot to be said about press freedom in this moment, but I\u2019ll save that for another day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nThe work of so many who report on and advocate for human rights and human dignity \u2013 including our extraordinary Ambassador to Liberia Michael McCarthy, also being honored tonight \u2013 is both incredibly dangerous but even more so incredibly consequential.\nPresident Biden has worked to put the promotion and protection of human rights, fundamental freedoms, at the core of our diplomacy.\nAt the State Department, we\u2019ve been ramping up programs to provide emergency support and legal assistance to those who are out there defending human rights around the world; pressing for the release of political prisoners; holding human rights abusers accountable, including with sanctions, visa restrictions; strengthening the rule of law and systems of transnational[1]\u00a0justice. We\u2019re also engaging constantly with our civil society partners, like Freedom House, on how to best defend and advance human rights in the face of traditional challenges as well as evolving challenges.\nAnd of course, one of the most rapidly evolving challenges \u2013 not a surprise to anyone here \u2013 is technology, both in the affirmative pursuit of human rights but also in further enabling repression. \u00a0And that\u2019s what I thought I\u2019d spend a little bit of time on tonight.\nNow, I suspect everyone in the room felt the same way.\u00a0 For a time, it seemed that leaps in technology would be a gamechanger, tilting the balance of power away from human rights abusers and in favor of human rights defenders.\nIn 1989, President Reagan summed up the consensus view at the time when he said, \u201cMore than armies, more than diplomacy, more than the best intentions of democratic nations, the communications revolution will be the greatest force for the advancement of human freedom that the world has ever seen.\u201d\nSince then, of course, the internet, digital technologies have connected and empowered billions of people: amplifying their voices, providing the opportunity to form communities, expanding economic opportunity.\u00a0 And in many ways, expanding freedom for human rights defenders specifically, technologies provide a platform to connect, to collaborate, to communicate across borders.\nYet, at the same time, as we all know too well, in many of the same places where human rights defenders are using technology for good, authoritarians and repressive regimes have abused technology to carry out their own transgressions.\nIn short, we\u2019ve been reminded powerfully that technology is not inherently good or bad. \u00a0Whether it makes our societies more or less equitable, whether it promotes or represses human rights, whether it brings us together or drives us apart \u2013 that\u2019s up to all of us.\nThe United States is committed to doing whatever we can, drawing on the full range of our own tools, diplomatic and otherwise, to try to maximize technology as a force for good and to minimize its misuse.\nWe\u2019ve also made historic investments like the CHIPS and Science Act, because we know we can only be effective in shaping these technologies in a way that aligns with our values \u2013 in particular, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2013 if countries that support freedom maintain leadership in cutting-edge technologies and are playing a lead role in shaping the norms and rules by which these technologies are used.\nOur human rights future is going to be shaped, simply put, by our technological future.\u00a0 And that\u2019s particularly so in four areas where we have to work together if we\u2019re going to achieve the goals that unite us.\nLet me just mention these quickly.\nFirst, surveillance technology, particularly spyware. \u00a0Our digital lives make us all vulnerable to new forms of surveillance tech, embedded in the devices we carry in our pockets, we wear on our wrists, we have in our homes.\nFor many here tonight, the proliferation and misuse of surveillance technology is a daily and growing threat. \u00a0Journalists, political activists, opposition figures, human rights advocates, others across nearly every continent have been targeted with commercial spyware that\u2019s readily available to governments and nongovernmental actors alike.\nNongovernmental reports have found that over 70 governments around the world \u2013 including democracies \u2013 have acquired commercial spyware or data extraction technologies.\nNow, governments, of course, can use surveillance technologies to help protect national security; to enhance law enforcement, public safety, the environment, critical infrastructure. \u00a0But they have to be used in a way that\u2019s consistent with domestic law, with international law, and with proper legal authorization, safeguards, and oversight.\nThat\u2019s why we have mobilized a government-wide effort to try to shape how surveillance technology is used. \u00a0We\u2019ve been putting significant restrictions on the export of technologies and inputs used for surveillance and other malicious cyber activities by governments.\nWe added spyware companies that have enabled the misuse of their technology to something called the Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List, which prevents these companies from receiving products or components from our own firms without the approval of our government.\nWe will continue to identify and sanction foreign companies that develop and supply software and other surveillance technology to governments with a record of using these tools to abuse human rights.\nThis year\u2019s Second Summit for Democracy, President Biden issued an executive order that bans the U.S. Government use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our own national security, including that which has been used to target U.S. Government personnel or devices or has been misused by foreign actors to target dissidents or abuse human rights.\nWe\u2019ve also encouraged the 36 other governments that are part of the Freedom Online Coalition to begin to adopt guiding principles on surveillance technology to prevent its misuse by bad actors, like targeting people based solely on their race, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, their political views, or any other classification protected by law. \u00a0And we\u2019ll keep working to bring more countries online with these efforts.\nA second area I just wanted to highlight quickly, where we\u2019re seeing technology\u2019s impact most significantly on human rights, and that, of course, is internet freedom. \u00a0Governments are finding new ways to restrict access to the internet, to choke off the information that citizens take in and that they share. \u00a0Some shut off the internet altogether. \u00a0Others, of course, use censorship and punitive laws to control how the internet is used.\nAccording to Freedom House\u2019s most recent Freedom on the Net report, internet shutdowns and internet censorship by governments are now at an all-time high.\nNow, we know unfettered access to the internet is essential for defending human rights and human freedoms.\u00a0 Aida Ghajar\u2019s news outlet Iran Wire used the internet to receive critical information from inside Iran to do everything from documenting an accurate death toll from the repression of protests, to sharing live footage of the regime\u2019s crackdown, to gathering and disseminating reporting by its network and citizen journalists.\u00a0 One Iranian journalist put it this way and explained of the protestors: \u00a0\u201cPeople don\u2019t have weapons. They have mobile phones.\u00a0 They have social media.\u201d\u00a0 These are among the strongest tools in democracy\u2019s arsenal.\nSo we are leading a global effort to try to advance \u2013 to protect and to advance internet freedom, particularly in areas where governments are most aggressively repressing it.\nWhen the Iranian regime tried to throttle internet access for most of its 80 million citizens, we issued a General License that enables technology firms to provide more digital services, hardware, and software to people in Iran, from access to cloud computing services to better tools to enhance their own online security and privacy; in other words, to be able to remain connected with each other and connected with the rest of the world.\u00a0 These tools have been essential in helping Iranians not only report on the regime\u2019s abuses, but to tell their own stories and exercise their right to free expression. \u00a0We\u2019re committed to expanding similar efforts around the world wherever necessary.\nThe third thing I wanted to highlight.\u00a0 While we\u2019re working to promote access to the internet for all, we\u2019re also working to address threats to human rights that come with an open internet, including online harassment, abuse, disinformation.\nNow, online abuse doesn\u2019t, of course, target only human rights defenders. \u00a0Instead, the internet and digital technologies are often used to amplify attacks on vulnerable groups \u2013 women, the LGBTQI community, marginalized ethnic or religious groups \u2013 and undermine our broader fight for human rights. \u00a0So this year, we launched what is now at least a 12-country Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse.\u00a0 We\u2019re encouraging private sector to become engaged with us as well.\nWe\u2019re also working to address the massive challenge of online misinformation and disinformation \u2013 again, something familiar to everyone in this room.\u00a0 To cite one example, of course, Russia continues to push a steady, relentless stream of disinformation about its war of aggression against Ukraine, to lie about and cover up horrific abuses it\u2019s committed, to try to justify committing others.\nIn response, the State Department has developed an AI-enabled online Ukraine Content Aggregator to collect verifiable Russian disinformation and then to share that with partners around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re promoting independent media and digital literacy.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with partners in academia to reliably detect fake text generated by Russian chatbots.\nWhich leads to a fourth area that I wanted to mention tonight, a fourth area where technology and human rights are converging, and that, of course, is emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and biotechnologies, including genomics.\nAs a system that reflects the data on which it\u2019s trained \u2013 including the biases embedded in that data \u2013 AI can, of course, amplify discrimination and enable abuses.\nIt also runs the risk of strengthening autocratic governments, including by enabling them to exploit social media even more effectively to manipulate their people and sow division among and within their adversaries.\nIn October, the White House put out a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \u2013 some basic principles to try to guide the way that we design and use automated systems in ways that protect our people and defend our democratic values. \u00a0These include the principle that people should be protected from unsafe and ineffective AI, and that people should know when an automated system is being used and understand how it affects them.\nThe National Institute for Standards and Technology also developed a risk management framework for how to measure and manage the risk of automated systems and make AI that\u2019s safe, accountable, and fair, and that protects privacy.\nNow, I think it\u2019s also not a secret to everyone in this room and particularly to those of you who are either serving or have served in government to suggest that one of the biggest challenges that we face in government is keeping up with technology as a general rule, including AI.\u00a0 It takes us a while to figure it out, to understand it.\u00a0 By the time we do, it\u2019s usually leaped several generations ahead.\u00a0 And then we go to regulate it; we tend to take out a 2 by 4 that governments use instead of a scalpel that may be more effective.\nSo one of the things that we are doing relentlessly, and including in my department at State, is to bring in much more expertise than we\u2019ve had in the past to help us in real time better understand the technologies that are shaping our world and to work together in figuring out how best to try to shape them in a way that advances the good and minimizes the bad.\nIt took me a while working in government over the years as someone trained in the humanities, as most of us are working on foreign policy, to understand that I needed scientists and technologists in the room just to tell me whether I needed scientists and technologists in the room.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So we\u2019re getting there.\nBut just recently, the State Department stood up an entire new bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy.\u00a0 We have an incredibly effective senior envoy for emerging technologies.\u00a0 We want to make sure that not only are we at the table, but we\u2019re really helping to shape the discussion at that table about, again, how these technologies are going to be used because they so powerfully affect our lives.\nAccess to human genomic data opens up a whole other set of human rights concerns. \u00a0Advances in biotechnology have enabled genomic surveillance based on a person\u2019s DNA, potentially facilitating abuses.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen some of those, for example, committed by the People\u2019s Republic of China against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. \u00a0We\u2019re also concerned by reports of the spread of mass DNA collection to Tibet as an additional form of control and surveillance over the Tibetan population.\nGoing back to last September, President Biden issued an executive order on biotechnology and biomanufacturing innovation, which seeks to ensure that the United States and our partners continue to lead and set norms and rules on advanced biotechnology in a way that is rights-affirming and reflects our values.\nNow, we know these principles and guidelines aren\u2019t the final word in navigating the extraordinary complexities around these technologies, which evolve, as I said, almost faster than we can keep up with understanding them.\u00a0 But they are a way to start to create guardrails and to shape the space, particularly as countries on the cutting edge of tech-enabled repression seek to export their models and technologies, with all the biases and risks that they contain, and to do so at scale.\nThese four challenges \u2013 and others that we know will emerge in the months and years ahead \u2013\u00a0 require all of us to try to work harder, to work smarter, to work more collaboratively than ever before.\nAt the same time, for our administration as we consider the larger challenge of strengthening democracy and pushing back against autocracy, we\u2019ve tried to put in place some foundational pieces that will help us do that.\nOver the last few years, we\u2019ve been working very hard to invest in ourselves, to make sure that our own country is as competitive as can be and that it\u2019s delivering on the things that people\u00a0 most want and expect.\u00a0 Because fundamentally, if we can\u2019t demonstrate that our democracies can deliver, if we can\u2019t demonstrate that we can compete effectively, we\u2019re going to be on the losing end.\nThe other half of the coin is making sure that we\u2019re engaged, truly engaged, in the world.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ve worked very hard to re-engage, to rejuvenate, to re-energize our alliances, our partnerships, starting but not ending with our democratic partners around the world.\u00a0 Because if we can build convergence among countries about the way to approach these problems, if we can multiply the weight that we bring, we are going to stand a much better chance in being effective and getting real change and defending more effectively the freedoms and rights that are under challenge.\nBut what I know powerfully is this:\u00a0 It\u2019s simply not enough for governments to do this.\u00a0 We can\u2019t, we can\u2019t do it alone.\u00a0 On the contrary, more than ever before we need partnerships.\u00a0 We need partnerships with the private sector.\u00a0 We need partnerships with nongovernmental organizations.\u00a0 We need partnerships with academia.\u00a0 We need partnerships that bring together all of the stakeholders in this fight to strengthen, to preserve, to defend our democracies and to uphold human rights.\nWe know that in so many ways all of these stakeholders are more empowered than ever before.\u00a0 And if we\u2019re not together on the takeoff, we\u2019re probably not going to be together on the landing.\nAt the end of the day, we together have a shared commitment and a shared responsibility to uphold the freedoms that so many of us have tended to take for granted but that Freedom House never has.\u00a0 I think the great power, the great strength, the great contribution that Freedom House has made over so many years is precisely that: not taking freedom for granted, not taking democracy for granted, not taking human rights for granted; on the contrary, telling us, showing us, that we have to fight for them and we have to fight for them together every single day.\nNow, I suspect many have been awakened to that proposition a little bit more recently, but I hope it commits all of us to try to find ways to work together in ways perhaps that we haven\u2019t before.\u00a0 So what I really wanted to share with you tonight is simply that, speaking on behalf of our administration, we will continue to look to Freedom House and to human rights and freedom defenders writ large who have always been and have to remain our North Star. \u00a0We ask you to continue to work with us, including by sharing your ideas, by sharing your perspectives, and yes, holding us accountable.\n[1] transitional\n\n"}, {"url":

you.\u00a0\u00a0Assalamu alaikum, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Eid Mubarak to you and to your families.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to join you.\u00a0 Alia, I\u2019m tempted to say, \u201cWhat she said,\u201d drop the microphone, and leave.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Because who wants to follow this extraordinary woman.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0on the acceptance to Northeastern.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0on your decision to dedicate what are manifestly tremendous talents to the public health field.\u00a0 We need you.\u00a0 They need you.\u00a0 The world needs you.\u00a0 We\u2019re so grateful to have you here with us now.\nMS SALEEBAAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And to my friend and colleague, our remarkable ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom.\u00a0 He\u2019s been a remarkable force for the United States around the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Opening doors, opening minds, opening hearts, and making a huge difference.\u00a0 And it\u2019s always great to be with you, my friend.\nTo all of our distinguished guests, members of religious communities, civil society, the diplomatic community, thank you for joining us this afternoon and welcome to Blair House, a absolutely wonderful setting.\u00a0 Blair House, which is, I think as most of you know, the President\u2019s guesthouse, has played host to countless dignitaries over the past 80 years, including more than a hundred heads of state from predominantly Muslim countries.\u00a0 Now we are thrilled to be opening its doors \u2013 actually quite literally opening its doors \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 to community leaders for the first Eid reception hosted here by someone in my position.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo as you all know better than anyone, Eid is a time of spiritual renewal, an opportunity to reflect on a month of fasting and prayer, and to recommit \u2013 recommit to values at the heart of Islam: compassion, empathy, service, charity, gratitude, generosity.\u00a0 Our nation is strengthened by the contributions of hundreds of Muslim Americans across our government, including at the State Department.\u00a0 We know \u2013 I know profoundly \u2013 that our diversity \u2013 it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it is so profoundly true: our diversity is our greatest strength in the world, and we\u2019re putting it to use to serve American interests and values.\u00a0 We are operating in an extraordinarily diverse world.\u00a0 If we were to leave our own diversity on the sidelines, we\u2019d be shortchanging ourselves, shortchanging our foreign policy, shortchanging the country.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined not to do that.\nAs we look around the world, we see examples of Muslims living out the values that we\u2019re celebrating here today: showing compassion for the vulnerable, showing a commitment to justice, showing a commitment to the pursuit of peace.\u00a0 When a devastating earthquake hit T\u00fcrkiye and Syria just a couple of months ago in February, governments stepped up to build shelters, to dispatch search and rescue teams.\u00a0 NGOs like the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement, Islamic Relief USA, provided lifesaving equipment, humanitarian assistance, food, water, clothing, medicine.\u00a0 We saw people coming together in an hour of profound need\u00a0for so many of our fellow human beings.\nWhen the Taliban enacted restrictive bans on higher education for women, governments from across the Muslim world spoke up to condemn the Taliban\u2019s decision, arguing that their actions were inhumane and contrary to Islamic beliefs.\u00a0 Scholars of Islamic law weighed in to condemn the Taliban\u2019s actions, too, noting that the Quran gives the right to education to women and men alike. \u00a0(Applause.)\nAnd in Sudan, which has occupied our minds and focus recently, Arab countries as well as regional and international partners across Africa are providing aid and helping secure an immediate end to the conflict.the se\nThe United States is proud to support these efforts and others, and we will continue to work with our Muslim partners and allies to tackle the challenges of our time, the responsibilities that we all share.\u00a0 That includes fighting for the rights of many people around the world who simply cannot freely or safely practice their faiths.\u00a0 We\u2019re standing up for those who face persecution, for peacefully worshiping, those who are vilified for being part of a religious minority, those who face real threats to their safety, for choosing not to observe a faith at all.\nThe team at the Office of International Religious Freedom, led by Ambassador Hussain, works with partner countries and civil society to advance religious freedom and drive progress on tackling pressing challenges \u2013 global health to climate change \u2013 and they\u2019re doing that, Rashad is doing that, around the world.\nFor us, freedom of religion is a fundamental human right, one foundational to the creation of our country.\u00a0 And our government is committed to supporting the right of every person \u2013 every person \u2013 to worship as they choose.\u00a0 We\u2019re equally committed to standing against discrimination and affirming every Muslim American\u2019s place as a full member of American society.\nThe leaders in this room reflect the reality that Muslim Americans are a vital part of the fabric of this country.\u00a0 With us this afternoon: doctors, scientists, writers, poets, leaders tackling virtually every vital issue that our society has to tackle and confront.\nMina Kalil and Faisal Mumtaz are two such leaders in this room.\u00a0 Both moved from Afghanistan to the United States in 2021.\u00a0 They quickly threw themselves into serving refugees in their new community here in northern Virginia.\u00a0 They both work at the nonprofit Islamic Circle of North America Relief, where they\u2019re helping provide essential social services to new refugees like health care, like transitional housing.\u00a0 They\u2019ve both been generous about sharing their experiences with incoming refugees in panels and one-on-one conversations, because they know that\u2019s one of the best ways to help others.\nNow, if Mina and Faisal are here \u2013 there you are.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSimply put, you reflect so much of the spirit of Eid \u2013 the desire to serve, compassion for the newcomer, a commitment to building a community.\u00a0 And you are, as we would say, paying it forward in a very profound way.\nBut each of you here tonight embodies these values.\u00a0 You embody them with your words.\u00a0 You embody them with your work.\u00a0 The United States, the world, is immeasurably better off because of it.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for being here tonight, and everybody,\u00a0Eid Mubarak\u00a0to everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-uk-foreign-secretary-james-cleverly-at-a-joint-press-availability-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken And UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly At a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Burns Auditorium ", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 9, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It is a genuine pleasure to welcome my friend Foreign Secretary James Cleverly back to the State Department.\u00a0 As usual, we covered a lot of ground, but I began by asking the foreign secretary to extend my warm\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla on their coronation.\nI was in Atlanta over most of the weekend.\u00a0 I can report that many members of our team got up pretty early on Saturday to watch the ceremony, including me.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s something that captivated millions and millions of Americans, as it did people around the world.\nToday, I also had the chance to thank James for the United Kingdom\u2019s crucial cooperation in getting citizens of both of our countries out of Sudan.\u00a0 These joint efforts allowed UK aircraft to evacuate more than 2,000 people, including U.S. citizens, from dangerous and unpredictable conditions (inaudible) evacuation of hundreds of additional U.S. citizens through Port Sudan.\u00a0 All told, we supported the evacuation of more than 1,300 Americans from Sudan in collaboration with our partners.\nTogether now, we are pressing the warring parties in Sudan to put down their guns and allow lifesaving aid to reach the Sudanese people.\u00a0 Even as we meet here, we have diplomats from the United States and Saudi Arabia deeply engaged in talks in Jeddah, working in close consultation with counterparts from the UK, the United Arab Emirates, the African Union, and other multilateral partners.\u00a0 The collective aim that we have is to lay the foundation for further negotiations between the parties that we hope can lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities.\nBut in the first instance, we\u2019re working in Jeddah to extend the ceasefire and get agreement on the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Sudan.\u00a0 We continue to engage directly with Sudanese civilian leaders, with Sudanese civilian society with the goal of putting their nation back on the track to civilian democratic governance.\u00a0 That\u2019s the goal that we share and the goal that we will not give up on.\nWe\u2019re also working hand in hand, as we have been for well more than a year now, to provide support for Ukraine as it defends its people and its territory against Russia\u2019s war of aggression.\u00a0 We applaud the UK\u2019s pledge to match in 2023 the $2.3 billion in military support that it provided to Ukraine during the first year of the war.\u00a0 In addition to training of tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, the UK is providing MRS, Challenger 2 tanks, armored vehicles, anti\u2011air missiles, and other military aid that will help equip Ukraine\u2019s defenders as they work to retake more of their nation\u2019s territory in the weeks and months ahead.\nWe also talked about the urgent need to extend and expand the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukraine\u2019s ports to pick up the grain: a cynical action that directly results in less food getting to global markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East, and around the world who need that food.\u00a0 While we\u2019re grateful for the tireless efforts of Secretary-General Guterres and our colleagues in T\u00fcrkiye working to break this impasse, the world shouldn\u2019t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people\u2019s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.\nWe\u2019re teaming up to help rebuild Ukraine from the colossal damage inflicted by Russia\u2019s relentless attacks.\u00a0 Next month, we\u2019ll build on these efforts at the UK-hosted Ukraine Recovery Conference, which will bring together governments like ours with the private sector, with international financial institutions, with multilateral organizations to invest in the future of Ukraine and its people.\nWe also discussed how to meet other challenges to our shared security.\u00a0 In March, the UK released its Integrated Review Refresh 2023 and its assessment of both the challenges that we face and how to effectively address them to work together in that area.\u00a0 I think we see very, very close strategic alignment.\u00a0 That includes when it comes to both our individual relationships and coordinated approach with China, which we discussed today.\nThe vision that James set out a few weeks ago in his speech at Mansion House underscores the shared approach when it comes to key issues like ensuring peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as looking for ways to cooperate with China where we can work together to solve big challenges.\u00a0 That\u2019s what people around the world expect from great powers, and it\u2019s in our collective interest.\nI think it\u2019s also important to note that even as we focused today, as we do, on Ukraine, on some of the challenges represented by our respective relationships with China, we equally focused on a much broader agenda and that is the needs, the concerns, the imperatives for people around the world as they deal, and as we deal, with the impact of climate change, food insecurity \u2013 as I\u2019ve already mentioned \u2013 energy insecurity, global health, trying to provide for more inclusive economic growth through work that we and partners in the G7, as we\u2019re preparing for the leaders\u2019 meeting of the G7, can help advance and support.\u00a0 That agenda is very much the focus of both the United Kingdom and the United States.\nJames said something when we were together recently in Japan that I\u2019ll take the liberty of quoting here.\u00a0 He said, \u201cThe world is a healthier, happier, safer, more prosperous place when the United Kingdom and the United States work closely together, and it\u2019s in our mutual interest to do so.\u201d\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t agree more.\nAnd next month\u2019s visit by Prime Minister Sunak to meet with President Biden will offer us a chance to do even more of that, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to it.\nWith that, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Tony, thank you once again for hosting me here in Washington.\u00a0 It\u2019s always a pleasure to speak with you, to discuss the areas of bilateral interest, as well as the issues which affect the whole world.\u00a0 We did so recently at the G7 with our \u2013 all our friends in the international community.\nAnd thank you also for the kind words that you\u2019ve said on behalf of your nation on the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III and Queen Camilla.\u00a0 Can I also thank the First Lady for joining us at this time of special celebration, a once in a lifetime event made more special because we were able to share it with friends from across the world.\nCan I also put on record our thanks to the United States of America and, indeed, you personally for the huge amount of effort that you have invested in seeking peace in Sudan.\u00a0 It was a situation which unfolded whilst we were meeting at the G7 in Japan, and I commend the effort that you personally put in, engaging with the generals, with the leadership of the warring factions, to try and bring initially a ceasefire and then your ongoing work, the ongoing work of the United States of America, in trying to broker a sustainable peace.\nIt should remind everybody that whilst we are, of course, working on the support that we give to Ukraine and their self-defense \u2013 and I\u2019ll touch upon that again in a moment \u2013 we are not distracted from the pressing issues of the day and we deal with them.\u00a0 We deal with them effectively; we deal with them collaboratively.\u00a0 And we\u2019re able to do so because of the very strong bilateral relationship that our two countries enjoy, a relationship which is invested in regularly by the visits that we make over here.\u00a0 And as you say, I know the prime minister\u2019s very much looking forward to meeting with President Biden when he comes across next month.\nBut also we are very grateful to the President for his recent visit to the United Kingdom to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, a topic which I know is of great interest and passion to him, and we value your country\u2019s engagement on that issue.\nWe remain committed to building peace and prosperity around the world, just as we are attempting to do in Sudan, and we continue to work towards that goal in Ukraine.\u00a0 Every time I come to the United States I make a point of thanking your nation for the scale of support that you have given to Ukraine.\u00a0 You are the largest donor, both in military and economic terms, and I know that your support is incredibly important in their ability to defend themselves against this unprovoked attack from Russia.\nWe, of course, spoke at length about the nature of that support, about the next few months, and the importance to not only look at the context through the prism of the conflict but also to focus on the future rebuilding work that will inevitably be needed.\u00a0 We are very pleased \u2013 the UK is very pleased to host on behalf of Ukraine the Ukraine Recovery Conference, where we will seek to build a coalition that will enable Ukraine to rebuild its country after this conflict has been concluded, after they regain their country back.\u00a0 And we value the United States of America\u2019s coordinating role in ensuring that the private sector as well as the public sector is heavily involved in that reconstruction.\u00a0 From the UK\u2019s point of view, we\u2019ll of course also continue to provide financial and military aid.\u00a0 We intend to give the Ukrainians the tools they need to successfully defend themselves against the invasion.\nBut just as we did with Sudan, we remain focused on the needs of some of the poorest people in the world, and I echo your comments on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 It is completely wrong that Russia uses the hunger of some of the poorest people in the world to pursue leverage during this conflict.\u00a0 They should re-sign the Black Sea Grain Initiative and do so immediately.\u00a0 They should unlock the supply of food to go to those people around the world who need it most.\u00a0 And it is perverse that they are using hunger in the developing world as leverage in their conflict in Ukraine.\nWe did, of course, also have the opportunity to speak about issues on a broader context.\u00a0 And, of course, how we recognize the role that China has in world affairs and how we respond to China\u2019s action will, of course, be an ongoing part of our bilateral discussions.\nI recently gave a major speech on the UK\u2019s posture towards China, which was derived from our recent integrated review refresh.\u00a0 We made the point that we need to defend ourselves as nations \u2013 the UK is doing this, as indeed the United States of America is \u2013 against inappropriate activities by China.\u00a0 We also need to make sure that we build alliances and strengthen the pre-existing alliances that we have, as I\u2019m doing today with the United States of America, but also with our friends in the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 And we have to engage with China directly, robustly, regularly, to seek to influence the decisions that are made in Beijing and do so in a way that benefits the whole world, whether that be on the maintenance of peace across the Taiwan Strait, which of course is something which affects all of us irrespective of where we are in the world, to issues such as climate change, pandemic prevention and response.\nAnd that of course brings us full circle to our bilateral relations with the United States of America.\u00a0 We have been close defense partners.\u00a0 We are intelligence-sharing partners.\u00a0 And of course, we have strong economic ties.\u00a0 And we will seek to find opportunities where the UK can be a strong economic partner to the United States of America as well as being a strong defensive partner as well.\nIt is \u2013 and thank you for reminding me of that quote; I do happen to be rather proud of it \u2013 I think it is in our mutual interest and in the interests of everyone around the world that the UK and U.S. bilateral relationship continues to be one of the points of pride, and one which is strong, and one which I intend to make even stronger still in the future.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Kylie Atwood from CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you both for taking questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I want to just ask you a quick question on China and then pivot to Ukraine.\u00a0 This week, when Ambassador Burns met with the Chinese foreign minister, did they agree to begin planning on your rescheduled visit to Beijing?\u00a0 And then on Ukraine, does Ukraine have what it needs to be successful in winning back at least some of the territory that Russia is now occupying in the upcoming counteroffensive?\nAnd Secretary Cleverly, the same question for you.\u00a0 Does Ukraine have everything it needs to be successful in winning back some of that territory?\u00a0 And then specifically related to international support for Ukraine headed into the coming months and year, there are reports that your country is preparing to send long-range missiles to Kyiv.\u00a0 When could those long-range missiles from the UK and potentially other European allies actually arrive in the country?\u00a0 And we have seen in the past that when the UK moves on an additional military capability for Ukraine, the U.S. has followed suit.\u00a0 In any of your conversations so far, have you gotten indications that that might be the case with long-range missile systems as well?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, thanks very much.\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 With regard to China, I\u2019m obviously not going to go into any detail about the ambassador\u2019s conversations with Chinese counterparts.\u00a0 What I can say is this.\u00a0 What we have communicated to our colleagues in the government in Beijing is the importance from our perspective in engagement, precisely because we have a deeply complicated and also consequential relationship that is important to people in the United States and China, but beyond that around the world; that our two presidents agreed when they met in Bali at the end of last year that it would be important to establish and strengthen our lines of communication; and that we believe that that\u2019s in our interests and also something that the rest of the world expects us to do because there\u2019s an expectation that we will responsibly manage the relationship.\u00a0 And precisely because we have profound differences as well as, I believe, some responsibility not only to manage those differences so that the competition that we have doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, but also the potential where it\u2019s in our mutual interest and where it answers needs that the world has as well to find areas of cooperation, that engagement\u2019s the way that we try to pursue both of those responsibilities.\nSo that\u2019s the nature of the conversation that we\u2019re having with China in this moment, and we\u2019ll see where that goes.\nWith regard to Ukraine, all along, from day one \u2013 in fact, before day one \u2013 it\u2019s been our determination to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 And throughout the more than one year of that aggression, we have worked very hard to adjust at every step of the way to what was needed at any given time; and right now, of course, the focus is on the Ukrainian efforts that we anticipate to try to retake more of the territory that\u2019s been seized from Ukraine by Russia over the last 14-plus months.\nI believe that the efforts that both of us have been deeply engaged in are very productive in terms of what more than I think 50 countries have been able to provide Ukraine.\u00a0 Secretary Austin has been leading a process, as you know, for many months where we have a coordinated process to do that.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said repeatedly, it\u2019s not only the weapons; it\u2019s the training, and the UK has been engaged in significant training.\u00a0 It\u2019s making sure that the Ukrainians can maintain the systems that we provide them.\u00a0 And it\u2019s important, of course, that they have the right plans, again, to be successful.\nMy own estimation is that they have in place across all of those dimensions what they need to continue to be successful in regaining territory that was seized by force by Russia over the last 14 months.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Kylie, thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to take slight issue with one of the elements in your \u2013 in your question, but thank you for highlighting that the UK has been very proactive in our support for Ukraine.\u00a0 We are very proud of the fact that we provided the antitank \u2013 the handheld antitank missile systems ahead of the February of last year\u2019s invasion by Russia, and those pieces of equipment proved very consequential in Ukraine\u2019s defense of Kyiv.\nBut I also think it\u2019s important that we put on record that the United States from the very start has been very active, very effective in its support, and as befits a country of the scale and power of the United States of America, it is the largest donor of the allies.\u00a0 So I wouldn\u2019t want to imply that there\u2019s either kind of competition between us or anything else.\u00a0 We have from the very start worked in close coordination.\nThe nature of our militaries is different.\u00a0 The natures of our political systems are different.\u00a0 There are some things that the UK is able to do more quickly because of the nature of our political system, and there are some things that the American system allows them to do different and better.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about always trying to replicate what our allies do.\u00a0 That\u2019s not the point of an alliance.\u00a0 The point of an alliance is that we support each other, that we reinforce each other in our work to help Ukraine defend itself.\u00a0 And as Secretary Blinken said, we constantly assess and coordinate with each other and with the Ukrainians to make sure that the support that we are giving them matches the needs at the time: those antitank missiles at the early stages, air-defense systems more recently, the training of their ground troops, the provision of armored vehicles and ammunition, and the ability for them to project effective force against Russian troops within Ukraine to push them out of their country.\u00a0 And we will continue to do so.\nIt is a collaborative effort.\u00a0 It has proven to be very, very effective.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve seen over and over again is that the Ukrainian, both politically \u2013 the Ukrainians, both politically and militarily, have learned quickly, have been relentlessly focused on using the support that we give them effectively, and have consistently outperformed expectations \u2013 certainly the expectations of Vladimir Putin.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Your assessment on the long-range missiles that potentially get to them?\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, look, you would, I\u2019m sure, understand that anything to do with operational details about the nature, the timing, the scale of our support would be counterproductive for us to discuss publicly.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Mark Stone with Sky News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you both very much.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, a question for you in a moment, if I may.\u00a0 But first of all, for Foreign Secretary Cleverly:\u00a0 It feels as though support for Ukraine is waning a little bit.\u00a0 You may disagree with that, but you can feel it on Capitol Hill with influential sections of the Republican Party and their base across America skeptical now about the never-ending \u2013 seemingly never-ending support for Ukraine.\u00a0 If Ukrainians don\u2019t deliver a decisive victory over the next few months, how do you \u2013 how does Britain persuade America that they must continue to lead support for a Ukrainian victory?\u00a0 And if you can\u2019t, what then?\nAnd a second question for you, if I can, just a little bit more on the long-range missiles.\u00a0 Can you give us any assessment of whether these long-range missiles will come and what effect that will have on the battlefield?\nAnd then in a moment for you, sir.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, I \u2013 I\u2019ve said this \u2013 why don\u2019t you put your question on record, and then (inaudible) my frame of view \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah, okay.\u00a0 Sorry, I will.\u00a0 Yeah, of course.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I want to focus with you on American priorities, if I may.\u00a0 Since Ukraine \u2013 since the war started, there have been nearly 9,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine, according to the UN.\u00a0 In America this year, in the past five months, 15,000 people have died from gun violence; 70,000 people died last year from opioid overdoses, many of those drugs coming from China.\u00a0 Your argument on defending Ukraine is clear, but with so many fundamental challenges here at home and politicians telling people that security begins at home, how do you maintain support for a battle far away?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 So firstly, on our support for Ukraine \u2013 and when I say \u201cour,\u201d I mean the wider alliance of friends who are supporting Ukraine.\u00a0 This means the UK and the United States of America and others.\u00a0 We need to recognize that the outcome of this conflict will have effect all over the world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said over and over again the eyes of the world are watching.\u00a0 They are watching how we respond to this challenge; they are watching to see our resolve.\u00a0 And whether it be in capital cities or non-state actors, the message that we send now is really important.\nI think the message that we should send is that when we commit to something, we stick with it.\u00a0\u00a0 We have the grit, we have the determination, we have the strategic endurance to see it through until its successful conclusion, and anyone watching should learn that lesson.\nI would also make the point that, of course, there has been an economic impact on people in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 This is not a byproduct of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 This is part of the conflict.\u00a0 Economic coercion through their restrictions of hydrocarbons, pinching off the supply of grain to the developing world \u2013 this is part of the conflict; it\u2019s not a byproduct of the conflict.\u00a0 And we should recognize that if we do not re-establish the principles of the UN Charter \u2013 the foundation stone of peace in the post-Second World War era, that powerful nations cannot invade their neighbors with impunity \u2013 the world will be more dangerous, more expensive, more difficult.\nSo this is not just about Ukraine, though, of course, the Ukrainians have been suffering enormously and it\u2019s right that we defend them.\u00a0 It is about us, and it is in our interest, as well as the Ukrainians\u2019 interest, that we stay resolute in our support, because it will become more painful and more expensive if we do not.\nAnd when it comes to the Ukrainians\u2019 forthcoming counteroffensive, I\u2019ve made the point that this is not a film.\u00a0 There are no certainties when it comes to conflict.\u00a0 The Ukrainians have consistently outperformed expectations, but there can be no guarantees in war.\u00a0 So we have to recognize that we are giving the Ukrainians a huge amount of support \u2013 as I\u2019ve said, they have learned quickly; they have adapted very, very successfully, and they have defended themselves incredibly effectively \u2013 and we need to continue to support them, irrespective of whether this forthcoming offensive generates huge gains on the battlefield, because until this conflict is resolved and resolved properly, it is not over.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the message that I have spoken about back home in the UK and I will continue to say to those friends and colleagues here in the United States of America as well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, I can only violently agree with my friend and strongly endorse what he\u2019s just said.\u00a0 We have exactly the same perspective.\nSecond, I would also dispute the notion of waning support.\u00a0 I would refer you, for example, just recently to the very strong statement made by the Speaker of the House McCarthy about support for Ukraine and the enduring support and determination to see this through.\nBut stepping back, there is not a zero-sum choice between some of the work that we\u2019re doing around the world and the work that we\u2019re doing at home.\u00a0 In fact, to the contrary, they\u2019re directly linked and they\u2019re mutually reinforcing.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent the last couple of years making historic investments in ourselves \u2013 infrastructure, our technological edge when it comes to semiconductors, making sure that the United States would continue to lead when it comes to dealing with climate change and producing the technology of the future, green technology for green economies.\nAt the same time, working closely with our partners, we\u2019ve revitalized, re-engaged our alliances, our partnerships.\u00a0 We\u2019ve built new ones.\u00a0 The net result is that we are stronger at home, and our standing around the world is at I think the highest level that I\u2019ve seen in recent years.\nAnd, of course, we are \u2013 I was going to say walking and chewing gum \u2013 running and chewing gum at the same time.\u00a0 Even as we are engaged in helping Ukraine defend itself against this Russian aggression, for all the reasons the Foreign Secretary laid out \u2013 and, as he said earlier, we are equally focused on a very broad global agenda that addresses the needs and concerns of people around the world as well as our own citizens, and, of course, we\u2019re focused on challenges that we have at home.\nYou mentioned opioids, synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\u00a0 We\u2019re relentlessly focused on that, and that is by definition a problem that is both local and global.\u00a0 We\u2019re in the midst of building a much stronger global coalition to deal with the ravages that fentanyl is producing.\u00a0 In the United States, it\u2019s the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 49.\u00a0 So this is right at the top of our agenda.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re working very hard at home to deal with demand, to deal with treatment, to deal with recovery.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re working very closely, including with our neighbor Mexico, on the law enforcement piece to break up the cartels, to break up the financing, to interrupt the distribution.\u00a0 But more broadly, we\u2019re also working to get at the global network that has the production of some of the chemicals that go into fentanyl being made halfway around the world, and then coming close to us, perhaps getting diverted into the illicit produciton of fentanyl, and then winding up in the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what the coalition that we\u2019re building \u2013 and more on that in the coming weeks \u2013 will work to address.\nWe know that in the United States, when it comes to fentanyl and synthetic opioids, to some extent we\u2019ve been the canary in the coal mine.\u00a0 It hit us first, and it\u2019s hit us very hard.\u00a0 But as the markets become saturated in the United States, we see criminal enterprises trying to make markets elsewhere in the world, including in Europe, including in Asia.\u00a0 And there is a growing awareness and urgency on the part of other countries to making sure that we\u2019re tackling this problem.\nSo that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re not only doing it at home \u2013 we\u2019re doing it by building a very strong partnership with other countries, with the private sector, and other institutions to engage on it.\nSo the bottom line is these are not zero-sum choices.\u00a0 These are responsibilities we have: dealing with challenges we have at home, dealing with challenges we have around the world, and understanding the connections that exist between them.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Shaun Tandon with the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi there.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 Another conflict that\u2019s caused a lot of suffering: Syria.\u00a0 Just two days ago, the Arab League voted to readmit Syria.\u00a0 To both of you, do you see this at all as a failure of the efforts to isolate Assad that have been going on for many years?\u00a0 Specifically to Secretary Blinken, across partisan lines in Congress there are calls to continue using the Caesar Act and other authorities to prevent normalization with Assad.\u00a0 Is this still something that can be done, despite the reconciliation by the Arab League and by T\u00fcrkiye, for that matter, with the Assad regime?\nAnd to Foreign Secretary Cleverly, on that note as well, does the United Kingdom agree with the U.S. approach of no reconstruction aid at this point so long as Assad is there?\u00a0 Is that the approach that you think is beneficial?\nAnd just briefly, if I could ask both of you if you had any \u2013 any thoughts on the events today in Pakistan.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Khan was arrested; there was some violence.\u00a0 If you have any thoughts on that \u2013 thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Shaun, thank you.\u00a0 Let me \u2013 let me address Syria first.\u00a0 A few things on that.\u00a0 We do not believe that Syria merits readmission to the Arab League.\u00a0 It\u2019s a point we\u2019ve made to all of our regional partners, but they have to make their own decisions.\u00a0 And our position is clear:\u00a0 We are not going to be in the business of normalizing relations with Assad and with that regime.\nHaving said that, we also clearly have shared goals when it comes to Syria with our partners.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s reflected in a number of the things that they\u2019ve said.\u00a0 First, ultimately the only solution to the crisis inflicted on Syria by Assad has to be consistent with the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 that lays out expectations for a ceasefire, for humanitarian assistance, and for free and fair elections to ensure that Syrians have a government that actually reflects the will of the Syrian people.\u00a0 We agree on the importance \u2013 the imperative \u2013 of expanding humanitarian access to Syria.\u00a0 We agree on the importance of continuing the work to degrade ISIS or Daesh, to make sure that it can\u2019t re-emerge.\u00a0 And we agree on the importance of reducing Iran\u2019s malign influence and presence in Syria, as well as more broadly in the region.\nSo I think the Arab perspective, as articulated through the Arab League, is they believe that they can pursue these objectives through more direct engagement.\u00a0 But the \u2013 we may have a different perspective when it comes to that, but the objectives that we have I think are the same.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where the focus is.\nI think it\u2019s also fair to say that in terms of what\u2019s happened over the last few years, what we\u2019ve set out to do is to work to try to stabilize as best we could from afar the situation; to ensure, as I said, that ISIS cannot re-emerge in Syria; to expand humanitarian access.\u00a0 And on those criteria I think we\u2019ve actually made some progress.\u00a0 Fewer Syrians have lost their lives in the last few years.\u00a0 It\u2019s unfortunately a low bar given the horrors of the last decade, but that is a fact.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken ISIS leaders off the battlefield to ensure that, again, that organization couldn\u2019t re-emerge in the way that it at one point controlled a huge chunk of Syria and used it as a base for potential attacks around the world.\u00a0 And the humanitarian aid has continued to flow.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve managed to expand it, and we even managed to continue it despite the horrific earthquake in Syria.\nSo I think if you look at those various metrics, we have made some progress.\u00a0 And again, with our Arab partners, even if we disagree on the readmission to the Arab League, the objectives that we have remain the same.\nAnd with regard to Pakistan, of course I\u2019ve seen the reports that you\u2019ve alluded to, and we just want to make sure that whatever happens in Pakistan is consistent with the rule of law, with the constitution.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Shaun, yes.\u00a0 Again, this is an occasion where the UK and the U.S. share very, very similar views.\u00a0 I had a number of conversations with our interlocutors in the region ahead of the formal announcement of Syria\u2019s readmission.\u00a0 I say to you now what I said to our friends in the region, that the UK is very uncomfortable with Syria\u2019s readmission to the Arab League.\u00a0 But as Secretary Blinken said, ultimately is a decision for the membership of the Arab League.\nThe point that I have made is that there needs to be conditionality if they choose to take this course of action, have they done \u2013 as they have done.\u00a0 It needs to be conditional on some fundamental changes of behavior from Damascus and from the Assad regime.\u00a0 The protection of Syrians, if they choose to go back to Syria from the refugee camps in the region, needs to be assured.\u00a0 The Security Council Resolution 2254 needs to be at the heart of any engagement with Syria.\u00a0 And we cannot just wish away the actions of the Assad regime over the last few years; the brutality against Syrian people cannot just be ignored.\u00a0 And the UK certainly won\u2019t brush that under the carpet.\nBut we do recognize that there is a huge amount of pressure on countries in the region.\u00a0 They seek to alleviate that pressure through engagement with the Assad government in \u2013 or the Assad regime in Damascus.\u00a0 (Inaudible) if they are going to do that, then my strong view is that they should make sure that any steps that they take are more than matched by fundamental changes in behavior from the Assad regime and commitments that are then adhered to in line with 2254.\nAgain, with regard to Pakistan, I\u2019ve seen the headlines.\u00a0 I have not yet had the opportunity to be briefed in detail.\u00a0 The UK has a longstanding and close relationship with Pakistan.\u00a0 We are Commonwealth partners.\u00a0 We want to see peaceful democracy in that country.\u00a0 We want to see the rule of law adhered to.\u00a0 I\u2019m uncomfortable to speculate any further without having a detailed briefing on that.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll \u2013 final question \u2013 go to Nick Allen of\u00a0The Telegraph.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 If I could turn to trade, please.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, how do you address concerns on the other side of the Atlantic about the Inflation Reduction Act?\u00a0 What do you say to allies who might feel it\u2019s protectionist at their expense?\nAnd Foreign Secretary, in the absence of an FTA, and with the emergence of the Inflation Reduction Act, what specifically are you pushing for to boost joint economic security and the bilateral investment relationship between the two countries?\u00a0 For example, was there any discussion today about critical minerals and a deal similar to the one with Japan?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I think as we\u2019ve said over these last months, our primary focus with the Inflation Reduction Act was making sure that we\u2019re making the appropriate investments in ourselves to make sure that we can deliver when it comes to continuing to produce the technologies that are necessary both for dealing with the climate crisis and that are going to be, I think, central to 21st century economies.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what the act is all about.\u00a0 This is a historic commitment to dealing with climate and also a historic commitment to making sure that our economy is producing the very things that will be front and center for economies around the world over the next decades.\nBut as we\u2019ve also said very clearly, the intent is broader than that in terms of making sure that, collectively, with countries around the world that have a similar approach and are of similar mind, that we\u2019re working together to build the strongest possible collective infrastructure, supply chains, ecosystem to produce those technologies.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also worked to make sure that to the extent there were any unintended consequences coming from the act, that we\u2019ve addressed those, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working to do, I think successfully, over the recent months.\u00a0 This is not at all zero sum.\u00a0 On the contrary, I think it offers the prospects for a collective race to the top, not a race to the bottom when it comes to both addressing the climate crisis and making sure that our economies are producing the very technologies that are going to be front and center in the 21st century global economy and making sure that our countries collectively are doing that and that we are producing the strongest possible diversified and resilient supply chains.\nAll of these things are connected.\u00a0 I think there are profound benefits in the IRA for many of our partners around the world because, again, we will be increasingly joined in a supply chain that we\u2019ve been working to build.\u00a0 So I suspect that when the prime minister is here, we\u2019ll continue with that conversation.\u00a0 As the foreign secretary said, we continue to look at ways to strengthen and deepen what is already an extraordinarily strong economic partnership between our countries.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Nate, I know FTAs are often used as a shorthand for closer economic partnerships.\u00a0 We are not prioritizing an FTA with the United States of America because there are many areas where we can work more closely, more collaboratively, have real economic coordination that does not require the traditional kind of tariff-reducing elements of an FTA.\nOne of the advantages of being able to speak directly and regularly is the ability to coordinate and make sure that the completely understandable and correct desire of every government to make sure that it protects itself against future economic coercion \u2013 for example, that it protects itself against pinch points of critical elements of its supply chain, and that is right and proper that governments seek to do that.\nBut in doing so, it also seeks the opportunity to work closely with likeminded friends and economic allies in the same way that we are amongst the strongest defensive allies in the world as two member states of NATO.\u00a0 We are intelligence-sharing partners through the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship.\u00a0 The UK is also seeking to build an economic alliance which protects the interests of the United States of America while simultaneously protecting the UK\u2019s interests, protects standards, protects against the use of constrictions of key elements of global supply chains as a form of political or \u2013 as a form of coercion.\nAnd all these things are best done in close coordination, which is why \u2013 whether it\u2019s in Japan or in London or in Washington or anywhere else \u2013 we always take the opportunity to discuss, as we do the situation in Ukraine, those other immediate pressing issues, but also some of the long-term ways that we can work more collaboratively to protect those things that Tony quoted that I\u2019ve said in the past: the things that make us healthier and wealthier and more prosperous and safer.\u00a0 And I have no doubt that when my prime minister comes to the United States next month that\u2019ll be very much on the agenda that he discusses with President Biden.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Burdell \u2013 as America\u2019s next ambassador to France.\u00a0 He\u2019s earned it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, to get down to business.\u00a0 Before we get to where you\u2019re headed, let\u2019s just take a moment to reflect on where you\u2019ve come from, or better said, who you\u2019ve come from. \u00a0The people, as you heard the president say, who helped get you to this day, who always believed in you, even when you were a ramblin\u2019 wreck; the people who put their heads down so that you could lift yours up: moms and dads, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, grandparents, best friends.\nMany of them are here today cheering you on, and those who can\u2019t be, are part of who you are.\nThis is their day, too.\u00a0 So let\u2019s give them big round of applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nClass of 2023, I have to tell you I remember almost nothing about what the commencement speaker said at my college graduation.\u00a0 Not because it was a terrible speech \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 or because it was a long time ago \u2013 it was \u2013 but because my mind was elsewhere.\u00a0 And I suspect that may be the case for many, if not most, of you today.\nGraduation is one of those moments when your past, your present, your future all seem to be converging at once.\u00a0 You feel, rightly, immensely proud of what you\u2019ve achieved \u2013 and, at the same time, maybe a little bit anxious or even outright terrified about what you\u2019ll do next.\u00a0 It\u2019s a time when the question of who you are \u2013 and who you\u2019ll become \u2013 looms large.\nI can tell you from experience:\u00a0 It\u2019s a question you\u2019ll probably be grappling with years to come.\nSo I thought the most useful thing that I could do today is to share a few tips from my own experience about how to navigate the periods of uncertainty that lie ahead.\nFirst, get comfortable with what you don\u2019t know.\nTwo decades ago, I was hired as the staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u00a0 A big part of that job was fielding questions from senators, especially the chairman of the committee \u2013 a guy named Joe Biden \u2013 like how much aid we\u2019d given a foreign country over the last decade, or how long judges served on their supreme court.\nA lot of the time, I didn\u2019t have the answer.\nNow, when you get asked a question you don\u2019t know \u2013 especially by your boss \u2013 it\u2019s easy to feel like everyone will realize you\u2019re an impostor.\u00a0 You might be tempted to wing it \u2013 to fake it \u2018til you make it.\nDon\u2019t do it.\u00a0 Memorize this answer instead: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nI still use this line, including in Cabinet meetings with my boss, who\u2019s now President Biden.\nHere\u2019s why:\u00a0 If you give your boss bad information because you\u2019re too embarrassed to admit that you don\u2019t know, you\u2019re on the way to losing their confidence.\nIt\u2019s getting the right answer that matters, even if it takes some time to find it.\nThat\u2019s important when you\u2019re the one in charge, too, because acknowledging that there are things that you don\u2019t know signals to your team that they can also be honest with you.\nAnd it\u2019s also okay not to have the answers to the big questions like what you\u2019re going to do with your life.\u00a0 Everyone struggles with those.\nNow, you probably wouldn\u2019t know that from people\u2019s Instagram or LinkedIn accounts, where everyone seems to be crushing it.\u00a0 But remember, these are kind of like the real-world versions of George P. Burdell \u2013 they\u2019re highlight reels with the toughest parts edited out.\nYou never know what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s life, so err on the side of grace.\u00a0 And don\u2019t compare their outsides to your insides.\u00a0 Focus on your own journey.\u00a0 Be patient with yourself \u2013 you\u2019ll get there.\u00a0 You just may just need to wander a little bit first.\nWandering is how Buckminster Fuller \u2013 one of our nation\u2019s greatest innovators \u2013 found his way.\nHe was born in 1898[i].\u00a0 He failed out of Harvard \u2013 twice.\u00a0 He joined the Navy; he started a family.\u00a0 He had a successful construction company.\u00a0 Then his world unraveled.\u00a0 He lost his three-year-old daughter to a terrible illness; soon after that, he lost his job.\u00a0 Broke, sad, depressed, he considered two paths: either he would take his own life, or he would fully dedicate himself to serving humanity.\nBucky chose life, but he had no idea where to direct his new sense of purpose.\u00a0 He spent two years rigorously observing the world around him, driven by the belief that nature\u2019s patterns would teach him how to use technology to improve people\u2019s lives.\nHis first discovery was inspired by the triangular structures of spider webs and the branches of trees, which led to his realization that the right combination of tension and compression could make light, flexible structures incredibly strong.\nHe called the principle \u201ctensegrity,\u201d and designed an entire home based on it, whose lightweight parts could fit into a single shipping container.\u00a0 It was Bucky\u2019s answer to affordable and sustainable housing, and when\u00a0Fortune Magazine\u00a0put his prototype on its cover, he received 30,000 unsolicited offers.\nBucky led a wildly prolific life.\u00a0 He earned 25[ii]\u00a0patents in everything from cartography to car design, all focused on serving humanity.\u00a0 To this day, his designs are all around us.\nI was in Montreal recently, and we had a town hall at the U.S. pavilion from the 1967 World Expo \u2013 a geodesic dome that\u2019s over 20 stories high.\u00a0 Bucky designed it.\u00a0 And the mace that Vice Provost Jacobs carried when leading you out onto the field today \u2013 its design is based on Bucky\u2019s principle of tensegrity.\nSo get comfortable with not having answers.\u00a0 The search for them will lead to your most important discoveries.\nSecond, know what you do know \u2013 the principles that guide you \u2013 no matter what changes around you.\nJimmy Carter, of course, spent one of his undergraduate years here at Tech, and he later said that the only way he could \u201cget out\u201d was by getting elected president and then picking up an honorary degree.\u00a0 He had a beautiful saying for our core beliefs, which came from his high school teacher: \u201cWe must adjust to changing times and still hold [to} unchanging principles.\u201d\nThat\u2019s true for individuals; it\u2019s true for nations.\nAs President Biden often says, we\u2019re at an inflection point, when we face defining questions about the future we want and how to get there, including when it comes to technology. The unprecedented leaps in AI and biotech and quantum computing and other fields that you\u2019ve studied are already having a profound effect on the lives that we live, how we live, how we learn, how we work.\nIt can be difficult to keep up, no matter what field you\u2019re working in.\u00a0 At the State Department, I\u2019ve realized that I need scientists and technologists in the room just to tell me whether I need scientists and technologists in the room.\nBut as developments in recent years have made clear, technology \u2013 like any other field \u2013 is not inherently good or bad.\nThis fundamental truth is baked into Georgia Tech\u2019s mission statement, which commits this institution\u00a0\u201cto develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, whether technology makes our societies more or less equitable, whether it promotes or represses human rights, whether it brings us together or drives us apart, that will come down in no small part to what you do.\nThat\u2019s the story of Joy Buolamwini, Tech class of 2012.\u00a0 From the moment she started building websites in high school, she knew that she wanted to use her programming skills to serve other people.\u00a0 But Joy spent almost all her time coding, and little time talking to the people who were using what she made.\nThat changed during her junior year at Tech, when she went to Ethiopia to help the Carter Center build an app to track neglected diseases.\u00a0 That experience pushed Joy to get out into communities where she could interact with people who were using the technology that she was designing.\u00a0 And that contact raised questions, questions she hadn\u2019t grappled with before \u2013 like how seemingly minor choices in language could make people feel excluded, or how to engage people in designing the tools that were intended to serve them.\nJoy found a cardinal direction on her internal compass:\u00a0 Always \u2013 always \u2013 see the people behind the code.\nYears later, she was designing an app that could superimpose the faces of other people \u2013 like one of her heroes, tennis legend Serena Williams \u2013 on top of her own.\u00a0 But the software Joy was using couldn\u2019t detect her face.\u00a0 It only worked if she covered her skin, which was black, with a white mask.\nShe tried out other facial recognition programs \u2013 same result.\nSo she peeled back the code and found the problem:\u00a0 The programs were trained on databases made up mostly of the faces of white men.\u00a0 The result was an algorithm that literally \u2013 literally \u2013 couldn\u2019t see Joy or many other black women.\nBut Joy refused to stay unseen.\u00a0 She took the brave step of calling out the facial recognition software made by big tech companies and the harms that algorithms could cause.\u00a0 She published research; she wrote op-eds; she testified before Congress; she created museum exhibits.\u00a0 She convinced companies to sign onto a pledge limiting their use of facial recognition software, and formed a group of coders to fight for greater equity and accountability in the AI that she continues leads to this day.\nSo like Joy, each of you will have to find points on your compass.\nLet me share one of my own, which has a lot in common with Joy\u2019s:\u00a0 Never lose sight of the people \u2013 the real people \u2013 on the other side of your decisions.\nA great journalist from many years ago, Edward R. Murrow, once told a group of American diplomats that the most crucial connection in international relations is made in the last three feet, by one person talking to another.\nThe more layers there are between us and the people whose lives are affected by our actions \u2013 whether those layers are screens or miles or ideological bubbles \u2013 the easier it is to stop seeing the connections that we can only make in those last three feet, and the easier it is to start seeing people as numbers or statistics \u2013 the other \u2013 rather than as fellow human beings.\nAround the dinner table, when I was growing up, I heard a lot about our country as a beacon of hope.\u00a0 My grandfather came to the United States after fleeing pogroms in Russia.\u00a0 My stepmom found refuge here after fleeing the communist regime in Hungary.\u00a0 And my stepdad was rescued by American GIs after enduring the horrors of the Holocaust.\nSo to this day, when I meet with refugees \u2013 whether they\u2019re Ukrainians uprooted by Russia\u2019s brutal invasion, or Nicaraguans who escaped their country\u2019s repressive regime, or the Syrian and Afghan employees that I met earlier today working here in Atlanta at the Refuge Coffee Shop, I see my own family in their shoes.\nThese meetings are also a chance to hear directly from the men, the women, the children whose fates are too often decided without their voices \u2013 in air-conditioned conference rooms, in policy memos, in spreadsheets.\nNow, some people believe that when it comes to shaping our policies, empathy clouds our judgment rather than clarifies it, and that if we want to advance the interests of the American people, we have to worry less about the hardships and injustices faced by people beyond our borders.\nI\u2019ve never seen it that way.\u00a0 In fact, when I look at the programs that continue to make our country a beacon of hope \u2013 and strengthen our standing in the world \u2013 they almost always are ones where we\u2019ve remembered to see ourselves in others.\nPrograms like the President\u2019s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, which has saved more than 25 million lives and counting in the 20 years since President George W. Bush created it. Programs like the international exchanges that have fostered ties between generations of students, professors, leaders from the United States and other countries \u2013 including President Cabrera \u2013 and I\u2019m so delighted that the Fulbright program can take responsibility and credit for you being here, not to mention your marriage.\u00a0 Programs like our sustained efforts to promote the human rights of women and girls and LGBTQI people around the globe.\nIt\u2019s up close, in those last three feet \u2013 that\u2019s where we remember that the true measure of any policy \u2013 or any app, or any start-up, or any organization, anything else that we do \u2013 is the tangible difference it makes in the lives of our fellow human beings.\nThird and finally, always be open to rethinking the things that you thought you knew.\nThat includes the path you\u2019re on.\u00a0 It\u2019s never too late to change course.\nThat\u2019s what happened to me.\u00a0 I went to law school after college and then headed to a big firm. The job checked a lot of boxes.\u00a0 I had brilliant colleagues, intellectually rigorous work.\u00a0 The salary wasn\u2019t bad, either.\u00a0 But my heart just wasn\u2019t in it.\u00a0 So one year, ten months, two weeks, three days, and five hours after I started, I quit.\nSome of my best friends while I was in law school were film students, and a few of them had recently started a production company.\u00a0 So when I left, they asked me if I wanted to join them, and I said yes.\nI loved movies, and the idea of being part of building something from the ground up was incredibly exciting.\nWe produced a handful of films \u2013 including one about a brooding student-turned-vampire \u2013 no, not Twilight \u2013 and we put on a film festival in New York.\u00a0 But most of the creativity was coming from the writers, the directors, the actors \u2013 not me.\u00a0 Collaborating with them made clear they had gifts that I did not.\nAnd as much as I love movies, I was looking out at a world that was changing quickly, and I was feeling the pull to be a part of it.\u00a0 Apartheid was coming to an end in South Africa.\u00a0 The Soviet Union had collapsed.\u00a0 The people of newly independent nations were finding their own way.\u00a0 There were peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, a growing ethnic conflict in the Balkans.\nI wanted to get involved; I just didn\u2019t know how.\nThen I caught a break.\u00a0 Someone that I\u2019d worked for years earlier told me about an opening for an assistant job at the State Department.\u00a0 I applied \u2013 and I got it.\nNow, it was a pretty junior position.\u00a0 My first office \u2013 well, let me put it this way.\u00a0 The previous occupant of my first office was a very large safe, so that gives you some idea about what the office was like \u2013 basically, a windowless closet.\nBut from day one, I was hooked.\u00a0 Diplomacy felt urgent, challenging, directly connected to improving people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 It was a way to serve my country, which I badly wanted to do.\u00a0 I felt grateful every morning walking into work.\u00a0 I still do.\nNow, I\u2019m biased, but I think you might feel the same way.\u00a0 So I hope that some of you will consider putting your skills toward public service \u2013 maybe even toward making our foreign policy better \u2013 for the good of Americans, for the good of people around the world.\u00a0 We need your help.\nIn my case, it took a few tries, but I found my place.\nAnd I learned something important along the way:\u00a0 I had to be open to starting over.\u00a0 When things didn\u2019t turn out the way I hoped, I had to change my experience, not my expectations.\nLong before he was President, Jimmy Carter was a young dad with three small kids and a promising career in the Navy\u2019s nuclear submarine program.\u00a0 One day he got a call that his father, Earl, who was sick with cancer, was dying.\nJimmy drove from his base in New York to Plains, Georgia \u2013 a town of around 600 people where he\u2019d grown up.\nNow, Earl Carter, his dad, cast a big shadow in Plains, and Jimmy had worked hard to get out from under that shadow.\u00a0 But there was something about reflecting on his dad\u2019s life during that visit that planted a question in Jimmy.\u00a0 Not only was the family peanut farm one of the town\u2019s biggest employers, but Earl was a church deacon, a leader in the Elks club.\u00a0 He served on the local school and hospital boards.\u00a0 When kids in Plains couldn\u2019t afford clothes for graduation, the teachers told Earl and he donated them, anonymously.\nIf the family business went under, Jimmy knew the town would go with it.\nSeeing the community that his dad had worked so hard to build made Jimmy wonder whether it made sense and what it would be like if he tried something similar.\nAfter Earl died, Jimmy struggled with whether he should move his family back to Plains.\u00a0 And on paper, it made no sense.\u00a0 The family business was deep in debt, and he knew little about farming or running a business.\u00a0 He had a bright future ahead in the Navy.\u00a0 But he went back anyway.\nHis superiors thought he was crazy.\u00a0 His wife, Rosalynn, was so mad she refused to talk to him except through their kids.\u00a0 The first year, the farm earned $280.\nBut Jimmy found something different in Plains \u2013 something that he\u2019d been missing for years that he hadn\u2019t been able to put his finger on: a sense of community.\u00a0 And as he and Rosalynn turned the business around, he threw himself into local service: getting involved in the Lions Club, the Boy Scouts, the school, hospital, and library boards, in his church.\u00a0 Then he decided to run for a state senate seat, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nClass of 2023, you have a mantra here at Georgia Tech: \u201cWe can do that.\u201d\nAnd it rings true for so many of our shared hopes and ambitions \u2013 far beyond this campus.\nBut I would humbly suggest, as Zaria also suggested, that the most important in \u201cWe can do that\u201d is not \u201cdo\u201d but \u201cwe.\u201d\nWe can do that \u2014 whether that \u201cwe\u201d is a family, a campus, a city, a country, or the world.\nThat\u2019s certainly true today.\u00a0 Think about your experience.\u00a0 Look around.\u00a0 No one gets out by doing it alone.\u00a0 You got out because you did it together.\nAnd I\u2019m confident that as you reflect back on how you made it to this day, behind everything you\u2019ve done and everything you\u2019re proud of, there is a \u201cwe.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the one constant in navigating all the uncertainty that you\u2019ll face \u2013 whether that\u2019s getting through the times when you don\u2019t have the answers, or figuring out the principles that will anchor you in life, or keeping yourself open to rethinking the things that you thought you knew\u00a0\u2013 you must always, always be guided by people you love and trust.\nAnd so, esteemed graduates, don\u2019t forget:\u00a0 The key to navigating all uncertainty is never trying to do it alone.\nFind your \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 and there\u2019s absolutely nothing you cannot do.\nThank you, and congratulations!\n(Applause.)\n[i] 1895\n\n[ii]\u00a028\n\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken Following a Tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Atlanta, Georgia", "date": "May 5, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It really is a pleasure for me to be here at the Centers for Disease Control to spend some time with our colleagues with whom we have an extraordinary partnership between the CDC and the State Department.\u00a0\u00a0 But I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t start first by saying that we send our deepest condolences to the family, the friends of Amy St. Pierre, a member of the CDC community who was killed in the recent violence in Atlanta, someone who dedicated her career to working on maternal health issues and I know was a treasured member of this community.\u00a0 So we\u2019re thinking of her today as we\u2019re here.\nI also want to say at the outset that it was a coincidence but nonetheless powerful to be here with the director, Rochelle Walensky.\u00a0 She\u2019s announced she\u2019s leaving the CDC.\u00a0 She has been an extraordinary leader of this enterprise.\u00a0 She\u2019s made our country healthier and safer.\u00a0 She\u2019s made countries around the world healthier and safer.\u00a0 I could not be more grateful for the collaboration that we\u2019ve had during the time she\u2019s directed the CDC, and our institutions continue that collaboration every single day.\nWe have CDC experts in more than 60 of our embassies around the world, really the front-line defense for the United States in terms of detecting and then dealing with the outbreak of infectious disease.\u00a0 And we all know \u2013 we\u2019ve all experienced over the last few years \u2013 just how something that starts halfway around the world can have the most profound impact imaginable right here in the United States.\u00a0 So that front line of defense, that collaboration with the CDC in country after country, is making a huge difference.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a difference in spotting something as it emerges.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a big difference in helping build the capacity of partner countries to better detect, prevent, deal with the emergence of disease.\nThat remains a vital collaboration.\u00a0 But there is so much more that we\u2019ve been doing together for many years, working together, particularly on HIV/AIDS around the world through the PEPFAR program initiated by former President Bush, where as a result of that program we have helped save well more 20 million lives.\u00a0 And we\u2019re determined to see that it\u2019s reauthorized and to make sure that we complete the mission, because we\u2019re very close to getting that done, eradicating HIV/AIDS around the world as a killer.\nWe\u2019re dealing now together with Marburg and an outbreak that we\u2019ve seen in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania, where again the CDC and the State Department are joined at the hip in working with the host governments in dealing with that outbreak and trying to make sure that it doesn\u2019t go any further than it\u2019s already gone.\nAnd more broadly, we are working together to try to build up genuine global health security in a sustainable way.\u00a0 The thing that we\u2019ve learned powerfully in recent years is that health security is national security.\u00a0 We know that when health security breaks down, it\u2019s almost inevitably going to have an impact on our national security.\u00a0 As disease outbreaks that go uncontrolled and unmanaged, we have everything from, potentially, societal breakdowns to mass migrations, all of which have a profound impact on national security.\nSo one of the things that we\u2019re doing at the State Department \u2013 another reason for this visit today \u2013 is we\u2019re standing up for the first time a Global Health Bureau in our department to make sure that we\u2019re marshaling all our resources in effectively responding to global health challenges.\u00a0 And we\u2019re also here to learn from the experience of the CDC and to integrate into that effort to stand up this bureau some of the experiences, some of the learning, some of the ways that CDC has done things that will help shape what we\u2019re doing at the State Department.\nFinally, right now the number one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49 are synthetic opioids, fentanyl \u2013 the number one killer.\u00a0 Last year we seized enough fentanyl to kill every single American citizen.\u00a0 So the State Department is working aggressively to build an international coalition to help more effectively deal with the fentanyl challenge because it\u2019s by definition a global challenge, an international problem.\u00a0 The precursors that go into making fentanyl often are manufactured somewhere else in the world.\u00a0 They wind up coming toward us, turned into a synthetic opioid, and then they wind up on our streets and kill Americans.\u00a0 So we need global collaboration, global cooperation, as part of dealing with this challenge.\nHere again, CDC is a critical partner, learning from them some of the best practices that they\u2019ve put into dealing with things like fentanyl, synthetic opioids, sharing some of those best practices with our partners around the world \u2013 that\u2019s going to make a difference in combating what is one of the worst scourges that we face as a country.\nSo in these areas and so many more, this partnership, this collaboration, is an essential part of our national security.\u00a0 It\u2019s an essential part of our foreign policy.\u00a0 And to have the opportunity to come here today to be with the leaders of the CDC, to learn from them, and to look at how we\u2019re going to pursue this partnership going forward is a very important part of my agenda.\u00a0 So I\u2019m grateful to our colleagues here, grateful for the collaboration, and very much looking forward to the work ahead.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-american-foreign-service-association-memorial-plaque-ceremony/",

Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 5, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good morning, everyone.\nPresident Rubin \u2013 Eric \u2013 thank you for making this event happen.\u00a0 To you, to the American Foreign Service Association, the DACOR Bacon House Foundation, the Senior Living Foundation: we are so grateful for everything that you do to support our diplomats.\nAs Eric said, I\u2019m also very gratified that we\u2019re all here today in person once again.\u00a0 It makes today even more meaningful.\nTo every member of our foreign affairs agencies, whether you\u2019re serving now or whether you served in the past, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the critical work that you do.\u00a0 Thank you for your dedication, your professionalism, your patriotism \u2013 all that you bring to our missions around the world.\nAs President Biden often says, we find ourselves now at an inflection point.\u00a0 So many of the actions that we take today are going to shape the lives of the American people for decades to come \u2013 whether that\u2019s meeting the challenge of great power competition, addressing the climate crisis, shaping the rules for emerging technologies, working to prevent the next pandemic.\nThese challenges make our diplomacy more critical than it\u2019s ever been.\nAnd it\u2019s only by working with allies, with partners that we can actually solve these problems \u2013 and seize some of the opportunities \u2013 that are too big for any one nation to face alone.\u00a0 And you are the ones leading the charge \u2013 following in the footsteps of generations of extraordinary public servants.\nLast year, more than 800 members of the Foreign and Civil Service retired, having devoted decades of their lives to this institution and to the American people.\nAltogether, that cohort dedicated over 22,000 years of service to our country.\u00a0 Its members worked in every single bureau in this department, at posts in more than 170 countries.\nThey tackled the most important issues of our time: protecting the environment, defending human rights, aiding refugees, expanding economic opportunity, negotiating peace agreements.\nThis class built and deepened ties between the United States and other countries.\u00a0 They forged new partnerships.\u00a0 They facilitated exchange programs.\u00a0 They issued countless visas and passports.\nTheir actions, big and small, changed the trajectory of so many lives, here and around the world.\nBut today, we celebrate not only what our diplomats do, but how they do it.\nThese jobs, as President Rubin said, require extraordinary sacrifice \u2013 from diplomats who work long hours; from their loved ones who support them.\nThese jobs demand character.\u00a0 They demand integrity.\nAnd serving as a diplomat also requires courage.\u00a0 Right now, around the world, our colleagues are working in war zones, under foreign surveillance, amidst humanitarian crises, in the aftermath of natural disasters.\u00a0 Some experience serious accidents abroad; others are exposed to severe illness or health hazards.\u00a0 Some of our LGBTQI colleagues serve in places where they \u2013 and their partners \u2013 don\u2019t feel safe to be their full selves.\nJust this week, we lost a treasured local staff member at Embassy Lisbon, Rui Noronha, who died in the course of his duty.\u00a0 His family\u2019s loss is our loss, too.\nBut our diplomats face these situations with tremendous heart, with compassion, with decency, focusing not on themselves, but on helping the people around them, who often go through some of the hardest days of their lives.\nSimply put, that\u2019s our mission.\u00a0 And for generations, our diplomats have carried on despite danger, despite difficulty.\nNowhere is that devotion more clearly illustrated than in the 312 individuals honored on our Memorial Walls \u2013 those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\nThis year, we pay special tribute to two more members of the Foreign Service: Thomas Wallis and Elbridge Lee, both of whom died from COVID-19 in 2021.\nTom dedicated his life to public service \u2013 first as a soldier in the U.S. Army, where he completed several tours, and was awarded a Bronze Star.\u00a0 Then, he became a consular officer.\u00a0 He brought a spirit of service to everything that he did.\u00a0 Tom had a special fountain pen that he used only to sign certificates of death abroad \u2013 to make sure that they looked dignified for the families who received them.\u00a0 When he sat at the consular window \u2013 working with foreigners or helping Americans in crisis \u2013 Tom was calm, he was friendly, he was easy to talk to.\u00a0 He also lifted up his team.\u00a0 He was the kind of person who would stop by his supervisor\u2019s office, just to let her know that a coworker had done a great job.\u00a0 He brought this kindness everywhere he went: from the animal rescue organizations he supported around the world, to trivia games, where he was always everyone\u2019s first pick, apparently, to be on their team.\nElbridge \u2013 who went by his last name, Lee \u2013 specialized in information management, and by all accounts he was a natural diplomat.\u00a0 Thoughtful, compassionate, a talented problem-solver.\u00a0 Whether you were a colleague, a friend, a family member, if you needed advice, you went to Lee.\u00a0 And people wanted to be like him.\u00a0 One of his former teammates said that, in tough situations, he found himself asking, \u201cWhat would Lee do?\u201d\u00a0 Lee was proud to be an American, proud to serve his country.\u00a0 So much so that it rubbed off on the people around him, especially those closest to him.\u00a0 Years ago, he encouraged his wife, Josie, to apply to the State Department.\u00a0 She still works here today.\u00a0 His eldest daughter, Naomi, said that her interest in the world and the people in it came from her dad.\u00a0 And when his youngest daughter, Esther, starts college this fall, she\u2019s planning on studying international relations.\nThe State Department \u2013 the United States of America \u2013 are better because of Tom and Lee.\u00a0 Because of their service, but also because of who they were as people.\nTo their family \u2013 Tom\u2019s wife, Monica; Lee\u2019s wife, Josie, their daughters, Naomi and Esther \u2013 we will be forever grateful, grateful that we got to know \u2013 and that we got to work alongside \u2013 your exceptional loved ones.\nWith this new plaque, we honor the permanent mark that they made on this department, and on our country.\nAnd by carrying out their dedication and compassion \u2013 and continuing the spirit of service that runs through every single name on these walls \u2013 we will work to keep their legacies alive.\nMay God bless you.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-bilateral-peace-negotiation-closing-session-with-armenian-foreign-minister-ararat-mirzoyan-and-azerbaijani-foreign-minister-jeyhun-bayramov/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

I want to start by thanking our colleagues, both foreign ministers, their delegations for traveling here and for spending the time here in \u2013 at the Foreign Service Institute, and especially for their commitment to dialogue, and I think a recognition on the part of both Armenia and Azerbaijan that the only path to a lasting, durable peace is through dialogue.\u00a0 The United States is very happy to continue to offer its support, its engagement, its good offices to host this discussion and any future ones toward an enduring peace.\u00a0 That is the objective.\nThe two sides have discussed some very tough issues over the last few days and they\u2019ve made tangible progress on a durable peace agreement.\u00a0 I hope that they see \u2013 and I believe that they do, as I do \u2013 that there is an agreement within sight, within reach.\u00a0 And achieving that agreement would be, I think, not only historic, but would be profoundly in the interests of the people of Azerbaijan and Armenia, and would have very positive effects even beyond their two countries.\nI think the pace of the negotiations and the foundation that our colleagues have built shows that we really are within reach of an agreement.\u00a0 The last mile of any marathon is always the hardest; we know that.\u00a0 But the United States is here to continue to help both of our friends cross the finish line.\u00a0 And as I say, I think we\u2019re very much within reach of that.\nI have to say, finally, that the leadership that we\u2019re seeing from both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and from my friends the foreign ministers, is inspiring.\u00a0 None of this is easy, but the commitment, the determination to move forward, to deal with the remaining challenging issues is real.\u00a0 And we feel, coming out of these few days, that, as I said, we\u2019ve made very tangible progress.\u00a0 A final agreement is within reach, and we\u2019re determined to continue to help our friends achieve it.\nSo with thanks to both of you, to both of your delegations, as well as to Prime Minister Pashinyan and President Aliyev for sending you here.\u00a0 I thank everyone, and we look forward to continuing.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-closing-remarks-at-the-2023-selectusa-investment-summit/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Good morning, everyone, and it is wonderful to see all of you here, so many of you here.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite an extraordinary turnout.\u00a0 And Don, thank you very much for that introduction and also \u2013 and more important \u2013 my thanks to you and to my good friend, Secretary Gina Raimondo, and the entire team at the Commerce Department for the work that you\u2019re doing every single day to drive economic opportunity for the American people and for our partners.\nSo it really is a pleasure for me to be here at the United States\u2019 biggest investment summit with business leaders from every part of the world, including thousands of foreign investors and representatives from the American private sector.\nA very warm welcome as well to the hundreds of city and state leaders here with us today.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the critical role that you\u2019re playing in attracting and welcoming new businesses into your communities and reminding private and public investors alike why it is always a good bet to invest in America.\nSo throughout this week, this group has heard from leaders across the U.S. Government on why the United States is the best place in the world to invest: our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, driving new products and solutions at scale; a world-class system of universities and colleges, fueling ideas and fostering talent; our rule of law, protecting intellectual property, worker rights, fostering growth.\nToday, what I thought I\u2019d do is just briefly lay out how we\u2019re building on these advantages to try to make the United States an even stronger and more attractive place to invest, to do business.\u00a0 And the short answer really is this: first and foremost, by investing in ourselves.\nWe\u2019ve made, as you know, historic investments in our competitiveness with legislation like the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \u2013 transformative laws that make America an even better place to do business, with more resilient supply chains, a stronger and more inclusive workforce, more regional innovation and technology hubs, improved infrastructure, including new roads, rail transit, waterways, airports, as well as expanded fast and free broadband across our entire country.\nBut investment in ourselves is not a zero-sum proposition.\u00a0 Our approach is predicated on building a strong, resilient, and advanced industrial base with our partners around the world.\u00a0 We can\u2019t build everything domestically, nor would we want to, because it\u2019s to our collective benefit to have diversified supply chains across all of our partners.\nWe\u2019re also trying to modernize our economic partnerships to better position us to address the challenges and opportunities of this moment that we share: from combating the climate crisis, to tackling corruption, to driving sustainable economic growth.\u00a0 New initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity will both protect our national and economic security, and that of our partners \u2013 creating closer connections between our countries, more opportunities for our businesses to invest and to thrive.\nAnd we\u2019re using existing bodies to produce results for our people, like the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, through which we\u2019re coordinating our industrial strategies to be complementary to one another.\nThis approach is delivering results.\nSince 2021, the private sector has invested more than $435 billion in businesses across the United States.\u00a0 A third of the investments announced since August have involved a foreign investor.\u00a0 There\u2019s also record demand for our international business leaders to come to the United States, and that\u2019s something that my department is working to facilitate.\nSo far this fiscal year, we have already issued nearly double the number of business visas that we did at this point last year, and we\u2019ve also surpassed the number of business visas that were issued before the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 so that entrepreneurs and investors can attend professional conferences, negotiate contracts, work with their associates, do the countless things that they do to run successful businesses.\nAs has been very evident this week, there is tremendous pent-up demand for more business travel, so we\u2019re devoting more resources and streamlining our processes to help you secure business and work visas for yourself and for your employees.\nOur Bureau of Consular Affairs stands ready to help.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made it easier to apply for these visas, including by launching the Business Visa Center.\u00a0 That\u2019s a one-stop-shop to help international investors access visas for business travel.\u00a0 Later this year, we\u2019ll be piloting a program to make it easier to renew some of our temporary work visas from within the United States instead of having to traveling abroad.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to save time and it\u2019s going to reduce uncertainty for employers.\nIf you go back to 2011, since then this conference has helped bring in more than $80 billion in private investment.\u00a0 It\u2019s supported more than 60,000 jobs in the United States while helping thousands of foreign businesses and investors enter the U.S. market, to the benefit of themselves, their economies, their fellow citizens back home.\nThese partnerships have also helped us advance critical foreign policy priorities \u2013 something that needless to say I\u2019m focused on.\nAt last year\u2019s SelectUSA Summit, the CEO of Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer GlobalWafers, Doris Hsu, announced plans for a new state-of-the-art facility in Sherman, Texas.\u00a0 It will be the largest facility of its kind in the United States.\u00a0 GlobalWafers broke ground last December, and once completed, this $5 billion facility will support more than 1,500 jobs in the United States.\u00a0 But it will also fill a critical gap in our advanced semiconductor supply chain \u2013 crucial to preserving our competitiveness on a technology that is foundational to the 21st century economy.\nOr consider the example of Delfast, a Ukrainian e-bike company that helped us confront the climate crisis by creating a zero-carbon transportation option.\u00a0 Thanks to the connections that they made with American partners at the SelectUSA Summit last year, as well as ongoing support from our embassy in Ukraine, Delfast was able to open its first store in the United States in September 2021 in Whittier, California.\u00a0 They are growing very quickly in the United States, with 70 percent of their customer base located in this country.\u00a0 In fact, Delfast has been so successful that they\u2019ve announced plans to invest another $25 million in their U.S. operations over the next year, next several years.\u00a0 That will create another 200 jobs in Whittier.\u00a0 And we\u2019re joined by representatives from dozens of Ukrainian startups similarly taking advantage of SelectUSA to thrive.\nNow, I know Delfast just won the premier award that we issue from this gathering.\u00a0 My only disappointment was that in the long journey from my car through the back stage all the way to the stage, I didn\u2019t get a chance to use one of their e-bikes, but maybe on the way out.\nGlobalWafers, Delfast, hundreds of other companies have used this summit to gain the connections and the know-how to enter the United States market.\u00a0 The State Department stands ready to help your company do the same thing.\nWe have 200 Economics and Business Affairs officers in Washington, D.C., and 1,500 economic officers in our embassies and consulates around the world, across more than 150 countries. \u00a0All have the responsibility to help foreign businesses find the strongest investment opportunities here in the United States.\u00a0 They, along with our colleagues in the Department of Commerce\u2019s Foreign Commercial Service, will be able to help you navigate legal frameworks in the United States, connect you with potential partners, and answer any questions that you\u2019ve got along the way.\nSo to our international visitors here today:\u00a0 The United States is very much open for business, and we hope you choose to invest your time and your talents with us.\nAnd to the U.S. businesses that are here today:\u00a0 We are standing by to continue supporting everything that you\u2019re doing as you grow your businesses both here in the United States and around the world.\nIf the innovation, the dynamism on display here this week is any indication, we have a lot to look forward to, a lot to be optimistic about.\u00a0 So to each and every one of you, thank you for being here.\u00a0 Thank you for taking part.\u00a0 We look forward to doing a lot of good business together in the years ahead.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "May 3, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0The only thing better than having the Secretary of State on the screen is having the Secretary of State in person.\u00a0 We\u2019re very happy that Secretary of State Blinken could join us today to celebrate, commemorate World Press Freedom Day.\nIn our business, we like to cover the story; we worry that we\u2019re becoming the story.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had 67 journalists and media workers who were killed last year.\u00a0 We have about 570 who are in prison around the world in 30 different countries.\u00a0 We have a problem.\u00a0 And I want to ask you about the case that we\u2019re focused on most immediately right now, which is that of\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporter Evan Gerschkovich.\u00a0 Tell us about the efforts the State Department has made to get Evan free, and \u2013 in particular I\u2019m curious whether you\u2019ve been able to talk \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Excuse us.\u00a0 We can\u2019t use this day without calling for the freedom of Julian Assange.\nSTAFF:\u00a0 Come on, you got to go.\u00a0 Come on, you go to go.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 The Biden administration must (inaudible) Julian Assange.\u00a0 Stop the extradition request of Julian Assange.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 What about \u2013 two hours and not one word about (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Take it easy.\u00a0 Take it easy.\u00a0 Take it easy guys.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Not one word about journalist Shireen Abu-Akleh, who was murdered \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 by the Israeli occupation forces in Palestine.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Not one word about Julian Assange.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019re here to celebrate freedom of expression, and we just experienced it.\u00a0 Let me continue, Mr. Secretary, to ask you about Evan Gerschkovich and your efforts to get him free.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first, David it\u2019s very good to be here, to be with you.\u00a0 This is an important day.\u00a0 It\u2019s a somber day, for the reasons that my alter ego cited just a few minutes ago.\u00a0 We know that journalists around the world are increasingly under siege \u2013 under siege in a whole variety of ways.\u00a0 That\u2019s now manifested itself once again very powerfully in Evan\u2019s detention and incarceration, in Moscow \u2013 profoundly, unjustly \u2013 for doing his job.\u00a0 We\u2019re intensely engaged with the Russians to seek his freedom, to seek his immediate release \u2013 short of that, just to get what Russia\u2019s obligated to provide, which is consular access, which they\u2019ve done once but have yet to repeat.\nOur Ambassador Lynne Tracy had a chance to be with Evan about ten days ago; found him of incredibly strong of mind and spirit, which is a very powerful thing in this situation.\u00a0 But we have a country in the case of Russia that like a handful of other countries around the world is wrongfully detaining people, using them as political pawns, using them as leverage in a practice that is absolutely unacceptable and that we\u2019re working both broadly to try to deter \u2013 but also at the same time to try to secure the release of those who are being unjustly detained.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0And let met ask, Mr. Secretary, whether you\u2019ve talked directly to your Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, about this.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I have.\u00a0 I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov shortly after Evan was detained. \u00a0I haven\u2019t spoken to him since.\u00a0 I made clear the imperative of releasing Evan.\u00a0 I made clear the imperative of getting consular access.\u00a0 We did get consular access after that.\u00a0 We have a channel that President Biden and President Putin established, some time ago, to try to work on these cases, so we\u2019re engaged.\u00a0 I wish I could say that in this moment there was a clear way forward.\u00a0 I \u2013 we don\u2019t have that in this moment, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working every single day.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ve done something unusual in these cases, which is to impose the Levinson Act and declare the FSB, the Russian secret police, as a target of your sanctions because of wrongful detention.\u00a0 Tell us about that, whether that was a difficult choice to make, and what specific leverage that\u2019s going to give you in getting freedom for Evan.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Look, the Levinson Act is an important tool.\u00a0 It gives us different and new authorities to try to go at those who are directly engaged in wrongfully detaining journalists or wrongfully detaining our citizens.\u00a0 It includes things like travel bans, like asset freezes.\u00a0 And, look, I think it\u2019s clear that in some cases the individuals who are sanctioned may not be planning to travel to the United States anyway; we have to acknowledge that \u2013 or many not have assets here.\u00a0 But our hope is that by applying it, we can have a chilling affect on those who would engage in these practices going forward.\nThere\u2019s something else, though, that\u2019s going on.\u00a0 For a country like Russia that has already severely isolated itself by its aggression against Ukraine, these acts only further its isolation.\u00a0 Increasingly, the message is don\u2019t come here, don\u2019t travel here; whoever you are, you risk being pulled off the street and thrown in jail \u2013 and that is only going to deepen Russia\u2019s isolation.\u00a0 As we speak, to my knowledge there are no reporters of American nationality in Russia.\u00a0 There are about 20 Russians who are formally accredited here with state media organizations.\u00a0 But if this is applied across the board, and you see more and more countries, and the nationals of more and more countries saying \u201cI\u2019m not going there,\u201d that is simply going to further detach Russia from the world, and that is profoundly not in Russia\u2019s interest.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0As someone who has personally been sanctioned by Russia, this has meaning for me.\u00a0 I want to ask you about another\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0colleague, and that is our contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza.\u00a0 He is not a U.S. citizen, but his wife is.\u00a0 He\u2019s been a permanent resident \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 in Washington and his two children \u2013 his children are citizens.\u00a0 Why isn\u2019t he included in your declarations about wrongful detention, which would have some force in leaving the 25-year \u2013 the harsh, harsh sentence that was just imposed on him?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So first, we deplore what is being done to him.\u00a0 Second, when it comes to determinations of wrongful detention, it\u2019s a process.\u00a0 And there are clear criteria, but it\u2019s also true that these cases evolve.\u00a0 And as we learn more, as we fully understand the circumstances, the details as we are able to look at how people similarly situated are being treated, that \u2013 all of that goes into a determination of wrongful detention.\u00a0 So these determinations are not typically made immediately; there is a process and criteria that we apply.\u00a0 And that does not in any way prejudge what we might do coming up as we continue to look at that case and others.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So, just because it\u2019s important, obviously, to his family and to those of us here at the\u00a0Post, I understand you to be saying that the State Department is still examining whether you might \u2013\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s correct.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 \u2014 declare him as wrongfully detained.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That is correct.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And when do you think you might make that decision?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to put a timeframe on it.\u00a0 Again, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at constantly.\nThe other thing I\u2019d say is this, because I think it\u2019s important:\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to fight back and push back around the world to help journalists, who \u2013 in one way or another, are facing intimidation, coercion, persecution, prosecution, surveillance.\u00a0 We have a fund, a technology fund, to try to get technology in the hands of journalists and other civil society advocates to make sure that they can continue even in a surveillance state to communicate with each other and to be connected to the outside world.\u00a0 We have a defamation fund, because increasingly what we\u2019re seeing in country after country is the use of lawfare, trying to put journalists and put media enterprises out of business by litigation.\u00a0 We now have a defamation fund that journalists and independent media can tap into to help defend themselves.\u00a0 We have a program to try to help journalists protect themselves \u2013 physically, or in cyberspace \u2013 from intimidation and coercion by states.\u00a0 We contribute tens of millions of dollars into a media freedom fund for independent media to bolster their capacity to continue doing business even in very difficult places.\u00a0 And we\u2019re part of a Media Freedom Coalition, about 52 countries, pooling resources, pooling information, sharing expertise and knowledge with journalists and independent media enterprises around the world.\nSo, it\u2019s not just a matter of putting a spotlight on this, as we do every day.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just a matter of engaging country after country where journalists are being in one way or another mistreated.\u00a0 We\u2019re actually trying to get tools in the hands of journalists and independent media so that they can push back, so that they can sustain what they\u2019re doing.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful, obviously, for the support of all countries in the United Nations, the United States leading among them, in recognizing World Press Freedom Day and taking this issue seriously, as Secretary-General Guterres did in his comments this week.\nI want to ask you briefly about another\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0colleage \u2013 I wish this list was shorter \u2013 and that\u2019s Austin Tice, who was a contributor to\u00a0The Washington Post, who\u2019s been missing in Syria now for many years.\u00a0 His mother, Debra, told CBS News this week that she wants to see the same urgency and commitment that she hears from top levels trickle down through the State Department, throughout the administration, and that the assurances that have been given that her son will someday be free be realized.\u00a0 What would be your response to Debra Tice, Austin\u2019s mother?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well first, David, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet with Debra Tice on a couple of occasions.\u00a0 I can\u2019t begin to tell you my admiration for her, the extraordinary courage that she and the family have shown, the resilience that they\u2019ve shown.\u00a0 I can\u2019t begin to put myself in her shoes \u2013 almost 11 years now that Austin has been taken and separated from her, from his family, from his friends.\u00a0 And her absolute determination, relentless determination to do everything in her power to push for his freedom is beyond admirable.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really \u2013 I think humility in the face of that is what really comes to mind.\nAnd I know when you\u2019re in the shoes of someone like Debra Tice \u2013 and unfortunately we have 60 or so American families who have their loved ones wrongfully detained somewhere around the world; I\u2019ve met virtually or in person with every single one of them \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly frustrating, because you want to see something happening every single day.\u00a0 And often we\u2019re engaged in efforts to get people home that we can\u2019t talk about even with the families.\nWhat I can say is this:\u00a0 We\u2019re extensively engaged with regard to Austin \u2013 engaged with Syria, engaged with third countries \u2013 seeking to find a way to get him home.\u00a0 And we\u2019re not going to relent until we do.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Let\u2019s \u2013 as more Arab countries establish diplomatic relations with Syria, that\u2019s one hope that we have, is that that leverage will be used to get freedom for him.\nBefore we leave this general topic, I want to ask you a question from a member of our audience, which is a good one.\u00a0 This is from Ramunas Bigalus (ph) in Connecticut.\u00a0 The question is:\u00a0 \u201cShould the State Department warn all journalists to avoid travel to Russia and Belarus?\u201d\u00a0 Given the situation you described, given the threats that are so obvious, should the State Department be saying flatly, \u201cWe don\u2019t think you should go at all\u201d?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, the truth is we\u2019ve instituted something in our travel warnings \u2013 a D indicator, as we call it \u2013 to make sure that every American who is contemplating travel to a certain group of countries understands that they engage in this practice of wrongful detention, so that at least people are put on notice.\nNow, I recognize journalists are in a different category.\u00a0 It\u2019s your job to shine a light everywhere in the world, including in the darkest corners.\u00a0 And\u00a0that comes with extraordinary risk.\u00a0 So yes, as a government we can certainly recommend that anyone with a U.S. passport strongly reconsider traveling to a handful of countries that are known to do this, and we\u2019d say the same thing to journalists.\u00a0 But I also recognize that you feel that you have a job to do, it\u2019s an invaluable job, and ultimately journalists have to balance that risk, calculate that risk.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I have to say we are in the business of ignoring those risks, and going to places where people tell us not to go, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change.\u00a0 I hope it doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 So we wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs as journalists \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if I didn\u2019t ask a little bit about the news of the day, because there\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 And I want to start with the new overnight from the Kremlin, accusing Ukraine of having tried to assassinate President Vladimir Putin with a drone strike on the Kremlin near his residence.\u00a0 Ukraine has denied doing this.\nI want to ask the question this way:\u00a0 What is the United States position on such attacks, on leadership during this war by Ukraine or other combatants?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, I\u2019ve seen the reports.\u00a0 I can\u2019t in any way validate them; we simply don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Second, I would take anything out of the Kremlin with a very large shaker of salt.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s see \u2013 we\u2019ll see what the facts are.\u00a0 And it\u2019s really hard to comment or speculate on this without really knowing what the facts are.\nMore generally, as I\u2019ve said and as we\u2019ve said, when it comes to Ukraine \u2013 which is under daily assault \u2013 and not just its incredibly courageous military forces, but its citizens \u2013 its men, women, and children \u2013 being assaulted on a daily basis by this Russian aggression, being bombed out of their homes, their apartments, and their streets, children killed, families torn apart \u2013 well, we leave it to Ukraine to decide how it\u2019s going to defend itself, and how it\u2019s going to try to get back the territory that\u2019s been seized from it illegally by Russia over the past 14 months and going back to 2014, back to then.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So to clarify, if Ukraine decided on its own to strike back in Russian territory, the United States would not criticize them?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, these are decisions for Ukraine to make about how it\u2019s going\u00a0 to defend itself, how it\u2019s going to get its territory back, how it\u2019s going to restore its territorial integrity and its sovereignty.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 We carried a story this morning that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read in which President Zelenskyy of Ukraine complains about the reporting about the so-called discord leaks, which contained material on almost every imaginable subject around the world, but of special interest to Ukraine \u2013 had information said to be U.S. intelligence estimates that Ukraine was running out of air defense weapons, that this war was likely heading toward a stalemate.\u00a0 Zelenskyy said to our journalists this was not helpful.\nOne thing that the story said was that you, as Secretary of State, had talked to your counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in April about these leaks that were just hitting.\u00a0 What did you tell him?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Without commenting on purported leaks of documents, I can say this generically about the stories that were in the press.\u00a0 What I told him is we very much regretted the unauthorized exposure of these documents, that we took very seriously our obligations and responsibility to protect information.\u00a0 \u00a0We, of course, have arrested someone who is allegedly responsible for this.\u00a0 And at the same time, we were determined to pursue our partnership with Ukraine, our support for Ukraine.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that Ukrainians, as well as many other countries around the world, have benefitted from the extraordinary information that the United States is able to develop and provide that helps support, defend, protect their security as well as ours.\u00a0 I have to say, David, going around the world since then, meeting with colleagues from probably dozens of countries, this has virtually not come up.\u00a0 In fact, to the extent it\u2019s come up, I\u2019ve raised it just to make clear how seriously we take this.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The Ukrainians and President Zelenskyy obviously took the information in these alleged leaks with special seriousness, because of their planned offensive.\u00a0 They\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that they want to push the Russians back, and here were arguments that they may have limited success.\u00a0 Documents aside, you study this every day.\u00a0 This is an anguishing war on your watch.\u00a0 What\u2019s your sense, as we head in the spring and summer, and this long-awaited counteroffensive is about to dawn, about Ukraine\u2019s ability to alter the balance over the course of this year in this war in a way that might make ending the war possible?\u00a0 What do you think?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, this:\u00a0 What was published in the press, in the media reflected a particular point in time.\u00a0 And this is not static.\u00a0 And so, where Ukraine might have been a month ago, two months ago, three months ago is not where it is now in terms of its ability, for example, to prosecute a counteroffensive and to deal with the ongoing Russian aggression.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s one very important thing to keep in mind.\nSecond, we have been engaged intensely over many months with about 50 countries in trying to provide the support that Ukraine needs both to defend itself, but also to help regain territory that\u2019s been taken by Russia over the last 14, 15 months.\u00a0 Lloyd Austin has, I think, worked miracles in bringing together 50 countries in a very coordinated way.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just the equipment that we provide, because while that\u2019s vital, it\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 In and of itself, it doesn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to be able to use it \u2013 training \u2013 you\u2019ve got to be able to maintain it \u2013 we\u2019ve been working on that.\u00a0 And then, the Ukrainian forces have to be able to use everything in a coordinated and combined way, and many countries have been working to support them on that.\nSo, I feel confident that they will have success in regaining more of their territory.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s also important to note that, for Russia, this is already a strategic failure.\u00a0 Russia sought to erase Ukraine from the map, to eliminate its independence, to subsume it into Russia.\u00a0 That has failed.\u00a0 And of course, Ukraine has regained a big chunk of the territory that Russia originally had its footprints on.\u00a0 Where exactly this settles remains to be seen. \u00a0And Ukraine has to make important decisions about exactly where it\u2019s going to go, how far it can get, and how it wants to pursue this.\u00a0 But we\u2019re determined to sustain that support.\u00a0 We\u2019re also determined not only to look at this in the short term with this intense focus on the counteroffensive in the months ahead, but also for the medium and long term.\nBecause what Ukraine also needs \u2013 and what many countries around the world are interested in doing on a sustainable basis \u2013 is to help them develop the kind of military that in the future can effectively deter another Russian aggression \u2013 and if deterrence doesn\u2019t work, to defend against it, and if necessary to defeat it.\u00a0 That is going to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position, as well as helping to rebuild the country and pursuing its integration into Europe, its economic integration.\u00a0 The combination of those things, as well as Ukraine continuing to pursue policies that root out corruption, that put in place transparency, good governance, strong civil society, a vibrant, independent media \u2013 those are the secrets to success, to resilience, to strength for Ukraine over the coming years in being able to resist further Russian aggression.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re walking and we\u2019re running, even, and chewing gum at the same time.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So, that\u2019s a useful summary and a hopeful summary of where Ukraine will end up.\u00a0 I hear you saying they will gain some territory as a result of this counteroffensive.\u00a0 A question that lies ahead after these months is whether there\u2019s some effort to seek a settlement that might include, yes, the United States and Europe, but also China, which has expressed a strong interest in doing so, has a 12-point peace proposal.\u00a0 As I look at the 12 points, many of them are ones that we\u2019d probably write ourselves.\u00a0 What do you think in principle, Mr. Secretary, about the idea of the United States working in parallel at some point down the road with China to seek a stable outcome here?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0In principle, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u00a0 If we have a country, whether it\u2019s China or other countries, that have significant influence, that are prepared to pursue a just and durable peace \u2013 and I\u2019ll come back to what that means in a minute \u2013 we would welcome that.\u00a0 And it\u2019s certainly possible that China would have a role to play in that effort, and that could be very beneficial.\u00a0 There were elements in the plan that China put out, things that actually it had said and many others had said for some time, that were positive.\u00a0 But it has to begin with a couple of things.\nFirst, a clear understanding that in this instance, there\u2019s a victim and there\u2019s an aggressor.\u00a0 There\u2019s no moral equivalence between the two positions.\u00a0 And I have to say, until recently, it was very unclear whether China accepted that basic principle.\u00a0 I\u2019m still not sure that they do, but at least President Xi has now had a conversation with President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 That\u2019s a positive thing, because it\u2019s vitally important that China and other countries that have been seeking to advance peace hear from the victim, not just the aggressor.\nSecond, any peace really has to be both just and durable, and what do I mean by that?\u00a0 Just in the sense that it has to basically reflect the principles that are at the heart of the United Nations Charter, when it comes to territorial integrity, when it comes to sovereignty.\u00a0 It can\u2019t ratify what Russia has done, which is the seizure of so much of Ukraine\u2019s territory.\u00a0 And it needs to be durable in the sense that we don\u2019t want this to land in a place where Russia can simply rest, refit, and re-attack six months later or a year later.\u00a0 So, we have to look at all of that.\u00a0 But as a matter of principle, countries, particularly countries with significant influence like China, if they\u2019re willing to play a positive role in trying to bring peace, that would be a good thing.\nBut, it starts fundamentally with Vladimir Putin actually making that fundamental decision.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not seen that yet.\u00a0 There is zero evidence that Russia is prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 To the contrary, we\u2019ve seen the horrific onslaught, just in the past week, again, on civilian targets in Ukraine.\u00a0 We saw the horrific story of a father in an apartment building who, after this attack, opens the door of his children\u2019s room to find that it\u2019s gone and they\u2019re gone.\u00a0 So, there has to be some profound change in Mr. Putin\u2019s mind and in Russia\u2019s mind to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0One more quick question.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about China.\u00a0 You had a trip that was scheduled to China that you postponed, because of the Chinese spy balloon.\u00a0 And I have to ask you:\u00a0 In a period where there seems to be some warming of relations between the United States, beginning of a thaw, are you hopeful that you may be able to reschedule that trip this year?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I am, and I think it\u2019s important, as President Biden laid out in Bali when he was with President Xi at the end of last year, that we re-establish regular lines of communication at all levels and across our government.\u00a0 We\u2019re in a competition with China; there\u2019s no secret about that.\u00a0 But we have a strong interest in trying to make sure that that competition doesn\u2019t veer into conflict.\u00a0 There\u2019s a clear demand signal from around the world that we manage this relationship responsibly \u2013 a demand signal on us, but also on Beijing.\u00a0 And that starts with engagement, that starts with communicating, it starts with trying to make sure, again, that we don\u2019t veer into conflict.\u00a0 If there are areas where we can actually cooperate, because it\u2019s in the interest of our people, Chinese people and people around the world, so much the better, but at the very least we need to have a floor under this relationship.\u00a0 We need to have some guardrails on it.\u00a0 And the way to do that is through engagement.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So, Mr. Secretary, we want to thank you for coming here, for answering all these questions frankly, and especially we want to thank you for marking with us World Press Freedom Day.\u00a0 This is a period where journalists are under threat.\u00a0 Knowing that senior officials of the U.S. Government, the leadership of the United Nations stand with people in our business in insisting that journalists be free to do their work matters a lot.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0You know, David, we\u2019re also trying, at least in my department, to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.\u00a0 One of the first things we did \u2013 actually, probably the first thing we did \u2013 was to restore the daily press briefing at the State Department.\u00a0 Virtually, wherever I travel, I have your colleagues with me.\u00a0 And, pretty much every stop, we have some kind of press conference, press engagement that brings in our travelling pool but also brings in journalists from the countries that we\u2019re traveling to, including countries that may not have the most open media environment.\nIt\u2019s hugely important to me and to us to demonstrate that we\u2019re holding ourselves accountable by making sure that we\u2019re answering questions, we\u2019re engaging with people who have one of the most important responsibilities in this world, and that is to hold governments, to hold institutions to account, to shine light where there\u2019s darkness, to give people confidence in their institutions, in the people who have the responsibility to represent them.\u00a0 I think, in my experience, there\u2019s actually no more important time for it.\u00a0 I\u2019m incredibly grateful \u2013 even if there\u2019s some days when I don\u2019t feel like it \u2013 incredibly grateful to you and to all of our colleagues.\nThe other day \u2013 and let me end with this \u2013 I got a chance to sit down with Ben Hall from Fox, who was part of our traveling family and then was grievously injured in Ukraine covering the war, trying to shed light on it.\u00a0 Extraordinary story.\u00a0 He\u2019s back.\u00a0 It was just incredibly good to see him and have a chance to talk to him.\u00a0 I said to him when we started the interview how glad I was to see him back, and I said I\u2019d probably regret saying that about five minutes later when the interview was over.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But it was just one powerful example of the dangers that so many of our colleagues expose themselves to so that they can bring forward the story, bring forward the truth, and I\u2019m really grateful for it.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So amen to those comments, and thanks to our courageous colleagues.\u00a0 Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, my friend.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much.\nSECRETARY

you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 It is wonderful to be with all of you here in Denver.\u00a0 And Mike, let me just say to you first off, I can\u2019t thank you enough for your extraordinary leadership in bringing all of this together.\u00a0 The work you did to galvanize the community, to get the support that we needed for this summit, it\u2019s a remarkable contribution not just to this community but to our entire hemisphere.\nAnd I also want to especially thank Governor Polis, Mayor Hancock not just for your hospitality but for your leadership as well in bringing us all together.\u00a0 We picked Denver to host the inaugural Cities Summit of the Americas in large part because of its track record in addressing global challenges at a local level.\u00a0 And that\u2019s really what this summit is all about for us.\nI\u2019m so thrilled to be joined by literally hundreds of mayors and governors, tribal and other indigenous leaders, along with dozens of networks which support them, like ICLEI, U.S. Conference of Mayors, C40 Cities Group.\u00a0 We also want to welcome the many representatives of civil society and the private sector who are here with us today.\nIf you go back to last June, leaders from across our hemisphere came together in Los Angeles for the Ninth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 We agreed to ambitious commitments on issues that actually matter in the lives of all of our citizens: migration, climate change, democratic governance; sustainable, inclusive economic growth.\nEach of you, as city leaders, are on the front lines of tackling these global challenges.\u00a0 You\u2019re welcoming and integrating migrants into your communities.\u00a0 You\u2019re planning for and responding to natural disasters, made more frequent by the climate crisis.\u00a0 You\u2019re addressing the issues that are facing your residents, from law enforcement challenges like ransomware, to public health crises like the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 Your efforts day-in/day-out are helping us make progress on the commitments that we made as countries in Los Angeles.\nCities, when you come down to it, are where democracy is closest to its people.\u00a0 And when cities are responsive to the needs of residents, they demonstrate democracy\u2019s greatest strength: its ability to improve on itself, to empower citizens to hold their leaders accountable, to try out different solutions, and to allow the best ideas to rise to the top.\nWe\u2019re hosting the Cities Summit of the Americas because our collective ability to deliver for our people and to tackle global issues depends on all of you.\u00a0 It\u2019s as simple and as straightforward as that.\u00a0 And we look forward to continuing to elevate your voices in every dimension of our work in the hemisphere, including at the Tenth Summit of the Americas that\u2019ll be hosted by the Dominican Republic.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also why we plan for this to be the first but not the last of many Cities Summits to come.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, what we know is this and what I\u2019ve learned over 30 or so years of doing this going around the world is this:\u00a0 Somewhere, in some part of the world, someone has figured out the solution to a problem that many people are trying to solve; but if we don\u2019t share that information, if we don\u2019t share that knowledge, then everyone else just has to keep reinventing the wheel.\nSo our success in addressing the many issues that we\u2019re trying to tackle right now depends on the best ideas being shared among all of you.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why I hope that the connections \u2013 and that\u2019s the word that Mike used \u2013 is the word indeed that comes back again and again.\u00a0 Connections, interconnectivity.\u00a0 I hope the connections you\u2019ve made here in Denver will last a long time and that you use them to continue to engage with each other, to share ideas, to share solutions.\nAnd as I said, our success depends on these ideas being shared among you.\u00a0 It also depends on national governments learning from you, incorporating the ideas and perspectives of our cities and communities into the policies that we\u2019re making at a national level.\nSo what I thought I\u2019d do today as we\u2019re closing out this summit is to share just three areas where cities are leading the way, and where deeper connections between cities and national governments can make a profound difference in the lives and livelihoods of our people, starting with the first issue I\u2019ll talk about: migration.\nNow, if you step back for a minute and think about the moment we\u2019re in globally, there are more people displaced from their homes around the world than at any time in recorded history: more than 100 million.\u00a0 In our own hemisphere, more than 20 million people are on the move.\nBack at the Summit of the Americas, we came together to try to address what is an unprecedented migration challenge across our hemisphere through something we called the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which reflected the first truly regional approach to the issue.\u00a0 Twenty-one countries agreed that we have a shared responsibility to tackle the migration challenge together, and they agreed on a shared set of principles and priorities, among them expanding protections for migrants who are at risk.\nSo under the leadership of Mayor Claudia L\u00f3pez, someone I\u2019ve had the great pleasure of working with on many occasions \u2013 she\u2019s here with us today, Bogot\u00e1 has been putting this principle into practice since last year.\nI had a chance to visit last time I was in Colombia one of the city\u2019s pioneering migration integration facilities, which offers basically a one-stop-shop where people get a Temporary Protected Status card, they get connected to jobs, they get connected to schools, they get to sign up for essential services like health care.\nBecause of these efforts, Bogot\u00e1 has welcomed more refugees in recent years than any other city in the Americas \u2013 or, as Mayor L\u00f3pez likes to call them, \u201cNew Bogot\u00e1nos.\u201d\u00a0 Colombia as a whole has given refuge to more than 2.5 million Venezuelans who were displaced by their country\u2019s crisis.\nAnd because the protected status that Colombia gives them allows Venezuelans to work, they are also contributing to Colombia\u2019s economy, filling jobs, providing services, starting new businesses.\u00a0 These efforts are driving growth.\u00a0 They\u2019re creating opportunities for Colombians as well as Venezuelans.\u00a0 And they\u2019re showing that we can actually manage migration safely, humanely, and use it as an opportunity to strengthen our communities.\nCity leaders are also stepping up to tackle the second issue I want to talk about, and that\u2019s the climate crisis.\nBack in 2019, the Mississippi River Basin \u2013 and that\u2019s an area that stretches across 31 of our states in the United States \u2013 that basin experienced historic floods, causing more than $6 billion in damages.\u00a0 In the aftermath, mayors from more than a hundred cities and towns \u2013 led by Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons, who\u2019s here with us today \u2013 have been helping prepare their communities for future floods to get ahead of the next problem, the next crisis.\nWorking hand-in-hand with local and global environmental organizations, the mayors and their partners are restoring 66,000 acres of wetlands, of forests, of marshes, and adapting the land to regulate stormwater flow, with a focus on building resilience for communities that have historically been overlooked.\nOnce completed, these restored lands will capture more than 165,000 tons of carbon from the air.\u00a0 Now, that\u2019s the equivalent of taking about 36,000 cars off the road every year.\u00a0 And their efforts are making cities and towns more resilient against floods.\u00a0 When the area around St. Louis \u2013 which is in the basin \u2013 was hit with a \u201conce in a thousand-years rainfall\u201d in 2022, the wetlands there soaked up enough stormwater to fill 750 Olympic-size swimming pools, and that saved millions of dollars in potential damages.\nNow, often innovations at the city level start from the dedicated work of civil society leaders, and that\u2019s the case for the third and final area I want to talk about today, and that\u2019s transparency in our governance.\nIn Chihuahua, Mexico, members of a local anti-corruption nonprofit, Karaywah, came together to tackle lack of transparency in their municipal government.\u00a0 In 2019, when this initiative started, only about 60 percent of municipal contracts were being publicly bid.\u00a0 That meant that many companies were left out of the bidding process \u2013 reducing competition, driving up costs for taxpayers.\nKaraywah teamed up with other Mexican NGOs, with the United Nations Development Programme, and with the U.S. Agency for International Development to put together a digital platform that tracks and publishes open municipal contracts, that follows the bidding process, that allows constituents to monitor where their tax dollars are being spent.\nNow, 100 percent of municipal contracts in Chihuahua City are published online.\u00a0 The tool has been so successful that it\u2019s now being rolled out, free of cost, to 15 other city and state governments across Mexico \u2013 decreasing the potential for corruption, increasing people\u2019s\u00a0 participation and trust in government, something that is especially critical in the times that we\u2019re living.\nOn issue after issue, in city after city, local leaders are pointing the way to effective solutions.\u00a0 This week\u2019s summit shows many more promising opportunities to deliver for our people, including one starting right here in Denver.\nThe City of Denver and the State Department signed an agreement to partner on building early detection systems to track the evolution of new synthetic drugs, like fentanyl, so that we can develop lifesaving interventions early on.\u00a0 We\u2019ll share our findings with partners across the hemisphere, so that we can inform locally-led efforts to counter this public health and security threat.\nNow, this is a powerful illustration of how solutions that we\u2019re finding and answers that we\u2019re finding at the local level can have a powerful impact on the most pressing, most urgent national problems and international problems we face.\u00a0 Fentanyl in the United States is responsible for more deaths among Americans aged 18 to 49 than anything else.\u00a0 Think about that for a second.\u00a0 The leading cause of death in our country for Americans aged 18 to 49 is synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\nLast year, we seized enough fentanyl to kill every single American.\u00a0 That\u2019s the scale of the problem.\u00a0 By definition it has to have an international solution, which we\u2019re working on very hard at the State Department under President Biden\u2019s guidance, but also national and local responses.\u00a0 And I had a chance to see some of the incredibly important work that Denver is doing right here, and I\u2019m grateful for the partnership that we have.\nDozens of cities from across the hemisphere also came together to sign the Denver Declaration, which reflects their shared commitment to addressing the challenges facing our cities, including affordable housing, migration, and the climate crisis.\nAnd thanks to the leadership of Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, more than 45 cities also launched the Anti-Racist Cities Network, through which cities will share best practices for promoting equity and inclusion in our societies.\u00a0 Discrimination robs democracies, including ours in the United States, of the strength, the innovation, the creativity of so many of our citizens, which is exactly what we need to more effectively face the challenges of our time.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why efforts like this one are really important in empowering our full populations.\nTo strengthen the partnership between the United States mayors and their counterparts across the world, we at the State Department recently launched a new City and State Diplomacy Office.\u00a0 So again, people might ask, how is it that we have an office at the State Department to engage at the subnational level?\u00a0 Well, this summit here in Denver demonstrates exactly why it was important for us to do that.\nSince October, Ambassador Nina Hachigian and her team have been working at building the ties that we\u2019re seeing come to full fruition here in Denver.\u00a0 Ambassador Hachigian has held senior positions at the White House, the State Department, and the city of Los Angeles, where she was deputy mayor for international affairs. \u00a0Nina and her team are here in Denver; if you haven\u2019t had the chance to connect up with them yet, I hope in the remaining time that you have you\u2019ll take the opportunity to do so.\nThe city and state diplomacy teams work as a key component, but not the only component, of the State Department\u2019s substantive engagement with cities across our hemisphere.\u00a0 Many of you in this audience have worked closely with our embassies in your countries, in your cities, on a wide variety of issues \u2013 connecting your cities\u2019 businesses with the U.S. private sector.\u00a0 Launching partnerships to strengthen our shared energy security.\u00a0 Combating human trafficking.\u00a0 Promoting global health.\u00a0 In so many ways, the connectivity between our department and your cities is helping to produce real results.\nEarlier today I also had a chance \u2013 and I hope, again, some of you, if not all of you, had the opportunity to do this \u2013 I had a chance to visit the Innovation Plaza at the summit, where many of our companies are displaying solutions that they\u2019ve found to the challenges that you\u2019re trying to address, from accessing government services to recycling and sustainability to housing.\u00a0 These connections, too, between cities and the private sector are another very vital part of this gathering.\nNow, to build on all of this work, we\u2019re devoting additional resources to our engagement with cities.\u00a0 Yesterday we launched something called Cities Forward, an initiative to help cities build a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future.\u00a0 Through this program, which we\u2019re running with our implementing partners ICLEI, Resilient Cities Catalyst, and the Institute of the Americas, we\u2019ll start by connecting 12 American cities here in the United States with 12 Latin American and Caribbean cities so that they can share directly experiences and lessons on everything from how they\u2019re finding new ways to reduce air and water pollution to designing their infrastructure to better withstand more intense and frequent natural disasters.\nWe\u2019ll also support participating cities with funding, technical assistance to develop and implement sustainability action plans that benefit all of their constituents, including those from underserved communities.\u00a0 And while we\u2019re starting with 24 cities, we plan to share our findings with cities throughout our entire hemisphere so that what we learn from this initiative, we can take that and we can scale it.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing a little advertising \u2013 the application for Cities Forward is now live.\u00a0 Consider applying.\nAs you all know well, there is tremendous collaboration already happening in communities across our hemisphere.\u00a0 To cite just one example, look at the work being done here in Denver by community leaders Kristin Lacy and Vivi Lemus, who are also here with us today.\nWhen they first met, Kristin and Vivi realized how much that they had in common.\u00a0 Vivi was born in Guatemala; Kristin had spent years working there.\u00a0 They loved two things: coffee and cooking.\u00a0 They shared a dream of creating a space to build community between Spanish and English speakers.\u00a0 So they started putting away their savings.\u00a0 They got financing from local lenders.\u00a0 A fellow entrepreneur tipped them off to an open space, and city leaders stepped in to help them secure it.\nLast year, Kristin and Vivi opened Convivio Caf\u00e9, Denver\u2019s first women and immigrant-owned, bilingual coffee shop.\u00a0 They source their coffee directly from Guatemalan growers.\u00a0 That allows farmers to earn up to four times the profit they otherwise would, and they use the walls of their cafe as a space to display art that exposes customers to Guatemalan culture.\nConnections like these are leading to tangible benefits for people across our countries \u2013 through greater exports and good-paying jobs that respect labor rights, that give workers a fair shot at getting ahead, providing for their families and their communities.\u00a0 These partnerships are already being built \u2013 not only between our people and businesses, but also city and national governments, labor unions, civil society, multilateral organizations.\nWe\u2019re increasingly bound together through these connections, and what\u2019s so important is that we\u2019re putting them to work, putting them to work to meet the challenges of our time, the challenges we have to face if we\u2019re going to make a meaningful difference in the lives and livelihoods of our fellow citizens.\nPresident Biden has said on more than one occasion that we have everything we need to deliver for our people right here in our own hemisphere \u2013 and work being led by cities across the region, which you\u2019ve shared throughout this summit, shows exactly how we\u2019re doing that.\nSo to each and every one of you who\u2019s participated this week, and to each and every one of you who\u2019s not only participating this week but engaging every single day in these efforts, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your leadership, thank you for your partnership, thank you for the work that we\u2019re doing together as we build toward a more secure, a more prosperous shared future in the Americas.\u00a0 I, for one, am greatly looking forward to seeing all that we can accomplish for our people, and for our hemisphere, in the months and years ahead, following up on everything that\u2019s happened this week here in Denver.\u00a0 Thank you all so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

That speaks volumes at a time when we need those resources.\nAnyway, I was anxious to get a chance to share some of your experiences, and finally I\u2019ll say this:\u00a0 I\u2019m hoping very much that the work that\u2019s being done here and the connections that are being made across our hemisphere continue well beyond the days in Denver.\u00a0 I\u2019m really grateful to Nina Hachigian, who\u2019s leading our efforts in the State Department in what we call sub-national diplomacy, which is an increasingly critical part of what we\u2019re doing, and no one is actually better prepared to do that, having served at the highest levels of our national government but also as deputy mayor of Los Angeles, so not bad.\nIn any event, thank you all for taking some time.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-following-a-meeting-with-mayors-from-the-western-hemisphere-to-discuss-efforts-to-combat-fentanyl/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

the sea is much larger.\u00a0 The number one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49 is synthetic opioids, notably fentanyl.\u00a0 And by its very nature, this is a problem that requires us to work at a local level, at a national level, and at an international level.\nAs the mayor said, you might ask why someone in my job focusing in on this here in Denver, and it\u2019s precisely because of that.\u00a0 Just to give you a couple of quick examples, what Denver is doing so remarkably well both on dealing with prevention, with treatment, with recovery, with detection, with law enforcement, all of that is a powerful example for other communities that may be affected down the road if they\u2019re not already affected by synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\nAnd what we\u2019ve seen here is the United States has been something of the canary in the coal mine.\u00a0 It hit us here before it\u2019s hit many other places, but now we see it picking up in Mexico, in Canada.\u00a0 We heard from our colleague from Vancouver the numbers in Canada are dramatic, and we know it\u2019s going to spread to other places in the world.\u00a0 Our market is increasingly saturated.\u00a0 The criminal enterprises that are engaged in producing and distributing synthetic opioids like fentanyl are trying to make markets elsewhere.\nSo the more we can learn about how a city like Denver is being affected in dealing with the problems at a local level, the better we\u2019ll be able to share that with countries around the world.\u00a0 But we also need their help.\u00a0 Much of the fentanyl that\u2019s coming into the United States starts halfway around the world with perfectly legal chemicals that may be produced in one country then sent somewhere else, including to Mexico, and diverted into illegal use and used to manufacture fentanyl.\nSo having the cooperation and collaboration of countries around the world to prevent that diversion is critical.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got to get countries involved, we have to get the private sector involved because these chemicals are made, manufactured, and shipped.\u00a0 And all of us together can do a much better job in making sure that these chemicals are not diverted into illegal use and fabrication of fentanyl.\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons why President Biden is building an international coalition of concerned countries to work together to get ahead of this around the world.\u00a0 But at the same time, when I\u2019m going around the world and people are asking, well okay, what is the United States doing about this at home, I\u2019m able to point to a city like Denver that\u2019s leading on this effort in trying to reduce demand, in dealing with prevention, in dealing with treatment, in dealing effectively with law enforcement.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly powerful example that I can share.\nAnd then finally, there\u2019s a big law enforcement component to this at a local level but also at an international level.\u00a0 Much of this is driven by large transnational criminal enterprises that we\u2019re working every single day to break up, to break down, to break down the financing, the production, the distribution.\u00a0 But if we\u2019re not working at every single one of these levels \u2013 at the local level, at the national level, the international level \u2013 we\u2019re not going to solve the problem.\nSo being here, having so many of our colleagues from around the hemisphere here in Denver, to see what you\u2019re doing and how you\u2019re doing it, and then being able to share their own experiences and for us to be able to then build partnerships, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re ultimately going to get ahead of this problem.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really grateful \u2014 Mr. Mayor, to you; Mr. Director to you \u2013 for sharing everything that you\u2019re doing here in Denver, and we\u2019re determined together to get ahead of it.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-state-luncheon-in-honor-of-republic-of-korea-president-yoon-suk-yeol/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

", "date": "April 27, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Please, take a seat.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Please take a seat.\u00a0 Good afternoon, and welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 President Yoon, Mrs. Kim, it is a great pleasure to have you here with us today.\nNow, some of you may have heard this and actually seen it, but last night President Yoon \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 brought down the house at the state dinner \u2013 (applause) \u2013 singing \u201cAmerican Pie.\u201d\u00a0 So, Mr. President, I want you to know we have two great American musical giants with us here today, Herbie Hancock and Diane Reeves.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So if you feel moved to deliver another performance \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 don\u2019t let the music die, Mr. President.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nEvan and I are delighted to join Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, in welcoming all of you here today.\u00a0 And I know we\u2019re joined by an incredible group of friends, colleagues.\u00a0 Particularly I want to salute the members of Congress who are here.\u00a0 President Yoon just came from delivering an extraordinary speech to a joint session.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt has been 70 years since the United States and the Republic of Korea formed our alliance, making official a bond that was forged by Korean and American soldiers in the crucible of war.\u00a0\u00a0Katchi kapshida\u00a0\u2013 we go together \u2013 that was their motto.\u00a0 And indeed, they lived and fought and died shoulder to shoulder.\nFrom the beginning, American and Korean leaders understood that our alliance was about more than our two nations.\u00a0 President Eisenhower, speaking to Congress, said that it was an affirmation of our belief that the security of an individual nation in the free world depends on the security of its partners and constitutes another link in the collective security of free nations.\nIt was also a way to create space \u2013 space for Korean and American entrepreneurs and innovators, scientists and artists, governments and citizens \u2013 to use that security and their freedom to improve our societies in real ways.\u00a0 And who, looking at how far we\u2019ve come since that time, would question whether our partnership has lived up to its promise?\u00a0 We see the extraordinary emergence of Korea in virtually every domain around the world, not just as the strongest of security partners for the United States, but in science, technology, the arts, culture.\u00a0 We have never wavered in our commitment to our mutual defense.\u00a0 We\u2019ve invested in our shared prosperity and competitiveness.\u00a0 And we have decades of mutual growth to show for it, including in the industries and technologies that are shaping the future \u2013 from quantum computing to renewable energy to biotech.\nWe\u2019ve invested in the foundation of our strength, our democracies, while also deepening ties to our partners who share our commitment to freedom, to equal opportunity, to human rights, to the rule of law.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden convened the first two Summits for Democracy, the second of which was co-hosted by President Yoon.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why Seoul will take up the mantle now in leading the third Summit for Democracy next year.\nAs we think about all the ways that our countries go together, it\u2019s easy to take for granted our closeness, to see as somehow inevitable the parallel arcs that U.S. and Korea have traced over time.\u00a0 But the reality is this: the friendship between nations, like all friendships, ultimately comes down to the actions of individuals.\nAnd it\u2019s here that I\u2019d like to express our enormous gratitude to President Yoon.\u00a0 At a time of tremendous challenge to the international rule of law and the United Nations Charter, to our democracies, indeed to our planet, Mr. President, your principled leadership has helped bring us even closer together and has made Korea a global pivotal state.\u00a0 And that\u2019s to the benefit of Koreans, Americans, and indeed to people around the world.\nNow, it\u2019s not just our leaders who are committed to deepening our friendship, but our people, starting with Korean Americans.\u00a0 This year also marks the 120th anniversary of the arrival of the first Korean immigrants to America, a hundred or so men, women, and children who arrived on Honolulu\u2019s shores.\u00a0 Today, the extraordinary contributions of generations of Korean Americans are woven into the fabric of American society, from the sweeping histories of Min Jin Lee\u2019s novels to the explosive flavors of David Chang\u2019s dishes to the exceptional service of diplomats right here at the State Department, like one I\u2019d like to mention today: Julie Chung.\nJulie was just five years old when, in 1977, her family moved from Seoul to California.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t speak a word of English.\u00a0 Her dad got a job on the drafting floor of an engineering company.\u00a0 Her mom worked nights washing dishes in a restaurant.\u00a0 Julie\u2019s mom went on to become a librarian and a church deacon.\u00a0 Her dad later designed a heating system to prevent O-rings from freezing on space shuttles \u2013 that\u2019s what had caused the Challenger explosion \u2013 allowing NASA to restart the space missions.\u00a0 And Julie joined the first cohort of Pickering fellows at the State Department, which encourages the service of historically underrepresented minorities.\nToday, Julie\u2019s dad\u2019s engineering company is working on technology that will help the United States, Korea, and other partners who are joined in the Artemis Accord return astronauts to the Moon, including the first woman and first person of color.\u00a0 And Julie is the United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka.\nIf these are the threads that are connecting the United States and Korea through a single family, just think how rich, how deep the ties are that are binding our nations together.\nSo, President Yoon, Mrs. Kim, all of our distinguished guests, I ask you to raise a glass with me \u2013 and we\u2019ll even find a glass to raise.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 To all the ties that make our nations go together, and to all the places that they\u2019ll take us.\u00a0 Mr. President, cheers.\n(A toast was offered.)\nAnd now it\u2019s my great pleasure to turn it over to the Vice President of the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The Vice President delivered remarks.)\n(A toast was offered.)\nPRESIDENT YOON:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Emhoff, Secretary Blinken, White House Cabinet Secretary Ryan, and distinguished guests:\u00a0 I extend the gratitude to you for inviting me to the heart of global diplomacy, the Department of State.\u00a0 With Vice President Harris, a fearless fighter, and with strong supporters of the ROK-U.S. alliance, it feels as though there is no obstacle that we cannot overcome.\u00a0 It is truly reassuring.\nI heard that the name of this building is the Harry S Truman Building.\u00a0 President Biden gifted me a plaque with President Truman\u2019s words that I keep on my office desk.\u00a0 He granted me this plaque last year in Korea, and the plaque reads, \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d\u00a0 This place reminds me of the devotion and responsibility for freedom and democracy.\u00a0 And as you are well aware, President Truman in 1953, when communism attacked Korea, he dispatched U.S. forces and also put together the UN Security Council and came to our rescue.\u00a0 For the past 70 years, the ROK-U.S. alliance has developed into the most successful alliance in history on the soil that was fortified by the sacrifice of Korean War veterans.\u00a0 The Republic of Korea was able to rise from the ashes of war to become a country with global stature thanks to the power of the ROK-U.S. alliance.\nYesterday, President Biden and myself had an invaluable discussion on where the ROK-U.S. alliance should head towards.\u00a0 And based on our discussion, I plan to develop our alliance in a way that expands practical benefits for the peoples of both our countries.\u00a0 Our future will be brighter than the past.\u00a0 Our two countries will build peace through strength and lead the solidarity of freedom to promote peace in East Asia and the rest of the world.\u00a0 We will further strengthen our solidarity on cooperation in cutting-edge future technologies, including semiconductors, quantum, artificial intelligence, space, and cyber.\u00a0 And the young talents of our two countries will learn from one another and build a free, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 We will also work very closely together in response to pending global issues.\nVice President Harris, Secretary Blinken, and all distinguished participants gathered here today are the mainstays of the global comprehensive strategic alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States.\u00a0 We look forward to your continued support as the ROK-U.S. alliance marches forward.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas at a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Press Briefing Room", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "April 27, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Let me just say at the top that besides being delighted to be joined by Secretary Mayorkas, I also want to take this opportunity to say how thrilled I am that we have Matt Miller joining us as our new spokesperson.\u00a0 Probably have more to say on that in the days to come.\u00a0 But I couldn\u2019t be more pleased, not just for me but for the department and, indeed, for our country.\u00a0 An extraordinary professional I\u2019ve had the benefit of working with over many years.\u00a0 And I\u2019m equally grateful to Vedant Patel, who\u2019s done an extraordinary job as our spokesperson these past weeks.\nIn two weeks\u2019 time, the CDC\u2019s temporary Title 42 public health order will expire, as required by court order.\u00a0 President Biden and agencies across our government have been taking robust steps to prepare for the effect this will likely have on our immigration system, our partners in the region, and the movement of people across our hemisphere.\nSecretary Mayorkas will speak about the immediate impact of Title 42\u2019s expiration and our stepped-up enforcement efforts.\u00a0 But first, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to put this in the context of our broader approach to migration in the region, which we\u2019ll continue to build on in the coming weeks.\u00a0 It\u2019s an approach focused on making migration more safe, orderly, and humane, and on advancing the interests of the American people.\nIf you step back \u2013 and it\u2019s really important to do that \u2013 globally there are more than 100 million people on the move today, compelled to leave their homes in search of security and better lives.\u00a0 That is more people than at any time in recorded history.\u00a0 And in our own hemisphere, we are facing an unprecedented migration challenge.\u00a0 Long-term drivers like violence, corruption, lack of economic opportunity, continue to push people from their homes \u2013 problems that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, crises of governance, extreme weather events caused by the changing climate.\u00a0 Twenty million people are displaced across this hemisphere, and the strain on transit and host countries is high.\nMigration is the definition of a challenge that no country can solve alone.\u00a0 The magnitude, the range of drivers, the push and pull factors \u2013 all demand that we work together.\u00a0 That\u2019s why last summer President Biden brought together leaders from nations across the Western Hemisphere to agree to the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection; 21 countries have joined that declaration.\u00a0 The LA Declaration is an acknowledgment of our shared responsibility on migration, and our shared commitment to work together and leverage the strengths of partners across government, civil society, the private sector, humanitarian organizations, multilateral organizations, all coming together to address this challenge.\nSo let me highlight some of the ways the United States is working with our partners in the region on migration so as to take, among other things, pressure off our borders by giving people alternatives to making a hazardous journey to seek asylum in the United States.\nOf course, fundamentally we\u2019re working to tackle the root causes of migration so that people don\u2019t have to leave their homes in the first place.\u00a0 That includes investing and redirecting and mobilizing resources toward greater economic opportunities, as we\u2019ve done through the more than $4.2 billion in private sector commitments that Vice President Harris has helped to secure for northern Central America.\u00a0 These investments by businesses and social enterprises will sustain and create jobs, connect people to the digital economy, expand access to financing, provide training and education for young people and workers, and improve economic livelihoods across the region.\nWe\u2019re also investing in economic opportunity through the nearly $1.2 billion that we provided in humanitarian assistance across the region last year, and through initiatives like our commitment to work with our partners to train and equip 500,000 local healthcare workers across the hemisphere over the next five years so that more people can get quality care in their own communities.\u00a0 All of these investments will help people feel that they have a future in their own communities.\nNow, of course many of these investments can take time to bear fruit.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working in parallel on critical collaborations and initiatives with partners in the hemisphere to have a more near-term impact.\u00a0 First, we\u2019re supporting host countries as they provide legal protections and assistance to refugees and migrants so that they can thrive in their new communities.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that by delivering funding to schools, health facilities, and other providers of support to migrants, funding the staffing and capacity-building of local asylum centers and systems, and supporting registration and documentation efforts so that individuals can gain and demonstrate legal status, which is critical for access to work, to schools, to social services.\nOur partners in turn are doing extraordinary work in this area.\u00a0 Colombia, for example, has given 10-year temporary protected status to approximately 2.5 million Venezuelans, allowing them to work, to study, to access public services.\u00a0 Ecuador, Costa Rica, Belize are also undertaking similar efforts to regularize migrants from Venezuela and Nicaragua, as well as Peru.\u00a0 We see efforts as well to forgive existing migrant overstay fines, effectively removing one of the largest barriers to regularization.\u00a0 Brazil\u2019s \u201cOperation Welcome\u201d helped over 100,000 Venezuelans voluntarily resettle in places where they have greater economic opportunity.\u00a0 Mexico and Canada are increasing the number of people that they welcome on a humanitarian basis.\nWe\u2019re also working with partners in the hemisphere to accept repatriation flights, increase security forces along migration routes, provide more assistance to migrants and refugees.\u00a0 We continue to surge assistance to host countries throughout the hemisphere to help integrate refugees and migrants, and increase humanitarian aid and protection for vulnerable populations.\nSecond, we\u2019re announcing a 60-day surge of urgent assistance to regional partners to enhance security, to counter smuggling \u2013 an effort that Ali will share more about in a few moments.\u00a0 We\u2019re also working to counter disinformation being spread by traffickers and other bad actors, including by expanding our paid and earned media outreach to high out-migration communities and migrant routes through channels potentially reaching upward of 85 million people \u2013 so that people who want to migrate have accurate information about how to do so legally and safely, and know the dangers of putting themselves in the hands of traffickers.\nThird, we\u2019re significantly expanding access to lawful pathways for migration for those in need, including the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.\u00a0 For too many people in too many places, these pathways feel far from reach.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working to create more opportunities, and to make them more accessible.\u00a0 The United States welcomed six times as many refugees from Latin America and the Caribbean in 2022 than during the previous year.\u00a0 We\u2019re on track to more than double those arrivals in 2023.\nAnd in January, President Biden committed to welcoming 30,000 individuals every month from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, and Nicaragua through a parole program.\u00a0 Irregular migration from those four countries fell by more than 97 percent within the first month \u2013 because people now have a legal and safe pathway.\u00a0 That means tens of thousands of people are no longer making the perilous overland journey to our border, or putting themselves at the mercy of abusive smugglers.\nWe\u2019re partnering with both national and international NGOs to connect the most vulnerable populations \u2013 including religious minorities, political dissidents, LGBTQI+ persons, and survivors of gender-based violence \u2013 to expedited resettlement processes.\nWe\u2019re developing new ways to increase the scope and effectiveness of our migration system, like Welcome Corps, which \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 allows American individuals to sponsor refugees.\nAnd soon we will stand up Regional Processing Centers in select locations in the region.\u00a0 I want to thank Colombia and Guatemala specifically for their role as excellent partners of the United States in these efforts.\u00a0 These centers will be operated by international organization partners and improve qualified individuals\u2019 access to accelerated refugee resettlement processing, family reunification, and labor pathways in the United States.\u00a0 They will also be a referral point for lawful pathways as well, as well as humanitarian and refugee protections in other countries, like Canada and Spain.\nThese centers will take a hugely important step to prevent people from making the dangerous journey to the border by providing a much safer legal option to migrate that they can pursue in and from their own countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new and innovative approach that does right by people who want to migrate, and that enhances security and stability in the region.\nLater today, I\u2019ll have a chance to travel to Denver for the Cities Summit of the Americas, where we\u2019ve convened leaders to talk about how governments can better deliver for their people.\u00a0 And that mission is at the heart of the migration challenge:\u00a0 How can we all work together, as we are, to provide the foundation for better, more secure, and more hopeful futures for all our citizens?\nWith that, let me turn it over to Secretary Mayorkas.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 As the Secretary described, this is a hemispheric challenge that demands hemispheric solutions.\u00a0\u00a0 Working with our neighbors in the region, we can and will reduce the number of migrants who reach our southern border.\u00a0 The Regional Processing Centers announced today will be a critical addition to the programs and processes DHS has in place for qualifying individuals to obtain authorization to enter the United States before arriving at our borders.\nThis is particularly important because we have a humanitarian obligation to cut the smugglers out.\u00a0 We have seen a dramatic rise in the reach, sophistication, and cruelty of the smuggling organizations over the past ten years and the challenges that presents.\nThe comprehensive plan we have developed and are executing takes this reality into account.\u00a0 We are building lawful pathways for people to come to the United States without resorting to the smugglers.\u00a0 At the same time, we are imposing consequences on those who do not use those pathways and instead irregularly migrate to our southern border.\nThis plan has proven effective.\u00a0 Building on the success of Uniting for Ukraine, we created parole processes for qualifying Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, and we expelled individuals from these countries who sought to enter at our southern border.\u00a0 We have seen a high degree of interest in these parole processes and a dramatic drop in encounters from these nationalities.\u00a0 Overall, the number of Border Patrol encounters in March 2023 was down 23\u00a0percent compared to March of last year.\u00a0 When people have safe and orderly pathways to come to the United States and face consequences for failing to do so, they use those pathways.\nAfter May 11th, our court-compelled use of Title 42 will end and we will once again process all migrants under Title 8 of the United States code.\u00a0 This is a longstanding immigration enforcement authority that multiple administrations \u2013 Republican and Democratic alike \u2013 have used to process individuals.\u00a0 It carries stiff consequences for irregular migration, including at least a five-year ban on reentry and potential criminal prosecution for repeated attempts to cross unlawfully.\u00a0 The return to processing migrants under Title 8 authorities will be swift and immediate.\nWe have been preparing for this transition for more than a year and a half.\u00a0 Notwithstanding those preparations, we do expect that encounters at our southern border will increasing, as smugglers are seeking to take advantage of this change and already are hard at work spreading disinformation that the border will be open after that.\u00a0 High encounters will place a strain on our entire system, including our dedicated and heroic workforce and our communities.\nThe smuggler\u2019s propaganda is false.\u00a0 Let me be clear:\u00a0 Our border is not open and will not be open after May 11th.\nToday, we are announcing the expansion of our plan to build lawful pathways and to impose consequences for failure to use those pathways.\nFirst, the Department of Homeland Security is proud to work with the State Department in establishing the Regional Processing Centers that Secretary Blinken described.\u00a0 We are dedicating specially trained refugee officers to the centers.\u00a0 They will interview applicants for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and provide for the swift processing of a greater number of individuals.\u00a0 In addition to refugee processing, migrants may be screened at these centers and referred to pursue additional pathways to the United States or to other countries for which they may be eligible.\nSecond, we are streamlining the long-established family reunification parole processes for Cubans and Haitians so that individuals from these countries with approved family-based petitions can more quickly reunite with their families here in the United States.\nThird, I have directed my team to develop family reunification processes that will extend this well-recognized model to certain individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Colombia.\u00a0 More information about these processes will be available by May 11th.\nFourth, we will continue the successful processes we announced in January.\u00a0 Through our CPB One mobile app, we will enable individuals to schedule more appointments at ports of entry, consistent with Title 8 processing.\u00a0 The Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela parole processes, as well as the corresponding returns to Mexico for those without a legal basis to remain will continue.\nAt the same time, we are imposing consequences for individuals who do not use our lawful pathways.\nBeginning on May 12th, we will be \u2013 we will place eligible individuals who arrive at our southern border in expedited removal proceedings.\u00a0 Those who arrive at our border and do not have a legal basis to stay will have made the journey, often having suffered horrific trauma and having paid their life savings to the smugglers, only to be quickly removed.\u00a0 They will be removed most often in a matter of days in just a few weeks.\nUnlike the Title 42 public health authority, the penalty for being removed from the United States under Title 8 through expedited removal and other immigration laws we will be enforcing is not just removal.\u00a0 An individual who is removed is subject to at least a five-year ban on admission to the United States and can face criminal prosecution for any subsequent attempt to cross the border illegally.\nWe will process eligible single adults for expedited removal while they are in our Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\u00a0 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will be conducting any credible fear interviews.\u00a0 We have expanded our holding capacity and set up equipment and procedures so that individuals have the ability to access counsel.\u00a0 We have digitized processes, surged personnel, and with the cooperation of partner governments increased return flights.\u00a0 We are ensuring that removals are accomplished fairly, efficiently, and quickly.\nFamilies have always presented unique challenges within our immigration system, particularly for an administration like ours that priorities family unity and opposes family separation.\u00a0 Like single adults, families will be placed in removal proceedings, including expedited removal.\u00a0 We are currently focused on utilizing the full spectrum of our Alternatives to Detention Programs, including GPS monitoring and enhanced supervision, such as curfews and expanding case management services.\u00a0 This will be coupled with more stringent measures for those who do not comply.\nThe same principle will apply to single adults and families.\u00a0 They will have an opportunity to seek protection or other relief from removal.\u00a0 If they receive a final order of removal, we will enforce the law, and they will be removed.\nIn addition to our land border, we will continue to confront the challenge of migration on our seas.\nSince we announced our parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, we have made it clear that those who arrive at our southern border are not eligible for the parole processes.\u00a0 We are announcing today that that ineligibility will now extend to individuals who take to the seas and are interdicted trying to arrive at our maritime borders.\u00a0 We have seen too many people \u2013 families, women, children \u2013 perish in the rough seas.\nWe have increased the presence of our United States Coast Guard to interdict migrants trying to reach the United States by sea.\u00a0 We have saved countless lives, and we have returned the migrants to their home countries.\u00a0 That will continue.\nIn addition, we are finalizing the regulation that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security jointly proposed earlier this year.\u00a0 That proposed regulation will incentivize individuals to avail themselves of lawful, safe, and orderly pathways, and disincentivize dangerous border crossings by placing a new condition on asylum eligibility for those who fail to use those pathways.\u00a0 The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security aim to have the rule finalized by May 11 and will swiftly implement it.\nThe work we have been performing to prepare for post Title 42 continues, as I have previously outlined in our six-pillar plan.\u00a0 We are surging resources to our border, modernizing processes, attacking the smuggling organizations with unprecedented law enforcement focus, strengthening our immigration enforcement tool of expedited removal, working to increase information sharing and resources \u2013 having distributed over $130 million this fiscal year with 290 more to be awarded in the coming weeks \u2013 for local communities and their non-profit organizations.\u00a0 We are partnering with nations in the region to address the challenges of unprecedented migration throughout the hemisphere.\nFor example, two weeks ago we reached a trilateral agreement with Colombia and Panama to attack the smugglers who falsely coax people into the treacherous terrain of the Darien.\u00a0 We initiated a 60-day coordinated campaign with Panama and Colombia to prevent the incredibly dangerous humanitarian situation of migrants traversing the Darien jungle.\u00a0 We have made more than 10,000 smuggling arrests since April of last year and seized more than $47 million in smugglers\u2019 illegal property and finances.\u00a0 The Canadian commitment to accept an additional 15,000 migrants was part of a complementary effort to create lawful pathways.\nEveryone agrees \u2013 everyone agrees \u2013 our immigration system is outdated and badly broken.\u00a0 We must tackle the challenges before us together.\u00a0 This includes the potential for increases in migration after May 11 and the strain it will place on our communities, our workforce, and our system.\nThat\u2019s why today we notified Congress of our intent to reprogram funds within our budget to support other emerging requirements across DHS.\u00a0 This reprograming of existing funds will not meet our longer term needs for securing our border and enforcing our laws.\u00a0 The administration requested $4.9 billion for these requirements but received only $2.7 billion in the funding bill passed this December.\u00a0 While the department is prudently utilizing the limited funding Congress has provided to prepare for the post-Title 42 environment, this notification of repurposing existing funds is only a fraction of what we will ultimately need.\nWe know smugglers will seek to take advantage of the end of Title 42 and that the first few weeks will be challenging, but I have full confidence in the dedicated men and women of DHS.\u00a0 We will do all we can to manage our border and increased encounters in a safe, orderly, and humane way.\u00a0 We are working with our regional partners.\u00a0 We are going after the smugglers.\u00a0 We are surging resources to the border.\u00a0 But we cannot do everything that we need to do until Congress provides the needed resources and reforms.\u00a0 We call on Congress to provide the resources we need to continue our work.\u00a0 We stand ready to work with Congress to pass desperately needed reform to our immigration and asylum system.\u00a0 In the meantime, we will continue to do our part, implementing the approach we have described here today.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We will take a couple questions.\u00a0 I see we have a special guest today.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you want to ask the secretaries first.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 It\u2019s Take Your Children to Work Day, and we\u2019d happy \u2013 happy to take a question from you, if you have one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Or you can whisper to Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Well, I think she wanted to ask about the geopolitical and strategic implications of the U.S.-China-Russia rivalry, but that\u2019s a little bit off topic.\u00a0 Instead, she had a joke she wanted to tell, but I don\u2019t \u2013 not sure if she\u2019s got a little bit of stage fright.\u00a0 So let me go ahead and start.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Go ahead, Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 One, for either of you, on the Regional Processing Centers, do you have a target, an estimate, of how many people will be able to \u2013 the capacity for these, like per week or per month?\u00a0 And whether you do or not, if you think that they will be so successful and are truly new and innovative, why hasn\u2019t this been done before?\nAnd then secondly, for Secretary Blinken, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any updates on the Sudan evacuation or non-evacuation situation in terms of the State Department.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Do you want to start, Ali?\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 Happy to.\u00a0 So this is a process that will scale up over time.\u00a0 We are going to begin in collaboration, of course, with the State Department and our partner countries to begin several thousand each month, 5-6,000 plus each month individuals processed, a material impact on the decision-making of people who are seeking relief in a country.\u00a0 The whole model is to reach the people where they are, to cut the smugglers out, and to have them avoid the perilous journey that too many do not make.\u00a0 But we are beginning in Guatemala and Colombia.\u00a0 We are beginning at the level that I described and we will scale up.\u00a0 We are incredibly proud of the fact that we negotiated this agreement with those foreign countries and we hope to expand beyond there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Ali.\u00a0 And Matt, just to add one point on that, I think as this effort moves forward and we establish it, my expectation would be that even beyond the numbers of people who might be processed in a given month, other people, having \u2013 seeing that this is now a way to access legal pathways to the United States that doesn\u2019t require them to, again, take the hazardous journey to our border and to put themselves in the hands of smugglers, and then to come only to be turned away in any event, my expectation would be that many other people beyond those who are actually being processed in a given month will stay put and wait to avail themselves of this additional way of accessing legal pathways.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We have to build it out and we\u2019re very actively working on doing that.\nAs to why this hasn\u2019t been done before, well, I mean, it\u2019s like any good idea.\u00a0 You can say, \u201cGee, why didn\u2019t we think of this before?\u201d\u00a0 But the fact is we\u2019re working on it now, and we\u2019re working to make it real and effective.\nOn Sudan, just a few things.\u00a0 First, we are very actively working to extend the ceasefire.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a 72-hour ceasefire, which like most ceasefires is imperfect but nonetheless has reduced violence.\u00a0 And that\u2019s obviously created somewhat better conditions for people in Sudan.\u00a0 It\u2019s also enabled some humanitarian assistance to continue to move around.\nBut we want to make sure that, if possible, this is extended.\u00a0 We\u2019re very actively engaged on that.\u00a0 I hope and expect to have more information on that in the coming hours.\u00a0 And the focus, again, is on extending the ceasefire and making sure there is humanitarian access.\nWith regard to American citizens in Sudan, a few things to be said about that.\u00a0 We are providing the best possible advice that we can to anyone asking for our assistance about conditions, about safety, about security, so that they can make decisions with the most information possible about what they want to do, whether they want to stay, whether they want to try to go.\nAs you know, the vast majority of American citizens who are in Sudan are dual nationals, most of whom have made their lives and livelihoods in Sudan for years, decades.\u00a0 So these are very challenging decisions for people to make.\u00a0 But we\u2019re in contact with Americans who have registered with us in one way or another, and very active contact.\nWhat\u2019s happened over the last 72 or so hours is that the reduction in violence that we were able to achieve through the ceasefires that we helped produce has allowed partners and allies, in coordination with us, to conduct some aerial evacuations.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing important logistical support to these efforts.\u00a0 This is a collaborative process and we have managed to direct many Americans who have \u2013 were seeking to leave to that evacuation process so that they could, along with other nationals, take advantage of it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s ongoing.\nAt the same time, what happens in these situations is you have people who are not all at once\u00a0\u2013 everyone making a decision in a given moment, at a given time, about what they\u2019re going to do or not do.\u00a0 This changes over time.\u00a0 So people who today think that they\u2019re going to stay put may decide next week, next month, that they want to leave.\nWhat we need to do and what we\u2019re working to establish is a sustained process for enabling people to leave, assuming that the conditions that we see now are maintained, by which I mean on the one hand, yes, a ceasefire, however imperfect, but also ongoing violence, confrontation between the two rival military groups, et cetera.\nAs we\u2019ve looked at this, we believe that the best way to have an enduring capability to help people leave Sudan, if that\u2019s what they so choose, is overland.\u00a0 And we are working to establish a process that would enable people to move overland to a place where they can more easily exit the country \u2013 in all likelihood, Port Sudan.\u00a0 So that\u2019s under very active development, and again, that will be the most effective way to have a sustained process, a sustained mechanism, an enduring capability to enable people to leave if that\u2019s the choice they make.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Tracy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A couple of technical questions and then something broader for either of you.\u00a0 Following up on the regional centers, how many more countries are you negotiating with to set up centers to add them down the line?\u00a0 You have set a goal, I think you said, of doubling the number of refugees to be admitted.\u00a0 Is that realistic given the huge backlog, the enormous demand, and how long it does take to scale up to the 6,000 a month or whatever it is?\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering how many more people will really be helped in these new measures.\nSecretary Mayorkas, you said something I didn\u2019t quite get about family detention.\u00a0 Will entire families now be detained?\u00a0 Is that the idea?\nAnd finally, for Secretary Blinken, you mentioned the global aspect of immigration, and so I wanted to ask about Russians who\u2019ve been coming to the United States seeking asylum, saying they\u2019re fleeing conscription.\u00a0 Many of them are minorities, and it seems like their cases are being turned down.\u00a0 Many have been detained by ICE and a few that we know of have been deported back to Russia.\u00a0 So why is that not a \u2013 why do they not have a credible fear case?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 So let me \u2013 I can take the questions, if I may.\u00a0 So the issue of credible fear, the determination of credible fear is a very case-specific, individualized determination.\u00a0 Our very experienced asylum officers make those determinations based on the facts presented to them as well as their background information with respect to the country conditions.\u00a0 And so they evaluate the claims based on the people before them and the case that those individuals present.\nWe are indeed in discussions with other countries to expand the Regional Processing Centers, and they will have a significant impact on the migratory decisions of individuals in the region, and our parole processes really communicate that fact quite powerfully.\u00a0 People don\u2019t want to place their lives and their life savings in the hands of ruthless smugglers.\u00a0 If they have a lawful, safe, and orderly pathway to come to the United States or another destination country \u2013 like Canada or Spain, as Secretary Blinken mentioned \u2013 they will avail themselves of those lawful pathways.\u00a0 That has proven true through our parole processes and other lawful pathways that we have implemented to date.\nThat is especially true when, if they do take that perilous journey and happen to survive, because all too many do not, they will find that the border is not open and they are subject to removal.\u00a0 And removal will occur in the expedited removal context swiftly, in a matter of days or just a few weeks.\nThe Regional Processing Centers will indeed make a big difference because we are surging asylum officers to work with the international organizations \u2013 the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration \u2013 to screen people very quickly.\u00a0 We are going to be delivering efficiencies in the refugee screening process to move that process more rapidly than before.\u00a0 This is going to have a material impact in a number of ways.\u00a0 One, we will provide relief for a greater number of people; and two, an even greater number of people will wait to avail themselves of this pathway because of its magnitude and the consequence of not doing so.\nWe have no plan to detain families.\u00a0 As I mentioned, we will be employing alternatives to detention, including some innovations in that regard, and we will on a case-by-case basis use enhanced alternatives to detention as warranted.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Camilla.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 The \u2013 my understanding is that the U.S. intends to continue deporting Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans to Mexico if they crossed the southern border unlawfully.\u00a0 So do you know how many migrants or deportees Mexico has agreed to accept, if any?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think Mexico has spoken about it publicly.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 To date \u2013 to date, Mexico has agreed to accept up to 30,000 expulsions under Title 42 per month.\u00a0 That is a decision that they have made.\u00a0 We intend in a post-Title 42 environment, when we are using expedited removal \u2013 our Title 8 of the United States Code authorities \u2013 we intend to return individuals to Mexico from those nationalities.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Leon.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Just a technical question on these regional centers, if I may.\u00a0 If I understood you correctly, you said they were being \u2013 they would be operated by international partners.\u00a0 Are you outsourcing the immigration process?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start with that.\u00a0 No, the point here is to do the following:\u00a0 It\u2019s to take advantage of the fact that international partners have physical locations in a number of countries where they are doing very, very important work, and to be able to bring some of our own officers and experts into these centers so that people can come to them and explore whether they are eligible for one of the various legal pathways to come to this country, whether it\u2019s as a refugee, whether it\u2019s for family reunification, whether it\u2019s for a labor pathway.\u00a0 And that means that it\u2019s a lot easier for people who are contemplating coming to determine from their own countries whether they have a legal pathway to do that, so it\u2019s making legal pathways much more accessible.\nAnd as Secretary Mayorkas was saying, as this gets up and running and as people see that there is now a more accessible way to determine whether they are eligible to come to the United States through a variety of pathways, we believe that that will take significant incentive away for people to instead make this incredibly hazardous journey to the United States, put themselves in the hands of smugglers, encounter all the terrible dangers that we know they encounter along the way in an effort to pursue asylum, and in any event not get in.\nSo that\u2019s the idea.\u00a0 But no, it is reliant on our own people to share the information and to do some prescreening of individuals who come to these centers.\nAnything you want to \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Have you discussed with Colombia about returning migrants?\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\n\n"}, {"url":

everyone, and a very warm welcome to my friend the Cabinet Secretary Mutua.\u00a0 Alfred, very good to have you here, and I really appreciate the good, productive conversation that we had a short while ago.\nHowever, before I turn to that and to the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Dialogue, which is underway today, let me just share a brief update on Sudan.\nOn Saturday, I directed the temporary suspension of operations at Embassy Khartoum, and we conducted a successful operation to safely evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel and their dependents.\nI want to reiterate my appreciation for the leadership of Ambassador John Godfrey and the entire embassy team who managed the consolidation of our people and the necessary preparations for the evacuation under a very fluid security situation, even as they were tirelessly working to broker an Eid ceasefire.\u00a0 I could not be prouder of our team, most of whom are now en route back to the United States.\nI especially want to express my gratitude to Secretary of Defense Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Milley, and the men and women of the U.S. military who executed the evacuation operation with their usual extraordinary precision and skill.\u00a0 They once again demonstrated that they are the finest in the world.\nA decision to suspend operations at the embassy, remove our personnel from their assigned post, is among the most difficult that any Secretary has to make.\u00a0 But my first priority is the safety of our people, and I determined that the deteriorating security conditions in Khartoum posed an unacceptable risk to keeping our team there at this time.\nI want to be clear that even as we have temporarily suspended operations on the ground in Khartoum, our diplomatic and consular work in Sudan continues.\u00a0 Indeed, in just the last 36 hours since the embassy evacuation operation was completed, we\u2019ve continued to be in close communication with U.S. citizens and individuals affiliated with the U.S. Government to provide assistance and facilitate available departure routes for those seeking to move to safety via land, air, and sea.\nThis includes Americans who are traveling overland in the UN convoy from Khartoum to Port Sudan.\u00a0 We also continue to coordinate with allies and partners who are conducting their own operations, and to leverage those efforts to include Americans.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking further steps to support Americans and are exploring options to return the diplomatic and consular presence to Sudan as soon as possible.\nWe also continue to engage directly with General Burhan and General Hemedti to press them to extend and expand the Eid ceasefire to a sustainable cessation of hostilities that prevents further violence and upholds humanitarian obligations.\u00a0 The Sudanese people are not giving up on their aspirations for a secure, free, and democratic future; neither will we.\nThe United States will work with all parties, in coordination with regional and international partners, to bring an end to the fighting and a return to the transition to a civilian government.\nKenya, under President Ruto, has been a strong partner in this effort.\u00a0 And indeed, Kenya is a security leader throughout the region.\u00a0 That\u2019s evident not only in its commitment to resolving the current crisis in Sudan, but also in its support for United Nations and African Union peacekeeping efforts and the counterterrorism mission in Somalia, in its partnership to reach the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Ethiopia, and in its stewardship of the Nairobi process to advance peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAnd over the last two years, its tenure on the UN Security Council, Kenya has consistently stood up for the UN Charter and focused members on addressing the humanitarian and human rights crises across the continent and beyond.\nBeyond peace and security, Kenya and the United States are partnering on a wide range of issues.\u00a0 And that\u2019s reflected in the breadth of topics that we\u2019re tackling in the Strategic Dialogue.\u00a0 One of the major focuses we had today is public health, an area in which Kenya is demonstrating its potential to be a regional and indeed a global leader.\u00a0 The United States is supporting Kenyan-led vaccine production, including through Moderna\u2019s $500 million investment in a new manufacturing facility near Nairobi, which will produce mRNA vaccines to tackle viruses from COVID-19 to Ebola, from RSV to HIV.\nKenya remains at the forefront of the global HIV response.\u00a0 Today that\u2019s nearly reached \u2013 and has nearly reached \u2013 excuse me \u2013 its 95-95-95 targets: diagnose 95 percent of all HIV\u2011positive individuals, provide anti-retroviral therapy for 95 percent of those diagnosed, and achieve viral suppression for 95 percent of those treated.\u00a0 That is a tremendous milestone that is saving countless lives, and we\u2019re proud to have supported this effort over two decades with PEPFAR as it\u2019s been operating in Kenya.\u00a0 Now, we\u2019re building on that success by moving to a Kenya-owned, Kenya-driven, and Kenya-funded framework that will position the country to achieve sustained HIV epidemic control by 2025.\nHealth security and food security are closely intertwined.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard loudly and clearly from African leaders that emergency aid cannot be the only solution.\u00a0 So we\u2019re investing in sustainable, long-term African food production.\u00a0 That includes our work, with the AU and the UN, to invest in nutritious, climate-resilient crops and develop climate-smart agriculture.\u00a0 And it includes mobilizing the private sector in that effort.\nPresident Ruto recently announced 14 investments valued at over $150 million by private firms in Kenya\u2019s agro-industrial productivity.\u00a0 In total, these new partnerships will create over 20,000 Kenyan jobs, boost incomes by \u2013 for more than 1 million smallholder farmers, and increase sales and exports by over $130 million \u2013 while, of course, dramatically increasing local crop production and reducing malnutrition.\nU.S. companies are eager to invest in Kenya\u2019s success.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to supporting U.S. investment in Kenya \u2013 particularly in key sectors like information and communications technologies, agriculture, renewable energy \u2013 which will help Kenya achieve its goal of reaching upper-middle income status by 2030, while creating jobs and opportunity for people in both our countries.\nFinally, we\u2019re discussing through the Strategic Dialogue how the United States can continue to support Kenya\u2019s democratic progress.\u00a0 Its recent and fair elections and orderly and peaceful transition of power are a model for the region \u2013 demonstrating the commitment of its people, civil society, and leaders to transparent governance that is accountable to its citizens.\nSo we have made a lot of progress, and we\u2019re proud of it, and we have a lot on the agenda today.\u00a0 And as with all of our Strategic Dialogues, particularly with Kenya, the work of today is also the work of the 364 days that follow.\u00a0 This is an effort that takes place day-in, day-out between our governments, between our officials, between our experts, but also between our private sectors, our civil societies, our citizens, building, strengthening a partnership between our countries.\nI want to thank the cabinet secretary for his commitment to advancing this agenda, and Alfred, the floor is yours.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I\u2019m very happy to be here with my team.\u00a0 And I want to thank you for the warm welcome that you have given to us and the hospitality, and this Strategic Dialogue that is very important for both our countries, and not just both our countries, but also the African continent.\nLet me start the way you finished, and that is the issue of democracy.\u00a0 Kenya prides itself to be a democratic country that believes in the rights of the people to be able to go to the ballot box and choose their leaders and to live in a stable country where there\u2019s economic growth.\u00a0 And we want to thank the United States for the support you\u2019ve given us over the years in ensuring that we have a democratic country.\u00a0 And we will continue expounding the views and the principles and philosophies of true democracy as it is and stability in the region.\nKenya is open for business, as we usually say.\u00a0 We are moving into an era where we are saying we want more trade, not aid.\u00a0 Kenya is well placed in the African continent to be a hub for American investors.\u00a0 In the African continent, we now have the African Continental Free Trade Area, with a population of 1.3 billion people.\u00a0 When you come and invest in Kenya, it means you\u2019re investing in the continent of Africa.\u00a0 You\u2019re able to supply your goods, you\u2019re coming from a hub that can able to help you.\u00a0 We have worked very closely with American companies, and we had a very good Chamber of Commerce meeting in Nairobi, where a raft of new initiatives were announced to enable people to be able to \u2013 American farms to be able to come and invest in Kenya.\u00a0 So welcome, Americans, to come and invest in Kenya as you continue.\nIn the area of our cooperation and Strategic Dialogue, you mentioned Moderna as a company that is about to break ground in Kenya.\u00a0 We welcome more companies to come to Kenya, because we\u2019ve always been very good partners, and we\u2019ll continue working well together.\nIn this Strategic Dialogue, I think we\u2019re also talking about issues of climate change.\u00a0 The reality is that it is not a matter of when but if the world has transitioned from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\u00a0 Kenya, we\u2019re at a good place and only 2 percent of our energy is renewable energy, using hydro, geothermal, solar, and wind.\u00a0 And we want to grow that to 100 percent by 2030.\u00a0 And we want to work with American farms and American Government towards supporting the production of green hydrogen, which is what the future will need.\nSo we have looked at the past.\u00a0 We have fossil fuels.\u00a0 We\u2019ve decided not to tap into them because the environment is very important.\u00a0 We have to protect now for future, otherwise the world will not be in a very, very good place.\u00a0 So we want to be able to work together in those many ways.\nWe\u2019ll be discussing many issues, ranging from security, peace in the region \u2013 as you know, Kenya has been quite involved in the mediation in Ethiopia, and also looking at what you can do for Democratic Republic of Congo.\u00a0 COVID has taught us that what happens in one part of the world will happen \u2013 will have an influence or an impact on what happens in the rest of the world.\u00a0 So we want to acknowledge the support we have been receiving, and the comradeship between us and the United States in terms of bringing peace to the region.\u00a0 And we are committed to be the peacemakers of the continent of Africa, if not the world, looking at silencing the guns, people sitting down and being able to work together.\nIt is in the same spirit we are talking about the Russia and Ukraine conflict where Kenya recognizes Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders, and we\u2019ve been calling for cessation of hostilities, and the steps that have been taken so far to tell others that you cannot roll back history.\u00a0 We\u2019re at a place we are by now; we have to move forward.\u00a0 You can\u2019t start claiming countries, or claiming countries that are part of you.\u00a0 Nostalgia is not the order of the day now.\u00a0 We need people to be respected, they need peace and security, and we have to have a system where we don\u2019t let things get out of hand.\u00a0 Because today it\u2019s Ukraine; what about tomorrow?\u00a0 What will it be?\nWe also are very happy about many things that are happening.\u00a0 But as they happen also, we are quite sad of what\u2019s happening in the Sudan.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been working closely with the Government of Sudan, trying to get to a place whereby we can have peace and stability.\u00a0 It is quite tragic that we have more bullets coming into Sudan or being used in Sudan than food.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a tragedy, because we see from where we sit a lot of international interference, a lot of other players trying to use Sudan as a playing field for whatever reason, for the gold in Sudan, for territorial strength and control of the region.\nAnd we\u2019re trying to ask \u2013 we are asking external forces to leave Sudan alone.\u00a0 As an African continent and the AU and intergovernmental organization called IGAD, we are trying to find solutions for Sudan.\u00a0 I know you\u2019ve pulled your teams out.\u00a0 Kenya is not pulling its diplomatic offices.\u00a0 We\u2019re not shutting them down because we want to have a presence as we negotiate.\nPresident Ruto is looking forward to going to Sudan as soon as it stabilizes and there is enough security to try and see how we can engage the leaders.\u00a0 We are trying to engage the two warring parties, we\u2019re trying to bring them to the table so that we can have a good end, to a cessation of the violence.\u00a0 And what we want is civilian rule eventually over there.\nPresident Ruto has offered Kenya to mediate the conflict and to restore civility and peace.\u00a0 And we are quite persuaded that a peacefully negotiated solution to the conflict in Sudan is within reach.\u00a0 And as always, we stand ready to make our contribution, and we\u2019ll be playing hand-in-hand with that.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll be able to work together and see what we can do.\nI want to thank you.\u00a0 There are many topics we can talk about.\u00a0 We look forward to welcoming you back to Kenya sometime soon, and we look forward to President Biden also visiting Kenya, and President Ruto coming back, and thus holding these meeting at presidential level as we continue to work.\nWhat I can assure you is that Kenya will remain a good partner, will remain a friend of the United States, and we\u2019ll be able to work in sync as we try to improve the world that we live in.\u00a0\u00a0 When it comes to issues of trade, when it comes to the issue of health, when it comes to the issue of peace and stability, when it comes to issues of humanity, we are all the same people and we want to have a good life while we\u2019re here.\u00a0 And if we can work together as friends, it will be very good.\nAnd at that note, I want to welcome Americans to visit Kenya.\u00a0 We don\u2019t get as many Americans coming to Kenya as they should.\u00a0 I think our elephants and lions are complaining that they don\u2019t see a lot of Americans in our national parks.\u00a0 So Kenya is a safe and happy place, and we welcome Americans to come down for safari where you actually get to interact with the animals as long as they don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t get too close.\u00a0 But they\u2019ll be happy to see you.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take three questions.\u00a0 First, we\u2019ll go to Cindy Spang from Voice of America.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, thank you.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 I have one question for you, Secretary Blinken, and several questions for both of you, please.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, do you have numbers of how many Americans remain in Sudan?\u00a0 And could you share any updates on their safety and well\u2011being?\u00a0 And what options are there for those who want to leave?\nAnd for both of you:\u00a0 Cabinet Secretary Mutua, you mentioned foreign involvement in Sudan.\u00a0 Could you elaborate on that, please?\u00a0 And have either of you seen direct or indirect involvement from Egypt or the United Arab Emirates?\u00a0 And if so, have you spoken to their leaders about that?\u00a0 And have you seen involvement by the Wagner Group, and you are \u2013 how concerned are you that Russia may fan the violence?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 First, in terms of American citizens in Sudan, as you know, in any country around the world, whether it\u2019s Sudan or anywhere else, we never know with any precision how many Americans may be there at any given time because Americans are not required to register with the embassy, with the government, either when they go, when they reside, or when they leave.\u00a0 So we don\u2019t have a good fix on the number of Americans who are there at any given time, including now.\nWe do know, of course, the number of Americans who have registered with us and with whom we\u2019re in very active touch, communication.\u00a0 And of those, I would say some dozens have expressed an interest in leaving, and as I mentioned just a few moments ago, even with the withdrawal of our embassy personnel from Sudan, our efforts to provide services to American citizens who are there \u2013 consular services, other services, advice \u2013 continues, and we\u2019re in regular communication with American citizens.\u00a0 We are looking to see how we can help them ensure their own safety.\u00a0 We have been working with allies and with partners to do as much as we can to enable them to find their way out if that\u2019s what they choose to do.\nNow, keep in mind as well that the overwhelming majority of American citizens in Sudan are dual nationals who have made their lives there, been living there for years, for decades, for generations, and many want to continue to do that.\u00a0 But for those who are seeking to leave, we\u2019ll continue to engage directly with them to see what we can do to help them, and as I said, with allies and partners as well to help facilitate their departure.\u00a0 And this is going to be an ongoing process.\nIn addition, we\u2019re looking at what options we have to perhaps resume a diplomatic presence in Sudan, including in Port Sudan; that\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 But conditions are very challenging and we\u2019re tracking that very carefully.\nJust to pick up on the second part of the question, look, on one level, a whole variety of countries are involved in Sudan, have been engaged there, and engaged in \u2013 to some extent in trying to help Sudan move forward with its transition to a civilian-led government.\u00a0 And we have been in touch repeatedly throughout this crisis with a variety of them.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken directly to counterparts in Saudi Arabia, in the United Arab Emirates; other members of our team have spoken to Egypt and other countries, the United Kingdom \u2013 all to the same end, which is trying to get a ceasefire, trying to get a more sustainable cessation of hostilities, and then trying to get the country back on track to the transition to a civilian-led government that it was on before the violence that erupted derailed that effort.\u00a0 And it remains vitally important that countries use whatever positive influence they have to try to move Sudan in that direction.\nWe do have deep concern about the engagement of the Prigozhin group, the Wagner Group, in Sudan.\u00a0 It\u2019s in so many different countries in Africa \u2013 an element that, when it\u2019s engaged, simply brings more death and destruction with it.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very important that we not see its further engagement in Sudan.\u00a0 And I know a number of countries are very concerned with that prospect.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I agree with you there with the last statement about all these groups coming in and destabilizing.\u00a0 Currently in Sudan, we are trying also to evacuate Kenyans who have been working and living in Sudan.\u00a0 We\u2019ve (inaudible) to a lot of requests by the international organizations, the UN particularly, and other countries to help evacuate some of their people and bring them to Kenya or get them out of Sudan because of current need to accompany, and so we\u2019ll be proceeding.\nBut it would be good if we can find a way of establishing a ceasefire, even for a few hours or even a half a day or a day, to enable people to be able to move, to enable food and supplies to be brought in to the \u2013 especially in the capital, Khartoum, and other places.\nIn terms of involvement and indirect and direct involvement of various groups, we\u2019ve been quite concerned by some of our friends in the Middle East as (inaudible) Russia and others who for a long time have been friendly to either one or the other side.\u00a0 And we are just saying that at this particular time, it is not a time to take sides in a war.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to be able to come together and bring them together because at the end of the day, peace has to prevail.\u00a0 And so it doesn\u2019t matter who you support; at the end of the day, we need to have the people of Sudan have stability.\nSo all these other interests, if they can just keep off and let us bring peace to Sudan, we do believe it is possible.\u00a0 And that is where we are working towards as Kenya, together with our partners.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t want to be talking to people who are being supported and armed more and given strength by outsiders who don\u2019t live in Sudan.\u00a0 We care about Sudan.\u00a0 As part of the African Union, we want to silence the guns in Sudan, want to find an African solution to African problems with the support of our friends.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t effectively do that if we are talking to groups that are being strengthened every day by the parties who believe that all they need to do is to fight to the end.\u00a0 There is no fighting to the end.\u00a0 At the end of the day, it\u2019s the local and the normal people who lose, not just their leaders.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Julian Pecquet from\u00a0The Africa Report.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Julian Pecquet of\u00a0The Africa Report,\u00a0Jeune Afrique.\u00a0 You mentioned, Secretary Mutua, about President Ruto\u2019s involvement with IGAD and the talks with the Sudanese, so I have a few questions.\u00a0 One of them is what are you hearing from the parties to the conflict?\u00a0 What are you telling them?\u00a0 What kind of progress are we seeing, are we making since the past week?\u00a0 Any progress on when the president might host the parties in Nairobi if he can\u2019t go to Sudan because of the security situation?\u00a0 And how are you working with the African Union, which has its own effort going on?\u00a0 Secretary Blinken perhaps can talk to what the U.S. can do to help with the African-led negotiations.\nEastern Congo is another conflict where foreign actors are working at cross-purposes.\u00a0 I wanted to ask if Kenya can be a meaningful force in the DRC.\u00a0 Are you willing to take on the fight to the M23, which is what the Congolese seem to want?\u00a0 And can you tell us what the latest is with negotiations to renew the mandate of the East Africa Community regional force?\u00a0 And here as well, what role can the U.S. play?\nAnd then finally, on trade, perhaps we can talk about agriculture specifically, which is a very big deal to the Kenyans, obviously.\u00a0 What kind of progress are we making in the bilateral talks on agriculture, and particularly U.S. GMO exports to your country?\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 As members of IGAD, we have decided to be at the forefront in finding a solution to all these problems.\u00a0 We do believe that we are at a good place because the two warring leaders are talking to us, so that\u2019s a good sign.\u00a0 They are not \u2013 they \u2013 when you talk \u2013 when they are being talked to, they\u2019re talking back, and we\u2019re able to open the channels of communication.\u00a0 The fighting is still going on in Sudan, but we just feel that at least we have an entryway.\u00a0 They have not locked themselves up and shut their ears to the world.\u00a0 They are listening to the world, and they know the pressure that is being felt around them.\nOur president is ready.\u00a0 We have said that Kenya is ready at any moment\u2019s notice.\u00a0 Even if our president may not be able to go there immediately, we are ready to start discussions, and that\u2019s a message we are communicating to them, is that send us part of your teams.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start talking about what needs to be achieved because there\u2019s a reason they are fighting.\u00a0 They are fighting because they can\u2019t agree about something and we need to be able to sort out what they can\u2019t agree about, find a common, agreeable ground and then be able to move forward.\u00a0 And this is also under the auspices of the African Union.\u00a0 The African Union had a ministerial meeting where they called cessation of fighting, where they called for dialogue, and so this is part of the process.\nWhat we are doing as Kenya is that we are not just going to wait.\u00a0 We are saying \u2013 we\u2019ve put \u2013 stuck our necks out and said, we can provide a solution.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been in this game for some time.\u00a0 We\u2019ve \u2013 kind of have a bit of experience in how these things are done, and we love the people of Sudan so much that we say that we are ready to commit ourselves to hosting a negotiation between the two of you, the two warring groups, and trying to find solution so that the innocent people of Sudan \u2013 great people of Sudan \u2013 who are suffering can have this burden lifted from them.\nIn terms of eastern Congo, yes, our troops are on the ground, and it\u2019s not about us fighting the M23.\u00a0 We are not there to fight M23 or to fight anybody.\u00a0 We are there to provide a corridor that allows the groups that are fighting the Congolese Government and the ones that are being fought by the Congolese Government to have a sense of security through there.\u00a0 That they can start \u2013 we can \u2013 they can start putting down their guns and getting to the table and be able to negotiate.\nIt is important to note that M23 has been in operation for over 30 years.\u00a0 It is not just a simple problem that just started yesterday.\u00a0 So we are working together, and the Nairobi processes are still \u2013 is still going on, process still going on.\u00a0 We have Nairobi 4 coming up, and so we are fully engaged.\u00a0 And they have different meetings being called this coming month to try and sort out the issue.\nIn terms of the regional force and extending, that\u2019s in the process, and we are confident that will be \u2013 Kenya is not planning to withdraw its troops until we find an amicable solution.\u00a0 And we want to thank our partners, the United States and others, for the promised support that we can be able to work together to ensure that that region is stable.\nMaybe you can take agriculture fast, then I can \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Alfred.\u00a0 Let me just add that in terms of our engagement in Sudan, first, we\u2019ve been deeply engaged directly with the parties.\u00a0 I have spoken to Generals Burhan and Hemedti on multiple occasions.\u00a0 We strongly support African-led efforts to help both mediate this crisis, to end the hostilities, and, as I said, get back on the \u2013 on track to transition to a civilian-led government.\u00a0 We participated in, I think, an important meeting by video conference that was convened by the chairperson of the African Union, Mr. Faki, just at the end of last week that included the secretary-general of the United Nations, that included virtually all of the stakeholders in Africa and beyond who have an interest in trying to help Sudan get back on track, and we continue to support those efforts.\nWe all have the same goal.\u00a0 We\u2019re all driving to the same place.\u00a0 That is a ceasefire that\u2019s genuinely durable, that turns into a full cessation of hostilities between the competing forces, and that resumes the very important negotiations that were underway to create a transition to a civilian-led government \u2013 negotiations that had produced very significant progress, including the agreed framework.\u00a0 So that is everyone\u2019s goal, and we\u2019ll use both our direct engagement as helpful and as appropriate, but also strongly in support of AU-led efforts to put this back on track.\nWith regard to the United States and Kenya and trade, I think first it\u2019s worth pointing out that it\u2019s up 20 percent over the last year.\u00a0 That in and of itself speaks volumes.\u00a0 And when it comes to agriculture, that\u2019s exactly one of the things that we focused on today in a variety of ways, and I think that\u2019s going to be also the product of the Strategic Dialogue that we\u2019re having today and that you\u2019ll hear more about when we conclude our conversations.\nOne of the things that we talked about \u2013 and this has been part of an ongoing conversation \u2013 is of course Kenya is on the receiving end of an acute food insecurity challenge, like many other countries in Africa and beyond.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen an almost perfect storm that\u2019s emerged \u2013 the combination of climate change, of COVID, and of conflict, including the Russian aggression against Ukraine \u2013 all of which have contributed dramatically to rising food insecurity in Africa and beyond.\nWe have been deeply and intensely engaged in meeting this challenge.\u00a0 If you go back to February of last year when Russia invaded Ukraine again, we\u2019ve provided since then about $13.5 billion toward building greater food security, including direct assistance to Kenya and to many other countries.\u00a0 The United States has provided about 75 percent of the United Nations appeal for Kenya when it comes to food security.\nBut for all of the efforts that we and other countries are making in partnership with Kenya and other friends to address the immediate crisis, we\u2019re equally focused on helping countries build sustainable, long-term, productive capacity themselves.\u00a0 That is fundamentally the answer to the challenge.\u00a0 And I think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity there, including in the work that we\u2019re doing with Kenya.\nOne aspect of that is making sure that, using remarkable technology that we\u2019ve developed over recent years, that two things are addressed: the health and strength of soil, and the resilience of seeds.\u00a0 We have the capacity to basically map soil anywhere to determine whether it\u2019s strong or not and needs help.\u00a0 We also have remarkable technology when it comes to seeds to make sure that they are much more resilient to climate change, to droughts, to extreme conditions.\u00a0 And this is one of the things that we\u2019re working on with Kenya, as well as building out the entire production infrastructure that\u2019s also vital to making sure that there\u2019s genuine food security.\nSo this is very much part of our dialogue.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of our ongoing conversation.\u00a0 And I expect you\u2019ll see more on that in \u2013 both today and in the months to come.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\u00a0 Just to add on to issues of agriculture, and this is where with the impact of climate change I think it\u2019s a lesson to all of us that we can\u2019t keep on relying on rainfed agriculture.\u00a0 So we have a massive program in Kenya of building dams so that we can be able to conduct irrigation \u2013 hold irrigation programs so that now when it rains \u2013 it doesn\u2019t rain at least over there, but we still have to combat climate change.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we are planting 15 billion trees over the next few years to try and roll back what is happening.\nAgriculture in our region will only thrive if our farmers feel that they need to use it for economic reasons.\u00a0 Agriculture is not only for food, because when a farmer grows crops, that farmer uses \u2013 sells those crops, eats some and sells the crops and gets money for school fees, for building, for their car, et cetera, et cetera.\u00a0 So to us when it came to agriculture is also an economic issue, and that\u2019s why we are talking about value addition in the conversation we\u2019re talking about, getting our products here.\nI can say with no fear of contradiction that Kenya has the best tea and coffee in the world, and so we would like to be able to get more of that in the United States.\u00a0 And even our products \u2013 as we add value to our products, which means that with opening up of the markets means that our farmers get more money in their pocket as a motivation, they engage more into growing crops, and then it becomes a cycle that is able to continue.\u00a0 So it\u2019s about sustainability.\nMR. PATEL:\u00a0Final question. Kylie Atwood, CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thanks, you guys.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to start with Secretary Mutua, please.\u00a0 I just wonder if you could be a little bit more explicit for us in terms of how exactly Kenya has seen the Wagner Group\u2019s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Sudan.\u00a0 And you said that you believe that a peaceful resolution is in reach in Sudan.\u00a0 Why exactly do you feel that that is in reach?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, just questions on Sudan and then also on Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 First, on Sudan, have the convoys that have attempted to leave Sudan, that have American citizens who have joined them, run into any problems, any violence along the routes on the way out, as far as the U.S. knows at this point?\u00a0 And you mentioned potentially resuming a U.S. diplomatic presence at Port Sudan.\u00a0 Could that happen as soon as this week?\nAnd then just one question about a report this morning in\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0on the \u2013 on Ukrainians planning to attack Moscow earlier this year, on the one-year anniversary of the war.\u00a0 Based on that article, which comes from leaked classified U.S. Intelligence documents, it says that the country\u2019s military intelligence directorate agreed to postpone the strikes at Washington\u2019s request.\u00a0 Have Ukrainian officials ever discussed with you such potential plans for an attack on Moscow?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your message to any Ukrainian Government officials who may be privately advocating for such an approach?\u00a0 Thank you.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I think the position that Kenya holds is that we don\u2019t want interference by any group, may be Warner Group or individual countries that may be involved directly or indirectly.\u00a0 At this particular time, we\u2019d just like us to be left with Sudan without foreign and other groups interfering with the peace process.\nWe are quite encouraged about peace being found in Sudan very soon.\u00a0 This is because we\u2019ve had negotiations and mediation and a process in Sudan that has gone on for some time.\u00a0 And a few weeks ago, there was a very successful forum held in Khartoum, where there was an agreement basically in terms of returning the country to civilian rule, in terms of when the next elections will be held, in terms of the balance of how things will run.\u00a0 And it was only one item that there was a bit of disagreement, and it\u2019s not even a major item.\u00a0 It was all about the militia \u2013 the RSF joining the national military and how the timelines and the groups \u2013 which was a very, very small issue, and we are confident that that is an issue that you can tackle.\u00a0 Basically, it\u2019s a 2 percent that remains; 98 percent has already been done and agreed and signed to.\u00a0 That is why we are very confident that, once there\u2019s cessation, and with a bit of mediation, we believe that by the end of this year we\u2019ll be talking a different story about Sudan.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, in terms of the convoys, it\u2019s \u2013 look, it\u2019s a moving picture, and we\u2019ve seen to date different things.\u00a0 Some of the convoys that have tried to move people out, including all the way to Port Sudan but also to places closer into Khartoum, some of them have encountered problems, including robbery, looting, that kind of thing.\u00a0 Others not.\u00a0 But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking very, very carefully.\nTo the extent that we\u2019ve been able to facilitate Americans being folded into some of those convoys, we\u2019ll continue to do that.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also trying to provide the best possible advice we can to anyone asking for our assistance about conditions, about safety, about security, so that they can make their own decisions with the most information possible.\u00a0 But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking as carefully as we can, and of course we\u2019re in very close contact with a number of countries that are engaged in removing their personnel from Sudan to make sure that we know from them what they\u2019re experiencing, what they\u2019re encountering.\u00a0 All of that factors into the advice that we can provide and the decisions that we make.\nWhen it comes to resuming our own diplomatic presence in Sudan, look, that\u2019s going to be entirely dependent on the conditions in Sudan. \u00a0Again, something that we\u2019ll look at day-in/day-out, but I can\u2019t put a timeframe on it at all.\u00a0 It\u2019s really conditions dependent.\nAnd finally, the last part of your question:\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to comment on any purported intelligence documents that are being reported on in the press.\u00a0 Thanks.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 When it comes to what Ukraine does to defend itself against the Russian aggression, these are decisions for the Ukrainians to make.\nThank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-japanese-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken At a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "The Prince Karuizawa ", "location": "Karuizawa, Japan", "date": "April 18, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone. \u00a0Let me \u2013 let me start with the situation in Sudan. \u00a0For the past 36 hours, we and our partners have been focused on how to stop the widespread fighting in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. \u00a0Indiscriminate military operations have resulted in significant civilian deaths and injuries, and are recklessly endangering the Sudanese people, diplomats including U.S. personnel, and humanitarian aid workers.\nThis morning, I made calls to Generals Burhan and Hemedti, urging them to agree to a 24-hour ceasefire to allow Sudanese to safely reunite with their families and to obtain desperately needed relief supplies.\nI also underscored in both calls the responsibilities that Sudanese fighting forces bear for ensuring the safety and security of U.S. and other diplomats who are resident in Sudan, as well as for UN staff and other humanitarian partners. \u00a0If implemented successfully, a ceasefire for 24 hours can create a foundation to build upon for a more sustained halt to the fighting and a return to negotiations on a durable end to the hostilities.\nThe people of Sudan have made clear their democratic aspirations. \u00a0After months of talks, they were close to restoring a civilian-led government.\u00a0 We remain committed to helping them achieve that goal. \u00a0At the same time, we will take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of our people.\nNow, we just finished up a marathon couple of days, during which the G7 foreign ministers came together to address some of the most consequential issues confronting our countries and people all over the world.\nI want to thank our Japanese hosts and especially my friend Foreign Minister Hayashi for the warm hospitality and for his leadership.\nTogether, we have strengthened the centrality of the G7 as the steering committee of the world\u2019s advanced industrial democracies, and deepened ties with other countries around the world. \u00a0And together, we emerge from this ministerial more globally engaged than ever.\nA major theme of this G7 was how our nations can leverage our strengths to work with our partners to deliver better futures for people around the world, to focus on the issues of most concern to them in their daily lives. \u00a0And this means combining our political and economic muscle and our development dollars, yen, euros, and pounds to support countries on every continent in meeting their food, energy, climate, infrastructure, and technology challenges.\nIt means shaping a more inclusive international system \u2013 including with UN reform, making the international financial system more responsive to the actual needs of countries, and finding new formats for consultation that welcome more voices. \u00a0It means offering more countries better, more sustainable, and more equitable ways to prosper, while respecting their sovereignty. \u00a0From Central Asia to the Pacific Islands to Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, our goal is to offer leaders and citizens better choices \u2013 free from coercion, unsustainable debt, and malign influence.\nWe also discussed a range of challenges to our shared vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous international system. \u00a0The most immediate challenge, of course, is Russia\u2019s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.\nYesterday, we recommitted to Ukraine: with the security and economic support that it needs today to defend its sovereignty and people, and for the long term to ensure that Ukraine doesn\u2019t just survive, that it thrives \u2013 and that Russia is deterred from further aggression.\nThis includes continuing to tighten sanctions and export controls, putting that pressure on Russia to limit its ability to wage its war, cracking down on sanctions evaders wherever they hide, rejecting Moscow\u2019s nuclear blackmail, and ensuring accountability for war crimes.\nThe G7 from the get-go has led the world in galvanizing and sustaining support for Ukraine. \u00a0Now, as Ukraine prepares to launch a counteroffensive to take back its land, to liberate its people in occupied territories, to stop the missiles, bombs, and drones which continue to rain down daily on its civilians, we stand with Ukraine.\nAnd when the inevitable voices, led by a Russia that is losing its war of conquest, talk about avoiding escalation or call for Ukraine to stop reclaiming its own territory, we will remind the world who is the aggressor and who is the victim \u2013 who has 20 percent of its land occupied by enemy forces; whose children are being disappeared, and whose civilians are being killed and left in mass graves.\nAt the same time, Russia is again blocking Ukraine\u2019s grain from reaching the world, spiking food prices for people everywhere. \u00a0For the last few days, no ships have gotten out of Ukraine, and more than 50 have been blocked from going in to load up. \u00a0Countries around the world depend on this life-saving grain. \u00a0Russia is breaking its promises to them.\nWe also discussed China. \u00a0All of our nations have consequential relationships with Beijing, and a number of G7 colleagues have recently visited. \u00a0What struck me in hearing the readouts of those conversations is that we are resolved and united in the need for candid discussions with Beijing about its unfair trade practices, its actions that undermine the international rules that all nations benefit from, and the risks if it breaks its word and starts arming Russia. \u00a0And of course we\u2019re united in making clear to Beijing our opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo with Taiwan.\nWe\u2019re also equally committed, individually and collectively, to constructively engaging with Beijing if it chooses to contribute its efforts \u2013 to efforts to address shared global challenges. \u00a0That is what the world expects of responsible powers.\nAt this ministerial, we also focused on nuclear proliferation. \u00a0I\u2019m grateful to Japan for the high priority that it has placed on countering nuclear threats \u2013 including from the DPRK\u2019s dangerous ballistic missile launches; Iran\u2019s expansion of its nuclear activities, including the operation of advanced centrifuges and the accumulation of highly enriched uranium, for which it has no credible civilian explanation or purpose; Russia\u2019s New START suspension and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric; and the PRC\u2019s opaque and rapid build-up of its own nuclear arsenal. \u00a0These actions only strengthen our determination to address nuclear dangers.\nWe\u2019re also focused on the threat posed by synthetic opioids. \u00a0Our communique speaks to our collective commitment to developing and implementing solutions to this crisis, and we will continue to cooperate closely \u2013 indeed, we will strengthen that cooperation \u2013 addressing illicit financing, disrupting trafficking networks, supporting public health responses, and more.\nSo it\u2019s been a very productive and important few days which lay the groundwork for the Leaders Summit in Hiroshima in a month\u2019s time.\u00a0 And I commend to you the joint statement that we issued, or will soon issue, reflecting the work that we\u2019ve done.\nWith that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 All right, we\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Nike Ching from Voice of America.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Nike, how are you?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Inaudible.) \u00a0Thanks for the press conference.\u00a0 On Sudan, can you provide more details on reports that a U.S. embassy vehicle was targeted in Khartoum, which means (inaudible) divided?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your plan to ensure the safety and security of U.S. citizens and diplomats?\u00a0 Is there a plan to evacuate the embassy there given the newest developments?\u00a0 And if I may, do you support the calls from some senators to sanction generals of the two fighting military factions?\nAnd finally, if I may, on\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporter.\u00a0 Do you have more details on Ambassador Lynne Tracy\u2019s access to Evan Gershkovich given reports that a Moscow court is scheduled on Tuesday to hear an appeal on his case?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to Sudan, look, I\u2019m limited in terms of the details and what I can get into from here, but I can confirm that yesterday we had an American diplomatic convoy that was fired on.\u00a0 All of our people are safe and unharmed.\u00a0 But this action was reckless, it was irresponsible, and of course unsafe \u2013 a diplomatic convoy with diplomatic plates, a U.S. flag, being fired upon.\nIn the calls that I had this morning with Generals Hemedti and Burhan, I made very clear that any attacks, threats, dangers posed to our diplomats were totally unacceptable.\u00a0 This particular incident is still being investigated in terms of understanding exactly what happened.\u00a0 The initial reports that we have is that it was undertaken by forces associated with the RSF, and again, I made very clear in my conversation with General Hemedti that any attacks that endanger our diplomats are totally unacceptable, and I shared the same with General Burhan.\nWe have deep concerns, of course, about the overall security environment as it affects civilians, as it affects diplomats, as it affects aid workers.\u00a0 World Food Program had to suspend its operations; three of its people were killed.\u00a0 That potentially has terrible consequences for the Sudanese people, who are in desperate need of the assistance provided by the World Food Program.\u00a0 That only underscores the imperative of getting a ceasefire and putting Sudan back on the track that it was on, which was talks and negotiations toward the restoration of a civilian-led government.\nWe will continue to track this very closely and very carefully.\u00a0 My number one priority, of course, is the safety and security of our personnel.\u00a0 I\u2019m in very close contact with \u2013 as is my entire team \u2013 with Ambassador John Godfrey and our entire team in Khartoum.\u00a0 Again, I won\u2019t go into any details except to say that we are and will continue to take every responsible measure to make sure that our people are safe and secure.\nWe\u2019re also in very close coordination with other countries that have influence in Sudan.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been on the phone with counterparts from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, to make sure that we\u2019re coordinating carefully.\u00a0 Our team as well has been in very close contact with the African Union, with other international organizations \u2013 again, to make sure that everyone is coordinated and that we are channeling the shared determination among the international community to get to a ceasefire as quickly as possible and to put Sudan back on the track of talks, negotiations, again, to restore civilian-led government in Sudan.\nBut first things first, the imperative is getting quickly to a ceasefire so that the guns stop firing, people can move about safely, reunite with their families, get the assistance they need, and all of us can continue to engage in supporting Sudan as it makes its transition.\nWith regard to Evan Gershkovich, yes, Ambassador Tracy and our chief consular officer were able to see Evan in prison in Moscow.\u00a0 I can report, based on what Ambassador Tracy has said, that he is in good health and good spirits considering the \u2013 considering the circumstances.\u00a0 We continue to call for his immediate release from this unjust detention.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Tetsuo Shintomi with Kyodo News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I would like to ask on the nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation, which is of big interest among Japanese people.\u00a0 As you know, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida has expressed his hope to discuss on a world without nuclear weapons at coming G7 Leaders Summit.\u00a0 As you are wrapping up foreign ministers meeting here in Karuizawa, do you feel any tangible progress toward that end?\u00a0 And how do you think about the possibility of a world without \u2013 achieving a world without nuclear weapons despite all these challenges?\nAnd in addition, if I may, many local people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including a\u00a0Hibakusha, which is an atomic bomb survivor, are looking forward to a U.S. leader\u2019s visit to Hiroshima in May.\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering if you had any message to them.\nThank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, I should tell you that we had \u2013 during this G7 meeting we had dedicated sessions on specific issues, the most important issues on our agenda.\u00a0 And the final session that we had, dedicated session, was on arms control and nonproliferation, which in and of itself underscores the importance that the G7 attaches to it.\u00a0 And I have to praise Japan\u2019s leadership, as always, on this issue.\nWe, as G7 countries, are committed to maintaining and strengthening disarmament and nonproliferation efforts toward a more secure, stable, and safer world.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be convening, as you noted, at a leaders level in Hiroshima, which together with Nagasaki offers the most powerful reminder of the unprecedented devastation and immense human suffering that the people of Japan experienced as a result of the atomic bombings in 1945.\nThe overall decline in global nuclear arsenals has to continue and must not be reversed.\u00a0 If you look at the trajectory from the onset of the Cold War through to today, we\u2019ve seen that overall decline.\u00a0 And that can and should be achieved through a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach to arms control and nonproliferation.\nHaving said that, we also see some very significant challenges not just on the horizon but fully present, and we have to continue to work collectively to counter these challenges: Russia\u2019s suspension of the New START agreement, irresponsible nuclear rhetoric; the DPRK\u2019s dangerous ballistic missile launches and further development of its own nuclear program; Iran\u2019s expansion of its nuclear activities; and China\u2019s pursuit in a very opaque way of a rapid nuclear arsenal buildup.\nSo based on our conversations today, I can tell you that these actions only strengthen our determination to address nuclear dangers, and it\u2019s particularly why I\u2019m grateful to Japan for the high priority it\u2019s placed on this topic under its G7 presidency.\nI can also tell you that the President very much looks forward to being in Japan for the G7 leaders and in Hiroshima specifically, and I know he\u2019ll have much more to say when he\u2019s here, but it\u2019s something that he\u2019s very focused on and looks very much forward to.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg news.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary. \u00a0Chinse leader Xi Jinping has recently, obviously, made diplomatic waves both with the Saudi Arabia-Iran deal and its own proposal for peace in Ukraine.\u00a0 Just the other day, Brazil\u2019s president said the U.S. should stop encouraging war and start talking peace, and Brazil\u2019s foreign minister also criticized Western sanctions for taking an unnecessary toll on nations involved in the conflict.\u00a0 Do you think the Brazilian comments suggest that the U.S. is potentially losing the battle for public opinion on Ukraine in the Global South?\u00a0 And do you think it\u2019s time that Washington should meaningfully engage with China\u2019s peace proposal, even despite the reservations about it freezing Russia\u2019s territorial gains?\nAnd secondly, just on China.\u00a0 It\u2019s been weeks since Biden said he would try and speak with Xi, and there\u2019s still no clear plan for your own previously postponed trip to Beijing.\u00a0 Given your own G7 counterparts are visiting China and urging engagement, do you think it\u2019s time the U.S. started more substantive, meaningful engagement with senior Chinese officials or do you think Beijing\u2019s unwillingness to engage is holding that back?\nThanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, just speaking to the G7 itself and what I heard here and what we\u2019ve been discussing over the last few days, what I \u2013 what I heard, again, is remarkable convergence on concerns related to the PRC and on what we\u2019re doing to address those concerns.\u00a0 And I think some of you heard my counterparts speaking to that directly, and I\u2019d also invite you to read the joint statement that we put out that reflects very well the shared approach that we have to China \u2013 both the challenges it poses as well as the need for engagement that we all see and share.\nBut in general, over the past two years what I\u2019ve seen not just in Europe but also in Asia is much greater convergence on the approach to take to China, which for all of our countries is among the most consequential as well as complicated relationships that we have.\u00a0 We believe \u2013 the United States \u2013 that having lines of communication, being able to engage across the broad range of issues that animate the relationship, is important.\u00a0 And we also believe that countries around the world expect us to manage the relationship with China responsibly, and that starts with engagement, with having lines of communication.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what President Biden sought to reinforce in Bali when he met with President Xi, and my expectation would be that we will be able to move forward on that.\u00a0 But it does require China to make clear its own intentions in doing that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll look to see if they do so, but if they do so my expectation would be that we will find ways to engage as the presidents agreed during their Bali meeting.\nBeyond that, I\u2019m not going to speak to any individual countries.\u00a0 I can just say more generally with regard to Brazil that President Biden, President Lula had a very good meeting when President Lula visited the White House \u2013 I think his first or certainly among his very first visits to any country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 The final question, Ryo Kiyomiya from\u00a0Asahi Shimbun.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Welcome to Japan.\u00a0 I have several questions on Taiwan and engagement with the Global South.\nFirst, on Taiwan, French President Macron said in his interview that Europe must not be a follower of either the U.S. or China on Taiwan, and we heard that there was some discussions on this comment during the ministerial meeting.\u00a0 How much are you worried his comment may undermine global support for Taiwan?\u00a0 And do you think they represent perhaps a small victory for Xi Jinping in China\u2019s effort to divide Europe and the U.S. on foreign policy issues?\nAnd secondly, on the Global South, to address the challenges of Russia and China\u2019s influence in the developing world, how do you mean to offer an alternative to China by engaging more with the Global South?\u00a0 And also, what kind of role do you expect Japan to play in increasing engagement with the Global South?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to Taiwan, there is clear unanimity in the approach that we\u2019re taking with all of our G7 partners and many other countries around the world, and that is an expectation that any differences be dealt with peacefully and that neither side take any unilateral actions that would disrupt the status quo that preserves peace and stability.\u00a0 That is clearly what every single one of our G7 partners believes.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s reflected well in the G7 statement that we\u2019re putting out today.\u00a0 And again, a number of partners spoke directly to their views, to their countries\u2019 views, on the broader relationship with China and the more specific question of Taiwan.\u00a0 And as I said a moment ago, in my experience we actually have not seen greater convergence at any other time in the approach than we see now, both with Europe as well as with key countries in Asia.\nWith regard to what\u2019s called the Global South, I think if you look at the discussions that we had just over the last two and a half or three days, the vast majority of the time was spent on looking at the issues that are actually affecting people\u2019s lives around the world and focusing, as I said, on how we can leverage our strengths to deliver actual solutions on the issues that, as I said, are having an impact on the lives of people around the world as well as in our own countries.\nSo look at what we spent our time focused on and developing concrete action plans on: food security; energy and climate change; health security; building infrastructure that addresses the needs of countries around the world; catalyzing more investment from the private sector; broader and more inclusive economic growth; international financial institutions that actually respond to the needs of countries around the world.\u00a0 That was probably two-thirds of the discussion that we had over the last two and a half days, and I suspect that you\u2019ll see the leaders do the same when they meet in a month\u2019s time.\nAnd what this comes down to is that we as a G7, as individual countries, along with many other countries that are not part of the G7, want to spend our time, our focus, our resources on addressing these challenges and making it clear to countries around the world that this is not about asking or making them choose; it\u2019s about offering a good, indeed a better \u2013 a better choice.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve focused our attention on.\u00a0 Again, I invite you to take a look at the statement that we put out.\u00a0 I think it reflects it very well, and it\u2019s a very good prelude to the meeting that the leaders will have in a month\u2019s time.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY

everyone.\u00a0 So I have been long been looking forward to returning to Vietnam and making my first visit here as Secretary of State.\u00a0 I was here as deputy secretary in 2015 and 2016, but I am so pleased to be back today.\nA decade since the United States and Vietnam launched our Comprehensive Partnership, and nearly 28 years since we normalized relations, our nations have forged a relationship that is robust, dynamic, and consequential.\nI\u2019m here at the behest of President Biden to further broaden and deepen that partnership following the President\u2019s call with the general secretary last month and building on earlier high-level visits, including from Vice President Harris, Secretary of Defense Austin, U.S. Trade Representative Tai, USAID Administrator Power, and recently as well members of Congress.\nThroughout my engagements today, I focused on how the United States can continue to support Vietnam\u2019s success \u2013 which is good for the Vietnamese people, for Americans, and indeed for the entire region.\nOur countries are collaborating on an incredibly broad range of shared interests, and we believe that by supporting Vietnam\u2019s ambitions we advance our own, from the creation of American jobs and the strengthening of American businesses, to progress on the climate crisis that affects us all, to preventing pandemics.\nI also focused on how our countries can advance a free and open Indo-Pacific, one that is at peace and grounded in respect for the rules-based international order.\u00a0 When we talk about \u201cfree and open,\u201d we mean countries being free to choose their own path and their own partners and that problems will be dealt with openly; rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly; and goods, ideas, and people will flow freely across land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nIn my meetings with General Secretary Trong, with Prime Minister Chinh, with Foreign Minister Son, and External Relations Commission Chairman Trung, I discussed our work to promote broad-based prosperity in Vietnam and throughout the region, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 Vietnam has joined negotiations on all four pillars of IPEF, and that will help lead a race to the top on the issues that are shaping the 21st century economy, including supply chain resilience, the clean energy transition, digital connectivity, and that will benefit Americans and people across this region.\nWe discussed our mutual respect for ASEAN centrality and our close partnership through regional economic frameworks, including APEC, which the United States is proud to be hosting this year, and the Mekong-U.S.\u00a0 Partnership.\u00a0 We appreciate Vietnam\u2019s indispensable leadership in solving development challenges in the Mekong region that have been made worse by dam construction, climate change, and overfishing.\nWe\u2019re also growing our bilateral economic partnership.\u00a0 The U.S. is helping Vietnam double down on key reforms it\u2019s embraced \u2013 including on labor, intellectual property, fair trade \u2013 which have made it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\nWe believe that Vietnam can achieve its goal of becoming a connected, high-income country by 2045 by pursuing growth that lifts up all communities, while building resilience to adapt to climate change.\nWe know Vietnam is increasingly vulnerable to threats posed by the climate crisis.\u00a0 As Vietnam takes steps to become a leader on climate energy transition, the United States is investing in that tremendous potential.\nWe\u2019re launching new bilateral climate initiatives that were announced by Vice President Harris during her August 2021 visit to Vietnam, which do everything from conserving ecosystems and reducing emissions from rice farming in the Mekong Delta, to expanding a market-driven clean energy system and scaling up adoption of electric vehicles, to leveraging our private sectors to drive climate action.\nWe\u2019re also harnessing the power of regional frameworks like the Just Energy Transition Partnership.\u00a0 Vietnam recently joined that partnership.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to deploy $15.5 billion to help the country deliver on its ambitious Net Zero 2050 goal as well as the Japan-U.S.-Mekong Power Partnership.\nWe\u2019re also collaborating to build up Vietnam\u2019s public health capacity, including by establishing a national CDC here in Vietnam.\u00a0 We\u2019ve partnered closely to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, with the United States donating more than 40 million vaccine doses, followed by Vietnam\u2019s donation \u2013 following \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Vietnam\u2019s donation of millions of articles of PPE during the earliest part of the pandemic, when America was at a time of its greatest need.\u00a0 And I have to say this is a very powerful example of countries coming together and coming to each other\u2019s assistance when each of us needed it most.\nAs part of our bilateral security partnership, which is growing, we\u2019re finalizing the transfer of the third U.S. Coast Guard cutter to Vietnam, complementing a fleet of 24 patrol boats and other equipment, training, and operational facilities that we\u2019ve provided since 2016.\u00a0 All of these efforts bolster Vietnam\u2019s capacity to contribute to maritime peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nThe United States is committed to supporting a strong, prosperous, independent, and resilient Vietnam.\u00a0 And we respect Vietnam\u2019s right to shape its future under its own political system.\u00a0 At the same time, we continue to underscore how future progress on human rights is essential to unleashing the full potential of the Vietnamese people.\u00a0 That\u2019s the central focus of the U.S.-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue.\nFinally, the United States is committed to our ongoing work to address the legacies of the war, even as we focus on the future.\u00a0 This is a matter of trust, of commitment, and of duty.\nWe\u2019re continuing our joint efforts to clear unexploded ordnance.\u00a0 Next month, we\u2019ll complete the survey of the heavily bombed Quang Tri Province.\u00a0 We\u2019re making significant progress cleaning up dioxin hotspots from the war.\u00a0 Last month, we announced a new $73 million contract to treat contaminated soil and sediment at Bien Hoa Air Base.\nAnd we\u2019re continuing the important humanitarian work to account for those missing from the war, including by increasing Vietnam\u2019s capacity to identify its own missing and dead.\u00a0 We recognize the longstanding support of the Government of Vietnam to account for U.S.\u00a0 personnel lost during the war.\u00a0 Our reciprocal cooperation for ensuring families from both countries receive the closure they deserve remains vitally important.\nToday, we took another step to strengthen our relationship by breaking ground on our new embassy compound.\u00a0 When completed, our new embassy in Hanoi will be a state-of-art facility worthy of our ambitious vision for the future of our partnership and worthy of the American and Vietnamese people who work every day to make that vision a reality.\nWith that, I\u2019m happy to take some questions.\u00a0 Vedant.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll do four questions today.\u00a0 First question, John Hudson of\u00a0The Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, a three-part question on Vietnam if you\u2019ll indulge me.\u00a0\u00a0 You have underscored that the U.S. and Vietnam \u2013 the U.S. and Vietnam are aligned on a common view of free and Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 How does this square with Vietnam\u2019s recent crackdown on dissent?\nSecondly, advocacy groups say Vietnam deported several Russian residents who expressed opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\u00a0 And Vietnam earlier this year also voted to abstain from a UN vote to condemn the Russian invasion.\u00a0 Did you discuss Vietnam\u2019s position on the war with leaders today?\u00a0 And if so, what did you hear from them?\nAnd then lastly, from your discussion today, what ways does the U.S. and Vietnam share concerns about China\u2019s assertiveness in the region?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, John.\u00a0 So first, I am not aware of the deportations that you referenced.\u00a0 We did talk about Ukraine and about the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 Vietnam has a long history and relationship with Russia.\u00a0 We understand that and recognize that.\nAt the same time, I\u2019ve heard clearly from our Vietnamese interlocutors and I\u2019ve heard them state publicly their commitment and the importance that they attach to the basic principles that are also under threat by Russia\u2019s aggression, the principles at the heart of the UN Charter \u2013 territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence.\u00a0 Vietnam stands strongly for those.\u00a0 They\u2019ve made that clear.\u00a0 They\u2019ve said so publicly and they repeated that in conversation with us today.\nWith regard to human rights and the relationship that we have, this is a conversation that we regularly engage in.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve said to our counterparts, it\u2019s very important that we continue to speak directly, openly, candidly about our concerns.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly, exactly what we do.\nWe continue to seek progress on issues like freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of religion.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen, I think, positive steps taken in some areas, to include, for example, the respect for the rights of the LGBTQI+ community.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen important work that Vietnam has done with UNHCR on the right of stateless people, for example.\u00a0 But in these other areas we continue to have concerns that we\u2019ve shared.\nAs well, I think it\u2019s important that the space be expanded for nongovernmental organizations to be able to register, to operate without burdensome intrusion by the state.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve noted and we\u2019ve noted the important contributions these organizations make to issues that matter to all Vietnamese, for example, on climate change, on conservation, on dealing with transnational crime.\u00a0 But this is an ongoing part of our dialogue and an important one.\nFinally, on South China Sea, I think it\u2019s very clear that countries throughout the region, to include Vietnam, feel strongly about the importance of respecting the rule of law, particularly under the Law of the Sea Convention, when it comes to issues of freedom of navigation, when it comes to maritime disputes, when it comes to illegal fishing, et cetera.\u00a0 And a lot of good work is being done, for example, through ASEAN to try to address these issues.\u00a0 That\u2019s been going on for some time.\nAnd in our own relationship with Vietnam, with other countries in the region, one of the things that we\u2019ve worked on, I think very productively, is helping countries strengthen what we call maritime domain awareness \u2013 having the capacity to see very clearly what is happening in the seas that surround their countries, particularly when it comes to things like piracy, like illegal fishing, or like any use of coercion by other countries against \u2013 against these countries, against their fishing fleets, et cetera.\nSo that\u2019s an important part of the conversation as well, and it does go to the heart of what we have as a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, one in which, again, countries are free to pursue their own policies, their own partnerships, and in which everyone in the region abides by the international rule of law.\u00a0 This is something that joins us together with Vietnam.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to\u00a0H\u00e0ng Duy Linh with Tuoi Tre.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So let me ask you in Vietnamese, okay?\n(Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, before your arrival there are already speculation that this year will be the very good year to change the partnership from comprehensive to strategic partnership.\u00a0 Why would the U.S. would like that, and what do you think whether you can \u2013 the two countries can result in that goal?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I think from the perspective of the United States \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to speak for our Vietnamese colleagues, but certainly from our perspective \u2013 we think this is an auspicious time to elevate our existing partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had for the last 10 years this Comprehensive Partnership that has created an incredibly strong foundation of cooperation across many different areas.\nAnd as a result, we think this is a good moment to go even further.\u00a0 And by that we mean this: to make even more effective the existing cooperation that we have, and then to work in new areas of cooperation and collaboration in the partnership.\u00a0 And this is something that the \u2013 that President Biden and the general secretary discussed when they spoke on the phone a couple of weeks ago, and it was very much part of the conversations that we had today.\nSo I think what you\u2019ll see in the weeks and months ahead is our teams working on this.\u00a0 There are so many areas where we can either deepen cooperation or really add cooperation to what we\u2019re already doing, whether it\u2019s on climate change, whether it\u2019s on health, security, science and technology, and education.\u00a0 I was just at the Hanoi University for Science and Technology and saw some remarkable young Vietnamese innovators, including a robotics team that will be coming to the United States. \u00a0We think there\u2019s an area there for significant collaboration in building up science and technology in Vietnam and also deepening even more educational exchanges.\u00a0 We have many Vietnamese students in the United States.\u00a0 We want even more.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to see Americans come here.\nBut also the digital transformation, which is part \u2013 already part of IPEF, strengthening supply chains and building more resilient ones, deepening the work that we\u2019re doing together in the Mekong Delta.\u00a0 Each of these areas, whether it\u2019s an existing area of cooperation or one that we can add, I think would go to an enhanced partnership that we\u2019ll be working on in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Matt Lee with The Associated Press.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thanks, Vedant.\u00a0 Hi, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 A couple things.\u00a0 One, do you have any understanding of what the situation \u2013 what\u2019s going on in Khartoum right now in Sudan?\nAnd then more to the point of this trip, tomorrow you\u2019re going to be beginning almost three days of talks with your G7 colleagues in what is the first big international meeting since these leaks of the highly classified information.\u00a0 Whether or not you expect or worry that your colleagues in Japan might ask you about that or raise it as a problematic issue, what do you say to people who ask whether the U.S. can still be a trusted partner and ally given that this set of leaks is like the fourth major one in about a decade from Americans?\nAnd then lastly on Evan Gershkovich, is there any update on his situation in terms of getting consular access?\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that the Russians have said that they might be willing to arrange some kind of a swap for him.\u00a0 Is there anything to report on that front?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Matt.\u00a0 First on Khartoum, the major parties in Khartoum some weeks ago reached a very important framework agreement on how to proceed with a transition to civilian government.\u00a0 And there\u2019s been real progress in trying to move that forward.\u00a0 I spoke to General Burhan just a couple of days ago on that very topic, and there are still some remaining \u2013 important remaining issues that need to be dealt with.\u00a0 But I think there\u2019s a real opportunity to move forward on the agreed framework, and certainly that\u2019s what we\u2019re strongly supporting.\nIt\u2019s a fragile situation.\u00a0 There are other actors that may be pushing against that progress.\u00a0 But this is a real opportunity to finally carry forward the civilian-led transition, and one that we and other countries are trying to bolster.\u00a0 So we\u2019re very focused on that along with other partners.\nOn the intelligence leaks, what I can tell you is this:\u00a0 We have engaged with our allies and partners since these leaks came out, and we have done so at high levels, and we have made clear our commitment to safeguarding intelligence and our commitment to our security partnerships.\nWhat I\u2019ve heard so far at least is an appreciation for the steps that we\u2019re taking, and it\u2019s not affected our cooperation.\u00a0 I just haven\u2019t seen that.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard that.\u00a0 And of course, the investigation is taking its course.\u00a0 There\u2019s now, as you know, a suspect in custody but importantly as well, I know, measures being taken to further safeguard information.\u00a0 But to date, based on the conversations I\u2019ve had, I have not \u2013 not heard anything that would affect our cooperation with allies and partners.\nOn Evan Gershkovich, I don\u2019t have anything new to share.\u00a0 We continue to seek consular access.\u00a0 That has not yet been granted.\u00a0 It needs to be.\u00a0 This is a Russian obligation, and so we\u2019re looking to that.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve heard some of the comments that have been made, but there\u2019s nothing \u2013 nothing that I have to report on where this might go.\u00a0 We continue to call for his immediate release, and certainly we need to see consular access now.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, B\u00f9i Ki\u1ec1u Li\u00ean with Bao Chinh Phu.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam, how does it progress?\u00a0 How has it been progressing since?\u00a0 And what that relationship, the result of that relationship, the economic-wise and politically-wise?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s fair to say this has been one of the more remarkable evolutions in relationships that we\u2019ve seen in recent years and in recent decades.\u00a0 And it\u2019s one that is very gratifying to me and to the United States as a whole.\nLet me just give you one example.\u00a0 When we lifted the trade embargo in 1994, there was virtually no trade between Vietnam and the United States.\u00a0 Twenty years later in 2015, the first time that I was here as a representative of the United States, trade was roughly $45 billion between our countries.\u00a0 So it had gone up from virtually zero to $45 billion.\u00a0 Today, we\u2019re approaching $140 billion in trade.\u00a0 So just looking at that aspect of the relationship, we\u2019ve seen a dramatic, dramatic change.\nBut much more broadly than that, we\u2019re seeing the United States and Vietnam working closely together in virtually every area that matters to people in both of our countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in building the strong economic trade and investment relationship.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in the work that we\u2019re doing together now on climate change.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in the work that we\u2019re doing on building the resilience of our supply chains, which we know is so critical.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together to address the needs in the Mekong Delta, including on agriculture.\u00a0 In fact, our Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack will be here, I think, tomorrow following my visit.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve had a whole host of senior officials from across our government reflecting the full range of actions that \u2013 and activities that we\u2019re engaged in.\nBut whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy security, whether it\u2019s trade and investment, in science and technology, education \u2013 all of these areas, cooperation, collaboration between the United States and Vietnam has grown exponentially.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re also working very closely together in regional organizations like ASEAN, APEC, and collaborating to advance the international rule of law that both of our countries strongly adhere to and want to make sure is upheld and strengthened.\nAnd so in so many ways we become genuine partners trying to advance mutual interests and doing it in a way that reflects the interests of our people.\u00a0 As I said a moment ago, earlier today I had the opportunity to break ground for our new embassy compound, and that in and of itself is very symbolic of the relationship.\u00a0 The fact that we need that compound because we were doing so much together that our diplomatic presence is even more important than it\u2019s ever been.\nSo for us, for President Biden, for Washington, this is one of the most dynamic and one of the most important relationships\u00a0 we\u2019ve had.\u00a0 It\u2019s had a remarkable trajectory over the last couple of decades.\u00a0 Our conviction is that it can and will grow even stronger in the decades ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "U.S. Embassy Hanoi ", "location": "Hanoi, Vietnam", "date": "April 15, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you, everyone, very, very much.\u00a0 This really is a particular pleasure because this has been a day long in the making.\nI heard about this project, I think, the first time I was here as deputy secretary from Ambassador Osius, then Ambassador Kritenbrink.\u00a0 Marc, congratulations.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But thank you, in all seriousness, for your extraordinary leadership at a time of tremendous importance.\nTo my friend the foreign minister, we\u2019re so grateful not just for your presence but for our partnership every single day and for the work that you are instrumental in doing in bringing us to this day.\nAnd to the vice minister, to our colleagues from the city as well, the planning commission, thank you, thank you so much.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for this partnership, this collaboration.\u00a0 And it doesn\u2019t take that much imagination \u2013 maybe just a little bit \u2013 to see what this could be in just a few years\u2019 time, but also to see what it\u2019s going to represent in both symbolic and practical ways for the relationship between our countries.\nTo everyone who\u2019s here from the Government of Vietnam, from our embassy team, all colleagues past and present: \u00a0Thank you for all of the hard work that has gone to making this day possible.\u00a0 I know that it took a lot of work.\u00a0\nSo in a few moments, we will symbolically break ground on the new embassy campus here in Hanoi.\nYears in the making, this is the culmination of dedicated and often very creative engagement between countless Americans and countless Vietnamese diplomats.\nAnd again, that\u2019s something I saw firsthand when I was here in 2015 and 2016 as deputy secretary working together to find the land for the campus.\nNow, this groundbreaking \u2013 and the new embassy that we\u2019ll build \u2013 represents another significant step toward strengthening a vital partnership between our countries and between our people.\nBack in 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Hanoi to normalize diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.\u00a0 Opening the embassy was a key part of that effort.\nNow, back then, things looked a little bit different at the U.S. embassy.\u00a0 There were fewer than 30 American employees.\u00a0 Much of their work was done with a very exciting technology that let them communicate instantly with colleagues around the world: the fax machine.\u00a0\nSo we\u2019ve come a little bit of distance from those days.\u00a0 A few things have changed. \u00a0We have emails.\u00a0 And the small team that opened the embassy back then has grown to include more than 600 American and local staff.\nOver the last 27 years, similarly, the ties that connect our countries, Vietnam and the United States, have grown stronger and stronger.\u00a0 And that\u2019s happened in no small part because of our renewed diplomatic presence in Hanoi, because of our exceptional staff \u2013 at the embassy, at our consulate in Ho Chi Minh City \u2013 who have worked day-in/day-out to forge a relationship that\u2019s robust, that\u2019s dynamic, that\u2019s consequential, and that addresses the needs of the people in both of our countries.\u00a0\nToday, we are, as you\u2019ve head, celebrating 10 years of collaboration through our Comprehensive Partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019ve joined forces on everything from improving public health, to expanding inclusive economic opportunities, to accelerating the clean energy transition.\nWe\u2019re advancing together a free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific region, one that is at peace and rooted in respect for the rules-based international order.\u00a0 And we\u2019re continuing to work together to address the legacy of the war in Vietnam.\nFor nearly three decades, our embassy in Hanoi has been at the center of every one of these shared activities, and many more.\u00a0 And what the new facility will enable us to do is to build on that foundation for decades to come, meet modern challenges, and deliver for our people.\nIt\u2019s going to be eight stories tall.\u00a0 The building will be big enough to bring our entire team together under one roof, enabling both greater collaboration and greater efficiency.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have four times the number of consular windows as our current office, so that we can get visas and passports to more people more quickly.\u00a0 And over an estimated six years of construction, the project will provide good jobs for as many as 1,800 local workers, while adding $350 million to the Vietnamese economy.\nWhat\u2019s also powerful and important is that the embassy is going to reflect a fusion of our cultures and our nations.\u00a0 The complex was designed by an American company, inspired by a mix of Vietnam\u2019s topography and Hanoi\u2019s urban architecture.\nThe base of the building will be made from basalt \u2013 a rock that\u2019s found both in Vietnam and the United States.\u00a0 And the embassy\u2019s construction will embody our countries\u2019 shared commitment to environmental sustainability and resilience.\u00a0 We\u2019re building much of the embassy using recycled materials, and the design will both conserve energy and mitigate the risk of flooding from severe storms.\nWhen Secretary Christopher opened the embassy in Hanoi in 1995, he spoke about building a bridge of cooperation between our nations.\u00a0 But what no one could have anticipated, and what is plainly visible to all today, almost three decades later, is everything that building that bridge has enabled.\u00a0 With this new campus, we will be able to foster still more of those connections and all the relationships, the innovations, the opportunities that come with them.\nSo this is really a special day.\u00a0 And I was saying to the foreign minister, when the embassy is actually complete and built, I hope both of us are pulled out of our retirements and brought back to help actually open it.\u00a0 Thank you all very much for being here today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Secretary Manalo, Secretary Galvez, it has been an honor to host you at the State Department for the third ever \u2013 and first since 2016 \u2013 U.S.-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial alongside Secretary of Defense Austin.\u00a0 Today\u2019s meeting builds on the momentum of the high-level U.S. visits to the Philippines just over the past year, including by Vice President Harris, by Secretary Austin, and myself.\nThe Philippines is the United States\u2019 oldest ally in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our relationship is based on the shared interests and values of Americans and Filipinos, including our abiding commitment to democracy.\u00a0 For decades, we\u2019ve worked together to promote peace and stability across the region, and we\u2019re growing that effective partnership in scale and scope every single day, including through very productive, very rich discussions today.\nOur security alliance is an enduring source of strength for both of our nations.\u00a0 Today, we focused on ways to continue our close partnership under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement so that our forces can work even more closely together, including to provide humanitarian assistance and respond to disasters.\u00a0 Secretary Austin and I also reaffirmed the United States\u2019 unwavering commitment to standing with the Philippines against any intimidation or coercion, including in the South China Sea, and to preserving a region that\u2019s governed by international law where goods and ideas and people can move freely.\nWe also discussed deepening our robust economic ties, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity.\u00a0 We\u2019re working closely with other IPEF partners to build out this framework to help our economies grow faster and fairer so that all our people can reach their full potential, lead on issues shaping the 21st-century economy, and do it in a way that is sustainable for our planet.\nOne way that we\u2019re putting our partnership through IPEF to work is by collaborating to increase economic opportunities for women and girls in the Philippines.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing training in growing industries like data science and artificial intelligence, where women have been under-represented, and boosting digital literacy rates.\nAnd more broadly, as we discussed today, we\u2019re committed to expanding our economic cooperation across the board.\u00a0 Indeed, we discussed a number of areas where we can deepen our collaboration, cooperation in pursuit of that goal.\nTogether, we\u2019re stepping up to address global challenges that no country can solve alone.\u00a0 We discussed our shared efforts to combat the climate crisis and strengthen energy security.\u00a0 The United States is committed to helping the Philippines reach its ambitious goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent by 2030.\u00a0 To do that, the U.S. Government and critically, the private sector, are supporting the growth of the offshore wind market, the development of nickel and cobalt facilities that will help the Philippines sustainable process \u2013 sustainably process minerals essential to the clean energy transition.\nWe\u2019re also providing technical assistance and regulatory guidance to support the growth of the Philippines\u2019 civil nuclear energy program.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking to grow our cooperation through a 123 agreement on civil nuclear cooperation which will make it easier for us to share technical knowledge as well as nuclear material and equipment.\nWe\u2019re delivering solutions to the food security challenges impacting the Philippines like so many other countries.\u00a0 Philippines-based companies, with the support of the United States Government and the American private sector, are making impressive progress in developing climate-smart food systems, increasing their productivity, and the sustainability of their supply chains.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking forward to continuing this progress at the inaugural U.S.-Philippines Food Security Dialogue a little bit later this year.\nWe\u2019re able to do this work not only because of the partnership between our governments but also because of the partnership between our peoples.\u00a0 This year, we\u2019re celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Fulbright Program in the Philippines, the longest running Fulbright Program in the world.\u00a0 More than 22,000 Filipinos have come to the United States through the Fulbright and other U.S. exchange programs, enriching our communities with their perspectives and experiences, innovating and launching businesses, building enduring bonds between our people \u2013 bonds that to this day renew and revitalize the friendship between our countries.\nAcross all of these areas and more, the United States values and is proud of our robust and deepening partnership with the Philippines.\u00a0 Secretary Austin and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss in-depth how we\u2019ll make this essential relationship even stronger in the months and years ahead.\nSo really grateful to our colleagues for being here today, grateful to their teams at the hard work that\u2019s been done, but not grateful simply for their presence but also the spirit in which together we are working to strengthen the bonds between our countries.\nRicky, over to you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Tony.\u00a0 Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Senior Undersecretary and OIC Carlito G. Galvez, Jr., friends from the media, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\u00a0 I\u2019m very pleased to be here in Washington and to address all of you today.\u00a0 Some of you were with Secretary Blinken when we held our first meeting in our current capacities in Manila last August.\u00a0 We agreed then to work together in sustaining the positive momentum and trajectory of Philippine-U.S. relations, including by reconvening our 2+2 ministerial dialogue in 2023.\u00a0 And I\u2019m happy to report that we have in fact followed through on that commitment.\nToday is only the third iteration of our dialogue in the 2+2 format since it was established in 2012.\u00a0 After a seven-year gap since the second meeting in 2016, this meeting holds particular significance as it further reaffirms our shared commitment to advancing our common priorities as treaty allies and close partners amidst evolving regional and global security challenges.\nThe joint statement we will issue today, and the various areas it covers, demonstrates the breadth and depth of our bilateral relationship.\u00a0 We have reached a number of key understandings that the Philippines believes will truly elevate our relationship and translate into direct, substantial, and tangible benefits for our peoples and countries.\nAt today\u2019s meeting, we redoubled our commitment to modernizing the Philippine-U.S. alliance, recognizing that our partnership will need to play a stronger role in preserving an international law-based international order.\u00a0 This means ensuring the conduct of high-level and high-impact, high-value joint exercises, trainings, and other related activities.\u00a0 We especially welcome the United States pledge to fast-track and to ramp up support for the modernization of our defense, civilian law enforcement, and humanitarian assistance and disaster response capabilities, especially in the maritime domain, as well as the implementation of EDCA projects and investments in and around EDCA-agreed locations.\nI wish to point out that we also underscored the importance of equally ensuring that our modern alliance not only serves as an instrument as peace, but it shall also be a force for good that brings about sustained economic benefits to our two countries, down to our local communities.\nOur discussions and proposed ways forwards are aligned with the Philippines\u2019 priorities on agriculture, food security, promoting energy security as we transition to clean energy, boosting trade, and building resilience of our supply chains, as well as enhancing connectivity and digitalization.\u00a0 Our discussions focused also on areas such as economic cooperation, climate change, renewable energy, economic resilience, and economic security.\nThank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Manalo, and Secretary Galvez, I\u2019m honored to be here with you today for the third U.S.-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue.\u00a0 As you\u2019ve heard, this is the first of its kind in seven years.\nBut first, let me just say a few words about the story that I know many of you are tracking.\u00a0 I was first briefed on the reports of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and classified material on the morning of April 6th.\u00a0 And since then, I have been convening senior department leaders daily on our response, and I have directed an urgent cross-department effort.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve referred the matter to the Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal investigation.\u00a0 Now, I can\u2019t say much more while the Justice Department\u2019s investigation is ongoing, but we take this very seriously.\u00a0 And we will continue to work closely with our outstanding allies and partners, and nothing will ever stop us from keeping America secure.\nNow, let me turn to today\u2019s important discussions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come together at an historic moment in our alliance.\u00a0 For more than seven decades, the U.S. and Philippine forces have trained and fought alongside each other.\u00a0 And today we\u2019re building on those bonds to bring greater security, stability, and prosperity to the Indo-Pacific for the next 70 years and beyond.\u00a0 The commitments that we made today will spur even deeper cooperation to help ensure that we\u2019re poised to tackle the defining challenges of our time \u2013 together.\nWe all reaffirmed today that our Mutual Defense Treaty remains the bedrock of our cooperation.\u00a0 As Secretary Blinken and I have said clearly and repeatedly, the Mutual Defense Treaty applies to armed attacks on either of our armed forces, our aircraft, or public vessels \u2013 including our Coast Guard \u2013 anywhere in the South China Sea.\nAnd so today we built on our work together during my recent visit to Manila and discussed plans to operationalize the four new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement locations in Palawan and northern Luzon.\u00a0 These sites will support combined training exercises and interoperability between our forces to ensure that we\u2019re even better prepared for future crises.\nWe\u2019re proud of the investments we\u2019re making, and by the end of FY \u201923 we expect to have allocated more than $100 million in infrastructure investments at the new and existing EDCA sites.\u00a0 So those investments will spur job creation and economic growth in local Philippine communities.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also committed to swiftly finalizing the U.S.\u2013 Philippines bilateral defense guidelines, which charts our vision for alliance cooperation across all operational domains, including space and cyberspace.\nIn the face of coercion and gray zone aggression, Secretary Galvez and I agreed to redouble our efforts to strengthen our combined ability to resist armed attack by modernizing our armed forces.\u00a0 We also discussed near-term plans to complete a security sector assistance roadmap to support the delivery of priority defense platforms over the next five to ten years, including radars, unmanned aerial systems, military transport aircraft, and coastal and air defense systems.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on the some 500 defense engagements that our militaries conduct each year, and we\u2019re forging new ties between our militaries and expanding the breadth of our cooperation.\nYesterday, we celebrated the start of our 38th annual Exercise Balikatan.\u00a0 More than 17,000 troops are participating this year.\u00a0 It is the largest and most complex iteration in the exercise\u2019s history.\u00a0 Now the commitments that we made today will further integrate our strong bilateral ties into multilateral networks, including with Japan and Australia, and we discussed plans to conduct combined maritime activities with likeminded partners in the South China Sea later this year as we work to enhance our collective deterrence.\nOur alliance is ultimately guided by our deep and enduring commitment to freedom.\u00a0 So we\u2019re not just allies, we\u2019re democratic allies, and the United States and the Philippines are bound by a common vision for the future \u2013 a vision that\u2019s anchored in the rule of law and freedom of the seas and respect for the territorial integrity of sovereign states.\nAnd Secretary Galvez, Secretary Manalo, and Secretary Blinken, thank you for your leadership and your steadfast partnership as we build this future together.\nSecretary Galvez, the floor is yours, sir.\nOFFICER IN CHARGE GALVEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Foremost, my highest courtesies to the Secretary Antony J. Blinken and Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, to my most esteemed colleague Secretary Enrique Manalo.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\nFirst of all, we would like to take this moment to express our profoundest thanks to the U.S.\u00a0 We are grateful to the U.S. Government and the American people for their kind assistance in our current environmental sea disaster in containing the oil spill in Oriental Mindoro.\u00a0 Upon our request for assistance, the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Embassy, and the U.S. Navy manifested their unwavering support to its deployment of the Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, as well as the technical support provided by the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to help contain an oil spill.\nThe timely and efficient response of our allies in providing the technical and material support, amounting to more than $20 million U.S., was very instrumental in mitigating the impact of this environmental disaster on our coastal communities that may affect millions of Filipino people.\u00a0 The aid and cooperation demonstrates the strength of the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance, and we are very proud to be partner of the United States.\u00a0 And your commitment to assisting us in this time of need has reinforced the band of friendship and mutual trust between our nations.\u00a0 We will not forget.\nAs to vaccine, sir, I would like also to \u2013 like to reiterate our appreciation for the 3.6 million vaccine doses donated by the U.S. Government to the Philippines, which save millions of Filipino lives and help our economy to recover.\nToday, we have just concluded the third 2+2 ministerial meeting between the Philippines and the United States.\u00a0 And I am pleased to announce that it had been a most productive meeting, which expanded to even to economic security.\u00a0 The last time the 2+2 ministerial consultation were convened was in January 2016.\u00a0 The fact that we are able to convene once again highlights the continued importance and relevance of our partnership and the need for continued dialogue and cooperation on matters of mutual interest.\nIt is also noteworthy that this is the first time the meeting will be convened under the Marcos administration, which highlights the Philippine Government\u2019s commitment to strengthening our alliance with the United States.\u00a0 Our meeting today will set the direction that we would like to be the Philippine-U.S. alliance to take in consideration of our present-day realities and common security challenges.\nAlong this line, I wish to emphasize the strength and credibility of the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance, which is founded on a shared commitment to regional peace, stability, and security.\u00a0 Our partnership has weathered many challenges in the past and continues to stand strong today.\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to the Mutual Defense Treaty, which is our cornerstone of our partnership.\nOur defense establishments recognize the need to work together to enhance our interoperability, increase our defense capacity, and build our resilience against emerging challenges.\u00a0 To this end, we agreed to explore new areas of cooperation and deepen our existing partnership in key areas such as mutual defense, maritime security, and information/intelligence sharing, and joint sails and solidarity patrols.\nWe also welcomed the ongoing conduct of the biggest ever Exercise Balikatan, which involved 17,000 forces \u2013 12,000 U.S. personnel, 5,000 AFP personnel, and 111 Australian defense forces and observers from other likeminded countries, which capacitates our armed forces to train and operate together, improve interoperability, and enhance our respective capabilities.\nWith the announcement of the four additional sites where Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement agreed locations can be developed, and we reaffirm our commitment to work together in implementing the EDCA through the completion of both existing and potential projects.\nLastly, we discussed opportunities for future cooperation with likeminded partners in the region.\u00a0 We recognize that we cannot address such a wide range of security challenges and that we need to work with other countries who share our interest in accordance with our respective national laws and policies.\u00a0 We affirm the commitment to sustain regular exchanges through existing platforms, namely the 2+2 ministerial consultations, Bilateral Strategic Dialogue, the Mutual Defense Board, Security Engagement Board, and among others.\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize that the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance is strong and credible, and we are committed to modernizing our alliance to meet the evolving security challenges of the region.\u00a0 This alliance is for peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take three questions.\u00a0 First we\u2019ll go to Demetri Sevastopulo with\u00a0The Financial Times.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 I have questions for both sides.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, can you give us a sense of what kinds and numbers of military assets and personnel that you intend to position or rotate through the EDCA sites in the Philippines?\u00a0 And can you explain how specifically does this enhanced cooperation increase your ability to prepare for any possible conflict with China over Taiwan?\nAnd to Secretaries Manalo and Galvez, how will the EDCA sites be used if the U.S. and China go to war over Taiwan?\u00a0 And will there be any restrictions on what the U.S. military can do with the sites?\nAnd finally, Secretary Blinken, this is a China question.\u00a0 Your relations with China appear to be deteriorating continuously with only sporadic signs of positive developments.\u00a0 Is this the long-term future of U.S. relations with China, or is there some kind of a realistic way to turn things around?\u00a0 And when do you expect to go to Beijing?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, thanks for your question, Demetri.\u00a0 EDCA is a key pillar to our alliance.\u00a0 It provides us the opportunity to train together, to increase interoperability.\u00a0 And you know, Demetri, interoperability is not something that you can show up at the last moment and snap your figures and achieve.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that you\u2019ve got to work on each and every day.\u00a0 And so the addition of these EDCA sites puts us in a position to be able to not only train together but also respond to meet the needs of the Philippines in the event of a crisis like a natural disaster or a requirement to rapidly provide humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 And so I think it helps us not only work together, but it helps us address the needs of the Philippines as well.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s essential to our ability to strengthen our combined deterrence posture.\nI think it\u2019s a bit early to try to discuss numbers and specific timing of rotations, but certainly these are things that Secretary Galvez and I will continue to work on going forward.\u00a0 But again, it is a tremendous opportunity.\nI would finally emphasize that whatever we do in the future in terms of rotations and numbers of troops, it is a joint decision between the Philippines and \u2013 the Philippine Government and the U.S. Government.\u00a0 So again, a great opportunity.\u00a0 I\u2019m excited about the ability to increase interoperability and look forward to continuing our great work together.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0 Thank you very much for your question.\u00a0 What I can say at this stage is that the new sites that have been identified, the new EDCA sites, are mainly aimed at increasing or improving interoperability as well as addressing potential human, humanitarian disasters or climate-related disasters.\nAnd in operationalizing these sites, of course, much work still has to be done.\u00a0 We have to identify the terms and references, how these activities will be undertaken.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really at any stage yet to answer how they might be used.\u00a0 They\u2019re still open to discussion.\u00a0 But I think we have already reached an understanding that the basic elements of these sites would be, the basic purposes of these sites would be to address humanitarian disaster-related events, to increase and improve interoperability and training of Filipino and American assets, and also to be in a position to improve the interoperability and perhaps respond to other types of security challenges.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Demetri, with regard to China, you\u2019ve heard me say before, Secretary Austin and others say before, that the relationship between our countries is among the most consequential and also the most complex of any that we have, and the same could probably be said for many other countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re not reducing it to a bumper sticker, as \u2013 again \u2013 I\u2019ve said before.\u00a0 It has different aspects to it: certainly competitive, cooperative in other respects, and in some instances more adversarial.\nWhat we\u2019ve been working to do, first of all, is to make sure that when it comes to our own strategy and our own approach we\u2019re following through on it, making investments in ourselves and our strength at home.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that, aligning increasingly with partners around the world, whether that\u2019s in Europe and Asia, and we\u2019ve done that with greater convergence than I\u2019ve seen at any time with key partners on the approach to some of the challenges posed by China, and putting those assets together so that we\u2019re competing very vigorously in upholding our interests, upholding our values, and building our vision for the future.\nWhat I hear from countries around the world and what I believe is profoundly in our interest is for us to manage the relationship with China responsibly.\u00a0 And our goal is peace, security, stability, and creating opportunity.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to engage in a new cold war.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to contain China.\u00a0 But in doing that, in trying to advance a world that is peaceful, secure, stable, and with more opportunity, we\u2019re going to stand up very vigorously for our values and for our interests, and we\u2019re doing that with regard to China.\nWe\u2019re also prepared to work cooperatively with China where it\u2019s in our interest and their interest and, I believe, in the interests of the world.\u00a0 And there are a number of issues that we\u2019ve laid out \u2013 transnational challenges that no one country can solve alone where it would benefit all of us and benefit the world for us to find ways to work together.\nThrough all of this, it\u2019s, I believe, important to maintain channels of communication to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to each other clearly, and we\u2019ve certainly continued to do that even through what\u2019s been a challenging period in our relationship.\u00a0 I think as our two presidents agreed when they met in Bali at the end of last year at the G20, it would be important to continue to find ways to strengthen those channels of communication.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We look to do that in the time ahead.\nAnd when it comes to my own visit to China, when the conditions are right I\u2019ll certainly look forward to pursuing that.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, you just said that you first learned about the leaked documents on the 6th of April.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been online for months.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t U.S. intelligence, the rest of U.S. Government, see those leaked documents online for all those months?\u00a0 Is that an intelligence failure?\nAnd I\u2019d like to ask Secretary Blinken that same issue, as well as your conversations with Foreign Minister Kuleba of Ukraine.\u00a0 We have seen documents that indicate that Ukraine has crossed \u2013 with Ukrainian agents working for the government have launched drone attacks in Russia and in Belarus, contrary to commitments that they would not do that.\u00a0 Are you concerned that this would \u2013 will \u2013 undermine Western support for Ukraine?\u00a0 And can you talk about the overall damage that these leaks have caused to our reputation for handling intelligence with our closest allies?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, do you have concerns about sharing intelligence with the United States given the fact that these leaked documents were online for so many months?\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Thanks, Andrea.\u00a0 The documents that we are aware of are dated the 28th of February and 1st of March.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if there are other documents that are \u2013 that have been online before.\u00a0 These are things that we will find, find out as we continue to investigate.\u00a0 But the documents that we are focused on\u00a0thus far \u2013 28th of February and the 1st of March.\u00a0 Again, we will continue to investigate and try to determine the full scope of the activity.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But, sir, why did we know about it and why didn\u2019t you know about it before April 6th?\u00a0 That means that they were up for at least many weeks, months, before U.S. intelligence knew that they were in the public domain.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, they were somewhere in the web, and where exactly and who had access at that point we don\u2019t know.\u00a0 We simply don\u2019t know at this point.\u00a0 So \u2013 and again, I won\u2019t speculate, Andrea.\u00a0 I will tell you that we take this very seriously and we will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Andrea, my \u2013 I don\u2019t have much to add beyond what the Secretary said.\u00a0 Let me just say with regard to, broadly, allies and partners and these documents, we have engaged with allies and partners at high levels over the past \u2013 the past days, including to reassure them about our own commitment to safeguarding intelligence and, of course, our commitment to our security partnerships.\nWith regard to Ukraine itself, I did speak to Foreign Minister Kuleba today, and in speaking to him, among other things, I reaffirmed our enduring support for Ukraine and for its efforts to defend its territorial integrity, its sovereignty, its independence; reaffirmed the extraordinary support that we have provided to Ukraine along with dozens of other countries over the last year to help it defend itself, support that will be ongoing and indeed, as you\u2019ve seen just as recently this week, additional support that was provided.\nI\u2019m not going to comment on specific actions that Ukraine takes when it comes to defending its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, but we are determined to assist Ukraine in the efforts that it\u2019s making to regain the territory that\u2019s been seized from it, and I reaffirmed that commitment today in speaking to Foreign Minister Kuleba.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Are you concerned about cross-border attacks?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, I\u2019m not going to speak directly to any particular actions, and I\u2019m certainly not going to comment on these purported documents.\u00a0 But Ukraine has to make decisions about how it can most effectively defend itself against Russian aggression and take back the territory that\u2019s been seized from it.\u00a0 We give our advice as appropriate, we provide the support; that is well-known.\u00a0 But Ukraine makes the decisions about how it actually prosecutes the effort to regain its territory.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Oh.\u00a0 First let me also share the view of Secretary Blinken that we are very confident after \u2013 especially after today\u2019s meeting of the commitment to our alliance and our partnership.\u00a0 And I really don\u2019t want to jump to any speculation or jump to any conclusions at this stage.\u00a0 We have full confidence in the investigation that will be undertaken.\u00a0 And certainly we would have to wait for the results before we can even comment.\nBut just let me say that we are confident of the strength of our relationship and our growing partnership.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Will Mauldin of\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 First for Undersecretary Galvez, the mentioned exercise is going to take place later this year in the South China Sea.\u00a0 I wonder what countries would be involved in those exercises and whether there are any concerns that these exercises or the ongoing ones or different steps that the U.S. is taking with its allies and partners in the region would generate a response \u2013 a dangerous response from China.\nFor Secretary Austin, I wanted to ask:\u00a0 Irregardless of where the investigation into the documents take us or the veracity of the documents, they\u2019re posted online and definitely seen by the Russians as well as the Ukrainians.\u00a0 I wonder to what degree this will affect the tactics of the expected Ukrainian offensive this spring or summer.\u00a0 How \u2013 to what degree will their tactics need to change?\u00a0 To what degree will you recommend changes in those tactics?\nFinally, for Secretary Blinken, I wanted to ask about my good friend and colleague Evan Gershkovich.\u00a0 You found him wrongfully detained, and so I wanted to ask when your staff will be able to get consular access to him in Russia.\u00a0 What\u2019s taking so long there?\u00a0 And will there be any leverage that you can exert?\u00a0 Is there any leverage that you can exert to get Russia to provide that access and what strategies will you work on and will the administration be working on to free him?\nThank you.\nOFFICER IN CHARGE GALVEZ:\u00a0 The Balikatan exercise \u2013 this is its 38th activation, and it\u2019s been \u2013 we are doing the Balikatan yearly.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t expect any violent reaction considering that this exercise is intended for our collective defense with the U.S. and other allies.\nFor today, for this Balikatan, we have the participation of, as I have said earlier, 17,000 troops, including 12,000 Americans, 5,000 Filipinos, and 111 Australians.\u00a0 We have also observers from the ASEAN nations and also from other allies, and we are happy to say that\u00a0these exercises are varied exercises on counterterrorism, humanitarian response, and also on developing interoperability with our U.S. forces and also our Australian friends.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0Hey Will, thanks for the question.\u00a0 I just spoke with my counterpart in Ukraine today, Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.\u00a0 And we talked about a number of issues, but \u2013 as we typically do.\u00a0 But he and the leadership remain focused on the task at hand.\u00a0 And I have every confidence that they will do what good leaders, great leaders do:\u00a0 They will fight the enemy and not be driven by a specific plan.\u00a0 They have a great plan to start and \u2013 but only President Zelenskyy and his leadership really know the full details of that plan.\nSo they have much of the capability that they need to continue to be successful.\u00a0 We\u2019ve trained an enormous number of troops.\u00a0 We have provided a substantial number of platforms.\u00a0 And so I think he feels that he\u2019s in a \u2013 they\u2019re in a pretty good position.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll stay focused on continuing to generate security assistance capability so that they can continue to be successful whenever they choose to take up offensive operations.\nAnd again, sustainment will be there throughout.\u00a0 We\u2019ll stay connected with our allies and partners.\u00a0 We next meet for our next round of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on the 21st, and I look forward to seeing him and the rest of our colleagues at that meeting.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And Will, as to your question regarding Evan, yes, I made the determination yesterday that he is being wrongfully detained by Russia.\nPresident Biden had an opportunity to speak to his family today, I believe.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken to your colleagues, including leadership at\u00a0The Wall Street Journal, multiple times about Evan\u2019s situation.\u00a0 When I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov about a week ago now, just after Evan was detained, I of course pressed for his immediate release, but I also pressed for immediate consular access to him.\u00a0 The fact that Russia has not granted that access puts it once again in violation of international commitments it\u2019s made, commitments that are at the heart of diplomatic relations between countries and the ability of our citizens as well to be able to safely be present in other countries.\nI think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access \u2013 never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes \u2013 is going to do even more damage to Russia\u2019s standing around the world, a standing that has been in freefall particularly since its reinvasion of Ukraine last year.\nAnd I think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there lest they be arbitrarily detained, and in the context of being arbitrarily detained not even having access for the diplomats who are there to look out for their interests and who, as a matter of solemn international obligations that Russia has undertaken, should be allowed that access.\nI\u2019m not going to get into what measures, steps we\u2019re taking or might take to do that.\u00a0 I can simply tell you that we are engaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan\u2019s release.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, your Excellencies.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-bangladeshi-foreign-minister-abdul-momen-before-their-meeting-2/", "title":

Blinken  at a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "NATO Headquarters", "location": "Brussels, Belgium", "date": "April 5, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s always good to be back in Belgium, in Brussels, at the NATO Headquarters, which has become almost a home away from home.\u00a0 But this week, these last two days, this has genuinely been a historic NATO meeting.\nYesterday, on the 74th anniversary of the Alliance, I accepted Finland\u2019s membership documents to join NATO.\u00a0 Finland is now our 31st Ally.\u00a0 With this step, Finland is safer; NATO is stronger.\u00a0 We look forward to welcoming Sweden to NATO in the near future.\u00a0 Like Finland, it\u2019s militarily capable.\u00a0 It\u2019s a strong democracy, fully dedicated to upholding the commitments and values that underpin our Alliance, including Article 5.\nAt the NATO leaders summit last summer, the NATO Allies agreed on a new strategy for the first time in a decade.\u00a0 Since then, including at this ministerial, we\u2019ve been working to implement that strategy, making our Alliance stronger, more resilient, better positioned for the future.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on the Wales defense investment pledge to invest 2 percent of our GDP in defense.\u00a0 It is critical that we have the means to replenish stockpiles, to increase the readiness of our forces, to meet force generation commitments for NATO missions and operations, to keep pace with 21st century challenges.\nWe\u2019re developing new partnerships, including in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 At this ministerial, we welcomed the participation of Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, who share our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region but also recognize that many of the challenges that we face are interconnected and global in nature.\nAnd of course, the Alliance remains relentlessly focused on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 The NATO-Ukraine Commission met for the first time in five years, with Foreign Minister Kuleba\u2019s participation, to talk about ways that we can continue to help Ukraine in the weeks, the months, and indeed the years ahead.\nWhen the NATO foreign ministers last convened back in November of last year, President Putin was pursuing his new strategy to win his brutal war against Ukraine.\u00a0 Having suffered devastating setbacks on the battlefield, he tried to bomb and freeze Ukraine\u2019s civilian population into submission.\u00a0 He accelerated his campaign to weaponize energy against Ukraine\u2019s European partners so that they would decide that the cost of supporting the country were too high.\u00a0 And he continued to try to raise food and energy prices in some of the poorest countries in the world to manufacture a false choice between supporting Ukraine and making ends meet for their people.\nPresident Putin has failed.\u00a0 Thanks to the remarkable courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people and unprecedented support from Ukraine\u2019s partners, Ukraine endures.\u00a0 More than 50 countries have been providing security assistance.\u00a0 Dozens of countries jumped in to help Ukraine defend and repair its energy grid in the face of Russia\u2019s onslaught.\u00a0 We sustained and increased the pressure on Russia with unprecedented sanctions and export controls, which are having a dramatic and growing impact.\u00a0 The Kremlin\u2019s usable financial reserves are plummeting.\u00a0 Its budget revenues from oil and gas have been cut in half since last year.\u00a0 Hundreds, even more than a thousand, companies have fled the country and aren\u2019t coming back.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands of young people have fled Russia \u2013 literally Russia\u2019s future.\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated again our unity of purpose and our unity of action.\u00a0 And after this ministerial, I am confident that that will endure for as long as it takes for Ukraine to defend its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, its independence.\nYesterday, the United States announced our 35th drawdown of arms and equipment.\u00a0 That includes more ammunition for HIMARS, air defense interceptors and artillery rounds, as well as antiarmor systems, small arms, heavy equipment transport vehicles, and maintenance support.\u00a0 These contributions will continue to enable Ukraine to protect civilian infrastructure from missile and drone attacks and to hold and retake Ukraine\u2019s territory.\nThe United States and Ukraine\u2019s partners support meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve a peace, but not just any kind of peace.\u00a0 It has to be a just peace that upholds the principles of the UN Charter \u2013 sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence \u2013 and it has to be an durable peace that ensures that Russia can\u2019t simply rest and refit its troops and then relaunch the war at a time of its choosing.\u00a0 That\u2019s the kind of peace, a just and durable one, that 141 countries at the United Nations General Assembly endorsed just a few weeks ago.\nUntil that peace is achieved, the United States, together with allies and partners from around the world, will continue to provide the assistance that Ukraine needs to defend its territory and defend its people.\nThe story of NATO over the last year has been one of unity and resolve.\u00a0 Amid new challenges to our values, to a rules-based order, to our collective security, our Alliance has emerged stronger than ever and now larger than ever.\u00a0 As we prepare for Vilnius and beyond, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to meet the challenges of this moment and the time to come.\nSo with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Vivian Salama with\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Vivian.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I want to ask you about my colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who as of today has been detained in Russia for the last year \u2013 for the last week, sorry.\u00a0 Do you \u2013 it feels like a year.\u00a0 Do you anticipate that you will approve a designation of wrongfully detained for Evan, or do you need to wait however long it will take for the Russians to agree to grant him consular access for that to even happen?\nAnd secondly, prisoner swaps have occurred in recent years to bring a number of detained Americans home.\u00a0 Is there anyone that the Russians want or would be willing to exchange either for Evan or for Paul Whelan, who is also being held on espionage charges?\u00a0 And more broadly, are you concerned that there is a precedent being set now by our adversaries who are detaining Americans in the hope that maybe they would be some sort of prisoner swap in return?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks very much, Vivian. \u00a0First \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard me say this before \u2013 from my perspective, from the department\u2019s perspective, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of American citizens around the world, and that includes those who may be wrongfully detained, held hostage, otherwise kept from coming home, being with their families.\nIn Evan\u2019s case, we are working through the determination on wrongful detention, and there\u2019s a process to do that and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working through very deliberately but expeditiously as well.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll let that process play out.\u00a0 In my own mind, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s being wrongfully detained by Russia, which is exactly what I said to Foreign Minister Lavrov when I spoke to him over the weekend and insisted that Evan be released immediately.\u00a0 But I want to make sure that \u2013 as always, because there is a formal process \u2013 that we go through it, and we will, and I expect that to be completed soon.\nMore broadly, when it comes, first of all, to Paul Whelan, as I\u2019ve also said, there\u2019s a proposal on the table that\u2019s been on the table for some months.\u00a0 Again, with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I reiterated that Russia should move on that proposal so that we can bring Paul home.\u00a0 In any of these instances, there is a balance to be done between trying to bring home people who are being unjustly detained in one way or another and what it takes to do that.\u00a0 I believe that, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past and as a result as well of legislation that we have and other tools that we have, that even as we engage in efforts to bring people home, we can also increase the pressure and increase the penalties on those who would engage in the practice of unlawful, arbitrary detention of American citizens.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing, including, for example, implementing the Robert Levinson Act and other tools that we have.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Vitaliy Syzov with Freedom TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I have one question.\u00a0 Yesterday, after meeting with you, minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine said that he want to see some proposal from NATO during the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 Today, minister of foreign affairs of Estonia said that Ukraine should be provided with a roadmap of accession to NATO.\u00a0 What are your thoughts about this process?\u00a0 Each proposal could expect to get Ukraine during Vilnius Summit.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Our focus right now is relentlessly on doing what needs to be done to help Ukraine defend itself against the Russian aggression and, indeed, to put it in a \u2013 help put it in a position to retake more of the territory that\u2019s been seized from it by Russia.\u00a0 That\u2019s our intense focus.\nWe\u2019re also looking at what we can do over a longer period of time to build up Ukraine\u2019s capacity to deter aggression, to defend against aggression, and, if necessary again in the future, to defeat aggression.\u00a0 And a big part of that is bringing Ukraine up to NATO standards and to NATO interoperability.\u00a0 And I suspect that you\u2019ll see that focus continue at the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the summit, but we are very focused on these very practical steps that can be taken and need to continue to be taken to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards.\nOf course, NATO\u2019s door remain open \u2013 remains open.\u00a0 There\u2019s no change in that, but we have to be in this moment focused intensely on the weeks and months ahead, particularly as Ukraine prepares for a counteroffensive, again, to try to retake more of its territory, as well as work that needs to be done to continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards and NATO interoperability.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Kylie Atwood with CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Hi, Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you for doing this.\u00a0 It was a momentous week here, but there\u2019s a lot going on at home, so I have a few questions for you.\u00a0 Bear with me.\u00a0 In terms of what happened here, obviously, you said that NATO has become stronger this week with Finland joining, but how tangibly will Ukraine benefit from Finland joining NATO?\nAnd then my second two questions have to do with what is happening at home.\u00a0 First, President Tsai of Taiwan is meeting with Speaker McCarthy today in California.\u00a0 Do you support this meeting at this time?\u00a0 And how concerned are you about China already vowing that it will retaliate?\nAnd then my second question has to do with politics at home.\u00a0 Yesterday, the world watched as former President Trump was arrested.\u00a0 He\u2019s now the first current or former president to face criminal charges, and he\u2019s running for re-election to be president.\u00a0 Have any of your allies asked you about this while you\u2019ve been here at NATO?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your response to revive concerns among Allies that many of us have heard about the long-term reliability of the United States given the polarized nature of politics at home?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Kylie, last question first.\u00a0 As you know well, I don\u2019t do politics.\u00a0 I can tell you, though, that the question you raised about the proceedings in New York actually did not come up in my conversations with NATO colleagues, nor did I get questions about the durability of our approach.\u00a0 I think people are very focused on what we\u2019re actually doing, and what we\u2019re doing is a lot, including what I just went through in terms of the outcomes from this ministerial, the preparations for the leaders summit in Vilnius, the intense focus on everything we\u2019re doing to support Ukraine, to implement the new Strategic Concept for NATO.\u00a0 That\u2019s what everyone was talking about and focused on, and also, as I mentioned, the fact that we have the growing engagement between NATO and other partners, to include our partners from the Indo-Pacific, to include the European Union \u2013 its high representative was here as well today.\u00a0 That was the entirety of the conversation and our focus.\nIn terms of Finland\u2019s membership in NATO and Ukraine, look, in the first instance, irrespective of the \u2013 of that question, as I\u2019ve detailed at some length, a big focus of our meetings here over the last day and a half was on Ukraine and the support that virtually every NATO member is providing individually, as well as the support that NATO institutionally is providing, both in the immediate and also looking toward the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 I mentioned a moment ago work that the Alliance looks to do to help continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards, NATO interoperability, and I think that\u2019s something you\u2019ll see featured at the at the leaders summit.\nFinland\u2019s membership in NATO does two things.\u00a0 It, as I\u2019ve said, makes Finland safer because one of the things that resulted from Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was deep and growing concern among a number of countries that they could be next, and that created what I think is truly historic sea change in both Finland and Sweden, seeking membership in NATO, and thus seeking to benefit from its Article 5 guarantees.\u00a0 So Finland now benefits in that, but Finland also makes the Alliance as a whole stronger, and that\u2019s important in and of itself.\u00a0 I think it may have some additional benefits in the sense that, to the extent Russia thinks about expanding or broadening its aggression, the deterrent that NATO poses to that has now become even stronger.\nNATO is a defensive Alliance; it\u2019s not seeking to engage in conflict with Russia.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a defensive Alliance that has to have a strong deterrent, precisely because we want to make sure that countries think twice, think three times, and then don\u2019t engage in aggression.\u00a0 And I think Finland will \u2013 its membership in the Alliance adds to NATO\u2019s deterrence strength and, if necessary, its defensive strength.\nWith regard to President Tsai\u2019s transit of the United States, I think the first thing to emphasize is that these transits by high-level Taiwanese authorities are nothing new.\u00a0 They\u2019re private, they\u2019re unofficial, but they\u2019ve been going on for years, and President Tsai and her predecessors have done the same thing.\u00a0 In fact, every Taiwan president has transited the United States at one point or another.\u00a0 The meetings, the engagements that the president has also are very much in line with precedent.\u00a0 And similarly, our own approach to Taiwan has remained very consistent and unchanged, including our adherence to the \u201cone China\u201d policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Communiques, the Six Assurances, our opposition to any unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying that, given that, Beijing should not use the transits as an excuse to take any actions to ratchet up tensions, to further push at changing the status quo.\u00a0 And our objective remains the same: to have peace, to have stability across the Taiwan Strait, and to ensure that any differences that exist between mainland and Taiwan are resolved peacefully.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Rikhard Husu with \u2013 from YLE.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for taking my question.\u00a0 A follow-up on Finland:\u00a0 How do you see that Finland will strengthen the Alliance?\u00a0 And do you see that this decision to join can also strengthen the ties, bilateral ties between the U.S. and Finland, for instance in regard to a future defense cooperation agreement?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much.\u00a0 Well, the bilateral ties between the United States and Finland are already extraordinarily strong.\u00a0 But I think Finland\u2019s membership in the Alliance can, if it does anything, will only strengthen those ties, as well as Finland\u2019s ties to all the other members of NATO.\u00a0 But as I said before, what Finland brings to this enterprise is a country that has very strong military capacity, and equally important is a strong and vital democracy.\u00a0 And so both in terms of advancing the interests that bring NATO countries together and the values that we share, Finland is a very compelling member of the Alliance.\nAnd I think what\u2019s important, too, is that Finland and the NATO Alliance have been working closely together for years.\u00a0 What membership does now is it makes, in a sense, formal what\u2019s in many ways been the case for a long time, but it also provides Finland with the commitment of every NATO Ally to Finland and its security and its defense as a member of NATO and as a beneficiary of Article 5.\u00a0 But I would anticipate that, across the board, this has the effect of just further strengthening, deepening relationships, not only between the United States and Finland but between Finland and all the other members of NATO.\nWe also have now even more increasing overlap between membership in the European Union and membership in NATO.\u00a0 And that too has the effect of creating even greater convergence between the United States and Europe than we\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 In fact, I think in my experience now, doing this for 30 years in one way or another, there is more convergence than there\u2019s ever been between the United States and Europe on the big challenges and questions of our time \u2013 dealing with the Russian aggression against Ukraine; meeting some of the challenges posed by China; looking at new things emerging from cyberspace, emerging technologies and their impact on our security and our interests \u2013 much greater convergence in how we approach each of these challenges than we\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0 And I think Finland\u2019s membership in NATO is just one more expression of that, but it really is across the board, and it\u2019s something that, from my perspective, puts us collectively in a much stronger position to deal effectively with all of these challenges.\nWe started with \u2013 this administration started with the basic proposition that American engagement, American leadership is important.\u00a0 It makes a difference because in its absence, some else may try to fill the gap and maybe not in ways that advance our interests and values, or no one does, and then you\u2019ve got a vacuum that tends to be filled by bad things before it\u2019s filled by good things.\u00a0 But the flip side of that coin, the importance of U.S. engagement, is that for virtually all of the challenges that we\u2019re dealing with, no single country, even the United States, can really effectively address them alone.\u00a0 We\u2019re much better off when we\u2019re doing it in partnership, in alliance with other countries, and where we adopt a similar approach.\nThat\u2019s been the story of these last two and a half years: the strengthening of our alliances; creating new partnerships to deal with some of these new challenges, fit for particular purposes; and, fundamentally, a much greater convergence than there\u2019s ever been \u2013 between the United States and Europe, between the United States and Asia, Asia and Europe \u2013 on what we need to do to effectively deal with these challenges.\u00a0 And this ministerial just confirms that trend, confirms that convergence.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken Remarks Before U.S.-EU Energy Council Meeting\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "European Council Building", "location": " Brussels, Belgium ", "date": "April 4, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0High Representative Borrell, Josep, thank you. Thank you for bringing us together today and for continuing an ongoing discussion, an ongoing action that we\u2019ve had with the United States and the European Union on an issue that\u2019s critical in the lives of all of our fellow citizens. I\u2019m very much looking forward to pursuing the discussion we actually began earlier this morning. It\u2019s great to be joined, Tobias, by you, Commissioner Simson, our Deputy Secretary of Energy Dave Turk. Very good to be with everyone this morning.\nWhen this council met on February 7th, 2022, Russia was on the verge of invading Ukraine. Europe was on the verge of an energy crisis. President Putin bet that his threat of stopping gas supplies would deter Europe and the world from standing up to his aggression against Ukraine. He was wrong.\nHe then doubled down \u2013 stopping natural gas supplies to many European countries, dramatically reducing flows to others, forcing record-high prices on millions in Europe and around the world. He sought to wipe out Ukraine\u2019s critical energy infrastructure \u2013 damaging or destroying 50 percent of Ukraine\u2019s grid, leaving millions without reliable power and heat.\nAnd again \u2013 he failed. Ukraine stands \u2013 and stands strong. Europe stands \u2013 and stands strong. The world is reducing its dependence on Russian energy, accelerating the transition to the green economy.\nThis is possible, in no small part, because of the partnership between the United States and the European Union.\nThe U.S.-EU Energy Council has worked as never before to help make Europe more energy secure. The United States has more than doubled our supply of natural gas to the continent \u2013 exporting 56 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas last year. Because of these and other efforts, Russia\u2019s natural gas only accounted for about 16 percent of the EU\u2019s natural gas imports by the end of 2022 \u2013 compared to 37 percent in March of 2022. And as I mentioned, our supplies went up more than twofold \u2013 over 140 percent increase between 2021 and 2022.\nThe EU\u2019s leadership has been vital in this shift \u2013 for example, with its Save the Gas for a Safe Winter program, through which citizens voluntarily lowered their electricity use and used more energy efficient appliances. These and other efforts contributed to a 19 percent reduction in natural gas demand between August of 2022 and January of 2023.\nWe accelerated, as I mentioned, the clean energy transition. The U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security is helping our governments and private sector partners share information to boost energy efficiency and diversify supply, like deploying more heat pumps and smart thermostats.\nHere, too, the European Union has shown remarkable leadership, increasing its goal of energy from renewables from 40 percent to 45 percent by 2030. EU countries added roughly 50 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity last year \u2013 which together generated more electricity than natural gas in 2022.\nLast year, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in American history, and we\u2019re heartened that Europe too is working on ambitious clean energy incentives. Through the Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue, which President Biden and President von der Leyen launched last month, we are working together to make sure that these efforts are mutually reenforcing, so that our incentives create a positive feedback loop of innovation, investment for energy transition, jobs for our people.\nWe also come together to support Ukraine\u2019s energy needs. Together, the EU, the U.S., and our G7+ partners have delivered more than 4,000 power generators, 1,000 transformers, and more than 5 million pieces of equipment, like circuit breakers and cables, to help repair and replace the country\u2019s battered energy grid.\nToday, we\u2019ll talk about ways to continue rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. We\u2019ll also talk about our shared work to deploy new technologies like clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, among other efforts, to advance the energy transition across Europe and the United States.\nThese collective efforts are directly benefiting people on both sides of the Atlantic through more affordable, more reliable energy, good-paying jobs, and a safer, more sustainable future.\nToday\u2019s discussions will bring us one step closer to that future, and like everyone, I\u2019m eager to get the conversation started. So again, Josep, thanks so much for having us here today, and I look forward to our discussions.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-eu-high-representative-for-foreign-affairs-and-security-policy-josep-borrell-remarks-to-the-press/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

morning.\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0I\u2019m very happy to welcome you, Secretary Blinken, in Brussels.\u00a0We just had a very good bilateral meeting marking our great transatlantic cooperation.\u00a0Now we will co-chair the EU-U.S. Energy Council, and later we will see each other also at the NATO Ministerial.\nAllow me some words about our bilateral discussion.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, we start discussing and talking about the Russian war in Ukraine, the situation in Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, and the Middle East peace process.\nIt\u2019s more than one year ago that Putin start destroying Ukraine, and he seems determined to continue with his brutal bloodshed and destruction, and he still escalates further despite not achieving anything.\u00a0\u00a0His newest nuclear gamble \u2013 with nuclear weapons moved to Belarus \u2013 constitutes a new escalation and poses a direct threat to European security.\u00a0\u00a0And this comes, ironically, after Chinese President Xi visited Moscow and mentioned the need for peace and they agreed on the need to not deploy nuclear arms abroad.\u00a0\u00a0Some days later, Russia deployed tactical weapons \u2013 nuclear tactical weapons in Belarus.\nWe have been discussing with Secretary Blinken about the role of China on supporting Russia\u2019s blatant violations of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0\u00a0There is a clear expectation from a permanent member of the Security Council to stand up in defense of international rules-based order.\u00a0\u00a0And China has a moral duty to contribute to a fair peace.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot be siding with the aggressor.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot be militarily supporting the aggression.\nThis is our message to China, from today\u2019s meeting and from all the European Union\u2019s visits going to Beijing.\u00a0\u00a0Today, President von der Leyen will be in Beijing with French President Macron, Spanish Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez was there last week, and I will travel next week too.\u00a0\u00a0So, as you see, a lot of Europeans going to China.\nBut we have been clear with China that its position on Russia\u2019s atrocities and war crimes will determine the quality of our relations with Beijing.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, the European Union stands united and our transatlantic community remains also united.\u00a0\u00a0We are committed to continue supporting Ukraine in its self-defense, and we will maintain the collective pressure on Russia to stop the widespread violations of international law.\u00a0\u00a0We are doing everything we can militarily, politically, and providing financial support to ensure that Ukraine prevails.\nWe also talked about the Middle East, and we shared our concerns about the vicious cycle of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territories.\u00a0\u00a0The latest developments painfully demonstrate that the path towards a resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict is urgently needed.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciated the recent U.S. mediation efforts in Aqaba and Sharm el-Sheikh, and I also shared with you, Secretary Blinken, about my efforts together with partners in the Arab world to try to revive peace efforts by building on the Arab Peace Initiative and adding European peace contribution to it.\nWe also discussed about some topics in Africa.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, on Ethiopia, this was a major crisis, and now, fortunately, things start to move towards solving it.\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s one of the rare good news that we have in the world.\u00a0\u00a0And to sustain the current progress, it is important that the EU and U.S. continue working hand-in-hand.\u00a0\u00a0The message to both the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigrayans is to make them understand that we are watching the settling of the conflict and will only normalize our relations in a gradual way, step by step.\nOn Central African Republic, we exchanged views on the ongoing international efforts, including our own efforts, to help to stabilize the country so they did not have to rely on the Wagner mercenaries.\u00a0\u00a0You know that the Wagner mercenaries, this destructive group, has had a negative impact on each country where they are present, be in Central African Republic and others in the Sahelian area, contributing only to further destabilization and impacting negatively in the entire region.\nFinally, we are going to co-chair now the 10th EU-U.S. Energy Council, but this year is different from our previous meetings in Washington, and the past year has been marked by atrocities, war against Ukraine, and the unprecedented EU-U.S. coordination to support the country and to support our energy security in Europe.\u00a0\u00a0We, the European Union and its member-states, are the lead donors when it comes to energy assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0We have been able to get rid of the Russian dependency on gas, and we will discuss today about how to accelerate the green energy transition, reducing methane emissions, and launching a new global energy efficiency initiative.\u00a0\u00a0That also is a good news.\nThank you.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0And let me just start by thanking the High Representative, my friend Josep, for another very productive and timely meeting, building on the momentum that President Biden and European Commission President von der Leyen produced at the White House just last month.\nThis discussion today reinforced what has been evident to us for some time: U.S.-European Union relations have never been stronger or more important for advancing our shared interests.\nAfter more than a year of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, the stakes for our partnership could not be higher \u2013 for the transatlantic relationship; for Ukraine itself; indeed, for people around the world who are bearing many of the consequences of this aggression.\nThe United States and the EU continue to work in lockstep, together with a broad coalition of partners around the world, to ensure that Ukraine can defend itself, its people, its territory, the right to choose its own path.\nEuropean partners have spent about $13 billion in European \u2013 in military assistance thus far, on top of tens of billions more in economic and humanitarian assistance, extraordinary support for refugees who have come from Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0We very much appreciate the announcement from the EU that it will be providing an additional 2 billion in euros worth of ammunition through its European Peace Facility.\nTogether, we\u2019re freezing the assets of those fueling the Kremlin\u2019s aggression, deploying sweeping sanctions and export controls that are degrading Russia\u2019s capacity to wage war.\u00a0\u00a0The Kremlin\u2019s finances have been squeezed to devastating effect, forcing it to choose between pouring money into the war or providing for its own citizens.\u00a0\u00a0As one Russian billionaire starkly said of Russia\u2019s future: \u201cThere will be no money next year.\u201d\nThe United States and the European Union are further working together to defend the energy and food security of millions of people around the world who have been affected by President Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, to press for accountability for Russian atrocities, and to support meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve a just and durable peace.\nJosep and I also discussed the United States and Europe\u2019s unprecedented cooperation on energy security, and indeed, we\u2019ll take that up in more detail in a few minutes.\u00a0\u00a0We share a commitment to preventing a climate catastrophe, accelerating the global clean energy transition, building resilient, secure, and diversified supply chains for renewable energy \u2013 and doing it in a way that creates good-paying jobs and lowers costs for people on both sides of the Atlantic.\nRussia\u2019s weaponization of energy has underscored the urgency of that task \u2013 and an opportunity to accelerate our progress.\u00a0\u00a0And so, over the past year, the United States and Europe have thrown our energy security cooperation into even higher gear.\nIn 2022, the United States exported 56 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe: that is 40 percent of Europe\u2019s total imports; it\u2019s a 140 percent increase over our LNG exports to Europe the previous year.\u00a0\u00a0The European Union cut dependence on Russian gas from nearly 40 percent at the start of the war to about 15 percent by the end of 2022.\u00a0\u00a0That is extraordinary.\u00a0\u00a0When we convene the council in a few minutes, we will focus on how we can further reduce European dependence on Russian energy, and boost the Euro-Atlantic region\u2019s clean energy production.\nWe also spoke about our continued partnership on economic security.\u00a0\u00a0We have serious concerns about the challenges posed by economic coercion, by the weaponization of economic dependencies, and non-market policies and practices, including by the PRC, and we discussed ways to address these issues.\u00a0\u00a0Later this spring, we\u2019ll hold another meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, where these and other priorities will be on the agenda.\nAs Josep mentioned, we also did something of a tour of the world of challenging places and areas where our work together, our coordination, our cooperation can make a difference, from Ethiopia to the Central African Republic to the Middle East.\u00a0\u00a0And in all of these areas, the coordination between the United States and the European Union is as great and, indeed, I would say greater than it\u2019s ever been.\nFinally, running through our conversation was our focus on revitalizing our democracies and our democratic values \u2013 which bind us, and which brought hundreds of partners together just this week around the world and in Washington for the Summit for

is really a moment to just drop the mic and leave because \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 a few things I wanted to share with all of you, but I think the first and most important is this:\u00a0 Moments like this are important.\u00a0 We don\u2019t usually take the time, even half an hour, 45 minutes, to just press pause and reflect on something that we\u2019ve done, because there\u2019s just too much to do.\u00a0 And the inboxes are overflowing, and it\u2019s always move, move, move.\u00a0 But it is important to do that because when we\u2019re at our best, as each of you has been in this extraordinary chapter, it really is worth reflecting on.\u00a0 And I hope that it inspires, energizes, encourages each of us to keep going, to keep doing this, to keep with this calling that has drawn all of us together in this incredible enterprise.\nErin said something that is I think very powerful and it\u2019s that we get called upon to do lots of things in our careers here at State, other agencies.\u00a0 But there\u2019re not that many moments when you can really say and see directly that something you have done has actually changed someone\u2019s life, and changed it for the better.\u00a0 There\u2019s usually too many points of connection along the way to really see it and really feel it, but the experience that each of you has had \u2013 in this instance, I hope really makes that connection, makes it powerful, and is something that you\u2019ll take with you throughout your careers and throughout your lives no matter what you do going forward.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply the most powerful thing that we occasionally have an opportunity to do, and it really is worth reflecting on.\nTressa, my friend, my travel companion, colleague, this is the epitome of the person here who runs into the burning building every single time, no matter how challenging it is, and gets the job done.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen that again and again.\u00a0 I\u2019m so grateful once again to you for your incredible leadership in this instance.\nThe extraordinary team of volunteers \u2013 and that was a hugely important word, volunteers \u2013 that Mike shared with us.\u00a0 That just inspires me tremendously because, again, I\u2019ve seen it time and again in this department.\u00a0 When we\u2019ve had an urgency, when we\u2019ve had an emergency situation, when we\u2019ve had a daunting challenge, people have been raising their hands.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been standing up.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve been running \u2013 you\u2019ve been running \u2013 into the building, and that makes a huge difference.\u00a0 Your determination, your skill, your heart, which is also very apparent in the stories that we\u2019ve heard from Katherine, from Marta, from Josh, from Hannah, from Gail, from Michael \u2013 that truly is inspiring to me as well.\nAnd to everyone who is joining us today, including folks who are online, as well as everyone here in person, thank you for everything that you\u2019ve done; and thank you for sharing the stories.\u00a0 We know that for each of the six stories, seven stories that we just heard, there are hundreds more \u2013 from across the U.S. Government, from across NGOs \u2013 from people who stepped up to welcome the 222.\u00a0 And I hope that in some way, as well, we\u2019ll find a way to collect some of those stories and maybe share them with colleagues because \u2013 again, I think it\u2019s going to be incredibly inspiring to them.\nBut these doctors, these political leaders, these journalists, these priests, these others who all came together and found themselves together \u2013 as a result of your work \u2013 on that plane, they had one thing that connected them, one overriding aspiration, and that was to simply exercise their fundamental freedoms and to try to safeguard the freedom of their fellow citizens.\u00a0 Tragically, in Ortega\u2019s Nicaragua, that\u2019s a crime.\u00a0 It\u2019s why these activists were imprisoned for months and sometimes years; denied visits from their loved ones.\u00a0 Many were held in harsh conditions, little access to sunlight, to fresh air, writing materials, books.\u00a0 One prisoner recalled reading and re-reading the label on a tube of toothpaste.\nAnd as you\u2019ve heard, living with that constant fear that you could be pulled into another cell to be beaten up, to be tortured \u2013 the constant fear that you might even be executed.\u00a0 Living with that, every single day, is its own kind of horrific torture.\nBut it\u2019s precisely because of the power of their message, their actions, the alternative vision that they have for their own country and the way it should treat its own people \u2013 it\u2019s exactly why the regime stripped them of their citizenship soon after they came to the United States.\u00a0 That too speaks volumes.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also why we felt compelled to do what we could to bring them to safety. \u00a0And it\u2019s why the work that all of you did \u2013 and did together \u2013 was so important.\nNow, that work began, in large part, with our colleagues in Embassy Managua who negotiated with the Nicaraguan Government, creating a system to ensure that each of 222 prisoners was accounted for, and \u2013 when the moment finally came, during the early morning hours of February 9th \u2013 physically escorting them to the airplane and then to their freedom.\nKatherine talked about the \u2013 waiting for that final confirmation, and I know that\u2019s excruciating.\u00a0 And as this was all happening, and Brian and Erin and others were keeping me informed of what was going on, I have to admit, I wasn\u2019t so sure this was really going to come together.\u00a0 I had a funny feeling, oh, this is going to fall apart.\u00a0 It seems almost \u2013 almost too good to be true, but too good to be true because so much work actually goes into this.\u00a0 These things don\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 It takes the incredible effort that started in Managua to actually get it done.\nFrom there, more than 350 \u2013 more than 350 of our colleagues from the U.S. Government, as well as partners from the state of Virginia, NGOs \u2013 you all took over.\u00a0 You worked around the clock, you worked through the weekend, reuniting prisoners with their loved ones.\u00a0 You interpreted for them.\u00a0 You provided them with food, with clothing, with healthcare.\u00a0 You helped them through the jarring process of starting a new life far from their homes and their communities.\nAnd what I heard also in the stories that were told is I think you all responded in a powerfully human way, because I imagine as you\u2019re there with someone who has just had this absolute sea change in their life, you\u2019re thinking and feeling and understanding how totally jarring and disorienting that is \u2013 even in this incredibly positive way.\u00a0 And the humanity that you showed as fellow human beings in helping them navigate this particular passage \u2013 that in and of itself was hugely important.\nAnd indeed, it wasn\u2019t just what you did, it\u2019s how you did it: with care, with compassion, by asking each of our Nicaraguan friends how are you doing, are you okay, what do you need \u2013 probably a question they hadn\u2019t been asked in a long, long time.\u00a0 By arriving at the tarmac with American colleagues that they knew from the past, they were welcomed by familiar faces.\u00a0 And Marta, I know that must have had a powerful impact on them as well.\nAs one of the volunteers put it, \u201cThe whole operation was successful because we all cared too much to accept anything less.\u201d\nNow, because of this work, our Nicaraguan friends are beginning new lives across more than two dozen U.S. states, some now moving on to other countries as well.\u00a0 Some have already jumped back into activism \u2013 no surprise \u2013 rallying international support and pressure for a better future for their country at the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Summit for Democracy just this week.\u00a0 At the summit, we heard some of these voices.\u00a0 Others are starting the process of opening new businesses, continuing their studies, getting on with their lives that were so violently interrupted by the Nicaraguan regime.\nNow, in the months ahead, we have our NGO partners that will continue to support the recent arrivals\u2019 relocation.\u00a0 We have our embassy colleagues who will work to reunify family members in Nicaragua with their newly settled family members in the United States.\u00a0 So, this process goes forward.\u00a0 It carries on.\nAnd at the same time, for us, a government, we\u2019ll join our partners across the hemisphere and around the world to continue to push for a return to democracy and respect for human rights in Nicaragua, while also using all of the diplomatic and economic tools that we have to try to promote accountability for the widespread abuses from the regime.\nSo, in a very small period of time, in a very intense way, you gave us a reminder of who we are when we\u2019re at our best \u2013 which is not every day, but it was in the days that you were engaged in this mission: a country that stands with those on the side of freedom and human rights, and fights for our democratic values around the world.\u00a0 You\u2019ve demonstrated that with your service; you\u2019ve demonstrated that with your dedication.\nSo, I\u2019m so glad we just had a few moments together, again, to press the pause button, to reflect a little bit on what each of you has done, and to take that with you going forward because this career that all of you have been called to in a variety of ways, I know a lot of days can be frustrating.\u00a0 I know we pile on the work.\u00a0 The inbox gets higher, the resources seem to get \u2013 to shrink, and we\u2019re working on all of that.\u00a0 And I know there are days for each of us when we say, is it worth it?\u00a0 Maybe I should be doing something else.\nI hope and I believe strongly that this experience is a reminder of what an incredible pursuit this is, what an incredible responsibility we all have, but also what an incredible privilege it is to actually work for, represent your country, and try to make sure that the country that we love and share and the department that we love and share is actually operating at its best.\u00a0 In this instance it was because you were.\u00a0 And I just wanted to thank you on behalf of the President and as a fellow American.\u00a0 Thanks for exemplary work.\u00a0 Thanks for your service to our country.\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url":

more able to address the issues that matter most in the lives and livelihoods of their populations, whether it\u2019s protecting public health, advancing children\u2019s education, expanding economic opportunity.\nAnd we know that the pursuit of a stronger, freer, more democratic future is shared by people and governments from big and small countries, North and South, developed and developing.\nAs President Biden has said, democracy doesn\u2019t happen by accident.\u00a0 It requires constant effort, constant tending by each new generation \u2013 and by each of us.\u00a0 And indeed, we are at an inflection point when it comes to the future of democracy, where a defining question of this time is whether we are willing to do what it takes to make sure that democracies continue to deliver for their people, continue to thrive.\nThroughout this Year of Action, this group has answered that question with a resounding yes.\u00a0 Since the last Summit for Democracy, we have made \u2013 and we are delivering on \u2013 over 700 commitments that help us defend and strengthen democratic values and institutions.\nThese commitments include new laws and initiatives to combat corruption \u2013 like Ecuador\u2019s new National Anti-Corruption Strategy, the Dominican Republic\u2019s Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture, and Australia\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Commission Act.\nSteps to support a free and independent press \u2013 including the contributions of France, Slovakia, New Zealand, and the United States to initiatives that help independent news outlets become more financially stable and sustainable, and protect journalists, as well as the abolition of laws, as in Zambia, that could be used to silence government critics.\nGovernments have taken measures to bolster democratic institutions, including judicial reform in Albania and Angola; to encourage inclusive representation in government, particularly by women, members of the LGBTQI+ community, and other historically marginalized groups.\nAnd many have taken action to protect civic and human rights.\u00a0 The Democratic Republic of Congo passed landmark legislation to recognize indigenous peoples\u2019 land and cultural rights.\u00a0 Taiwan lifted barriers to prevent the recognition of transnational same-sex marriage.\u00a0 Nepal passed legislation to punish perpetrators of acid attacks and rape, to name just a few.\nThese national commitments are significant.\u00a0 They\u2019re making a difference, an actual difference, in the lives of millions of people around the world.\u00a0 And as we close this second Summit for Democracy, as we prepare for summits to come, we\u2019ll continue to help one another sustain, adapt, and build on our collective efforts.\nBecause President Biden believes deeply \u2013 as do I \u2013 that safeguarding our democracies is a collective effort, one that depends on our governments and on our people working together.\u00a0 Because all people, all nations, all sectors have contributions to make.\u00a0 And for sure, none of us has a monopoly on ideas, never mind good ideas.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why we tried to bring such a wide-ranging group of summit participants together to drive progress on shared priorities \u2013 from promoting youth engagement in politics, supporting an independent press, securing free and fair elections \u2013 and, as we discussed today, shaping the norms around the internet and emerging technologies.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why such a major focus of our work leading up to this summit, and in the months that will follow it, is on multilateral efforts \u2013 including Democracy Cohorts: innovative platforms that bring governments together with leading civil society and private sector groups.\nThis\u00a0shared fight against corruption is just one powerful example of why we need to work together across borders and with partners across our societies.\u00a0 And there has been \u2013 and I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019ve done it \u2013 real focus on combating corruption through our Summit for Democracy process.\nWe know that corruption is a transnational scourge.\u00a0 It discourages investment.\u00a0 It stifles competition.\u00a0 It deepens inequities.\u00a0 And maybe worst of all, it erodes public trust in government and institutions.\nEvery country, unfortunately, has experience in fighting corruption \u2013 experience that we need to be sharing with one another.\u00a0 Over the last 15 months, the United States, together with the Brookings Institution and the Open Government Partnership \u2013 which includes 76 countries, 106 local governments, representing more than 2 billion people, and thousands of civil society organizations \u2013 we\u2019ve been leading a new Financial Transparency and Integrity Democracy Cohort to do just that, to come together, to bring our experiences, our knowledge, and our efforts together in combating corruption.\nBringing these diverse perspectives together, the Cohort has worked to study the problem across regions.\u00a0 And it\u2019s crafting actual solutions based on lessons learned, based on best practices from member countries.\u00a0 Guidelines put together by the Cohort will help prevent bad actors from shielding illicit activity behind shell companies, stopping corrupt government officials and their cronies from enriching themselves, making sure that gatekeepers of the financial system \u2013 lawyers, accountants, investment managers \u2013 don\u2019t enable money laundering.\nThis work \u2013 this summit \u2013 is about looking inward at our democracies: recognizing our challenges, striving to do better by our people.\nAnd in a very profound way, I believe that\u2019s what distinguishes democracies: our willingness to confront these challenges \u2013 out in the open, transparently; to acknowledge our shortcomings \u2013 not to sweep them under the rug, not to pretend they don\u2019t exist.\u00a0 That is one of our greatest strengths.\u00a0 It\u2019s what we mean in the United States when we commit to the enduring task of forming a more perfect union.\nWe don\u2019t believe that we hold all the solutions \u2013 far from it.\u00a0 But we do know that when we join together with our fellow democracies, we make one another stronger, more resilient, more responsive to our citizens, and better able to do what we\u2019re here to do, which is to deliver for them \u2013 and, I hope, for the world.\nSo to each of you who are still here hanging in there at the end of the day, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your participation.\u00a0 Thank you for your engagement \u2013 but not just today, every single day \u2013 in doing this work.\u00a0 It matters.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a difference, and I can think of no recent time in history when it\u2019s been more vital.\u00a0 So thanks to everyone.\u00a0 Have a great evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-session-on-advancing-democracy-and-internet-freedom-in-a-digital-age-summit-for-democracy/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken.\u00a0 To build a more rights-respecting future, it\u2019s clear that democracies need to define an affirmative vision for how technology can promote democracy.\u00a0 Our first session, Advancing Democracy and Internet Freedom in a Digital Age, will help us think through how we might craft a world in which technology and democracy are mutually reinforcing.\nWe\u2019re joined today by three speakers; let me introduce them now.\u00a0 Jorge Arg\u00fcello is ambassador of Argentina to the United States.\u00a0 Nighat Dad \u2013 (applause) \u2013 Nighat Dad is executive director of Digital Rights Foundation.\u00a0 And Funke Opeke is CEO and founder of Main One.\u00a0 And I will now give the floor \u2013 (applause) \u2013 back to our moderator for this session, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Jeanne.\u00a0 So this is what I really like, because I actually get to ask the questions for once.\u00a0 And we have a great group of colleagues to hear from, to listen to, and to learn from.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really thrilled to be able to join each of you today and to, I think, focus on a few things.\u00a0 I think we all recognize that democracies have to make an affirmative case for how societies can leverage technology to actually advance, to make progress, and, as we were talking about just few minutes ago, to actually try to deliver positive results for our people.\u00a0 And I think we also recognize that the same human rights that we are so engaged in defending offline have to be also respected online, and this is one of the big challenges of our time.\u00a0 We have to have an internet, we have to have a digital ecosystem that respects and protects those rights, and each of you in different ways is engaged in that.\nSo a few things that I wanted to try to put on the table and invite our colleagues to talk about.\u00a0 First of all, my friend Ambassador Arg\u00fcello \u2013 Argentina is a member of the Freedom Online Coalition.\u00a0 We\u2019re very proud to chair this effort, and many in this room are members.\u00a0 As you\u2019re looking at it from Argentina\u2019s perspective, tell us a little bit about how you see Argentina working to advance internet freedom and to protect the space that we all have to share.\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0 Perfect.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary, Antony.\u00a0 Good morning to everyone here.\u00a0 First and foremost, I would like to stress that our country\u2019s highly honored to be part of this important event, as well as to be part of the second Summit for Democracy and endorse its final declaration.\u00a0 As you all know \u2013 and you probably know or you may know \u2013 our President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, the president of Argentina, was in Washington, D.C., yesterday in order to have a bilateral meeting with President Biden, which was held yesterday at the White House.\u00a0 Our Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero was part of the presidential delegation.\u00a0 He received the invitation to participate in this panel as a speaker.\u00a0 Unfortunately, he was called away for last-minute business and he is now in Buenos Aires for what he asked me to convey: his deepest apologies to you all.\nBut let me now turn to the topic that gathers us today.\u00a0 Information and communication technologies are in process of constant progress and have become fundamental tools that improve productivity for development, both economically and socially, fostering greater participation of societies and allowing better access to knowledge while promoting the strengthening of education in our countries.\u00a0 Likewise, and from the point of view of government interaction with citizens within the framework of truly democratic societies, these technologies have enhanced the capacity to provide quality, agile services with greater transparency, open communications, and greater participation.\u00a0 In this sense, increasing access to these technologies while strengthening connectivity and achieving the universalization of ICT services is a clear priority that allows us to avoid digital exclusion and reduce inequality \u2013 and reduce inequality.\nTherefore, aspiring to a knowledge society cannot be dissociated from the achievement of the highest possible levels of social inclusion.\u00a0 The achievement of one will not be fair or democratic if it is not built on the basis of the other.\u00a0 The adoption and implementation of technologies are still a challenge for many countries because, while some technologies make leaps of great magnitudes, certain technologies, groups, industries, sectors, workers go at a different pace and require a different policy approach.\u00a0 We must look closely at the different divides \u2013 gender, rural, industrial systems, security systems \u2013 and analyze together, with the private sector and civil society, which are the best policies to address those gaps.\nIn Argentina, ARSAT, the state-owned telecommunications company which operates the federal fiber optic network, plays a key role in connecting the unconnected, reaching the demand of small- and medium-sized companies, cooperatives, and rural areas.\u00a0 ARSAT, the company, was present some weeks ago here in D.C. for the SATELLITE Conference\u00a0and had many meetings with U.S. Government and companies to enhance cooperation in telecommunication and data centers.\u00a0 Also, it is important to highlight that in Argentina, fundamental human rights are protected by a solid legal framework guaranteed by our national constitution and in international treaties that have a constitutional hierarchy.\u00a0 The exercise of the rights of freedom of expression and association and the right to privacy is protected and guaranteed in the virtual and real world by the three branches of government.\nBearing this in mind, I would like to share with you some important milestones of our laws and policies regarding the ICTs.\nArgentina has a law which states that \u2013 and I\u2019m going to read \u2013 the search, reception, and dissemination of information and ideas of all kinds through the internet service is considered to be included within the constitutional guarantee that protects freedom of expression.\u00a0 Another law guarantees the complete neutrality of networks in all telecommunications services and ICT developments.\nNow, due to the boost we provide to the ICT sector, knowledge-based services represent the fourth \u2013 the fourth largest export complex in Argentina, and the development of Argentine technology companies with high levels of competitiveness is on the rise.\u00a0 We have also adopted a new knowledge economy law which broadens and deepens incentives into the sector.\u00a0 Likewise, under the firm conviction that certain vulnerable groups deserve special protection, in 2020 we sanctioned a law which creates a national program for the prevention and awareness of grooming or cyber bullying against children and adolescents, a crime that was also incorporated to our national criminal code.\nOn the other hand, regarding hate speech and its dissemination, it is worth mentioning that such crime is contemplated.\u00a0 As an open, multicultural, and multireligious society, in Argentina we strongly believe in our duty to work for an internet free of hate speech.\u00a0 Our rejection of online terrorism is clear and resounding.\u00a0 Argentina adhered to the Christchurch Call in September 2019.\u00a0 The call focuses on the delicate and sensitive balance between security considerations and freedom of expression and data privacy.\u00a0 Argentina has participated in many areas regarding the right of freedom of expression in digital context.\u00a0 We have adhered to a number of international instances, such as the Information and Democracy Forum or the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.\u00a0 Likewise, since June 2016, Argentina has been a member of the Freedom Online Coalition, and we are very proud to work in that sense.\nIn that regard, we wish the U.S. every success in its new chairmanship and reiterate our willingness to work together constructively.\u00a0 The Argentine Republic plays an active role in international and regional forums on issues related to human rights in the digital environment.\nFinally, Antony, and before giving back the floor to you, I would like to reaffirm our country\u2019s deep commitment to the development of information and communication technologies as fundamental tools for the empowerment of our peoples, with free access, without exclusion, which allows a true strengthening of societies, helping education and culture and access to information, as well as a better economic development.\u00a0 We \u2013 government along with the private sector along with the civil society \u2013 must tirelessly work together to make this happen.\nThank you very much, Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Ambassador, thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you for sharing that with all of us.\nLet\u2019s talk a little bit about digital inclusion.\u00a0 So, Ms. Dad, you are working to do exactly that: to try to make sure that women and girls, other marginalized communities are able to access technology and use it to thrive.\u00a0 So what I want to focus on here is your own experience through civil society in advancing rights and inclusion in the digital ecosystem.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Firstly, it\u2019s a pleasure to share this panel with esteemed panelists.\u00a0 As a civil society in past few years, we have had a front-row seat in seeing the role of digital technologies and internet in both advancing democracies and undermining institutions integral to a free democratic space.\u00a0 And holding these two realities together is important as we truly want to present a holistic picture of the role that technologies play in our democracies.\nThese two binaries also come as no surprise to me, having worked with young women and girls in Pakistan regarding their access to technologies and internet, which can be both as a liberating space in their lives but also abuse and violence not only online but offline as well.\u00a0 So it\u2019s really important that when we all are talking about digital rights, we center the experiences of marginalized groups \u2013 young women and girls, female journalists, women human rights defenders, activists \u2013 when we talk about democracy in the digital age, because\u00a0these experiences have a lot to teach us.\u00a0 And when it comes to technologies and digital spaces, there are two very main stakeholders who are dominating this space.\u00a0 One is governments around the world and the second is tech companies, platforms.\nOn one hand we have governments scrambling to acquire technologies and pass laws that would allow them to control the internet and dominate the pervasive narratives in these spaces.\u00a0 The loss of control over the information we consume and who gets to speak has been troubling for governments with long histories of interrupted and weak democratic rule.\u00a0 Even in countries where rule of law is strong, we \u2013 what we have seen is that they also struggle to come up with really good regulations, the regulations that respect international human rights framework.\nAnd on the other hand, we have powerful platforms dominating this space with so much space, profit margins, power to control content and our data, and often we have seen that \u2013 in my experience, the decade-long work, that we have seen that they are mostly unaccountable towards their \u2013 towards the governments but also mainly towards the users who should be the center of the conversation in these spaces.\nAnd this sort of throws up fundamental question about democracy:\u00a0 Do we want powerful tech companies to decide our democratic future?\u00a0 And while we are looking into these questions about governments and powerful companies, I think it\u2019s important to talk about solutions also, and there is this one solution which is self-regulatory model.\u00a0 It\u2019s an independent \u2013 Meta\u2019s Oversight Board that the company came up with a solution to hold itself accountable.\nBut the question is:\u00a0 Are they holding themself accountable independently and transparently?\u00a0 And the answer is that just this model that came up three years ago, where the people who are actually making decisions around content moderation of this platform are from diverse background.\u00a0 I sit on the board.\u00a0 I am from global majority.\u00a0 English is not my first language.\u00a0 I bring experiences of the marginalized groups not only from Pakistan but South Asia.\u00a0 But then telling companies sitting on this board that the decision that you are making are not truly democratic, are not following international human rights framework, and then come up with solution to tell them what they can do in these situations.\u00a0 And how we are making ourselves transparent is that \u2013 actually releasing our reports, the progress that we have made, the progress that the company has made so far.\u00a0 So I think these are the regulatory models I feel are so important to hold these companies accountable.\nAnd if I talk about my own personal experience as Digital Rights Foundation head in Pakistan, I feel that the global majority is actually at the end of \u2013 at the receiving end the decisions that the Global North, not only governments but the tech platforms, make.\u00a0 And there is very little say of the users, especially from Global South or global majority.\u00a0 There are such initiatives, local initiatives \u2013 if you look around, there are so many civil society organizations around the world who have been working on digital rights for such a long time.\u00a0 They have come up with local solutions.\u00a0 They have been part of international debates.\u00a0 But I think \u2013 and we\u2019ll speak about this later in the panel conversation as well \u2013 that these local solutions need to be taken into account in the global conversations.\u00a0 We cannot really come up with a top-down approach.\u00a0 I think we really need to see what people are locally doing, how they are contextualizing this issue, how they are holding their governments accountable who are coming up with bad regulations and laws while preserving speech in the online space, at the same time holding people in the Global North accountable, that what they are deciding can set bad precedents for the authoritarian regimes as well.\nThank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I think particularly the last point that you were making about the need to look to local solutions, to look to local ideas, to do this from the bottom up and the middle out not just the top down, is going to be vital to success and ultimately to having sustainable ways of doing things, because if people are not bought in, they will opt out one way or the other.\u00a0 So appreciate that very much.\nAccessibility.\u00a0 Ms. Opeke, tell us about how you are looking at this in the work that you\u2019re doing in Africa, and particularly operationalizing accessibility.\u00a0 We talked about this a little bit earlier, but we always run the risk with new technologies of having totally bifurcated worlds and those who have access to them, those who don\u2019t.\u00a0 And this is a vital part of your mission.\u00a0 Tell us how you\u2019re seeing it.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, and truly is an honor to be part of this distinguished panel.\u00a0 As you mentioned, Main One, which is a company that I run, was founded in 2008 to address the digital divide in Africa.\u00a0 It was informed \u2013 the vision was informed at that time with the reality that internet access was only a 10 percent penetration rate when the rest of the world was at 50 percent.\u00a0 Today we have 70 percent global internet penetration, but most of the African continent is at 50 percent or below.\nAnd so we set out to try to close that gap with a focus on West Africa.\u00a0 Now, how were we able to do that?\u00a0 Nigeria, which is the company that \u2013 country that I am from, had returned to democratic rule in 1999, and coming in 2001 on the heels of that was a liberalization of the telecommunications sector, which enabled private sector companies to deploy telecoms infrastructure for the first time to deliver to\u00a0citizens.\u00a0 And so coming on the heels of that, we were able to obtain licenses in Nigeria and Ghana, the first private licenses for open access submarine cables to connect West Africa to the rest of the world through Europe.\u00a0 Doing that, building that 7,000 kilometer cable, which initially served two countries in West Africa but is delivering a mix of services to 11 countries today, is part of what has enabled that growth in access to 50 percent.\nSo what really are the building blocks on which we did that, first, was the liberalization.\u00a0 And it is worth noting that not all African countries today have liberalized their telecommunications laws, which says in the \u2013 that the shortage of resources and the large infrastructure deficits that a lot of these countries face, they\u2019re not able to accelerate digital transformation of the economies because they\u2019re not enabling private capital to come in.\u00a0 The next step of our journey, of course, was private capital.\u00a0 And the African Development Bank was a key anchor, so having the kind of patient, more risk, higher-risk appetite capital to come into this market; obviously, skills; and then access to technology, where we had an American company with a depth of experience and capacity deploy the network for us.\nSo what do we see today is that the work is not done yet.\u00a0 And of course, as you go further down the pyramid and try to enable access and more inclusion, it does get more challenging. The word is\u2026what we have to do in these economics is to truly grow the market. \u00a0Because the value chain, in terms of realizing the return from investment in digital infrastructure, is simply not as mature as what you have in the advanced economies. \u00a0So there is a lot of partnering. \u00a0There is a need for patient capital to consider the affordability and also consider the provision of other elements in the value chain.\u00a0 Which is places like Lagos, Nigeria or Cape Town, South Africa or Nairobi, Kenya on the African continent your starting to see today.\u00a0 But there\u2019s still a lot more to be done.\nThe obvious returns are, there are successful companies of scale delivering the services on the African continent, so it proves that it can be done; and that delivering such infrastructure is also providing dividends for democracy, because as you have greater shared prosperity, job creation, financial inclusion, access to services, people are able to drive better outcomes, they\u2019re able to reduce unemployment rates for more people to work.\nAfrica, when you think of it, with 50 percent internet penetration of a population of 1.4 billion, that\u2019s about 700 million people.\u00a0 The average age on the continent is 19, who do not have access and constitute the workforce of tomorrow.\u00a0 So getting the access to those who have currently been excluded so they can form part of this fabric we are building is really critical.\u00a0 And that\u2019s \u2013 building the partnership to enable that is, I think, going to be critical to get there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I really want to underscore the point that you made about this not being a favor that one group of countries may be doing for another.\u00a0 It\u2019s profoundly in everyone\u2019s interests.\u00a0 And in the case of Africa, as you point out, the next 20 years we\u2019ll have one in four people on this planet being from and of Africa, so bridging these divides is going to be hugely important.\nI want to come back to one thing that you mentioned, then maybe we can go a little deeper on some of the things that people have already touched on.\u00a0 You mentioned the importance of private capital.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And of course, that\u2019s exactly right.\u00a0 And most of our governments, most of our systems, can\u2019t simply dedicate and direct state resources to some of these challenges.\u00a0 What we can do, what our comparative advantage is, is in catalyzing and leveraging private sector investment.\nBased on this experience, though, what do you see \u2013 and you\u2019ve touched on it a little bit \u2013 as some of the impediments to that?\u00a0 And then, are there any thoughts that you have about how that can be facilitated?\u00a0 You mentioned the need to actually make markets.\u00a0 I\u2019m hopeful, for example, that as the free trade area in Africa actually emerges and we get beyond this abnormal situation where African countries trade more with countries outside of Africa than they do with themselves, that will also help create markets that attract investment in an easier way.\u00a0 But are there other things that come to mind based on your experience?\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, understood about governments not being able to write checks, open checks to drive private infrastructure investment in developing countries.\u00a0 However, for the funds that have been identified, I believe helping to create the frameworks, a lot of these lesser developed economies do not have strong institutions.\u00a0 One of the areas where progress can be made and impacts can be driven is helping to strengthen the frameworks, helping to strengthen the work of institutions that are set up to establish and guide those examples.\u00a0 And I really think that\u2019s where the most impact can be made.\nAs you mentioned also with the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, implementation has not kept pace with expectations that were set a few years ago when the free trades agreement went into effect.\u00a0 So what can be done and based on the U.S. experience in setting up and working with such agreements to actually facilitate implementation and impact?\u00a0 I believe that\u2019s probably where the most impact can be had for the kind of checks that can be written by the U.S. Government.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 So we have an expression:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m from the federal government;\u00a0 I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I\u2019m from the federal government; I\u2019m here to help.\nFrom the perspective of civil society, what can governments be doing better, more effectively, to make sure that we\u2019re advancing inclusion, that we\u2019re making sure that in particularly underserved people, community groups, have the benefit of accessibility and also are not finding themselves in the situation where these tools and this technology is actually being used against them?\nMS DAD:\u00a0\u00a0I think for that, there has been a lot of conversation around including civil society in these conversations.\u00a0 I think, first and foremost, is we need to really see who are the people from civil society in these conversations.\u00a0 Are these only people from Western democracy and Global North?\u00a0 And if civil society from global majority is not part of this conversation, then why not?\u00a0 And I think that leads us to the conversation where civil society is being \u2013 the civic space has been eroded very slowly, very gradually, and no one even felt that.\u00a0 And I think what Western democracies who are setting good precedents, they can also hold those governments accountable, that why this is happening, why these civil \u2013 civil society cannot participate in these conversations if they are not truly liberated.\nAnd I think the second point is are they \u2013 do they have resources to do that?\u00a0 I think empowering them, not only making them included in these conversations but also do they have money to do that.\u00a0 And I think while I\u2019m saying these resources, I have seen people doing a lot of labor in these countries for \u2013 labor towards these companies, telling them what are the gaps that they have so that they can make these online spaces safer for their own communities, and telling government that the laws that they are making are problematic.\u00a0 So it\u2019s free labor; it\u2019s a thankless job.\u00a0 And I think what governments like U.S. can do is actually help empowering civil society, not only in their own jurisdiction but around the world, and hold other governments accountable what exactly they are doing to keep these space safer and freer for civil society.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAmbassador, any thoughts from the perspective of your country, your government, both on these questions of inclusion and these questions of accessibility?\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 Well, first of all, I would like to stress the importance of the battle we are facing, and allow me to congratulate you for calling for this gathering.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s very important to share the floor with my Nigerian and Pakistani friend.\u00a0 They do a very important work in their countries from the civil society.\u00a0 And something \u2013 what we must having clear is that they there must be an alliance between the government, the civil society, and the private sector.\u00a0 Otherwise we \u2013 it will not fly.\u00a0 And what we are trying to do is precisely \u2013 is to have it flying.\nIn the case of our country, we are working with different international initiatives.\u00a0 I wrote here the information for Democracy Forum \u2013 we have been working together in that sense \u2013 the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and the Freedom for \u2013 Online Coalition.\u00a0 These are our main activities we develop in the international field.\u00a0 And I would like to stress something that Funke just said:\u00a0 The work is not done yet.\u00a0 The battle is starting.\u00a0 Our democracy \u2013 the national democracy, the international democracy, the freedom is at stake.\u00a0 So we must take \u2013 be part of this discussion.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m cognizant of time \u2013 I want to make sure that we get some other people in on this conversation.\u00a0 So we have a number of \u2013 probably 600 experts in this audience today, but we can\u2019t hear from everyone.\u00a0 But there are a few people I\u2019d like to call on just to get perspectives and also any questions that you have for our wonderful panelists.\nSo Amalia Toledo from the Wikimedia Foundation, who\u2019s working on technology\u2019s impacts on human rights.\u00a0 Amalia, are you here?\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you to the panel.\u00a0 My question is (inaudible) digitalization happening across government \u2013 how can they ensure that tech companies are respecting the human rights of individuals?\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 If I may, I think that\u2019s a very important question because \u2013 and it needs a clear answer.\u00a0 There is only one way to guarantee that, and it\u2019s the development of a strong legal framework.\u00a0 So I want to reiterate there is an alliance to be \u2013 to put on the table between the government, the civil society, and the private sector.\u00a0 Otherwise, we won\u2019t be able to protect the right of freedom of expression, both, as you said, Antony, online and offline.\u00a0 So I think that that\u2019s our main target to play.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Other thoughts on this?\nMS DAD:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, I mean, yes, governments are powerful, and they are already bringing lot of regulations and laws to hold companies accountable.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s important that we look into other mechanisms where these platforms find themselves accountable as well.\u00a0 And one initiative I have already mentioned, like independent oversight body, which is truly independent, and which is also transparent.\nBut I would also like to be very cautious towards giving an only solution, like regulatory framework and laws, because it really doesn\u2019t work for everyone around the world.\u00a0 There are regulations and laws that we have seen that were made in the name of protecting young women and girls in the online space, cyber harassment, abuse, hate speech, disinformation, but those laws have been weaponized against the very same people.\u00a0 So I think we really need to see how those laws are being made, whether the governments are following international human rights framework, whether civil society is part of those conversations while these laws are being drafted and then implemented, and whether the judges are actually trained to develop good jurisprudence.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNext from our audience, Frane Maroevi\u0107 from the International Press Institute, who\u2019s working on advancing press freedoms around the world.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, excellencies and ladies and gentlemen.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be interested, as digitalization is happening across governments and different departments are working, how can\u00a0you ensure that it\u2019s all coordinated around the human rights agenda, that the human rights is at the focus of the work of each government department as they work on digitalization and promoting media freedom?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good question.\u00a0 Anyone want to jump in?\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Well, maybe that\u2019s for you, Secretary.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I was afraid you were going to say that.\u00a0 No, it\u2019s a hugely important question, and it goes to the work that we\u2019re trying to do to make sure that questions, obligations, responsibilities when it comes to human rights are infused in pretty much everything we do, including in places in our own department that might not naturally take that perspective into account when they\u2019re trying to formulate policy or advance policy.\nSo one of the challenges, I think, for particularly our organizations in government is to make sure that we\u2019re working horizontally as much as possible, because virtually everything we\u2019re talking about today connects to the equities of seven, eight, 10, 12 different offices in my own department, and it\u2019s the same, I\u2019m sure, for the ambassador and other colleagues in government.\nSo one of the things that we\u2019ve made a real effort to do is to make sure that in each of our bureaus, both from a geographic perspective but also a functional perspective \u2013 the human rights perspective and dimension is included in the deliberations.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019ve tried to bring together in the State Department, under one roof, all of these questions, to include the human rights dimension of technology in a new bureau that we stood up for Cyberspace and Digital Policy as well as for emerging technologies.\nSo partly this is a question of making sure that the direction, the responsibility to do that is clearly communicated, but it\u2019s also about setting up the mechanisms within government to make sure that that voice, that perspective is being included \u2013 and we\u2019ve tried to organize ourselves to do that.\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve had a similar experience.\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 Yes, I do.\u00a0 I agree with what you have said.\u00a0 I would add that our target, what we are pursuing when we talk about human rights, is a key word.\u00a0 We are trying to guarantee access.\u00a0 We are \u2013 for everybody, for everyone all over the world.\u00a0 We are trying to guarantee a true democratization of knowledge.\u00a0 That\u2019s human rights.\nAnd allow me to celebrate a decision made by the Biden administration.\u00a0 Argentina has a very firm stand in the human rights field, probably because of our own terrible experience during the last dictatorships in the \u201870s, but I said the international community is still celebrating the return of the U.S. to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations.\u00a0 We are working together.\u00a0 We are coordinating every action, not only between us but with all the members of the committee \u2013 the commission.\u00a0 But I think that is very important, and that will allow us to contribute to guarantee that everybody in \u2013 can engage in this public discussion.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0 I would like to speak from the standpoint of weaker democracies who \u2013 which governments are not necessarily inclined to protect human rights.\u00a0 And in such economies or such countries, what we\u2019re finding is access in and of itself starts providing citizens with a voice and a means of easier, faster information dissemination to call attention to the issues and actually push for their rights to be protected.\u00a0 So taking another \u2013 yes, there are governments that are working actively to promote human rights, but there are also governments who want to silence those dissenting voices, and the more access is enabled and is free and affordable, the more we\u2019re able to have those dissenting voices speak up.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s a very powerful point.\u00a0 I\u2019ll give you one other example, Frane, because you\u2019re working on press freedom every single day.\u00a0 One of the things we see from autocratic governance is an effort basically to use lawfare to silence journalists who are just doing their jobs.\u00a0 At this very summit a year ago, one of the initiatives that came out of it was standing up a fund to \u2013 that journalists, media enterprises, particularly small, independent media that usually doesn\u2019t have the resources \u2013 a fund that they can tap into if they\u2019re on the receiving end of bogus legal proceedings that are trying in effect to drive them out of business.\u00a0 That\u2019s just one initiative among many as we look at what is being done and how technology is being used or misused to try to silence voices, whether it\u2019s from media or from civil society or human rights defenders.\u00a0 We\u2019re also looking at what tools can we provide to help them more effectively defend themselves, and that\u2019s just one example.\nJohn Morris from the Internet Society, working on expanding internet access and freedom.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 At the Internet Society, we believe that the internet, the globally \u2013 the open, globally connected, secure, and trustworthy internet is a tremendous enabler of democracy, but increasingly decisions in government \u2013 by governments in democratic countries and non-democratic countries are threatening the internet\u2019s operations and its global nature.\u00a0 So my question is:\u00a0 How can we ensure that governments proactively assess the potential harmful impact on the internet from their policy proposals so that we don\u2019t inadvertently undermine both global speech, global internet access, and democracy worldwide?\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 I think we should stress the importance of the civil society.\u00a0 You have invited three of us; two of them come from the civil society, NGOs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s very important, because it\u2019s true that not every government works in this direction.\u00a0 Some governments do exactly the contrary.\u00a0 So the multilateral fora, the civil \u2013 the organizations from the civil society are called to play a key role in this issue.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, I couldn\u2019t agree more with that.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s imperative on us in government in particular to make sure that we have all of the different stakeholders in on the takeoff, not just on the landing, precisely because we need to make sure that we\u2019re factoring in these different perspectives, precisely because there are inevitably \u2013 to your point \u2013 second- and third-order consequences that we may not see because we\u2019re coming at it from one perspective that we need to be able to identify upfront before it\u2019s too late, and we actually have an effect that is not the one that we wanted to have.\nAnd it goes to a point I was making earlier when I was speaking, and I\u2019ve found this over 30 years in government, particularly when it comes to technology.\u00a0 The pace with which it\u2019s moving is so fast and the relative lack of expertise in government is such that we\u2019re constantly playing\u00a0catch-up, and just understanding \u2013 never mind trying to figure out what is the appropriate rule, norm, regulation that actually makes sense, doesn\u2019t have second- and third-order consequences that we don\u2019t like, that somehow balances the different equities that are in play.\nI think one of the answers to this for me, besides making sure that the stakeholders are at the table from the takeoff, is actually to make sure that in government itself we have more of this expertise and that it\u2019s not only, as important as that is, so-called outside stakeholders that are involved, but within our own institutions we have people who have come up in these disciplines, who bring that perspective to bear, and can make a huge difference in making \u2013 helping us to make policy.\nOne of the things that struck me some years ago in government was so much of what we do actually has a technological or innovative solution as part, at least, of the answer, what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But so many of us again are not coming up in these disciplines, and we need technologists, innovators, civil society, and others in the room, sometimes even just to tell us whether we need technologists, innovators, and civil societies in the room because, again, it\u2019s identifying a problem from the outset that we may not see.\nSo I think it just goes to this point that both of us are making, that unless everyone with an equity, a perspective, an experience on these questions is in on the takeoff, we\u2019re probably not going to have a smooth landing.\nSo we have a few minutes left.\u00a0 One of the things that I know bedevils all of us in different ways is how we think about dealing with disinformation and misinformation that\u2019s in our ecosystems, and to do it in a way that is protective of speech, not destructive of it, and to do it in a way, again, that uses \u2013 truth has now become a subjective word so I hate to use it \u2013 but that brings truth to bear.\nI\u2019m just wondering, from each of your perspectives, if this is something that you\u2019ve had to grapple with, to think about, and whether there are any ideas that you want to surface today in helping us think about it.\u00a0 Just throwing that out there.\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 We need a growing, transparent public discussion.\u00a0 This is the way we should follow to pursue the target.\u00a0 I want to share something with you.\u00a0 In Argentina, we are doing an experiment, an electoral experiment.\u00a0 We have called \u2013 I have mentioned government, civil society, private sector.\u00a0 We have called Facebook and Twitter.\u00a0 And there is a public agreement between the government, the political parties, and these two companies related to the electoral debate in Argentina, for example.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2013 what is the idea?\nThe idea is to guarantee transparency in the discussion, the possibility of having everyone on board, every sector on board, and particularly, I would like to stress, to guarantee a real public debate where everyone has the chance to participate.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s a \u2013 might be a new \u2013 in my country it\u2019s going to be a new tool that will provide a better solution \u2013 situation, sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I think that more conversation is needed.\u00a0 Education, awareness raising among stakeholders, government officials, judiciary.\u00a0 But at the same time, I think keeping an eye that there\u2019s always this tendency from the powerful actors to criminalize this kind of speech, and I think we have to be very, very careful, if governments are making these decisions, how civil society can be part of those conversation.\nAnd I believe that more speech is an answer and not banning the speech.\u00a0 And just want to mention one initiative that I\u2019m also part of is, because misinformation and disinformation has harmed women and girls online, female journalists.\u00a0 It has increased gender \u2013 online gender-based violence.\u00a0 And this global partnership on \u2013 to address tech-facilitated violence which, again, U.S. Government is taking the leading role and other governments are part of it \u2013 I think these are the kind of initiatives that we need more.\nAnd also like-minded governments are part of such kind of partnerships.\u00a0 We need to see how we can bring those governments which are not like-minded and how they are becoming part of these conversation.\u00a0 I think that that\u2019s much needed.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR OPEKE:\u00a0 Well, I think what you have are that the most powerful and motivated and the authoritarian voices then try to crowd people out and feed a lot of this misinformation.\u00a0 So I also agree that more conversation is required, but more \u2013 the broadening of access so that the advantage some of these people have in weaponizing, in being the loudest and the \u2013 sometimes the only voices or the strongest voices in the room, can be crowded out by broader sections of society.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Please.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Secretary, can I just \u2013 like just one last thing.\u00a0 I really want to commend the executive order that has been issued by the President Biden to ban spyware which violates human rights.\u00a0 And I would like to acknowledge that civil society has been doing a lot of work for years around this issue.\u00a0 And I think you guys have set a really good precedent for other governments, and we would like to see this kind of decision coming from other Western democracies and then hopefully from other regimes as well.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, you just heard it, so thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe are predictably out of time.\u00a0 I just want to see if anyone has any last things that they want to say, put on the table, that they didn\u2019t get a chance to say.\u00a0 Ambassador, anything?\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 I just want to thank you again.\u00a0 This is the way.\u00a0 This is the direction we should work on.\u00a0 So I want you to know that we will try to reproduce this scenario in our country following what you\u2019re doing here today.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Anything?\nMS DAD:\u00a0 I just want to say empower civil society.\u00a0 Give them resources.\u00a0 Make them part of these conversations in proper spirit.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s it.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good way to conclude.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you. (Applause.)\n\n"}]
