You could have picked another place \u2013 another time and place for us to have this occasion, but you picked Port Moresby, you picked our nation\u2019s capital, and you picked Papua New Guinea \u2013 and we sincerely appreciate you very much for this kind gesture.\nToday, in our bilateral meeting, you were witness to the signing of our Defense Cooperation Agreement.\u00a0 That was a culmination of many years and months of engagement with Pentagon, engagement with Washington, engagement with U.S. officials and our team.\u00a0 I just want to stress this point: It wasn\u2019t shoved down our throat.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t forced upon us; it was a mutual agreement.\u00a0 A conversation was held expressly on the need for Papua New Guinea to have our defence force assisted, supported, stepped up.\nPapua New Guineans, you must know you have domestic security issue, as well as closer to home security issues.\u00a0 We cannot forever remain in (inaudible) in as far as our defence force is concerned.\u00a0 Our defence force needs to be stepped up and supported.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had similar defense cooperation agreement with Australia, Indonesia, and other nations we enjoy strong long-term partnerships with.\u00a0 We have every right also, in the same vein, to engage in a straight partnership with United States of America, where we have had no problem with similar defense force cooperation agreements \u2013 have been foundation of our relationship.\nAnd today, the defense force cooperation comes with a backdrop of elevating what was originally the umbrella status of force agreement that kept us together.\u00a0 We are now elevating that to a specific relationship exclusive for U.S.A.-PNG military cooperations and military engagements and partnership.\u00a0 There is nothing for us to be fearful about.\u00a0 I just want to needless repeat but for emphasis because of a lot of misconception and confusion out there in the public.\u00a0 This agreement is subsidiary to a treaty \u2013 it\u2019s below the treaty level.\u00a0 This agreement in no way breaks or encroaches into our country\u2019s legislations, (inaudible) the fundamental constitution of our country or every other (inaudible) legislations we have.\nThis agreement is congruent to the 1975 Visiting Forces Act, the 1975 Visiting Forces Act.\u00a0 James Marape was still a child in 1975, when the fathers of this nation saw it important to have an act called the Visiting Forces Act to ensure we\u2019re engaged in partnership with nations of similarities, nations where we have common bond, where exchanges can be made possible.\nAnd so, I just want to inform the educated out there, especially those of you who want to pick a political bone with me \u2013 let\u2019s not confuse everyone.\u00a0 We are a nation of rule of law.\u00a0 If you feel that this agreement encroaches into one iota of our constitutional law of the land, make reference to the supreme court.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure the court will find \u2013 I\u2019m sure the court will find that what we have done is within the gambit of the constitution of our country and all subsidiary legislations.\u00a0 It is meant to ensure that our country\u2019s domestic as well as sovereign security is secured, beefed up, bumped up, and prepared for any challenges \u2013 not just military challenges, but more importantly, challenges of disaster, challenges of social issues, and every other challenge we go through, including securing our country to be a country known to have secured the security issue and prepared for investments that we are trying to attract into our country.\nMy conversation with India is not just purely on politics; my conversation with U.S.A. is not purely on politics.\u00a0 But more importantly, deep inside \u2013 and Secretary Blinken knows this; those who worked with us on this one knows this \u2013 we want American-based investors to come to our country.\u00a0 We want Indian-based investors to come into our country.\u00a0 We are looking at diversifying our economic base, and growing it \u2013 and make it stronger so that government can in turn look after our citizens.\u00a0 That is foundationally not so today because of the weak security structure we have in our country.\u00a0 Strengthening our defense force, strengthening our police, strengthening our court system, ensuring that our democracy is secure is a key foundational interest of the state to make sure our country is secure.\nIt is in this vein that we are in partnership with the biggest democracy on the face of Planet Earth, and I just want to encourage our people, please don\u2019t be \u2013 don\u2019t think that something suspicious of funny is behind this.\u00a0 It was a work over many years that has culminated over \u2013 into a six month of robust conversation between Port Moresby and Washington, (inaudible) and Washington, our own military head official or former head official as well as Pentagon and Washington officials.\u00a0 Today is a result of many weeks, months, and years of work.\nAnd I will be making available to the public, as we complete due process of key documents to be made known to public in the very near future \u2013 possibly in days, this agreement will be made public to everyone for all of us to understand.\u00a0 The United States of America is always transparent about matters that is of importance to the public.\u00a0 They too, I would believe \u2013 and I don\u2019t like to speak for Secretary Blinken, but they too will make known to public, their own country, they will report \u2013 they have a duty to report back to their country the agreement that we\u2019ve signed.\u00a0 And for matters of transparency for the people and citizens of Papua New Guinea, people and citizens of U.S.A. will know exactly what we\u2019ve signed.\nI just want to conclude by saying what we\u2019ve signed does not encroach \u2013 or affect, rather \u2013 Papua New Guinea\u2019s own relationships we have with other nations we trade with, or we have relationships with, be it military or government-to-government relations.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 It does not affect \u2013 whether in China or Australia or United Kingdom or Japan or India or any other nation, for that matter \u2013 this agreement does not in one way, shape, and form stop Papua New Guinea from continuing on doing business with those we do business with.\u00a0 So, I just want to inform everyone to have a bit of understanding that your government is in the business of securing your future and your economic future as we (inaudible) on these matters.\nOther matters we discussed with Secretary Blinken on behalf of President Biden, (inaudible) ways continuing issue on the climate change, our energy and security, our (inaudible) greater regional security in the region.\u00a0 You would have been informed earlier that we did sign a subsequent agreement called a (inaudible) agreement that secures PNG\u2019s maritime borders and our resources found in our seas.\u00a0 That sort of conversation was also held in the Pacific Island Leaders Meeting, the concern of care for our resources and the security of our seas; all conversation made \u2013 Secretary Blinken was very generous with his time and ears.\u00a0 He sat through, listened to our conversations (inaudible), but a substantial part of Pacific Island and U.S.A. engagements were put to a work-in-progress mode.\u00a0 And we will arrive in Washington in September of this year, hopefully for substantial progress where United States is making a greater commitment to respond to some of the key development challenges we face in the region, including (inaudible) issues and the other insecurity issues that (inaudible).\nOn this note, Secretary Blinken, I have not stolen your time now.\u00a0 There is now space for you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I just have (inaudible) the discussions that we held and (inaudible).\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a few questions (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Prime Minister, thank you so much.\u00a0 And I fully endorse everything you said.\u00a0 And you can speak for me, because you do it so eloquently.\u00a0 And I can only fully agree with everything that you said.\u00a0 But thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the incredibly warm reception, and thank you for the incredibly productive day \u2013 both on a bilateral basis between the United States and Papua New Guinea, but also with all of our regional partners \u2013 discussing and making progress on issues that are critical to our shared future.\nThere is an old Hawaiian saying that translates loosely to \u201cunited to move forward.\u201d\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s the spirit in which we all came together today as Pacific nations.\u00a0 Our partnership is crucial to how we deliver for our people, how we meet their needs and aspirations, and advance our common vision for the region \u2013 one that is free and open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.\u00a0 Or, as your 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent puts it, a \u201cresilient Pacific region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity that ensures all Pacific peoples can lead free, healthy, and productive lives.\u201d\u00a0 It is a powerful, positive ambition that we share.\nAt this forum we\u2019ve built on momentum from the first U.S.-Pacific Island Summit last fall.\u00a0 There in Washington, President Biden pledged to open a new era in our partnership \u2013 one of mutual respect, trust, and benefit.\u00a0 As I had an opportunity to tell Pacific leaders at our meeting today, over the past year the United States has been listening to you, engaging with your governments, working to deliver on our summit announcements that align with your broader vision.\u00a0 And together, we\u2019ve made considerable, tangible progress on many of the commitments in a short period of time.\u00a0 Together, we are super-charging our climate action.\nToday, I announced that the United States will support the PIF in standing up the new Pacific Resilience Facility.\u00a0 This Pacific-owned, Pacific-led solution will drive investment into climate adaptation and resilience in front-line communities.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re boosting our bilateral security relationship to ensure that the Blue Pacific remains a place of peace and prosperity.\nThe prime minister and I just signed, as he mentioned, two agreements which will boost cooperation between Papua New Guinea Defence Forces and the U.S. Coast Guard to help build up the Defence Forces\u2019 capacity, and help combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\nTogether, we\u2019re driving progress to expand trade, investment, and business initiatives that can lift up all communities.\u00a0 In Papua New Guinea specifically, we\u2019re working with Congress to provide over $45 million in new programming on sustainable and inclusive development, public health, and energy security.\u00a0 And later this year the Department of Commerce will lead a first-ever U.S. business delegation to Pacific Island countries to explore opportunities in energy, in transportation, in health care, tourism, and telecommunications.\nTogether, we\u2019re modernizing and enhancing the Compacts of Free Association.\u00a0 These are the bedrock of U.S. engagement in the Pacific.\u00a0 We just signed our agreement with Palau today, in this room.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful to President Whipps for his partnership.\u00a0 Tomorrow, we\u2019ll sign our agreement with the Federated States of Micronesia.\u00a0 And I look forward to finishing negotiations with the Republic of the Marshall Islands soon, to ensure that this arrangement reflects the realities and the challenges of our time.\u00a0 As part of these agreements, the United States will commit $7.1 billion to the Freely Associated States over the next 20 years.\nTogether, we\u2019re also strengthening ties between our peoples.\u00a0 We are very excited to announce the return of the Peace Corps to the Pacific Islands, and that we\u2019re launching new educational exchanges to share skills and expertise, and forge enduring connections that will benefit our communities.\nSo, we\u2019ve got a lot to work on, a lot to accomplish together.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re expanding our diplomatic presence in the region, delivering on our commitments last year.\u00a0 We\u2019ve opened two new embassies, one on the Solomon Islands, the other just two weeks ago in Tonga.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working to do the same in Vanuatu and Kiribati by the end of this year.\nWe\u2019ve named our first ever envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, Ambassador Frankie Reed, who will continue to engage throughout the region to strengthen our partnerships.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to strive to meet the Pacific where it is, (inaudible) Pacific leaders and through the Pacific Islands Forum.\u00a0 We\u2019ll encourage other partners to do the same, including through the Partners in the Blue Pacific, to support the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\u00a0 And in that regard, we very much welcome India\u2019s engagement with countries in the region.\u00a0 That, too, is a very positive development for the future that we all want.\nSo Prime Minister, to you, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for this partnership at a critical time for the region that we share.\u00a0 And thank you for the work that we\u2019re doing every day to build it, to make it stronger, to deliver on our shared vision.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Any questions?\u00a0 We\u2019ll just take two or three questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We will first go to Gorethy Kenneth from\u00a0The\u00a0Post-Courier.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Prime Minister, (inaudible), the line credit \u2013 the line of credit program with India and Papua New Guinea (inaudible).\u00a0 Was it \u2013 will it be extended or was it extended?\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0The prime minister took note of this fact, and he is taking it back to his country.\u00a0 We \u2013 for us, as a country, it\u2019s important we also diversify our source of support.\u00a0 India has opened up that facility \u2013 those facilities.\u00a0 We\u2019ve asked them to go back and maintain the facility and expressed the (inaudible) invite to procure a source.\u00a0 So, he said he\u2019ll take back to his officials.\u00a0 We don\u2019t run other forms of government.\u00a0 We run democratic form of government (inaudible) our systems to go back to (inaudible) said he would look at (inaudible).\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Jack Moore from AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to speak to us.\u00a0 My question is for you, Secretary.\u00a0 Given the inroads that China has made in the Pacific in places such as the Solomon Islands, how important was it for Washington to secure the deals today with Papua New Guinea and renew with Palau to counter Beijing\u2019s rise and influence in the region?\u00a0 And how satisfied are you with the outcome?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, I\u2019d say a few things.\u00a0 First, the agreements that we reached, the work that we\u2019re doing, is not about any other country.\u00a0 It\u2019s about our relationship with the Pacific Islands and the shared vision that we have for this region.\nAnd as you heard the prime minister say, while we signed the Defense Cooperation Agreement today, the ship (inaudible) agreement \u2013 these are very important in helping to strengthen Papua New Guinea\u2019s capacity.\u00a0 We\u2019re working across the board on issues of direct concern to people of Papua New Guinea and throughout the region, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s investment, whether it\u2019s building up healthcare systems.\u00a0 But this is grounded in \u2013 I think what\u2019s fair to say is a shared vision that we have for a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nAnd we talk about that a lot.\u00a0 And I just want to be clear about what we mean by that when we\u2019re talking about a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We need a region where countries are free to choose their own path and their own partners, where problems will be dealt openly, transparently. \u00a0Goals will be reached in a transparent way, (inaudible) fairly, and goods, ideas, and people can float freely and lawfully across the land, the seas, the skies, and in cyberspace.\u00a0 That\u2019s the vision that we have, as well as making sure that the citizens in our countries have the opportunity to reach their full potential, providing the support necessary to do that.\nBut this vision doesn\u2019t exclude anyone.\u00a0 We welcome contributions by other countries, including the PRC \u2013 the regional development \u2013 so long as they adhere to the highest standards, including in areas like transparency and the rule of law.\u00a0 If all of us are going to be engaged in a region as partners \u2013 well, if there\u2019s going to be a race, let it be a race to the top.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re all about, and we want to simply see anyone who\u2019s engaged engage in a way that advances the shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nBut as I said, the focus that we have is on building and strengthening these partnerships on their own terms, not with regard to any other country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Take a final question from Tim Swanston from ABC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m happy just to talk loudly if you can hear me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I appreciate what you\u2019re saying that this isn\u2019t about any other countries, but ultimately, China has made very serious inroads with respect to the defense and security arrangement here in the Pacific.\u00a0 Now that the Defense Cooperation Agreement is being signed, under what kind of timeframe would you like to see U.S. military or U.S. assets placed in PNG?\u00a0 And what bases are you looking at of importance to the island states?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0What we\u2019re focused on is what our partners here are working and trying to achieve in strengthening their capacity.\u00a0 As you heard the prime minister say, there\u2019s a focus on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief.\u00a0 That\u2019s the main import of what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But the main point is that, as you heard the prime minister say, we\u2019ve had this basic arrangement going back to 1975.\u00a0 So, this is simply updating and modernizing what has been a longstanding agreement between our countries just to make sure that we can work together as effectively as possible.\nAnd as I said in the first instance, we want to make sure that we\u2019re being responsive to some of the challenges that the PNG faces.\u00a0 There are other challenges that I mentioned that \u2013 where these agreements will be very helpful \u2013 for example, the issue of illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing.\u00a0 This is something that is having a devasting impact on livelihoods in the Pacific Islands, as well as the ecosystem that is so vital to nourishing these economies.\u00a0 So, this could \u2013 I think the work that we\u2019re doing with PNG can be of a real assistance there.\nYou heard the prime minister talk about other concerns with regard, for example, to (inaudible), where again these agreements will help.\u00a0 But that\u2019s the immediate focus of what we\u2019re looking to do, but it\u2019s all on the basis of simply bringing up to date and modernizing agreements that have been there for a long, long time.\u00a0 And I would emphasize, again, something the prime minister said: these are being done in a fully transparent way, respectful of PNG\u2019s institutions, of its sovereignty.\u00a0 These are agreements that we reach together, not agreements that anyone is imposing on anyone else, and they take away no freedom of action from the PNG.\u00a0 And as the Prime Minister said, we\u2019ll be making these publicly available \u2013 as we always do, as we complete the process of finalizing the agreements in our respective countries.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary, if I could just add one or two more lines \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 the presence of China, let me inform everyone, China is (inaudible) and people have no interest whatsoever with what they do in other nations.\u00a0 We have a healthy relationship with Chinese Government, and they are important and big trading partner, but we are moving into finalizing this agreement.\u00a0 We did not need to tell anyone else what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But they have given assurance to us in our conversations that we have every right to engage with U.S.A. as much as we have with them.\nAnd so, I just want to inform Papua New Guineans in the first instance and the media, we\u2019re trying to play out from this issue of China versus U.S.A.\u00a0 The Secretary of State correctly has stated this has nothing to do with the bigger issues, the headline issues that keep on going off every now and then.\u00a0 Papua New Guinea invited U.S.A. to move beyond just an ordinary agreement to a specifically defense-focused agreement.\u00a0 In my view, that strengthens our Defence Force, and they will come in at the invitation of our Defence Force, and not at their own will.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that must be clear that everyone in the Pacific \u2013 upon our invitation, they come in.\nThat is subsequently a question on when that needs to be done that dwarfs other agreements and other processes.\u00a0 This is just a framework agreement that now (inaudible) this element of specific relationship with U.S.A. like we\u2019ve never had before.\u00a0 And I want to assure Papua New Guinea\u2019s \u2013 particularly with China (inaudible) to do with our internal security issue to ensure that our military is now responsive to the challenges of 21st century, living in this part of Planet Earth.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Prime Minister.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0All right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And let me just say one last thing if I could.\u00a0 The ocean that we share is called the Pacific.\u00a0 And our ambition is for it to remain exactly that: an ocean of peace.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do together.\nPRIME MINISTER MARAPE:\u00a0\u00a0All right.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone (inaudible).\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "APEC Haus", "location": "Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea", "date": "May 22, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, everyone.\u00a0 And I have to say I\u2019m very tempted to say, \u201cWhat the prime minister said,\u201d and leave it at that because I could not and cannot say it more eloquently than he just has.\u00a0 But let me first say good afternoon to everyone.\u00a0 It is truly wonderful to be here in Papua New Guinea, to be joining the prime minister, to be joining the defense ministers, to be joining the entire team.\nMr. Prime Minister, we\u2019ve spent a good bit of time together, including a visit to the Oval Office with President Biden during the Pacific Island Summit last year.\u00a0 And you heard this from the President himself during your call a few days ago, but he asked me again to reiterate to you, to all of our friends in Papua New Guinea, his regrets for being unable to be here today.\u00a0 The President values deeply our nations\u2019 longstanding partnership and believes our cooperation is critical to addressing a series of shared challenges that are facing our people.\u00a0 And he\u2019s eager to welcome you, to welcome other Pacific Island Forum leaders, back to Washington for a second summit later this year.\nWe are deeply invested in the Indo-Pacific because our planet\u2019s future is being written here.\u00a0 Papua New Guinea is playing a critical role in shaping that future.\u00a0 That leadership is on display this week as you\u2019ve welcomed 16 delegations for the U.S.-Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting to make progress on priorities that we\u2019ve established together, from tackling the climate crisis to improving public health to enhancing disaster preparedness and response.\u00a0 And the United States is proud to partner with Papua New Guinea on these same priorities because they\u2019re our priorities too.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together as regional security partners.\u00a0 We\u2019re boosting our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific though the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.\nWe\u2019re driving economic opportunity through partnerships between our businesses, which are bringing tens of billions in new investment to Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 And we are teaming up to bring preventative, lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment to people here in Papua New Guinea so that they can continue to lead healthy and productive lives.\nSimply put, we are committed to growing all aspects of our relationship.\u00a0 And to that end, today, as you\u2019ve from the prime minister, we\u2019re signing two agreements on defense and on maritime cooperation.\nThe Defense Cooperation Agreement, drafted by Papua New Guinea and the United States as equal and sovereign partners, will enhance the PNG\u2019s Defence Force\u2019s capability to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, including through providing medical care and temporary shelter to those who are affected by crises.\u00a0 The agreement will also make it easy for PNG and U.S. forces to train together in new ways and in more places as part of our joint effort to uphold peace and security across the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We will be fully transparent of the details of the agreement, which contains elements from our previous agreement and updates to reflect our shared commitment to deepen cooperation on issues that matter most to people here as well as in the United States.\nAnd as you also heard from the prime minister, the Shiprider Agreement will allow the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and the U.S. Coast Guard to deepen cooperation to combat illicit maritime activities, including illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which we know is destroying livelihoods and threatening green ecosystems that nourish Pacific Island economies.\nAt more than 2.4 million square kilometers, the PNG\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone is one of the largest in the South Pacific.\u00a0 That poses a tremendous economic opportunity but also a serious challenge for monitoring, for controlling, for surveilling that vast expanse of maritime area.\u00a0 Under this agreement, our forces will be able to board one another\u2019s vessels, share technical expertise, and ultimately better patrol the seas together.\u00a0 This is vital to protecting livelihoods for generations to come.\nFor nearly 50 years, Papua New Guinea and the United States have worked together to deliver prosperity for our people and promote security and stability for the region.\u00a0 You heard the prime minister speak eloquently to that shared history.\u00a0 But I think what\u2019s so important is that shared history is also a living history, and together \u2013 even as we\u2019re inspired by so much that we\u2019ve done in the past \u2013 we are working together to shape the future.\u00a0 That\u2019s the task before us.\u00a0 And Mr. Prime Minister, we are very much looking forward to taking our partnership to the next level.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

very much.\u00a0 And colleagues, it is a great honor to be with all of you, to be with our Pacific Island partners.\u00a0 Prime Minister, I\u2019m really grateful to you as our host for welcoming all of us to Papua New Guinea.\nPresident Biden was very much looking forward to being here and to addressing Pacific Island Forum leaders before events in Washington required him to be there.\u00a0 He felt it was important for me to represent him to underscore to you our commitment to the region.\u00a0 And in fact, I\u2019m carrying with me a formal invitation from the President for Pacific leaders to come back to Washington this fall for a second summit to continue conversations and develop new initiatives that are critical to our collective future.\u00a0 I know that the President is eager to welcome you in Washington again.\u00a0 The first summit was historic.\u00a0 Our second summit will help us really shape history together.\nThis is the second opportunity that I\u2019ve had to be with the Pacific Island Forum.\u00a0 I very much appreciated the discussion last year in Fiji.\u00a0 Vice President Harris also addressed that meeting virtually.\u00a0 And in between those events, senior officials from across our government have regularly traveled to the region.\nWhen President Biden launched the Pacific Island Summit last year, he pledged a new era of cooperation and partnership to deliver for our people. \u00a0An era of mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual benefit with the United States and the Pacific Islands working together to advance a shared vision for the region that\u2019s free, that\u2019s open, that\u2019s connected, that\u2019s prosperous, that\u2019s secure, that\u2019s resilient.\nSo we sometimes have formulas, phrases that we repeat to each other on a regular basis, and \u201cfree and open\u201d is one of them.\u00a0 What do we actually mean by that?\u00a0 Well, for our part \u2013 and I think this is a shared view among everyone at this table \u2013 when we talk about free and open we mean a region where countries are free to choose their own path and their own partners; where problems can be dealt with openly, rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly; and goods, ideas, and people will flow freely and lawfully across land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nOver the past year, the United States has been listening hard, listening to you, engaging with your governments, working to deliver on our summit announcements and align with your vision.\u00a0 Today, I think we can actually point to substantial progress on many of those commitments, acknowledging that more work needs to be done.\u00a0 And Prime Minister, I take very much to heart what you said about the need to have clear lines of visibility and accessibility so that we can continue to move forward on the agenda we set for each other.\nBut if you just look at what we\u2019ve managed to accomplish over the past year as well as where we\u2019re going.\u00a0 I think we do see tangible progress.\u00a0 We\u2019re enhancing our diplomatic engagements in the Pacific.\u00a0 Last year, we inaugurated our new embassy building here in Papua New Guinea.\u00a0 I had a chance to visit it this morning.\u00a0 It\u2019s an extraordinary facility, really a state-of-the-art building that I think reflects the value that place on our partnership.\nWe recently opened two new embassies in Solomon Islands and Tonga.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to do the same in Vanuatu in Kiribati.\u00a0 We sent our first ever U.S. envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, Ambassador Frankie Reed, who is here with us today and has been hard at work to deepen our relationships across the region.\u00a0 America\u2019s future is here in the Pacific.\nWe\u2019re strengthening our partnerships on public health, the climate crisis, economic growth, and other key regional priorities that respond to people\u2019s needs and expectations.\u00a0 By September, we\u2019ll open a new USAID mission here in the Pacific Islands based in Papua New Guinea to advance those efforts.\nWe\u2019ve also helped Pacific Island countries unlock more than half a billion dollars from international organizations to help communities manage the growing impacts of climate change, a challenge that we know President Biden feels strongly is existential for the Pacific Islands and on which the Pacific Islands have all led in the global community.\u00a0 Today, I am very pleased to announce the United States plans to be among the founding partners to support PIF in standing up the new Pacific Resilience Facility to support investments in adaptation and resilience.\nWe\u2019re updating and enhancing the Compacts of Free Association with our close partners in the Freely Associated States.\u00a0 A little later today, we\u2019re signing agreements with Palau, tomorrow with Federated States of Micronesia, and we\u2019re looking forward to entering negotiations with the Republic of the Marshall Islands very soon.\nAs part of these agreements, the United States will commit more than $7.1 billion to the Freely Associated States over the next 20 years.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also included an enhanced South Pacific Tuna Treaty.\u00a0 We just completed negotiations on a new 10-year economic assistance agreement which will support livelihoods across the region, boost our cooperation on priorities like combatting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\u00a0 We know how essential, how vital this is, to virtually all of our partners in the region.\u00a0 We know the damage that it does to livelihoods and the threat that it poses to ecosystems that are quite literally nourishing your economies.\nWe\u2019re advancing shared prosperity across our region by connecting American and Pacific companies and boosting trade and investment through new initiatives and new dialogue.\u00a0 We launched a new transportation partnership and strategic infrastructure initiatives aimed at unlocking over $450 million in financing for clean energy connectivity and for digital infrastructure.\u00a0 We held the first U.S.-PIF dialogue on trade and investment a little bit earlier this year and look forward to a ministerial level dialogue very soon.\nAnd today, I can announce that our Department of Commerce will lead a U.S. business delegation to the Pacific Island countries in the coming year to look at concrete opportunities in energy, in transportation, in health care, in tourism, in telecommunications.\u00a0 We\u2019re putting together a very strong delegation of leading American enterprises, and we very much look forward to doing that in a few months\u2019 time.\nAlso deepening the already incredibly vibrant ties between our people, we\u2019re partnering with Johns Hopkins University to welcome the first cohort of Pacific leaders at the U.S. Pacific Institute for Rising Leaders program this fall.\u00a0 That will (inaudible) the region\u2019s brightest minds on the key priorities that (inaudible) time.\nAnd we\u2019re returning the Peace Corps to the region with volunteers already on the ground in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, and preparing to arrive in Vanuatu (inaudible) later this year.\nWe\u2019re committed to building on all of this momentum generated in the last year, including by working through the Partners in the Blue Pacific to support 2050 strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\nSo in short, I think we\u2019re making demonstrable progress on the agenda we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\u00a0 There is more that we can do, more that we will do, more that we have to do.\u00a0 But it was very important for me to be here today to hear from all of you, our partners, on how we\u2019re doing, how we can do even better, and how we can deepen all of the work that we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\nSo thank you for the honor of joining you today.\u00a0 I\u2019m so grateful to all of our colleagues for being here.\u00a0 I\u2019m very much looking forward to this conversation, to listening to everyone\u2019s ideas to everyone\u2019s priorities to ensure that the United States is a strong, reliable, effective partner in the Pacific Islands in the future that we are building together.\nThank you very much, Prime Minister.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

together some of our brightest minds, our best universities, our boldest companies, offers incredible promise for the future.\nAnd as the ambassador said, it\u2019s hard to know standing here today all that this is going to produce.\u00a0 But I can say with great confidence that it\u2019s going to stand both of our countries \u2013 and actually the world \u2013 in very good stead.\u00a0 This is an extraordinary collaboration that we\u2019re initiating today.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be a part of it.\nAnd to all of the leaders who are here from U.S. and Japanese industry, from educational institutions, kicking off these new initiatives today from IBM, from Google, from Micron, from Tokyo Electron; Universities of Tokyo, Hiroshima, Tohoku, Chicago, Purdue, Boise State \u2013 this is a extraordinary list but an extraordinary group of institutions, of individuals \u2013 partners, now, in this endeavor.\u00a0 And I really want to thank you for making this happen and thanking \u2013 and thank you as well for making up such an incredible team.\nThe collaborative efforts that we\u2019re launching today are about improving the lives of our people.\u00a0 That\u2019s fundamentally what it comes down to \u2013 now, but also for generations to come.\u00a0 We all know that semiconductors power everything from the devices we all carry in our pockets to the artificial intelligence that\u2019s reshaping the production of knowledge.\u00a0 They are the foundation upon which future innovation will be built, from quantum computers and biotechnology to precision medicine to renewable energy.\nMaintaining our shared edge in these technologies is not just crucial for expanding opportunities and delivering tangible benefits for our people.\u00a0 It will also allow us to shape the rules and norms around emerging technologies so that they\u2019re developed and used in ways that reflect the values that we share.\nAnd it\u2019s not just what we\u2019ll work on that makes these new partnerships critically important, but how we\u2019ll work together.\u00a0 We\u2019re investing in the best ecosystems for innovation, bringing together extraordinary research universities, extraordinary companies, and our governments.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be stronger, we\u2019ll be more nimble, we\u2019ll be more dynamic, because the United States and Japan will build these synergies in unison rather than in isolation.\u00a0 And I\u2019m especially excited by the young minds who are going to be brought to bear on this partnership.\u00a0 That to me is one of the most inspiring parts of this initiative.\nWe know this formula delivers because collaboration across our borders and sectors has already yielded some of the world\u2019s most transformative breakthroughs.\u00a0 Just to cite two examples for this morning out of so many that we all know about, the first is from 1986, when America\u2019s Motorola combined its microprocessor with Japan\u2019s Toshiba\u2019s design and manufacturing technology, producing one of the earliest and biggest leaps in semiconductor technology.\nThe second started back in the 1950s, when, after finishing his PhD at the University of Tokyo, a Japanese meteorologist, Manabe Syukuro, went to work at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0 Over the coming decades, he and American colleagues developed the first models that were used to simulate climate change, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 2021.\u00a0 Even as he pursued his own research, Manabe \u2013 who is now 91 years old \u2013 has mentored generations of rising American and Japanese scientists at Princeton and Nagoya Universities.\nUltimately, that\u2019s what this Memorandum of Cooperation In Education is all about.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just maintaining but expanding the pipeline of rising American and Japanese thinkers, innovators, technologists, so that they can shape emerging technologies for the good of our nations, for the good of the world.\nSo I am confident that no one can do it better together than our countries, our institutions, our people, and Rahm and I \u2013 well, maybe not Rahm \u2013 I\u2019ll be long retired when we get a chance to see the extraordinary innovations that I know this partnership is going to produce.\u00a0 So thank you all so much for being part of this, and we very much look forward to seeing the future that we\u2019re going to be building together.\u00a0 Thank you all very, very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMINISTER NAGAOKA:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good morning, distinguished guests.\u00a0 I am Keiko Nagaoka.\u00a0 I am the minister in charge of education, science, and technology.\u00a0 So shortly after my (inaudible), Ambassador Emanuel had his (inaudible).\u00a0 So he has an office in the Ministry of Education, but that is not true.\u00a0 But I think it is worth a office because he has been visiting us so many times and we have been holding so many frequent meetings, so I think his visit deserves that we give him an office.\nSo Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Ambassador Rahm Emanuel and distinguished guests from U.S. and Japan universities and representatives of (inaudible) companies, good morning.\u00a0 Today I am truly grateful to sign the Memorandum of Cooperation together with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 So this is the first MOC to be concluded between the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and the Department of State.\u00a0 A reference was made to this MOC during the U.S.-Japan summit meeting held earlier.\u00a0 We anticipate that the signing of MOC would contribute greatly to the expansion of cooperation in education between the U.S. and Japan, present and into the future.\nLast week, during the G7 education ministerial meeting which I chaired, G7 nations which share the democratic value of freedom, peace, and rule of law have reached agreement to promote cooperation in education.\u00a0 So the declaration was adopted, and only after the adoption of the declaration we were able to start a concrete action through the signing of this MOC, and I\u2019m truly grateful for that fact.\nGoing forward based on this MOC, our ministry and the Department of State will strengthen cooperation in the secondary and higher education, as well as in research.\u00a0 And at the same time, we will start holding policy dialogue between the two agencies on a regular basis.\nAs for the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, we hope to further promote exchange in education between the U.S. and Japan.\u00a0 Based on the second set of the recommendations, titled Initiative to Promote Overseas Study of (inaudible) Relations Who Will Shape the Future, which as known as the J-MIRAI project \u2013 this was compiled in the Education Future Creation Conference in April.\u00a0 We hope to further accelerate our cooperation.\nIn addition, along with the MOC, I welcome the conclusion of partnership agreements by the companies and universities of both nations on quantum and semiconductors, both of which are strategically critical to the U.S. and Japan.\u00a0 Under these partnerships, we have high expectations that the cooperation of the U.S. and Japan will further evolve in these critical sectors and will foster talent with skill sets that can shape the next generation.\u00a0 And I hope that such cooperation will further expand moving forward.\nAs the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, we wish to cooperate closely with the Department of State.\u00a0 I would like to ask your kind support and cooperation on this matter so that we can further strengthen our cooperation in education sectors and promote educational exchange.\u00a0 And needless to say, with the conclusion of MOC, the U.S. embassy officials \u2013 and not to mention Ambassador Emanuel \u2013 I would like to offer \u2013 express my gratitude for the U.S. embassy officials and Ambassador Emanuel.\u00a0 With that, I would like to conclude my remarks.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The memorandum was signed.)\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Dirksen Senate Office Building", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 16, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, State and Foreign Ops Chair Coons, Ranking Member Graham, distinguished members of the Appropriations Committee, thank you for this opportunity to testify before you today.\u00a0 Thank you for bringing us all together.\nI\u2019m very pleased as well to be here with Secretary Austin, Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 This administration is committed to leading a bipartisan, whole-of-government China strategy that advances U.S. interests and values and delivers for the American people.\nAnd to your point, Chair Murray, I think we do stand at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over.\u00a0 There is an intense competition underway to shape what comes next.\nChina represents the most consequential geopolitical challenge that we face today: a country with the intent and, increasingly, the capability to challenge our vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous international order.\nWe cannot dictate Beijing\u2019s path.\u00a0 We cannot wait for China to change its trajectory.\u00a0 But we can put ourselves in a position of strength to compete intensely to shape the broader strategic environment around China and to advance our vision.\nWe do not seek conflict with China or a new Cold War.\u00a0 We\u2019re not trying to contain China.\u00a0 And in fact, the United States continues to have a comprehensive trade and investment relationship with China, as do most of our allies and partners.\u00a0 We are, however, resolutely for de-risking and diversifying, not decoupling.\u00a0 That means investing in our own capacities and in a secure, resilient supply chain, pushing for a level playing field for our workers and companies, defending against harmful trade practices, and ensuring that the United States and allied technology is not used against us.\nWe\u2019re also committed to working with allies and partners to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific \u2013 one that is at peace and grounded in respect for a rules-based international order.\nWhen we talk about \u201cfree and open,\u201d what we mean is this:\u00a0 We mean countries being free to choose their own path and their own partners, and that problems will be dealt with openly, not coercively.\u00a0 Rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly.\u00a0 Goods, ideas, and people will flow lawfully and freely across the land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nThe world is watching how we \u2013 and Beijing \u2013 manage this relationship.\u00a0 And it\u2019s in our best strategic interest to do so responsibly, in a way that promotes security and prosperity and delivers solutions on shared challenges that matter to the American people and to people around the world.\nLast year, I had an opportunity to set out the administration\u2019s comprehensive PRC strategy to \u201cinvest, align, and compete.\u201d\nWe have made historic investments here at home \u2013 including the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 to strengthen our ability to compete.\nWe\u2019ve aligned our approach with key partners in Europe and Asia and beyond, working methodically to elevate our engagement around the world \u2013 and as a result, we have achieved greater convergence on how to deal with the challenges that China poses than ever before.\nAs we compete, we will work to maintain open lines of communication at all levels with the PRC to avoid miscalculation, to prevent competition from veering into conflict.\u00a0 Senior-level engagements over the past few weeks demonstrate that commitment.\nWe will purposefully engage China, not as a favor, or with engagement as an end in and of itself, but in ways that reflect our values and where we can find areas of cooperation that are in our mutual interest. That\u2019s what the world expects of responsible powers.\nSo we\u2019ll push for progress on priorities like the climate crisis, macroeconomic stability, public health.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to press the need to curb the flow of precursors that exacerbate fentanyl and synthetic opioids and the crisis that they pose.\u00a0 And I very much appreciate the leadership of this committee on this most urgent challenge for the United States.\nWe\u2019ve heard from members in both parties, on both sides of the Hill, that this unprecedented challenge requires an ambitious resource strategy.\u00a0 We very much agree.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the President\u2019s proposed FY2024 State Department budget aims to do: to give us the resources and the agility to advance our strategy.\nThis budget positions the United States to up our game in the Indo-Pacific: the frontline of our competition with China. \u00a0The Indo-Pacific is the most dynamic and fastest-growing region in the world \u2013 50 percent of the world\u2019s population, 60 percent of global GDP, eight of the top 15 U.S. export markets.\u00a0 It supports 3 million jobs here in the United States, provides about $900 billion in foreign direct investment to our country, and it\u2019s driven about 75 percent of global economic growth over the last five years.\u00a0 China, as it happens, invests a full 50 percent of its assistance and economic and diplomatic resources in the Indo-Pacific.\nOur budget proposal will allow us to further deepen our diplomatic footprint in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 from new missions in the Pacific Islands, to a surge of new positions in the region and beyond, including in the areas of greatest contestation with Beijing like technology, economics, and regional and international organizations.\nBeijing understands that diplomacy is a critical tool.\u00a0 It\u2019s why it\u2019s invested heavily in building up its own diplomatic capacity, its own diplomatic reach, and in fact it\u2019s increased its diplomatic budget last year at a faster rate than its military one.\u00a0 And today, it has more diplomatic posts around the world than the United States.\u00a0 If we\u2019re serious about this competition, we have to demonstrate the same diplomatic seriousness of purpose across the board.\nNow, we\u2019re not demanding that other countries \u201cchoose\u201d between us and China \u2013 but rather, we aim to offer a more attractive choice.\u00a0 If we can spark a race to the top, so much the better.\u00a0 That would be to everyone\u2019s benefit.\u00a0 Our budget sets us up to work with likeminded partners to strengthen our offer, and ensure it\u2019s relevant and responsive to the needs and aspirations of people around the world.\nThat\u2019s why the budget includes $2 billion in new investments in high-quality, sustainable infrastructure, rather than low-quality, opaque, extractive projects that leave countries mired in debt.\nIt would invest $2 billion to bolster Indo-Pacific economies and help the United States compete in areas where the PRC currently dominates and in key priorities for the region, including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean energy, digital technology, underseas communications cables, critical mineral mining.\nAnd it contains over $7 billion to extend our economic engagement with the Freely Associated States via the Compacts of Free Association.\u00a0 That\u2019s a critical component of our Indo-Pacific and National Security Strategy.\nAltogether, these funding streams ensure that we can meet a generational challenge and demonstrate our long-term commitment on issues that matter most to key countries in the region \u2013 so that the United States remains the partner of choice.\nDuring this decisive decade, our efforts and investments \u2013 together with our partners \u2013 will determine whether we succeed in advancing our shared affirmative vision for the international system, or whether the PRC can erode or replace the global rules and norms that guarantee peace, security, and stability in the world.\nI\u2019m grateful for this committee\u2019s partnership to sustain the resources and policies required by this challenge and very much look forward to taking your questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-on-the-2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken On the 2022 Report on International Religious Freedom\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Treaty Room", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 15, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Twenty-five years ago, President Clinton signed the International Religious Freedom Act into law.\u00a0 And that gave us a range of new tools to give voice to the persecuted, to empower advocates, to promote religious freedom around the world.\nAt that time, President Clinton noted that freedom of religion was a bedrock American belief.\u00a0 And he said that, and I quote, \u201cWhen we promote religious freedom, we also promote freedom of expression, conscience, and association, and other human rights.\u201d\u00a0 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms this same interdependence.\nReligious freedom is also vital to stable, secure societies.\u00a0 When each person is respected for their beliefs, they are more empowered to reach their full potential, which in turn lifts entire communities and societies.\nToday the State Department is releasing the 2022 International Religious Freedom Report, which provides a fact-based, comprehensive view of the state of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world.\u00a0 This report wouldn\u2019t be possible without the contributions of our civil society partners around the globe who help to shine a spotlight on abuses and advocate for victims of religious persecution.\u00a0 We are grateful for their vital work.\nThis report assesses the actions of countries that are our partners and those with whom we have disagreements, evaluating all by the same standards.\u00a0 Its aim is to highlight areas where freedom of religion or belief is being repressed, to promote accountability, and ultimately drive progress toward a world where freedom of religion or belief is a reality for everyone everywhere.\nOver the past year we\u2019ve seen real progress in some parts of the world on expanding religious freedom as people demanded their rights.\u00a0 Civil society groups pushed for change and governments listened.\nBelgium formally recognized its Buddhist minority, which entitles Buddhist religious organizations to teach their faith in state schools and eventually to apply for federal funding to do so.\nLawmakers in Brazil codified religious freedom guarantees for Afro-Brazilian indigenous communities at the municipal and state levels across the country.\u00a0 They also passed legislation making it a crime carry out discriminatory acts against any religious practices.\nCanada and the European Union both created new offices to combat Islamophobia, while Croatia appointed its first special advisor for combatting anti-Semitism.\nIn the Central African Republic, the country\u2019s special criminal court continue to prosecute cases of religious-based violence and other human rights violations against civilians since the military coup in 2003.\nAnd more broadly, civil society and other concerned governments around the world have successfully secured the release of many who\u2019ve been detained, even imprisoned, for exercising their freedom of religion or belief.\nNow, that\u2019s the positive news.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the report also documents the continuation and, in some instances, the rise of very troubling trends.\u00a0 Governments in many parts of the world continue to target religious minorities using a host of methods, including torture, beatings, unlawful surveillance, and so-called re-education camps.\u00a0 They also continued to engage in other forms of discrimination on the basis of faith or lack of faith, like excluding religious minorities from certain professions or forcing them to work during times of religious observance.\nGovernments use anti-conversion, blasphemy, apostasy laws, which ban the act of leaving a faith, to justify harassment against those who don\u2019t follow their particular interpretation of a theology, often weaponizing those laws against humanists, atheists, and LGBTQI+ individuals.\nAround the world, citizens and civil society organizations stepped up to counter these acts, often at great personal risk.\u00a0 NGOs like Campaign for Uyghurs and Uyghur Human Rights Project are documenting the genocide and crimes against humanity against predominately Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China.\nHuman rights defenders are sounding the alarm on attacks on the Catholic Church by the Ortega-Murillo regime in Nicaragua.\u00a0 Lawyer Martha Patricia Molina Montenegro\u2019s reporting exposed more than 160 attacks against the church and its members since \u2013 in 2022, from desecrations to arbitrary arrests.\u00a0 One of those unjustly detained was Rolando Alvarez, a bishop who criticized the regime\u2019s crackdown on civil and religious liberties and was promptly labeled a \u201ctraitor to the homeland\u201d and sentenced to 26 years in jail.\nPeople across Iran, led by young women, continue peaceful protests demanding their human rights, including freedom of religion, galvanized by the killing of Masa Amini, who was arrested by the so-called morality police because her hijab did not fully cover her hair.\nAmidst the Burma military regime\u2019s ongoing repression of religious minorities, thousands of teachers from Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, and other religious backgrounds continue to teach the importance of human rights, including religious freedom and respect between religions.\nThe United States will continue to stand with and support these brave advocates for religious freedom.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep advocating for religious freedom in countries where the rights are under attack, both publicly and directly in our engagement with government officials.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep working to defend and promote religious freedom here at home, including through the interagency group that President Biden created in December to combat religious bias and discrimination.\nWe defend the right to believe or to not believe, not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because of the extraordinary good that people of faith can do in our societies and around the world to promote peace, to care for the sick, to protect our planet, to expand opportunity for underserved communities, and so much more.\nSo this is an enduring commitment of this administration.\u00a0 This report released today reflects the picture that we see \u2013 saw emerge in 2022, but we are acting on the findings and observations of the report every single day in our efforts around the world to advance freedom of religion and belief.\nThe person who is leading our efforts in that regard is Ambassador Rashad Hussain.\u00a0 It is my pleasure to turn the podium over to him now.\u00a0 Rashad.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR HUSSAIN:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to thank President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Secretary Blinken for their sincere commitments and strong leadership of our global efforts to advance freedom of religion or belief for all people.\u00a0 Let me also take a moment to express my gratitude to our dedicated colleagues at the office of international religious freedom and U.S. embassies and consulates around the world for their remarkable work.\u00a0 They assemble and draft this report after engaging directly with governments, with civil society, and faith actors of every background, and by conducting their own meticulous research.\u00a0 And they are motivated by their unshakable commitment to the idea that saving even one person or improving even one life is well worth their effort.\nThis historic year marks a quarter century since the passage of the International Religious Freedom Act.\u00a0 During these 25 years, the report has served as an invaluable tool for anyone seeking to understand and address religious freedom conditions in any country around the world.\u00a0 So if you ever wonder whether the religious persecution of any group in any part of the world escapes our attention, the answer is in the country-by-country analysis in this report.\nThe role of the International Religious Freedom Office is to work with governments and civil society to expose, counter, and prevent restrictions on religious freedom.\u00a0 The report helps us tailor our diplomatic strategies to the circumstances in particular countries and to inform our policy decisions, and it identifies positive actions as well and trends that we will seek to support.\nNone of this work, of course, is possible without the tenacious leadership of civil society, including the dedicated leaders who are joining us today.\u00a0 So thank you so much for your partnership.\nI\u2019d like to share some key findings from this year\u2019s report regarding religious discrimination and hatred at the governmental and societal levels and describe what we are doing to address it.\nFirst, far too many governments continue to freely target faith community members within their borders.\u00a0 Russia, a Country of Particular Concern for the second year in a row, continues to target faith communities within its borders and beyond.\u00a0 Brave people of faith in Russia who dare to speak against its brutal war against Ukraine are targeted for repression.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China seized, imprisoned, and banished predominantly Muslim Uyghurs to re-education camps.\u00a0 They continue the repression of Tibetan Buddhists, Chinese Christians, and Falun Gong practitioners \u2013 many of whom are fleeing the PRC\u2019s abuses.\nIn Afghanistan, members of communities that do not toe the Taliban\u2019s narrow theological line must hide their religious identity or flee for their lives.\u00a0 In Saudi Arabia, we recognize the important recent moves to increase interfaith dialogue and religious tolerance.\u00a0 Publicly practicing any faith other than Islam, however, remains illegal.\nIn India, legal advocates and faith leaders from across the country\u2019s diverse religious communities condemned a case of extreme hate speech against Muslims in the city of Haridwar, calling for the country to uphold its historical traditions of pluralism and tolerance.\u00a0 And the Burma military regime continues to repress the Rohingya population, causing many to flee their homes.\nOur report also describes our response.\u00a0 We address these concerns directly with governments.\u00a0 We meet with and listen to victims.\u00a0 We partner with civil society and we also urge other countries and multilateral organizations to speak up, to build coalitions, and decry violations and abuses of the freedom of religion or belief.\nAs we do this work of advocating for people all around the world, we are sometimes asked:\u00a0 Who are you as the United States to speak to other countries about their human rights conditions?\u00a0 Well, I believe that we are uniquely situated to stand up for religious freedom around the world for a number of reasons.\u00a0 First of all, we are ourselves a country founded on religious freedom, founded by individuals fleeing religious persecution themselves.\u00a0 They felt so strongly about this right that they enshrined it in the First Amendment in our Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights.\u00a0 And we are a country of immigrants.\u00a0 People come to the United States from all around the world and demand that their elected representatives and government official promote our values in their homelands.\u00a0 They would have it no other way.\u00a0 So who are we to stand up for religious freedom around the world?\u00a0 In many ways we are representatives of the rest of the world gathered here in the United States.\u00a0 And we also don\u2019t walk away from discussing our efforts to form a more perfect union here at home.\nA second theme and trend the report highlights is the increase of government restrictions on access to holy sites and places of worship.\u00a0 We have all seen the sad pictures of Ukraine\u2019s civilians sifting through the rubble of their beautiful and most historic churches destroyed by Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression.\u00a0 Uyghurs have witnessed the PRC Government destroy or repurpose their mosques or cemeteries.\u00a0 Authorities also destroy the monasteries of Tibetan Buddhists and expelled monks and nuns.\nOn my trip to Jerusalem and the West Bank last month, I joined services at al-Aqsa Mosque, attended the Holy Fire Ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and visited the Western Wall during the convergence of Ramadan, Orthodox Easter, and Passover.\u00a0 I sat down with government leaders as well as leaders of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities to discuss the importance of religious coexistence and protecting access to these religious sites.\nThird, many countries continue to legislate and enforce apostasy, blasphemy, and anti\u2011conversion laws and related polices.\u00a0 These laws are direct attacks on the right to freedom of religion or belief.\u00a0 They criminalize religious expression and justify discrimination and harassment against members of minority religious groups or others who do not conform with the dictates of the approved theology.\nFourth, the report shines a light on the need for governments to ensure equal access to primary services for all, including education.\u00a0 Despite the near universal consensus among Islamic scholars regarding the right to education for women and girls, the Taliban in the name of religion continues to rob women and girls of this fundamental right.\u00a0 In Nigeria, yesterday Leah Sharibu turned 20 years old but remains captive to the Islamic State in West Africa Province after being kidnapped six years ago.\nOn the sidelines of last year\u2019s UN General Assembly, I unveiled Pathways to Respect, an effort that highlights the importance of educational initiatives to prevent and combat hatred.\u00a0 Many of these efforts, such as the 2016 Marrakesh Declaration play a critical role in educating public broadly, not just in the formalistic classroom setting; on the rights of religious minorities.\u00a0 I would be remiss not to mention the countless young people who have been forced to flee their homes based on their beliefs regarding religion and find themselves locked out of any educational at all.\u00a0 I had the opportunity to visit some of them in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.\nFinally, in addition to discriminatory laws and policies, the report describes growing bigotry at the societal level in many places around the world.\u00a0 Let me note the ongoing and deeply disturbing proliferation of anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim hatred, and xenophobia that target religious and non-religious communities.\u00a0 We are seeing increasing links between these forms of hatred and between those who propagate them at home and abroad.\u00a0 Earlier this year, I traveled with Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt to the Holocaust sites on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.\u00a0 We continue to participate in the White House-led interagency effort to combat anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hatred.\u00a0 And on March 15th, the anniversary of the Christchurch massacre, the United States joined with countries around the world on the First International Day to Combat Islamophobia.\nDespite the challenges we face, and in many ways because of these shared challenges, defenders of human rights are building a global movement to respond.\u00a0 The 42 members of the International Religious Freedom of Belief \u2013 or belief \u2013 Freedom of Belief Alliance[i]\u00a0collaborate to call for the release of prisoners of conscience, advocate for laws promoting religious freedom, and partner with civil society to promote respect and tolerance around the world.\nThe International Contact Group and civil society coalitions of religious, non-religious, humanitarian, and development organizations cast light on religious freedom violations.\u00a0 They give voice to those who are locked away or forcibly disappeared.\u00a0 And in London last July, I had the honor to join thousands from countries around the world at the International Religious Freedom or Belief ministerial.\u00a0 The Czech Republic will serve as this year\u2019s host.\nReligion can be such a powerful force for good in the world.\u00a0 Societies who seek to restrict it or use it to

Blinken At the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement Ceremony\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "National Academy of Sciences", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 11, 2023", "content": "\n\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Vilsack, Ambassador Branstad, and distinguished guests, my name is Ramin Toloui, Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs here at the State Department.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a pleasure to welcome you to the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement Ceremony.\nFor more than 30 years, the World Food Prize has recognized individuals who advance the cause of food security and nutrition around the world, and the State Department\u2019s collaboration with the World Food Prize goes back more than 20 years, actually to one of my predecessors and fellow Iowan Al Larson.\nAnd in 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell participated in this announcement ceremony.\u00a0 And the reason is the same as the reason that the Nobel Committee awarded Norman Borlaug the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970: food security is essential to global welfare, security, and peace, and elevating and celebrating the individuals whose scholarship, leadership, and activism advance the cause of global food security benefits us all \u2013 Americans and people around the world.\nAnd it\u2019s not about just the prize itself.\u00a0 Concurrent with the award ceremony in October, Des Moines also hosts the Borlaug Dialogue, which brings together scholars and practitioners for panels and seminars dedicated to the various critical food security issues the world faces today.\nAt last year\u2019s dialogue, it was a particular delight for me to meet the USDA Borlaug Fellows.\u00a0 These are young scholars from around the world who are selected to come to the United States and spend time at U.S. universities around our country on research collaborations, and so I met scholars from Egypt, Philippines, Tunisia, Algeria.\u00a0 And what was so exhilarating was getting to hear their passion for the problems that they were working on that came from their experiences in their local communities.\nAnd the idea that they would come to the United States, spend time at research organizations, and then take back to their communities the knowledge that can help solve the problems that are important to their lives was really what it was \u2013 what this collaboration \u2013 what the Borlaug Dialogue was all about.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just the \u201cwhat\u201d; it\u2019s the \u201chow\u201d through these global partnerships, and that\u2019s something that Norman Borlaug believed in very deeply.\nOn a personal note, as a native of Iowa City and fourth generation Iowan myself, it was rewarding to see the excitement of these young scholars and welcome them to my home state.\nSo with that, let\u2019s get down to it.\u00a0 Now, to introduce the new World Food Prize Foundation President and Former U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, I welcome World Food Prize Foundation COO Mashal Husain to the stage.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS HUSAIN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you Assistant Secretary Toloui for your very gracious introduction.\u00a0 To all our guests here this morning,\u00a0khushamdeed.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the manner in which friends are greeted in my country of heritage, Pakistan.\u00a0 Dr. Norman Borlaug often heard this phrase of welcome from farmers in the villages of Punjab, working to increase food production and prevent famine across South Asia.\u00a0\u00a0Khushamdeed\u00a0to all of you and welcome to the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Announcement.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMy own lifelong cross-cultural journey has taken me from my native Pakistan to living in Tanzania, the Philippines, and in Thailand and has ultimately brought me to the place from which Dr. Borlaug\u2019s \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d emanated, Iowa, where I found my purpose at the World Food Prize.\nSecretary Blinken, on behalf of our president, Ambassador Terry Branstad, Janis Ruan, and the entire Ruan family, as well as our board chair Paul Schickler, and our counsel of advisors, I want to thank you and your exceptional State Department staff for your invaluable collaboration.\nThis special gathering continues the tradition that began in 2004, when the first laureate announcement was held in partnership with the State Department.\u00a0 As a special surprise that year for Dr. Borlaug, who had just celebrated his 90th birthday, the State Department presented a cake with 90 candles.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He blew out the candles and made a wish.\u00a0 When asked what he wished for, he replied that this ceremony could take place with the State Department every year.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So Mr. Secretary, today, you are still making Dr. Borlaug\u2019s wish come true.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I know Julie Borlaug, his granddaughter who is here, is especially grateful to you and to Secretary Vilsack for your instrumental roles in carrying forward his legacy and this wonderful tradition.\nThe World Food Prize promotes Dr. Borlaug\u2019s legacy of global peace through agriculture and champions the values that drive us to create a better world.\u00a0 We do so by holding our annual Borlaug Dialogue addressing critical and cutting-edge conversations in food security.\u00a0 We do so by inspiring our next generation of agricultural innovators and by awarding our World Food Prize.\nSince 1987, 52 laureates from 21 countries and the United Nations have been recognized for their achievements in confronting hunger, poverty, and malnutrition.\u00a0 Now to reveal our 53rd World Food Prize laureate, it is my great honor to introduce the president of the World Food Prize, former U.S. ambassador to China, and the longest-serving governor in the history of the United States, Ambassador Terry Branstad.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR BRANSTAD:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mashal, for that very kind introduction.\u00a0 Thank you to Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack, for joining us for this very important celebration.\nWe are grateful to all of you for the strong partnership between the World Food Prize Foundation, the State Department, and the Department of Agriculture.\u00a0 This laureate announcement is a great legacy of collaboration which dates back nearly 20 years.\u00a0 Thank you also to all the members of the Iowa congressional delegation, many of which are here with us today, to support. Your support is also very much appreciated.\u00a0 I would especially like to thank the Greater Des Moines Partnership and Jay Byers, who\u2019s joined us today along with his team.\u00a0 This is the most Iowans that I\u2019ve seen in Washington, D.C. \u2013 (laughter and applause) \u2013 the most Iowans in Washington, D.C. since we dedicated the statue of Norman Borlaug in Statuary Hall in 2014 on his 100th birthday.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI am thrilled to be attending my first laureate announcement and I\u2019m honored to be here with all of you.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always been a strong supporter and advocate for the World Food Prize Foundation and served as governor when Dr. Borlaug partnered with Iowa businessman and philanthropist John Ruan, Sr. to move the World Food Prize to Des Moines.\u00a0 There wouldn\u2019t be a World Food Prize today if it were not for the ongoing commitment and vision of the Ruan family.\u00a0 We are very grateful for their dedication to this important work.\nAmbassador Quinn is also with us today in the front row.\u00a0 He is responsible for taking the World Food Prize Foundation to the very successful progress it\u2019s made over the last 25 years.\u00a0 Ambassador Quinn, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAll of us Iowans are proud of our native son, Norman Borlaug.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug and I are both of Norwegian heritage, and we share roots on farms in northern Iowa.\u00a0 In fact, Dr. Borlaug grew up on a farm in Howard County, and I grew up on a farm just two counties away in Winnebago County.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his lifetime of work to feed a hungry world.\u00a0 He is the guiding light behind the World Food Prize, which honors significant achievements in improving the world\u2019s food supply.\u00a0 Dr. Borlaug\u2019s granddaughter, Julie, is here with us today.\u00a0 Julie, thank you for continuing your grandfather\u2019s legacy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI also want to thank Dr. Gebisa Ejeta, who is the 2009 laureate, for his service as chair of the independent group of experts who select the World Food Prize laureates.\nToday, I have the honor of announcing the 2023 World Food Prize laureate.\u00a0\u00a0 Our 53rd laureate has built a model of work directly with farmers to restore farmland and food security after devastating conflict.\u00a0 Through this work, she has shown more than a million people living in war-torn regions a way forward to restoring peace and prosperity through agriculture.\nHere\u2019s how it works.\u00a0 First she partners with demining organizations to clear land mines.\u00a0 Then she works with farmers to replant fields with modern agriculture practices.\u00a0 Our laureate has worked in nine countries to confront the daunting challenge of rebuilding food systems and livelihoods after conflict.\u00a0 She started by partnering with wineries in her home state of California to raise funds to remove land mines in Croatia and replant vineyards and orchards.\u00a0 Then she took this model to Afghanistan.\u00a0 After clearing land mines there, she helped farmers \u2013 including more than 5,000 women \u2013 produce high-quality crops.\u00a0 She built agriculture value chains and provided market support and development.\nHer organization is one of the few U.S. non-profits that\u2019s still operating in Afghanistan.\u00a0 In Vietnam, she partnered with the State Department and with others to clear unexploded bombs, making it possible to plant more than 1.6 million black pepper trees.\u00a0 Her work shows the world the vital role agriculture must have in the resilient recovery from conflict and restoration and peace.\nFor making her mission to turn mines to vines, I am so pleased to announce that the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate is Heidi K\u00fchn.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHeidi K\u00fchn is the founder and CEO of the non-profit Roots of Peace.\u00a0 We are pleased to have here with us her husband Gary and one of her four children, her son Tucker.\u00a0 Thank you to the K\u00fchn family.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYeah, stand up.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nToday, Heidi is actually in Azerbaijan.\u00a0 As we speak, she\u2019s working in Azerbaijan to remove land mines \u2013 which is her Mother\u2019s Day tradition.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI want to also welcome Ambassador Ibrahim from Azerbaijan, who I think is also here.\u00a0 Ambassador, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 An honor to have you and many other ambassadors here.\nIt will be our honor to present the World Food Prize at the beautiful Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines on October 26th.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 This will culminate the event of the 2023 International Borlaug Dialogue from October 24th through the 26th, which will be held in person as well as virtually.\u00a0 Our theme this year is \u201cHarnessing Change.\u201d\nAgain, I want to say thanks to all of you for coming today.\u00a0 I hope to see you all in Des Moines in October \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as we celebrate our 2023 laureate.\u00a0 Again, thank you for being here, and\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to Heidi K\u00fchn as our new laureate.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR FOWLER:\u00a0 Good morning.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Good morning.\nMR FOWLER:\u00a0 I\u2019m Cary Fowler.\u00a0 I\u2019m the Special Envoy for Global Food Security, and I feel like I should say I\u2019m not from Iowa.\u00a0 I think I\u2019m the first one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The office of secretary of state is not where you would expect to find a farmer sitting behind the desk.\u00a0 And indeed, I \u2013 not sure that there has been one sitting behind that desk since the first secretary of state, who was Thomas Jefferson.\u00a0 Jefferson famously said that the greatest service that can be rendered to any country is to add a new crop to its cultivation.\u00a0 Norman Borlaug, the inspiration for the World Food Prize, effectively did that by giving new life and added productivity to one of the world\u2019s oldest staple crops: wheat.\nSeveral weeks ago, our next speaker appeared before a Senate committee, and among other things \u2013 after all, it was, I think, a hearing that lasted several hours \u2013 mentioned the importance of adapting crops and the importance of soil fertility to food security.\u00a0 I can imagine that both Thomas Jefferson and Norman Borlaug would have approved.\nIn our community, Mr. Secretary, it\u2019s a high honor to be mentioned in the same sentence with Thomas Jefferson and Norman Borlaug, but that honor belongs to you.\u00a0 It belongs to you for the priority that you\u2019ve given to combatting food insecurity, the guiding spirit behind the World Food Prize.\nSo it\u2019s my privilege to introduce my boss and our Secretary of State, Antony Blinken to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Welcome to Iowa Day.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 This is a shameless promotion for the state.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I\u2019m glad that Cary mentioned that he\u2019s not from Iowa because I was going to ask: Is there anyone here who is not from Iowa?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And it turns out that apparently, Cary, you and I are probably the only people who are not, although maybe we should do a little bit of digging into the birth records to find out.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut thank you, my friend, for that truly lovely introduction, humbling introduction.\u00a0 To you, to Under Secretary Jose Fernandez, Assistant Secretary Toloui, to the entire team in our Office of Agricultural Policy, thank you for what you\u2019re doing every single day to fight global hunger.\nAnd it\u2019s particularly inspiring to be here with many of the people who are leading what is a whole-of-government mission to advance our commitment to food security.\u00a0 Agriculture Secretary Vilsack, USAID Assistant Administrator Dina Esposito, and many of members of Congress who are with us today, it\u2019s wonderful to have you here, wonderful to have your partnership in this absolutely essential \u2013 it\u2019s hard to think of a more essential \u2013 effort that we make around the world.\nAnd Ambassador Branstad \u2013 maybe I should say governor because once a governor, always a governor, especially if you happen to the longest-serving governor in the history of the United States.\u00a0 And Secretary Vilsack, Governor Vilsack, the longest-serving Democratic governor in the State of Iowa.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nBut Terry, thank you to you, to everyone at the World Food Prize Foundation for the absolutely vital work that you\u2019re doing to inspire action and support outstanding individuals who are improving global food security, including, of course, this year\u2019s remarkable laureate, Heidi K\u00fchn.\nIt\u2019s wonderful that members of her family are here.\u00a0 I thought how inspiring that someone who has just won one of the most significant awards any of us can give can\u2019t be here.\u00a0 Because what is she doing?\u00a0 She\u2019s actually doing her work in the field, helping to remove landmines in Azerbaijan.\u00a0 I think that in and of itself is an extraordinary tribute to Heidi and the work that she does.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo as you\u2019ve heard, for more than 25 years, Heidi has led a movement to remove landmines from former conflict zones and plant crops in their place \u2013 turning fields of death into gardens of life.\nIn total, by harnessing the collective power of governments, businesses, international organizations, Heidi\u2019s non-profit, Roots of Peace, has, as you\u2019ve heard, removed over 100,000 landmines.\u00a0\u00a0 And not just removed them \u2013 this is what\u2019s so extraordinarily powerful \u2013 restored the land that is now being used by over a million farmers across nine countries, helping to feed people and create economic opportunity for so many.\nNow, we know that today conflict remains the largest single driver of food insecurity.\u00a0 The ten worst food crises in the world have all been caused or worsened by conflict.\u00a0 Seventy percent of the hungriest people in the world live in regions that are affected by war and by violence.\u00a0 And, often, even when the violence ends, hunger remains.\nOver the last year, millions more have been affected by conflict beyond their borders, as the Kremlin has tried to leverage food as a weapon in its aggression against Ukraine.\nFood insecurity, of course, is also being worsened by other intersecting challenges \u2013 COVID\u201119 and its disruption of global food supply chains and the climate crisis that\u2019s killing crops around the world.\u00a0 Hundreds of millions of people face food insecurity across our planet.\nSo for me, for the State Department, this is of course first and foremost a human issue, but it\u2019s also a national security issue, as well as an economic issue.\u00a0 In the United States, we are deeply committed to addressing it on all of these fronts.\nWe\u2019ve long been the largest single donor of global food assistance, something that I\u2019m immensely proud of.\u00a0 Last year, we contributed $13.5 billion to these efforts \u2013 when we had the Russian aggression exacerbate the problem, we doubled down on what we were doing.\u00a0 We provide more than 40 percent of the World Food Programme\u2019s budget every year.\nWe\u2019re also working to sustain the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has facilitated the delivery of more than 29 million metric tons of food from Ukraine to the global market since July.\u00a0 Now, this initiative never should have been necessary in the first place.\u00a0 It never should have been necessary because Russia should not have invaded Ukraine.\u00a0 It never should have been necessary because once Russia invaded Ukraine, it shouldn\u2019t have gotten into the business of blockading Ukraine\u2019s ports and preventing food from going around the world to people who desperately need it.\u00a0 Nonetheless, it was necessary.\nThe United Nations, T\u00fcrkiye did an extraordinary job in helping to set it up.\u00a0 But the fact that it succeeded over the last months in getting so much grain to so many places around the world is a very powerful thing.\u00a0 This includes eight million tons of wheat.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of roughly 16 billion loaves of bread, most of which has gone to low-income countries, including under the auspices of the World Food Programme.\nJust as we\u2019re focused on the acute humanitarian challenge of hunger, we\u2019re also addressing long-term food insecurity \u2013 including by working closely with partners across the globe.\u00a0 Because none of us can solve this complex problem alone, and also because what I\u2019ve heard time and again, especially from engaging with my counterparts around the world \u2013 foreign ministers from Africa and other places \u2013 is again and again:\u00a0 Yes, we need, we\u2019re grateful for emergency assistance, but what we most want is the ability to sustain the production for ourselves.\u00a0 And so the more that we can contribute to that, the more that we can help countries build resilient, sustaining productive capacity, that really is the objective.\nWe\u2019ve heard from partners again and again:\u00a0 Emergency food aid cannot be the only solution. And so we are investing in sustainable, long-term food production.\nLast May, we helped launch the Roadmap for Global Food Security, which calls on countries to fight hunger for generations to come \u2013 not just next month, not just next year, but for generations to come.\u00a0 Today, more than 100 countries have signed on and pledged to take swift, concrete steps toward building stronger, more resilient food systems, from improving access to markets for farmers to boosting the productivity of crops.\nWe\u2019re putting a special focus on adapting agricultural to \u2013 agriculture to the changing environment that we\u2019re all experiencing.\u00a0 We\u2019re helping farmers learn techniques that make their crops more resilient.\u00a0 Dr. Fowler is doing extraordinary work, along with international organizations, researchers, and donors, to improve healthy soil and identify regional crops that can thrive in Africa despite climate change.\u00a0 This focus on soil and seeds is absolutely essential for the future.\nWe also expanded USAID\u2019s Feed the Future program last year, from 12 target countries to 20, which will help farmers produce more crops, raise healthier livestock, and grow their businesses.\u00a0 The work that USAID is doing every single day on the frontlines of this effort is absolutely central to our efforts.\nPartnerships \u2013 across governments, science, business \u2013 that\u2019s at the heart of so much of our work on food insecurity.\u00a0 It is critical to our success.\nAnd when it comes down to it, it\u2019s the pioneers and visionaries like Heidi K\u00fchn who are such a big part of this process.\u00a0 They bring a spirit of innovation to this work.\u00a0 They bring a spirit of determination to this work, and they are quite literally forging new paths toward progress.\nIt\u2019s of course a special honor to be in the long, extraordinary shadow of Norm Borlaug.\u00a0 Hard to think of a fellow citizen who\u2019s done more for the world over so many years.\u00a0 And Julie, a reference has been made to you.\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 Are you here with us today?\u00a0 And if so, stand up \u2013 if not, we send our greetings to you.\u00a0 We send our greetings to the entire family.\u00a0 The efforts that Norman made to make our planet a little bit more just, a little bit more stable, a little bit more peaceful.\nTo this year\u2019s winner of the prize, thank you for carrying on that extraordinary tradition.\u00a0 And thanks to all of you for being here today and for your efforts every single day to help feed our planet.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, thank you for those wonderful remarks.\u00a0 We now return to the Iowan portion of the programming.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And it\u2019s my honor to introduce another leader on food security here and abroad, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY VILSACK:\u00a0\u00a0When I ran for governor in 1998, I wore a sweatshirt that said: I wasn\u2019t born in Iowa, but I got here as fast as I could.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So Tony, Dr. Fowler, there\u2019s still hope.\u00a0\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIt\u2019s an honor to be here today to acknowledge the work of Heidi and Roots [of] Peace.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s somewhat of a framing device for the last month that I\u2019ve experienced as Secretary of Agriculture.\u00a0 Several weeks ago I was in Vietnam visiting with the prime minister about our relationship.\u00a0 And what a phenomenal experience it is to be in Vietnam, a person my age; to have the experience of being welcomed by a leader and have the conversation and discussion substantively talk about the important role of agriculture in building relationships and friendships between two countries who in a lifetime had been at war.\nIt was interesting to me because at the tail end of our conversation, after we\u2019d gotten through all of the trade issues and some of the substantive issues, the prime minister turned to me and he said, \u201cWe still need help.\u00a0 We still need help removing explosive devices from our fields.\u00a0 We still need the United States to work with us to allow our farmers the opportunity to farm.\u201d\u00a0 So Heidi\u2019s work obviously incredibly important and ongoing, tragically.\nI then traveled to Japan, another country at one point in time that we were at war, and had the opportunity to visit with the agricultural minister, whose first comment about the relationship between the United States and Japan was focused on the hog lift that Iowa farmers were engaged in when a tsunami hit Japan and wiped out their hog industry, and the importance and significance of that relationship that is still valued today.\u00a0 As Ambassador Branstad knows, we\u2019ve both been to Yamanashi, we both know how important that connection has been.\nAnd then I come back home, and this week we invited folks who are engaged in our AIM For Climate Initiative.\u00a0 Now, this is an initiative that is right down Norman Borlaug\u2019s sweet spot.\u00a0 It is about science, it\u2019s about innovation, it\u2019s about agriculture and the role of embracing and enabling farmers to continue to be productive, sustainable, and profitable.\u00a0 We welcomed the largest number of agricultural ministers that have ever assembled in Washington, D.C. \u2013 over 50 nations represented at our Aim For Climate Summit.\nAnd during the course of the conversations that we had with a number of noted guests, Norman Borlaug\u2019s name was mentioned, world food laureate prize \u2013 World Food Prize laureates\u2019 names were mentioned frequently, because there was a recognition and understanding that in order for us to deal with the existential challenge that we face in agriculture and in food security of continuing to be productive at a time when climate is changing and threatening our capacity to produce, it is science and innovation that is at the heart of how we\u2019re going to approach this issue.\nNorman had some great advice for policy makers, and that advice was take it to the farmer.\u00a0 If you provide farmers the information, if you provide them the resources, there isn\u2019t anything they can\u2019t do.\u00a0 There isn\u2019t any problem they can\u2019t solve when it comes to growing and raising food.\nIt\u2019s been an extraordinary journey, and the World Food Prize allows us every year in October to focus the world\u2019s attention on the importance of agriculture, on the importance of farmers, on the significant contribution they make not just to food security but to overall peace and security, as witnessed by the fact that we\u2019re now working with Vietnam, we\u2019ve always worked with Japan.\u00a0 And during the course of the G7 meeting that was in Japan, the minister from Ukraine came on by video and talked about the necessity and need that when this war ultimately is over \u2013 and we hope it is over as soon as possible \u2013 the expectation is that the United States of America will work collaboratively with Ukraine to rebuild their agricultural economy.\nSo in acknowledging Heidi\u2019s work, in acknowledging the work of the laureates in the past, we really live the opportunity to remind ourselves of the importance of vision; the importance of a man, Norman Borlaug, whose vision still today impacts our ability to produce; the vision of John Ruan and John Ruan\u2019s family in allowing this great opportunity to continue.\nSo I\u2019m pleased to be here today.\u00a0 I\u2019m pleased to acknowledge Heidi and her family for the work that they do.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known her for quite some time.\u00a0 The passion \u2013 the unfortunate thing was she\u2019s not here today, because if she were, you would understand and appreciate the passion that drives her.\u00a0 And that is the same passion that drove Norman Borlaug.\u00a0 It is the same passion that has driven every one of our laureates.\nSo this is a day of celebration, a day of acknowledgment of the work of one person to make a difference.\u00a0 But at the end of the day, it is ultimately a celebration of the power and significance of agriculture and of farmers everywhere in the world.\u00a0 And that is indeed a cause for great celebration.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Vilsack, for those remarks.\u00a0 It\u2019s now my honor to introduce Dina Esposito, assistant to the administrator for the International Development Bureau for Resilience and Food Security at the U.S. Agency for International Development and deputy coordinator of the Feed the Future program.\nDina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS ESPOSITO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Assistant Secretary Toloui, and good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be here with those of you in Washington, and welcome to those of you joining virtually online as well.\u00a0 I am thrilled to be here and to be adding my voice to those we\u2019ve heard today and celebrating the World Food Prize Laureate Heidi K\u00fchn.\u00a0 Heidi K\u00fchn\u2019s leadership of Roots [of] Peace has shown us how agriculture can be a peacebuilder in the wake of conflict, not only rebuilding food systems in economies but by restoring hope and helping survivors envision and move towards a brighter future.\u00a0 We don\u2019t actually always think about this connection, how agricultural development can spur peace.\u00a0 Roots of Peace has shown us that making this connection can lead to transformative results.\nFor 26 years, Heidi has been a thought leader, bridging peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance, and economic growth to show how agriculture can help people cope and sow the seeds of a positive future.\u00a0 In conflict zones there\u2019s a tendency to focus on the searing experience of the war itself, and we often forget that these zones are still places of possibility, where people live, work, raise their families; where smallholder farmers \u2013 many of them women \u2013 need to rebuild and sustain livelihoods despite cycles of conflict.\u00a0 We must keep this at the forefront of our efforts.\u00a0 More conflicts rage today than any time since the Cold War, and more people are displaced than ever before.\nAnd when conflict strikes, it severely disrupts agriculture and food systems.\u00a0 A farmer may not be able to plant or travel to markets.\u00a0 She may have to cope in dangerous ways \u2013 by eating less, feeding her children less, traveling farther afield for goods, or quickly selling off her assets.\u00a0 Wages, extension services, and inputs are adversely affected too.\u00a0 And all of this further damages farmers\u2019 ability to make the adjustment they need to adapt to a changing climate, further fueling vulnerability.\u00a0 The better we understand these connections, as Heidi K\u00fchn has, and the earlier we take action on them, the better we can achieve our shared goal of a more food-secure and peaceful world.\nConflict is the largest driver of global food insecurity worldwide.\u00a0 And as the world\u2019s provider \u2013 largest provider of humanitarian assistance, we at USAID often hear, as Secretary Blinken also said, this refrain in fragile and war-torn places:\u00a0 Thank you for the relief assistance, but please help us rebuild so we can take care of ourselves and our families.\u00a0 Because of visionary partners like Heidi and Roots of Peace, we are able to do just that, to integrate what are often siloed efforts of peacebuilding, conflict prevention, community resilience, and long-term development, bringing them together in a shared vision.\nAnd we\u2019re investing in lasting food security in communities around the world through the U.S. Government\u2019s Feed the Future global hunger initiative.\u00a0 USAID is proud to call Roots of Peace a partner in this work.\u00a0 In fact, this year marks 20 years since USAID and Roots [of] Peace first began working together.\u00a0 This was in Afghanistan, where decades of war left the country\u2019s farming infrastructure in ruins and its market linkages broken.\u00a0 Through Heidi and her team\u2019s efforts, smallholder farmers benefited from training, tools, and market support they needed to increase their harvests and their incomes.\nIt\u2019s just one among \u2013 one example among many of how Roots [of] Peace has shown us through their work that we can help sustain livelihoods, even in conflict-affected settings.\u00a0 It is this simple but powerful insight that Heidi K\u00fchn acted on so many years ago, and for which we and the world are profoundly grateful.\u00a0 Again, my thanks to Heidi for her groundbreaking work and well-deserved recognition as the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Dina.\u00a0 And to close our ceremony, I\u2019m pleased to welcome to the stage Jose Fernandez, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, to give closing remarks.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUNDER SECRETARY FERNANDEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Full disclosure:\u00a0 I\u2019m not from Iowa.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But two years ago, I participated in the race across Iowa, the RAGBRAI.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And for six days and nights in 100-plus degree weather, across 500 miles of soybeans and corn fields, I experienced the warmth and the hospitality of Iowans \u2013 hospitality and pork chops.\u00a0 (Laughter, applause.)\u00a0 And \u2013 I haven\u2019t had a pork chop since.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us today.\u00a0 Thank you to the World Food Prize Foundation for inviting us.\u00a0 And thank you to the National Academy of Sciences for allowing us to use this beautiful venue.\u00a0 I would like to add my congratulations to our winner, the 2022 [1] \u00a0prize laureate Heidi K\u00fchn for her amazing work, her courageous work in converting heavily mined war zones into healthy and productive agricultural lands.\u00a0 We at the State Department believe that we must make global food assistance more resilient in the face of armed conflicts such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while also responding to the critical threats that are posed by the climate crisis, climate crisis whose impact on global food security and global agriculture and fishery systems are increasingly severe.\u00a0 We\u2019re fortunate to have talented, far-seeing, innovative partners like Heidi K\u00fchn and the World Food Prize Foundation to help us tackle these twin challenges.\nAnd as we end today\u2019s ceremony, it should be clear to everyone who\u2019s here in person and also participating virtually how seriously the U.S. Government takes this issue \u2013 through pioneering\u00a0 climate-resilient and food security initiatives, what Cary Fowler is doing now at the State Department or working with government, with embassies, with companies, with researchers, with philanthropies around the world to drive investment and innovation towards our most pressing challenges.\u00a0 And we\u2019re grateful to the World Food Prize Foundation for this \u2013 for advancing these goals, as well as to everyone here in this room.\nLet me thank Secretary Blinken, Secretary Vilsack, my colleagues in EB, and Assistant Administrator Esposito for their personal engagement.\u00a0 I\u2019d also like to thank Ambassador Terry Branstad \u2013 thank you, sir \u2013 and the entire World Food Prize Foundation for their commitment to strengthening global food security and food systems.\nThe State Department and our government partners look forward to participating in the October Borlaug Dialogue in Des Moines \u2013 and I look forward to being there as well \u2013 and our efforts throughout the year to advance common objectives to build sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems.\nSo thank you again.\u00a0 Thank you again to everyone for joining us today, and once more,\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to the 2023 World Prize Laureate, Heidi K\u00fchn.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\u00a0\n[1] 2023\n\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s really wonderful to have my friend, the foreign minister, back at the State Department.\u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Manuel, welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to have you.\nAs always, with such a close ally and friend, there is no shortage of important issues that we\u2019re tackling together.\u00a0 And the conversation that we had today, not surprisingly, reflected that.\u00a0 We covered a lot of territory together, and let me just share some of the important points.\nOne of the areas we discussed was deepening our cooperation in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 Spain has long invested in expanding economic opportunity for people across the region, and it\u2019s a key partner in supporting implementation of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which brings a regional approach to promoting safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.\u00a0 We are grateful for Spain\u2019s commitment to work with us on these Regional Processing Centers that we\u2019re establishing, which will expand access to people in the Americas who seek safe and legal migration options to come to the United States and potentially to Spain.\nThese innovative centers will allow people to stay in their own countries and determine their eligibility for lawful pathways to the United States, making them less likely to undertake the dangerous and costly journey to the border to seek asylum.\u00a0 And the centers will be a referral point for humanitarian refugee protections in other countries, including Spain.\u00a0 Spain has already received hundreds of thousands of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean.\u00a0 It\u2019s committed to increase the number of people that it accepts from the region.\u00a0 Madrid recently created an innovative new pathway itself that will work with the private sector to match the skills of people seeking protection with the needs of Spanish businesses.\nI also thanked Jos\u00e9 Manuel for Madrid\u2019s unwavering support and partnership with and for Ukraine as it defends its people and its territory against Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression.\u00a0 Spain\u2019s assistance has come in all forms: robust military aid, including the recent revision of Leopard 2 tanks; air defense systems; ammunition; humanitarian aid, including ambulances specially equipped to tend to the needs of women and girls; and of course, the generosity of the Spanish people, who have now welcomed more than 173,000 displaced Ukrainians into their communities.\nSpain has made clear that marshaling ongoing support for Ukraine \u2013 and for the principles at the heart of the United Nations Charter, including respect for a nation\u2019s sovereignty, territorial independence \u2013 will be a central focus of its upcoming presidency of the Council of the European Union.\u00a0 This is just one of the many ways that Spain is demonstrating leadership in rallying allies and partners around our shared interests and shared values.\nSpain has also played a key role in shaping the Strategic Concept that we and our allies adopted at the Madrid Summit of NATO that sets out a vision for strengthening transatlantic security in the face of unprecedented challenges.\u00a0 And Madrid has led by example in delivering on the commitments we made in deploying additional troops to bolster NATO\u2019s eastern flank, to strengthen the defenses of our Alliance.\nWe also discussed how to strengthen our longstanding efforts to defend and promote human rights.\u00a0 And to that end, we\u2019re very pleased, as we just did, to welcome Spain to the Global Equality Fund, a partnership between governments and the private sector to support those on the front lines of advancing the human rights of the LGBTQI community and people around the world.\nWith Jos\u00e9 Manuel\u2019s signature, Spain becomes now the 18th government to join this effort, which has dedicated over $100 million to civil society organizations and human rights defenders in more than 100 countries.\u00a0 Every year, that support takes the form of training and tools that make local advocates safer and more effective, and emergency assistance and legal aid to human rights defenders and LGBTQI+ persons who face violence and abuse because of who they are, who they love, or what they do.\u00a0 Our efforts are helping to change the views of individuals and communities, and chipping away at enduring prejudice and abuse.\u00a0 We will be even stronger with Spain as a partner.\nWe also touched upon a number of other important issues of mutual concern, including shared concern about the situation in the Sahel and the work we can do there together to help stabilize countries that are in very difficult situations.\u00a0 We engaged on a number of issues relating to Spain\u2019s upcoming presidency of the European Union.\u00a0 And of course, we discussed how we can build on our cooperation across all of these priorities and many others when President Biden hosts President S\u00e1nchez at the White House later this week.\nThis includes accelerating our joint efforts to cut carbon emissions and increase energy security, expanding inclusive economic opportunities, fostering entrepreneurship, and deepening our educational exchanges and scientific collaboration \u2013 something we spent some time discussing today \u2013 all priorities that will benefit the people of our nations and people around the world.\u00a0 With that, Jos\u00e9 Manuel, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) First of all, I would like to thank Tony Blinken for his hospitality and warmth during this trip to Washington.\u00a0 The Secretary of State is a good friend with whom I have had several meetings already, and these meetings have always been extremely fruitful for the relationship between our two countries.\u00a0 Spain and the U.S. share values and interests, such as the fight against climate change, preserving the environment, defending democracy and human rights.\u00a0 And on the international stage, we defend an international rule-based order and we work together on this within NATO, the G20, the UN, organizations in which we share the defense of these common values.\u00a0 These are the foundations upon which our relationship is based, and we would like to continue to build upon this to create stronger ties in the future.\nIn May, we signed the Madrid Declaration.\u00a0 This was the first U.S.-Spain declaration signed in two decades, which has strengthened our bilateral relationship even more in many areas.\u00a0 And one year later, the excellent state of our bilateral relationship is shown with the meeting that we just had and the meeting that our president of government will hold with President Biden this Friday.\nThis bilateral relationship is based on many ties: our businesses, which have a significant presence in both countries; our universities, who cooperate very closely; and we are also united by the strengths of our languages.\u00a0 We have talked about many of these issues, areas of cooperation today \u2013 our defense cooperation, our migration agreement via which Spain and the U.S. will work together in order to promote safe, humane, orderly, and regular migration from Latin American countries.\u00a0 We discussed Palomares as well as the renewal of the Scientific Cooperation Agreement to continue to promote working together with NASA, especially the Artemis program.\u00a0 We just signed an MOU to work together in one additional area: protecting the human rights of LGBTQI people through the world Equality Forum.\nWe unfortunately for many months have done \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the unjust, illegal war against Ukraine, and we talked about the transatlantic ties that tie the U.S. and Europe.\u00a0 Regarding the situation in Ukraine, I have discussed with Secretary Blinken the unconditional support of Spain as long as necessary with that country.\u00a0 We support Ukraine in its defense against the violation of its territorial sovereignty.\u00a0 This will \u2013 we will maintain this until peace comes once again to the borders of Ukraine and Ukraine is able to recover total sovereignty.\nWe also discussed how the Sahel is increasingly \u2013 has increasing geostrategic importance.\u00a0 We have discussed in NATO the threats that come from the southern flank, and we will continue to work to strengthen stability and development in the Sahel and coordinate our cooperation missions via AECID and USAID.\nThe transatlantic unity is key.\u00a0 It\u2019s always key, but it\u2019s even more so in moments like these \u2013 unity among Europeans, but also transatlantic unity with the U.S., which is a natural ally to Spain in many areas: health, energy, food security.\u00a0 In all of these areas, cooperation with the United States is vital.\nWe also spoke of the next EU summit during the presidency of Spain.\u00a0 This will be one of our priorities because we think that the entire Atlantic should become closer.\u00a0 There must be closer ties between our shores and we must create more stability and growth.\nIn sum, I would like to once again thank you for your hospitality, Tony.\u00a0 We will continue to work on these foundations of our relationship of friendship and cooperation, and that is why this week will culminate, then, with the meeting between President Biden and President S\u00e1nchez, which will show once again the excellent relationship that binds our countries.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Andrea Mitchell from NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister and Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good to see you, Andrea.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, as you know, China is the largest holder of U.S. debt.\u00a0 With the gridlock now in Washington, are you concerned that China and Russia will try to take advantage of the economic chaos that could ensue here and the gridlock right now, and that would damage the credibility of American democracy and economic power around the world?\nAnd I\u2019d also like to ask you what your message is to U.S. companies \u2013 companies working in China that are being raided by the police under their new law, their counterespionage law, that accuses them of espionage for sharing data with the United States.\u00a0 What do you recommend that American companies do?\u00a0 Is there anything the U.S. can do to protect them?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, your prime minister was recently in Beijing.\u00a0 China\u2019s foreign minister is now on tour in Europe and has threatened reprisals against the EU if it sanctions the Chinese companies that have supported Russia\u2019s war machine.\u00a0 Would you \u2013 is the EU \u2013 should the EU punish Chinese companies and retaliate against them despite the risk that China will have reprisals against the EU?\nThank you both very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much, Andrea. \u00a0On the debt ceiling, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the White House and our colleagues there.\u00a0 I think, as a general proposition, it\u2019s proven time and again to be a bad bet to bet against the United States.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the conversations that are going on now.\nWith regard to the treatment of some of our companies and other companies in China, I\u2019ve seen those reports and we obviously have concerns.\u00a0 I mean, one of our general concerns \u2013 and it\u2019s a concern shared by many allies and partners \u2013 is the way some of our enterprises are treated in China, certainly treated in a way that\u2019s not reciprocal to the way that many Chinese enterprises are treated, businesses are treated, around the world.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one of the challenges that I think a number of countries have.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we talk to the Chinese about.\u00a0 To the extent, of course, that China wants to have a positive business environment that attracts foreign investment, that attracts foreign businesses, the actions that it takes with regard to those businesses will have a big impact.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) China is a country \u2013 due to its demographic weight, its military capabilities, its economic weight \u2013 is extremely important for global challenges such as climate change or such as using the influence that it has on Russia and Vladimir Putin in order to achieve peace as soon as possible in Ukraine, because the war in Ukraine is a \u2013 it\u2019s not a European war, but it is a war in Europe.\u00a0 It\u2019s a war against the principles of the UN Charter, and China is a permanent member of the Security Council.\u00a0 So it is in that spirit that we work with China.\nWhat we want with every country worldwide is equal conditions under which we receive the businesses of any country in the world and where our businesses are able to go to those countries.\u00a0 And in Europe, all European countries are open societies.\u00a0 We believe in free trade and we believe in a relationship with all countries on the planet.\u00a0 We do always require equal conditions for the businesses that we receive and for our businesses that go to any other country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Eduard Ribas from EFE.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 I would like to ask the minister about the migration agreement with the U.S.\u00a0 Could you clarify how many migrants will be received by Spain, during what time, and especially what migratory status would these migrants have in Spain?\u00a0 I would also like to know if you\u2019ve celebrated any agreements to transfer the Palomares territories and when that would happen, when that transfer might happen.\nAnd for Mr. Secretary, same topics.\u00a0 Are you planning to expand the migration agreement with Spain to other European countries?\u00a0 And there is any U.S. commitment to keep the contaminated lands from the nuclear accident of Palomares?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding the migration agreement and the details of the agreement, the ministry of the interior and the ministry of inclusion, which are the two ministries in charge of deploying and implementing the agreement in and of itself, they will provide all the details in this regard.\nWhat I would like to point out is that this agreement responds to a shared vision vis-\u00e0-vis a very complex phenomenon, which is migration.\u00a0 We need to offer protection to people who for different reasons may need our protection to seek refuge and asylum in each of our countries.\u00a0 We also need to show that irregular migration, the migration that puts so many innocent lives at risk, people who only want to legitimately improve their lives but they choose the wrong path, that is not the only path that exists.\u00a0 There\u2019s also safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.\nAnd when all of us have labor markets, we have needs in these labor markets \u2013 we need labor in very specific industries.\u00a0 So we would also like to show what we\u2019re doing already with other countries through migration programs, circular migration programs.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to show that that migration path, the regular, orderly, safe path exists.\u00a0 And in the end, this is the best tool that we can use to discourage irregular migration.\u00a0 And of course, Spain will also be one of the countries that will join any initiative that may help our Latin American brothers and sisters with whom we share so many things, and so many of them area already living perfectly integrated in Spain and they promote our economic development and prosperity.\nWe discussed \u2013 I was saying this earlier \u2013 the Palomares area.\u00a0 I would like to state that both parties are willing \u2013 this is a complex issue technically speaking.\u00a0 It\u2019s been 60 years that this has been ongoing, and there are a series of technical issues that we need to solve and we need to expedite before making final decisions.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to the Regional Processing Centers, these are centers that give would-be migrants the opportunity to stay in their own countries and to determine whether they have a legal pathway to come to the United States, or to Spain, because Spain is participating in this process, and Canada has also indicated its interest in participating.\u00a0 That means that, again, a would-be migrant can stay in their own country, go to one of these centers and find out whether they qualify for a legal pathway, including, as Jos\u00e9 Manuel laid out so clearly, a worker or labor-related pathway so that they can perhaps fill a gap that exists in a given country when it comes to its labor market.\nSo we are very pleased and appreciative that Spain is participating.\u00a0 As I mentioned, Canada is participating as well; conceivably other countries could.\u00a0 Needless to say, in the case of Spain, there\u2019s a particular logic because, one, the needs of the labor markets in Spain; two, the shared language makes it particularly interesting and attractive.\nWith regard to Palomares, just as the minister said, first, we recognize the importance of this issue.\u00a0 And as he said, it goes back many years.\u00a0 We conducted remediation after the 1966 accident at Palomares.\u00a0 We now anticipate that negotiations related to further cleanup efforts will restart soon, and we very much look forward to working with our Spanish partners on this.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Tracy Wilkinson from\u00a0The Los Angeles Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, thank you.\u00a0 For Secretary Blinken, please, Spain \u2013 and like many countries in Southern Europe, those especially who have ties with the so-called Global South \u2013 have been more reluctant to join in the Ukraine mission.\u00a0 So you\u2019ve listed a couple of steps here today, and I just wondered if this is \u2013 if you\u2019re satisfied, if you\u2019d like to see more coming from Spain and countries like it.\nY para el Ministro Albares,\u00a0in English:\nFollowing on my colleagues\u2019 questions on immigration, you talked about the\u00a0misi\u00f3n compartida, the shared mission.\u00a0 Is it difficult for Spain to continue to receive more immigrants and refugees given you mentioned the many who have come from Ukraine, already several \u2013 several thousand from Venezuela and Cuba, and not to mention Northern Africa?\u00a0 So I just wonder how politically that goes over.\nAnd then second question on that issue, and last question, the United States talks about the root causes of immigration a lot, and one of those root causes is just dire, dire poverty.\u00a0 Do you \u2013 some of that poverty is exacerbated by sanctions that the United States maintains on Cuba and to a lesser extent Venezuela.\u00a0 And I wonder if you would think it a good idea for the United States to ease up on some of those sanctions.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Happy to start, Jos\u00e9 Manuel.\u00a0 Tracy, thanks very much.\u00a0 I have to tell you I don\u2019t share the premise of the question.\u00a0 Spain has been unwavering in its support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u00a0 It\u2019s made that crystal clear not only through what it says but through what it does.\u00a0 I mentioned earlier the very strong support when it comes to making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression and to retake territory that\u2019s been seized from it by Russia, including the provision of very important weapon systems through the process that we put in place, the coordinated effort that Secretary Austin has been leading.\nYou\u2019ve seen strong support for EU sanctions on Russia to continue to exert pressure on Russia for the aggression.\u00a0 The humanitarian support has been remarkably strong, both in what it\u2019s provided to Ukraine and also in the generosity of the Spanish people in taking in more than 175,000 Ukrainian refugees.\u00a0 So we have seen from day one extraordinary solidarity and a strong sense of common purpose and common action when it comes to supporting and defending Ukraine.\nThe other aspect of this that\u2019s so important is this:\u00a0 Even as we together and with many other countries are working to defend Ukraine, to help Ukraine defend itself and to deal with the Russian aggression, we are relentlessly focused on the many issues that are affecting people all around the world.\u00a0 You mentioned the Global South.\u00a0 If you look at the agenda that we just had at the recent G7 meeting of foreign ministers heading toward the leaders meeting coming up, I\u2019d say two-thirds of that was on the issues that are of most concern to people around the world and including in the Global South, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s food security, whether it\u2019s global health, whether it\u2019s finding ways to advance inclusive economic growth, whether it\u2019s meeting the development goals that the international community has set for itself.\nPart of the challenge, of course, is that the very aggression by Russia against Ukraine has actually exacerbated some of these problems, and we\u2019ve made that crystal clear.\u00a0 We are the solution to the problems, not the cause of the problem.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s been clear in the focus that we brought, including, for example, on making sure that the Black Sea Grain Initiative is extended.\u00a0 You have a situation now where Russia continues to try to use food as a weapon in its war against Ukraine.\u00a0 And Spain, the United States, many other countries are determined that that not happen because the victims in this case are people throughout the Global South who desperately need the food and desperately need to make sure that food prices are held \u2013 are held in check.\nSo I think we\u2019re both deeply appreciative of Spain\u2019s engagement and leadership on Ukraine, but also together very focused on this broad array of issues that are of fundamental concern to people around the world.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, I\u2019d like to continue along the lines that Tony Blinken was mentioning.\u00a0 I wanted to correct that mistaken perception of our support for Ukraine, which is total since day one.\u00a0 And I said it today publicly but I\u2019ve said it on many other occasions:\u00a0 It will be there for as long as necessary.\nSpain denounced from day one the illegal and unjustified aggression of Russia towards Ukraine.\u00a0 We supported the 10 packages of sanctions from the EU towards Russia.\u00a0 We have supported the use of the European Peace Facility to purchase weapons for Ukraine.\u00a0 We were with the U.S. to meet with the International Criminal Court to prosecute for the war crimes present in Ukraine, and we do have police officers from our scientific police in Ukraine helping to collect evidence.\u00a0 We provided the largest humanitarian aid package ever provided by Spain to another country.\u00a0 We have received 170,000 Ukrainian refugees under (inaudible) specific statute and we are of course willing to receive more if this unfortunate humanitarian catastrophe were to continue.\u00a0 We have provided military equipment to Ukraine that includes Leopard tanks, anti-air batteries.\nAnd of course we do speak with our friends about what is now called the Global South.\u00a0 We talk to our Latin American friends, we talk to our African friends, because as Tony very rightly pointed out, there is a food crisis, there is an energy crisis that is a global crisis and affects all of these countries.\u00a0 And we want to send the message that of course we are completely committed to Ukraine, but we are not forgetting the needs of all of these countries.\u00a0 That is why Spain has tripled its cooperation programs for development in Africa.\u00a0 In January I talked to all African Union ministers and I announced a package of millions of euros for the African Union and for insecurity situations.\nWhen it comes to migration, this phenomenon \u2013 this is your second question \u2013 and Spain knows this issue very well.\u00a0 We, as a country, have a land border with Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s 14 kilometers away from Africa, and we are very familiar with the complexity of migration.\u00a0 And one thing we do know is that this is a global phenomenon, and therefore we must act together.\u00a0 And this is the spirit with which we are going to start to work with the U.S. and Canada now, as we do with many other countries, and we do this in the EU as well.\u00a0 We will do this in order to tackle this phenomenon, which includes irregular migration, but there are many other issues when it comes to migration.\nWe cannot just become resigned and \u2013 resigned to the fact that the Mediterranean and the Atlantic will be the grave of thousands of innocent people who desperately want to improve their lives.\u00a0 And we need to tackle the root causes as well, because while the inequality between different countries is what it is, we\u2019re facing structural \u2013 a structural problem, and structural problems do not have one solution; rather, there is management, and part of this management is improving development cooperation programs as Spain is doing to promote regular migration programs like what we\u2019re doing with the United States, and we do this in many other ways as well.\nAnd regarding Cuba and Venezuela, Spain has a very special \u2013 in the best sense of the word \u2013 relationship with all Latin American and Caribbean countries.\u00a0 We are an authentic community of an Ibero-American family, and we want \u2013 what we want for all Latin American countries is the exact same thing that we want for Spain: prosperity, democracy, and freedom.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Sara Canales, La SER.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) And I will not discuss the decisions of other countries.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, this week the U.S. has agreed to send two additional destroyer ships to the Spanish naval base in Rota, increasing the number from four to six.\u00a0 How will this increase in military presence impact global security?\u00a0 Why now?\u00a0 And could we see more U.S. military presence in Spain?\nAnd then Latin America will be a big priority during Spain\u2019s turning presidency of the EU \u2013 oh, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 EU, yeah.\u00a0 How can the U.S. through this relationship with Spain benefit from this?\u00a0 What message does this send to the competitors such as China?\n(Via interpreter) Regarding Title 42, Minister, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and political divisions in the U.S. regarding the border as of Friday.\u00a0 Are you worried about this uncertainty in Spain?\u00a0 Are there guarantees from Washington, assurances that the situation can be kept under control?\u00a0 How have other EU countries seen this agreement?\nAnd when it comes to Palomares, you\u2019ve talked about complexity, but could it be resolved before 2024?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 So we were very pleased to be able to sign the Defense Cooperation Agreement with Spain, the enhanced agreement, and I think it\u2019s simply a reflection of the fact that one of the important aspects of our relationship is our cooperation in the realm of defense.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re joined together as NATO Allies.\u00a0 Spain is playing a critical role in NATO.\u00a0 In fact, the work that it\u2019s done since the Russian aggression against Ukraine to help reinforce the eastern flank of NATO is essential to the work of the Alliance and making sure that all of our members are defended.\nAnd in this context but also in the broader context of shared security interests, having stronger defense coordination, cooperation between us is important.\u00a0 That is one aspect of the relationship.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to predict any future deployments one way or the other; that\u2019s really up to our military experts and officials to determine.\u00a0 But we\u2019re very pleased that we were able to reach this agreement and strengthen and deepen even more the cooperation that we have on defense.\nAnd again, I emphasize it\u2019s on defense.\u00a0 The work that we\u2019re doing together is to defend our people, to defend our interests, to defend our values, to defend ourselves at a time when there are increasing challenges to our common security.\nWith regard to Spain\u2019s EU presidency, we welcome it for a number of reasons.\u00a0 One is, exactly as you say, the close relationship that we have, the extraordinary breadth and depth of our dialogue, I think will also be very beneficial when it comes to the relationship between the United States and the European Union, something that we have invested in very significantly over the last two and a half years.\nThe entire premise of President Biden\u2019s approach to foreign policy and to U.S. engagement in the world starts with the re-engagement, the re-energizing, the rejuvenation of our core partnerships and our core alliances, and one of our core partnerships is with the European Union.\u00a0 We have an extraordinarily rich agenda with the EU.\u00a0 One aspect of that agenda is how we see some of the challenges posed by China, and I think what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is a remarkable convergence in the approach that we\u2019re both taking.\u00a0 And I think if you look at the different articulations of policy that have put out, as well as the work that we\u2019ve actually been doing \u2013 including, for example, through the Trade and Technology Council \u2013 with the EU, you see that convergence.\nAnd I think there\u2019s a shared understanding that the relationship that we all have with China has aspects that are clearly competitive.\u00a0 There may be aspects that are adversarial, and it\u2019s our determination to make sure that competition does not veer into conflict.\u00a0 And there are aspects that can and should be cooperative because they\u2019re important things that might be important to our citizens as well as to people around the world that we should look and find ways to do together.\nAnd I think the EU, European partners, have very much the same perspective.\u00a0 The EU is one place where we can really continue to work on the details of how that convergence of views translates into specific policies, and having Spain in a leadership role I think will only advance those efforts.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding migration, there\u2019s several things.\u00a0 Migration is a global phenomenon, and we see it everywhere worldwide, and this is a challenge that we need to tackle from a \u2013 using a multilateral approach.\u00a0 Spain has a way of handling this challenge which includes constantly fighting against the mafias that smuggle human beings, a political dialogue with the origin and transit countries to offer regular pathways for migration \u2013 orderly migration \u2013 and to protect those who do warrant refuge and asylum in our countries.\nAnd especially we must \u2013 we fight against the deeply rooted causes of migration, and that is why this year we passed a new law for development cooperation that puts Central America and Africa at the center of our cooperation.\u00a0 And we have tripled our cooperation programs in many countries.\nNow, when it comes to the Palomares soil, there are technical aspects there that we must discuss at the technical level, not at the political level, and that is where we will set the different stages that must be followed.\u00a0 The important thing is that the will is there in our dialogue.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-freedom-house-2023-annual-awards-ceremony/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Conrad Hotel  ", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 9, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\nLet me start by thanking my good friend of so many years, Mike Abramowitz, for the honor of joining Freedom House tonight and helping you to celebrate the 2023 Annual Freedom Awards. \u00a0Now, we have to be honest with people; we\u2019ve known each other for a while, going back to our college days.\u00a0 We both wrote for our college newspaper. \u00a0Or, more accurately, I wrote for Mike because on the Crimson he held the title of president back then.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThere\u2019s something else you need to know about Mike.\u00a0 I tended to write a lot of opinion pieces read by, if I was really fortunate, one or two of my roommates and a family member too.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I was always trying to get Mike to write more opinion pieces.\u00a0 And his answer back then in being reluctant to do that was I just don\u2019t know, I really see both sides and I just have trouble coming out on one side or another.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well, something\u2019s changed in all those years, because I know, we know Mike, as being someone who is resolutely, ferociously on the side of democracy, freedom, and human rights.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe have here tonight leaders from across the Executive Branch, Congress.\u00a0 I think Chairman Mike McCaul is here, Representatives Swalwell and Panetta, others.\u00a0 Your presence reflects the bipartisan commitment to standing up for universal freedoms, universal rights, to standing up for democracy.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to be able to work with you and other members in Congress every single day to try to uphold that agenda.\nNow, when this organization was founded eight decades ago, the specter of Nazism loomed over Europe. \u00a0In the rise of Hitler, the men and women of Freedom House saw a threat not only to freedom on the continent, but to life and liberty everywhere. \u00a0And so they threw their full weight behind pushing President Roosevelt to enter World War II to join the fight against fascism.\nEver since, Freedom House has taken on challenges to freedoms everywhere \u2013 from standing up against McCarthyism, advocating for civil rights, to, in our time, protecting human rights during the pandemic, combatting transnational repression.\nThe Freedom Index that Mike spoke about is one of the most powerful tools that we in government have.\u00a0 Being able to refer to an objective, unbiased source that shows us the trajectory for good or back of democracy in our world, it helps guide our work and it is that unimpeachable document that we can use to try to leverage progress in country after country.\u00a0 And indeed, what we see today 71 years later is Freedom House helping lead the charge to defend and advance freedom and human rights in what is, I think everyone in this room knows, an extremely challenging and difficult time.\nGlobally, just to focus on the human rights dimension, governments have jailed upward of a million people just for exercising their fundamental human rights and defending the human rights of others. \u00a0That includes one of tonight\u2019s Freedom Award recipients: Russian journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza \u2013 sentenced to 25 years for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, and also for a lifetime of courageous work to seek a better future for his fellow Russian citizens.\nMillions of others are defending human rights on the frontlines, often at extraordinary personal risk. \u00a0People like Aida Ghajar, the first journalist to publish Mahsa Amini\u2019s name after her death. \u00a0We\u2019re honored that Aida is here to accept tonight\u2019s second Freedom Award.\nFor months now, Aida and hundreds of thousands of Iranian women, girls \u2013 with the support of many of their male compatriots \u2013 have demanded their basic freedoms be respected, even in the face of the most brutal repression.\nCountless journalists are working to expose and report on the truth in extremely dangerous conditions.\u00a0 Today, we were devastated to learn of the death of an AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in eastern Ukraine. \u00a0Our thoughts are with his family, with his loved ones, with the entire AFP family.\nJust a week or so ago I had the chance to welcome back to the State Department another remarkable journalist, Ben Hall from Fox, who traveled with me at the beginning of my tenure in this job and then was grievously wounded in Ukraine doing his job \u2013 trying to cover the war and bring its realities to people around the world.\u00a0 It was just a wonderful thing to have Ben back at the State Department back on the job after coming back from truly horrific injuries.\nBut he, so many others who are on the frontlines trying to make sure that they\u2019re shining a light on what\u2019s going on in the darkest recesses of Earth, more important than ever.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a lot to be said about press freedom in this moment, but I\u2019ll save that for another day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nThe work of so many who report on and advocate for human rights and human dignity \u2013 including our extraordinary Ambassador to Liberia Michael McCarthy, also being honored tonight \u2013 is both incredibly dangerous but even more so incredibly consequential.\nPresident Biden has worked to put the promotion and protection of human rights, fundamental freedoms, at the core of our diplomacy.\nAt the State Department, we\u2019ve been ramping up programs to provide emergency support and legal assistance to those who are out there defending human rights around the world; pressing for the release of political prisoners; holding human rights abusers accountable, including with sanctions, visa restrictions; strengthening the rule of law and systems of transnational[1]\u00a0justice. We\u2019re also engaging constantly with our civil society partners, like Freedom House, on how to best defend and advance human rights in the face of traditional challenges as well as evolving challenges.\nAnd of course, one of the most rapidly evolving challenges \u2013 not a surprise to anyone here \u2013 is technology, both in the affirmative pursuit of human rights but also in further enabling repression. \u00a0And that\u2019s what I thought I\u2019d spend a little bit of time on tonight.\nNow, I suspect everyone in the room felt the same way.\u00a0 For a time, it seemed that leaps in technology would be a gamechanger, tilting the balance of power away from human rights abusers and in favor of human rights defenders.\nIn 1989, President Reagan summed up the consensus view at the time when he said, \u201cMore than armies, more than diplomacy, more than the best intentions of democratic nations, the communications revolution will be the greatest force for the advancement of human freedom that the world has ever seen.\u201d\nSince then, of course, the internet, digital technologies have connected and empowered billions of people: amplifying their voices, providing the opportunity to form communities, expanding economic opportunity.\u00a0 And in many ways, expanding freedom for human rights defenders specifically, technologies provide a platform to connect, to collaborate, to communicate across borders.\nYet, at the same time, as we all know too well, in many of the same places where human rights defenders are using technology for good, authoritarians and repressive regimes have abused technology to carry out their own transgressions.\nIn short, we\u2019ve been reminded powerfully that technology is not inherently good or bad. \u00a0Whether it makes our societies more or less equitable, whether it promotes or represses human rights, whether it brings us together or drives us apart \u2013 that\u2019s up to all of us.\nThe United States is committed to doing whatever we can, drawing on the full range of our own tools, diplomatic and otherwise, to try to maximize technology as a force for good and to minimize its misuse.\nWe\u2019ve also made historic investments like the CHIPS and Science Act, because we know we can only be effective in shaping these technologies in a way that aligns with our values \u2013 in particular, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2013 if countries that support freedom maintain leadership in cutting-edge technologies and are playing a lead role in shaping the norms and rules by which these technologies are used.\nOur human rights future is going to be shaped, simply put, by our technological future.\u00a0 And that\u2019s particularly so in four areas where we have to work together if we\u2019re going to achieve the goals that unite us.\nLet me just mention these quickly.\nFirst, surveillance technology, particularly spyware. \u00a0Our digital lives make us all vulnerable to new forms of surveillance tech, embedded in the devices we carry in our pockets, we wear on our wrists, we have in our homes.\nFor many here tonight, the proliferation and misuse of surveillance technology is a daily and growing threat. \u00a0Journalists, political activists, opposition figures, human rights advocates, others across nearly every continent have been targeted with commercial spyware that\u2019s readily available to governments and nongovernmental actors alike.\nNongovernmental reports have found that over 70 governments around the world \u2013 including democracies \u2013 have acquired commercial spyware or data extraction technologies.\nNow, governments, of course, can use surveillance technologies to help protect national security; to enhance law enforcement, public safety, the environment, critical infrastructure. \u00a0But they have to be used in a way that\u2019s consistent with domestic law, with international law, and with proper legal authorization, safeguards, and oversight.\nThat\u2019s why we have mobilized a government-wide effort to try to shape how surveillance technology is used. \u00a0We\u2019ve been putting significant restrictions on the export of technologies and inputs used for surveillance and other malicious cyber activities by governments.\nWe added spyware companies that have enabled the misuse of their technology to something called the Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List, which prevents these companies from receiving products or components from our own firms without the approval of our government.\nWe will continue to identify and sanction foreign companies that develop and supply software and other surveillance technology to governments with a record of using these tools to abuse human rights.\nThis year\u2019s Second Summit for Democracy, President Biden issued an executive order that bans the U.S. Government use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our own national security, including that which has been used to target U.S. Government personnel or devices or has been misused by foreign actors to target dissidents or abuse human rights.\nWe\u2019ve also encouraged the 36 other governments that are part of the Freedom Online Coalition to begin to adopt guiding principles on surveillance technology to prevent its misuse by bad actors, like targeting people based solely on their race, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, their political views, or any other classification protected by law. \u00a0And we\u2019ll keep working to bring more countries online with these efforts.\nA second area I just wanted to highlight quickly, where we\u2019re seeing technology\u2019s impact most significantly on human rights, and that, of course, is internet freedom. \u00a0Governments are finding new ways to restrict access to the internet, to choke off the information that citizens take in and that they share. \u00a0Some shut off the internet altogether. \u00a0Others, of course, use censorship and punitive laws to control how the internet is used.\nAccording to Freedom House\u2019s most recent Freedom on the Net report, internet shutdowns and internet censorship by governments are now at an all-time high.\nNow, we know unfettered access to the internet is essential for defending human rights and human freedoms.\u00a0 Aida Ghajar\u2019s news outlet Iran Wire used the internet to receive critical information from inside Iran to do everything from documenting an accurate death toll from the repression of protests, to sharing live footage of the regime\u2019s crackdown, to gathering and disseminating reporting by its network and citizen journalists.\u00a0 One Iranian journalist put it this way and explained of the protestors: \u00a0\u201cPeople don\u2019t have weapons. They have mobile phones.\u00a0 They have social media.\u201d\u00a0 These are among the strongest tools in democracy\u2019s arsenal.\nSo we are leading a global effort to try to advance \u2013 to protect and to advance internet freedom, particularly in areas where governments are most aggressively repressing it.\nWhen the Iranian regime tried to throttle internet access for most of its 80 million citizens, we issued a General License that enables technology firms to provide more digital services, hardware, and software to people in Iran, from access to cloud computing services to better tools to enhance their own online security and privacy; in other words, to be able to remain connected with each other and connected with the rest of the world.\u00a0 These tools have been essential in helping Iranians not only report on the regime\u2019s abuses, but to tell their own stories and exercise their right to free expression. \u00a0We\u2019re committed to expanding similar efforts around the world wherever necessary.\nThe third thing I wanted to highlight.\u00a0 While we\u2019re working to promote access to the internet for all, we\u2019re also working to address threats to human rights that come with an open internet, including online harassment, abuse, disinformation.\nNow, online abuse doesn\u2019t, of course, target only human rights defenders. \u00a0Instead, the internet and digital technologies are often used to amplify attacks on vulnerable groups \u2013 women, the LGBTQI community, marginalized ethnic or religious groups \u2013 and undermine our broader fight for human rights. \u00a0So this year, we launched what is now at least a 12-country Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse.\u00a0 We\u2019re encouraging private sector to become engaged with us as well.\nWe\u2019re also working to address the massive challenge of online misinformation and disinformation \u2013 again, something familiar to everyone in this room.\u00a0 To cite one example, of course, Russia continues to push a steady, relentless stream of disinformation about its war of aggression against Ukraine, to lie about and cover up horrific abuses it\u2019s committed, to try to justify committing others.\nIn response, the State Department has developed an AI-enabled online Ukraine Content Aggregator to collect verifiable Russian disinformation and then to share that with partners around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re promoting independent media and digital literacy.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with partners in academia to reliably detect fake text generated by Russian chatbots.\nWhich leads to a fourth area that I wanted to mention tonight, a fourth area where technology and human rights are converging, and that, of course, is emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and biotechnologies, including genomics.\nAs a system that reflects the data on which it\u2019s trained \u2013 including the biases embedded in that data \u2013 AI can, of course, amplify discrimination and enable abuses.\nIt also runs the risk of strengthening autocratic governments, including by enabling them to exploit social media even more effectively to manipulate their people and sow division among and within their adversaries.\nIn October, the White House put out a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \u2013 some basic principles to try to guide the way that we design and use automated systems in ways that protect our people and defend our democratic values. \u00a0These include the principle that people should be protected from unsafe and ineffective AI, and that people should know when an automated system is being used and understand how it affects them.\nThe National Institute for Standards and Technology also developed a risk management framework for how to measure and manage the risk of automated systems and make AI that\u2019s safe, accountable, and fair, and that protects privacy.\nNow, I think it\u2019s also not a secret to everyone in this room and particularly to those of you who are either serving or have served in government to suggest that one of the biggest challenges that we face in government is keeping up with technology as a general rule, including AI.\u00a0 It takes us a while to figure it out, to understand it.\u00a0 By the time we do, it\u2019s usually leaped several generations ahead.\u00a0 And then we go to regulate it; we tend to take out a 2 by 4 that governments use instead of a scalpel that may be more effective.\nSo one of the things that we are doing relentlessly, and including in my department at State, is to bring in much more expertise than we\u2019ve had in the past to help us in real time better understand the technologies that are shaping our world and to work together in figuring out how best to try to shape them in a way that advances the good and minimizes the bad.\nIt took me a while working in government over the years as someone trained in the humanities, as most of us are working on foreign policy, to understand that I needed scientists and technologists in the room just to tell me whether I needed scientists and technologists in the room.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So we\u2019re getting there.\nBut just recently, the State Department stood up an entire new bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy.\u00a0 We have an incredibly effective senior envoy for emerging technologies.\u00a0 We want to make sure that not only are we at the table, but we\u2019re really helping to shape the discussion at that table about, again, how these technologies are going to be used because they so powerfully affect our lives.\nAccess to human genomic data opens up a whole other set of human rights concerns. \u00a0Advances in biotechnology have enabled genomic surveillance based on a person\u2019s DNA, potentially facilitating abuses.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen some of those, for example, committed by the People\u2019s Republic of China against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. \u00a0We\u2019re also concerned by reports of the spread of mass DNA collection to Tibet as an additional form of control and surveillance over the Tibetan population.\nGoing back to last September, President Biden issued an executive order on biotechnology and biomanufacturing innovation, which seeks to ensure that the United States and our partners continue to lead and set norms and rules on advanced biotechnology in a way that is rights-affirming and reflects our values.\nNow, we know these principles and guidelines aren\u2019t the final word in navigating the extraordinary complexities around these technologies, which evolve, as I said, almost faster than we can keep up with understanding them.\u00a0 But they are a way to start to create guardrails and to shape the space, particularly as countries on the cutting edge of tech-enabled repression seek to export their models and technologies, with all the biases and risks that they contain, and to do so at scale.\nThese four challenges \u2013 and others that we know will emerge in the months and years ahead \u2013\u00a0 require all of us to try to work harder, to work smarter, to work more collaboratively than ever before.\nAt the same time, for our administration as we consider the larger challenge of strengthening democracy and pushing back against autocracy, we\u2019ve tried to put in place some foundational pieces that will help us do that.\nOver the last few years, we\u2019ve been working very hard to invest in ourselves, to make sure that our own country is as competitive as can be and that it\u2019s delivering on the things that people\u00a0 most want and expect.\u00a0 Because fundamentally, if we can\u2019t demonstrate that our democracies can deliver, if we can\u2019t demonstrate that we can compete effectively, we\u2019re going to be on the losing end.\nThe other half of the coin is making sure that we\u2019re engaged, truly engaged, in the world.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ve worked very hard to re-engage, to rejuvenate, to re-energize our alliances, our partnerships, starting but not ending with our democratic partners around the world.\u00a0 Because if we can build convergence among countries about the way to approach these problems, if we can multiply the weight that we bring, we are going to stand a much better chance in being effective and getting real change and defending more effectively the freedoms and rights that are under challenge.\nBut what I know powerfully is this:\u00a0 It\u2019s simply not enough for governments to do this.\u00a0 We can\u2019t, we can\u2019t do it alone.\u00a0 On the contrary, more than ever before we need partnerships.\u00a0 We need partnerships with the private sector.\u00a0 We need partnerships with nongovernmental organizations.\u00a0 We need partnerships with academia.\u00a0 We need partnerships that bring together all of the stakeholders in this fight to strengthen, to preserve, to defend our democracies and to uphold human rights.\nWe know that in so many ways all of these stakeholders are more empowered than ever before.\u00a0 And if we\u2019re not together on the takeoff, we\u2019re probably not going to be together on the landing.\nAt the end of the day, we together have a shared commitment and a shared responsibility to uphold the freedoms that so many of us have tended to take for granted but that Freedom House never has.\u00a0 I think the great power, the great strength, the great contribution that Freedom House has made over so many years is precisely that: not taking freedom for granted, not taking democracy for granted, not taking human rights for granted; on the contrary, telling us, showing us, that we have to fight for them and we have to fight for them together every single day.\nNow, I suspect many have been awakened to that proposition a little bit more recently, but I hope it commits all of us to try to find ways to work together in ways perhaps that we haven\u2019t before.\u00a0 So what I really wanted to share with you tonight is simply that, speaking on behalf of our administration, we will continue to look to Freedom House and to human rights and freedom defenders writ large who have always been and have to remain our North Star. \u00a0We ask you to continue to work with us, including by sharing your ideas, by sharing your perspectives, and yes, holding us accountable.\n[1] transitional\n\n"}, {"url":

you.\u00a0\u00a0Assalamu alaikum, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Eid Mubarak to you and to your families.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to join you.\u00a0 Alia, I\u2019m tempted to say, \u201cWhat she said,\u201d drop the microphone, and leave.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Because who wants to follow this extraordinary woman.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0on the acceptance to Northeastern.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0on your decision to dedicate what are manifestly tremendous talents to the public health field.\u00a0 We need you.\u00a0 They need you.\u00a0 The world needs you.\u00a0 We\u2019re so grateful to have you here with us now.\nMS SALEEBAAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And to my friend and colleague, our remarkable ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom.\u00a0 He\u2019s been a remarkable force for the United States around the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Opening doors, opening minds, opening hearts, and making a huge difference.\u00a0 And it\u2019s always great to be with you, my friend.\nTo all of our distinguished guests, members of religious communities, civil society, the diplomatic community, thank you for joining us this afternoon and welcome to Blair House, a absolutely wonderful setting.\u00a0 Blair House, which is, I think as most of you know, the President\u2019s guesthouse, has played host to countless dignitaries over the past 80 years, including more than a hundred heads of state from predominantly Muslim countries.\u00a0 Now we are thrilled to be opening its doors \u2013 actually quite literally opening its doors \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 to community leaders for the first Eid reception hosted here by someone in my position.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo as you all know better than anyone, Eid is a time of spiritual renewal, an opportunity to reflect on a month of fasting and prayer, and to recommit \u2013 recommit to values at the heart of Islam: compassion, empathy, service, charity, gratitude, generosity.\u00a0 Our nation is strengthened by the contributions of hundreds of Muslim Americans across our government, including at the State Department.\u00a0 We know \u2013 I know profoundly \u2013 that our diversity \u2013 it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it is so profoundly true: our diversity is our greatest strength in the world, and we\u2019re putting it to use to serve American interests and values.\u00a0 We are operating in an extraordinarily diverse world.\u00a0 If we were to leave our own diversity on the sidelines, we\u2019d be shortchanging ourselves, shortchanging our foreign policy, shortchanging the country.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined not to do that.\nAs we look around the world, we see examples of Muslims living out the values that we\u2019re celebrating here today: showing compassion for the vulnerable, showing a commitment to justice, showing a commitment to the pursuit of peace.\u00a0 When a devastating earthquake hit T\u00fcrkiye and Syria just a couple of months ago in February, governments stepped up to build shelters, to dispatch search and rescue teams.\u00a0 NGOs like the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement, Islamic Relief USA, provided lifesaving equipment, humanitarian assistance, food, water, clothing, medicine.\u00a0 We saw people coming together in an hour of profound need\u00a0for so many of our fellow human beings.\nWhen the Taliban enacted restrictive bans on higher education for women, governments from across the Muslim world spoke up to condemn the Taliban\u2019s decision, arguing that their actions were inhumane and contrary to Islamic beliefs.\u00a0 Scholars of Islamic law weighed in to condemn the Taliban\u2019s actions, too, noting that the Quran gives the right to education to women and men alike. \u00a0(Applause.)\nAnd in Sudan, which has occupied our minds and focus recently, Arab countries as well as regional and international partners across Africa are providing aid and helping secure an immediate end to the conflict.the se\nThe United States is proud to support these efforts and others, and we will continue to work with our Muslim partners and allies to tackle the challenges of our time, the responsibilities that we all share.\u00a0 That includes fighting for the rights of many people around the world who simply cannot freely or safely practice their faiths.\u00a0 We\u2019re standing up for those who face persecution, for peacefully worshiping, those who are vilified for being part of a religious minority, those who face real threats to their safety, for choosing not to observe a faith at all.\nThe team at the Office of International Religious Freedom, led by Ambassador Hussain, works with partner countries and civil society to advance religious freedom and drive progress on tackling pressing challenges \u2013 global health to climate change \u2013 and they\u2019re doing that, Rashad is doing that, around the world.\nFor us, freedom of religion is a fundamental human right, one foundational to the creation of our country.\u00a0 And our government is committed to supporting the right of every person \u2013 every person \u2013 to worship as they choose.\u00a0 We\u2019re equally committed to standing against discrimination and affirming every Muslim American\u2019s place as a full member of American society.\nThe leaders in this room reflect the reality that Muslim Americans are a vital part of the fabric of this country.\u00a0 With us this afternoon: doctors, scientists, writers, poets, leaders tackling virtually every vital issue that our society has to tackle and confront.\nMina Kalil and Faisal Mumtaz are two such leaders in this room.\u00a0 Both moved from Afghanistan to the United States in 2021.\u00a0 They quickly threw themselves into serving refugees in their new community here in northern Virginia.\u00a0 They both work at the nonprofit Islamic Circle of North America Relief, where they\u2019re helping provide essential social services to new refugees like health care, like transitional housing.\u00a0 They\u2019ve both been generous about sharing their experiences with incoming refugees in panels and one-on-one conversations, because they know that\u2019s one of the best ways to help others.\nNow, if Mina and Faisal are here \u2013 there you are.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSimply put, you reflect so much of the spirit of Eid \u2013 the desire to serve, compassion for the newcomer, a commitment to building a community.\u00a0 And you are, as we would say, paying it forward in a very profound way.\nBut each of you here tonight embodies these values.\u00a0 You embody them with your words.\u00a0 You embody them with your work.\u00a0 The United States, the world, is immeasurably better off because of it.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for being here tonight, and everybody,\u00a0Eid Mubarak\u00a0to everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-uk-foreign-secretary-james-cleverly-at-a-joint-press-availability-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken And UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly At a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Burns Auditorium ", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 9, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It is a genuine pleasure to welcome my friend Foreign Secretary James Cleverly back to the State Department.\u00a0 As usual, we covered a lot of ground, but I began by asking the foreign secretary to extend my warm\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla on their coronation.\nI was in Atlanta over most of the weekend.\u00a0 I can report that many members of our team got up pretty early on Saturday to watch the ceremony, including me.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s something that captivated millions and millions of Americans, as it did people around the world.\nToday, I also had the chance to thank James for the United Kingdom\u2019s crucial cooperation in getting citizens of both of our countries out of Sudan.\u00a0 These joint efforts allowed UK aircraft to evacuate more than 2,000 people, including U.S. citizens, from dangerous and unpredictable conditions (inaudible) evacuation of hundreds of additional U.S. citizens through Port Sudan.\u00a0 All told, we supported the evacuation of more than 1,300 Americans from Sudan in collaboration with our partners.\nTogether now, we are pressing the warring parties in Sudan to put down their guns and allow lifesaving aid to reach the Sudanese people.\u00a0 Even as we meet here, we have diplomats from the United States and Saudi Arabia deeply engaged in talks in Jeddah, working in close consultation with counterparts from the UK, the United Arab Emirates, the African Union, and other multilateral partners.\u00a0 The collective aim that we have is to lay the foundation for further negotiations between the parties that we hope can lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities.\nBut in the first instance, we\u2019re working in Jeddah to extend the ceasefire and get agreement on the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Sudan.\u00a0 We continue to engage directly with Sudanese civilian leaders, with Sudanese civilian society with the goal of putting their nation back on the track to civilian democratic governance.\u00a0 That\u2019s the goal that we share and the goal that we will not give up on.\nWe\u2019re also working hand in hand, as we have been for well more than a year now, to provide support for Ukraine as it defends its people and its territory against Russia\u2019s war of aggression.\u00a0 We applaud the UK\u2019s pledge to match in 2023 the $2.3 billion in military support that it provided to Ukraine during the first year of the war.\u00a0 In addition to training of tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, the UK is providing MRS, Challenger 2 tanks, armored vehicles, anti\u2011air missiles, and other military aid that will help equip Ukraine\u2019s defenders as they work to retake more of their nation\u2019s territory in the weeks and months ahead.\nWe also talked about the urgent need to extend and expand the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukraine\u2019s ports to pick up the grain: a cynical action that directly results in less food getting to global markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East, and around the world who need that food.\u00a0 While we\u2019re grateful for the tireless efforts of Secretary-General Guterres and our colleagues in T\u00fcrkiye working to break this impasse, the world shouldn\u2019t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people\u2019s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.\nWe\u2019re teaming up to help rebuild Ukraine from the colossal damage inflicted by Russia\u2019s relentless attacks.\u00a0 Next month, we\u2019ll build on these efforts at the UK-hosted Ukraine Recovery Conference, which will bring together governments like ours with the private sector, with international financial institutions, with multilateral organizations to invest in the future of Ukraine and its people.\nWe also discussed how to meet other challenges to our shared security.\u00a0 In March, the UK released its Integrated Review Refresh 2023 and its assessment of both the challenges that we face and how to effectively address them to work together in that area.\u00a0 I think we see very, very close strategic alignment.\u00a0 That includes when it comes to both our individual relationships and coordinated approach with China, which we discussed today.\nThe vision that James set out a few weeks ago in his speech at Mansion House underscores the shared approach when it comes to key issues like ensuring peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as looking for ways to cooperate with China where we can work together to solve big challenges.\u00a0 That\u2019s what people around the world expect from great powers, and it\u2019s in our collective interest.\nI think it\u2019s also important to note that even as we focused today, as we do, on Ukraine, on some of the challenges represented by our respective relationships with China, we equally focused on a much broader agenda and that is the needs, the concerns, the imperatives for people around the world as they deal, and as we deal, with the impact of climate change, food insecurity \u2013 as I\u2019ve already mentioned \u2013 energy insecurity, global health, trying to provide for more inclusive economic growth through work that we and partners in the G7, as we\u2019re preparing for the leaders\u2019 meeting of the G7, can help advance and support.\u00a0 That agenda is very much the focus of both the United Kingdom and the United States.\nJames said something when we were together recently in Japan that I\u2019ll take the liberty of quoting here.\u00a0 He said, \u201cThe world is a healthier, happier, safer, more prosperous place when the United Kingdom and the United States work closely together, and it\u2019s in our mutual interest to do so.\u201d\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t agree more.\nAnd next month\u2019s visit by Prime Minister Sunak to meet with President Biden will offer us a chance to do even more of that, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to it.\nWith that, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Tony, thank you once again for hosting me here in Washington.\u00a0 It\u2019s always a pleasure to speak with you, to discuss the areas of bilateral interest, as well as the issues which affect the whole world.\u00a0 We did so recently at the G7 with our \u2013 all our friends in the international community.\nAnd thank you also for the kind words that you\u2019ve said on behalf of your nation on the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III and Queen Camilla.\u00a0 Can I also thank the First Lady for joining us at this time of special celebration, a once in a lifetime event made more special because we were able to share it with friends from across the world.\nCan I also put on record our thanks to the United States of America and, indeed, you personally for the huge amount of effort that you have invested in seeking peace in Sudan.\u00a0 It was a situation which unfolded whilst we were meeting at the G7 in Japan, and I commend the effort that you personally put in, engaging with the generals, with the leadership of the warring factions, to try and bring initially a ceasefire and then your ongoing work, the ongoing work of the United States of America, in trying to broker a sustainable peace.\nIt should remind everybody that whilst we are, of course, working on the support that we give to Ukraine and their self-defense \u2013 and I\u2019ll touch upon that again in a moment \u2013 we are not distracted from the pressing issues of the day and we deal with them.\u00a0 We deal with them effectively; we deal with them collaboratively.\u00a0 And we\u2019re able to do so because of the very strong bilateral relationship that our two countries enjoy, a relationship which is invested in regularly by the visits that we make over here.\u00a0 And as you say, I know the prime minister\u2019s very much looking forward to meeting with President Biden when he comes across next month.\nBut also we are very grateful to the President for his recent visit to the United Kingdom to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, a topic which I know is of great interest and passion to him, and we value your country\u2019s engagement on that issue.\nWe remain committed to building peace and prosperity around the world, just as we are attempting to do in Sudan, and we continue to work towards that goal in Ukraine.\u00a0 Every time I come to the United States I make a point of thanking your nation for the scale of support that you have given to Ukraine.\u00a0 You are the largest donor, both in military and economic terms, and I know that your support is incredibly important in their ability to defend themselves against this unprovoked attack from Russia.\nWe, of course, spoke at length about the nature of that support, about the next few months, and the importance to not only look at the context through the prism of the conflict but also to focus on the future rebuilding work that will inevitably be needed.\u00a0 We are very pleased \u2013 the UK is very pleased to host on behalf of Ukraine the Ukraine Recovery Conference, where we will seek to build a coalition that will enable Ukraine to rebuild its country after this conflict has been concluded, after they regain their country back.\u00a0 And we value the United States of America\u2019s coordinating role in ensuring that the private sector as well as the public sector is heavily involved in that reconstruction.\u00a0 From the UK\u2019s point of view, we\u2019ll of course also continue to provide financial and military aid.\u00a0 We intend to give the Ukrainians the tools they need to successfully defend themselves against the invasion.\nBut just as we did with Sudan, we remain focused on the needs of some of the poorest people in the world, and I echo your comments on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 It is completely wrong that Russia uses the hunger of some of the poorest people in the world to pursue leverage during this conflict.\u00a0 They should re-sign the Black Sea Grain Initiative and do so immediately.\u00a0 They should unlock the supply of food to go to those people around the world who need it most.\u00a0 And it is perverse that they are using hunger in the developing world as leverage in their conflict in Ukraine.\nWe did, of course, also have the opportunity to speak about issues on a broader context.\u00a0 And, of course, how we recognize the role that China has in world affairs and how we respond to China\u2019s action will, of course, be an ongoing part of our bilateral discussions.\nI recently gave a major speech on the UK\u2019s posture towards China, which was derived from our recent integrated review refresh.\u00a0 We made the point that we need to defend ourselves as nations \u2013 the UK is doing this, as indeed the United States of America is \u2013 against inappropriate activities by China.\u00a0 We also need to make sure that we build alliances and strengthen the pre-existing alliances that we have, as I\u2019m doing today with the United States of America, but also with our friends in the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 And we have to engage with China directly, robustly, regularly, to seek to influence the decisions that are made in Beijing and do so in a way that benefits the whole world, whether that be on the maintenance of peace across the Taiwan Strait, which of course is something which affects all of us irrespective of where we are in the world, to issues such as climate change, pandemic prevention and response.\nAnd that of course brings us full circle to our bilateral relations with the United States of America.\u00a0 We have been close defense partners.\u00a0 We are intelligence-sharing partners.\u00a0 And of course, we have strong economic ties.\u00a0 And we will seek to find opportunities where the UK can be a strong economic partner to the United States of America as well as being a strong defensive partner as well.\nIt is \u2013 and thank you for reminding me of that quote; I do happen to be rather proud of it \u2013 I think it is in our mutual interest and in the interests of everyone around the world that the UK and U.S. bilateral relationship continues to be one of the points of pride, and one which is strong, and one which I intend to make even stronger still in the future.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Kylie Atwood from CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you both for taking questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I want to just ask you a quick question on China and then pivot to Ukraine.\u00a0 This week, when Ambassador Burns met with the Chinese foreign minister, did they agree to begin planning on your rescheduled visit to Beijing?\u00a0 And then on Ukraine, does Ukraine have what it needs to be successful in winning back at least some of the territory that Russia is now occupying in the upcoming counteroffensive?\nAnd Secretary Cleverly, the same question for you.\u00a0 Does Ukraine have everything it needs to be successful in winning back some of that territory?\u00a0 And then specifically related to international support for Ukraine headed into the coming months and year, there are reports that your country is preparing to send long-range missiles to Kyiv.\u00a0 When could those long-range missiles from the UK and potentially other European allies actually arrive in the country?\u00a0 And we have seen in the past that when the UK moves on an additional military capability for Ukraine, the U.S. has followed suit.\u00a0 In any of your conversations so far, have you gotten indications that that might be the case with long-range missile systems as well?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, thanks very much.\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 With regard to China, I\u2019m obviously not going to go into any detail about the ambassador\u2019s conversations with Chinese counterparts.\u00a0 What I can say is this.\u00a0 What we have communicated to our colleagues in the government in Beijing is the importance from our perspective in engagement, precisely because we have a deeply complicated and also consequential relationship that is important to people in the United States and China, but beyond that around the world; that our two presidents agreed when they met in Bali at the end of last year that it would be important to establish and strengthen our lines of communication; and that we believe that that\u2019s in our interests and also something that the rest of the world expects us to do because there\u2019s an expectation that we will responsibly manage the relationship.\u00a0 And precisely because we have profound differences as well as, I believe, some responsibility not only to manage those differences so that the competition that we have doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, but also the potential where it\u2019s in our mutual interest and where it answers needs that the world has as well to find areas of cooperation, that engagement\u2019s the way that we try to pursue both of those responsibilities.\nSo that\u2019s the nature of the conversation that we\u2019re having with China in this moment, and we\u2019ll see where that goes.\nWith regard to Ukraine, all along, from day one \u2013 in fact, before day one \u2013 it\u2019s been our determination to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 And throughout the more than one year of that aggression, we have worked very hard to adjust at every step of the way to what was needed at any given time; and right now, of course, the focus is on the Ukrainian efforts that we anticipate to try to retake more of the territory that\u2019s been seized from Ukraine by Russia over the last 14-plus months.\nI believe that the efforts that both of us have been deeply engaged in are very productive in terms of what more than I think 50 countries have been able to provide Ukraine.\u00a0 Secretary Austin has been leading a process, as you know, for many months where we have a coordinated process to do that.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said repeatedly, it\u2019s not only the weapons; it\u2019s the training, and the UK has been engaged in significant training.\u00a0 It\u2019s making sure that the Ukrainians can maintain the systems that we provide them.\u00a0 And it\u2019s important, of course, that they have the right plans, again, to be successful.\nMy own estimation is that they have in place across all of those dimensions what they need to continue to be successful in regaining territory that was seized by force by Russia over the last 14 months.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Kylie, thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to take slight issue with one of the elements in your \u2013 in your question, but thank you for highlighting that the UK has been very proactive in our support for Ukraine.\u00a0 We are very proud of the fact that we provided the antitank \u2013 the handheld antitank missile systems ahead of the February of last year\u2019s invasion by Russia, and those pieces of equipment proved very consequential in Ukraine\u2019s defense of Kyiv.\nBut I also think it\u2019s important that we put on record that the United States from the very start has been very active, very effective in its support, and as befits a country of the scale and power of the United States of America, it is the largest donor of the allies.\u00a0 So I wouldn\u2019t want to imply that there\u2019s either kind of competition between us or anything else.\u00a0 We have from the very start worked in close coordination.\nThe nature of our militaries is different.\u00a0 The natures of our political systems are different.\u00a0 There are some things that the UK is able to do more quickly because of the nature of our political system, and there are some things that the American system allows them to do different and better.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about always trying to replicate what our allies do.\u00a0 That\u2019s not the point of an alliance.\u00a0 The point of an alliance is that we support each other, that we reinforce each other in our work to help Ukraine defend itself.\u00a0 And as Secretary Blinken said, we constantly assess and coordinate with each other and with the Ukrainians to make sure that the support that we are giving them matches the needs at the time: those antitank missiles at the early stages, air-defense systems more recently, the training of their ground troops, the provision of armored vehicles and ammunition, and the ability for them to project effective force against Russian troops within Ukraine to push them out of their country.\u00a0 And we will continue to do so.\nIt is a collaborative effort.\u00a0 It has proven to be very, very effective.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve seen over and over again is that the Ukrainian, both politically \u2013 the Ukrainians, both politically and militarily, have learned quickly, have been relentlessly focused on using the support that we give them effectively, and have consistently outperformed expectations \u2013 certainly the expectations of Vladimir Putin.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Your assessment on the long-range missiles that potentially get to them?\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, look, you would, I\u2019m sure, understand that anything to do with operational details about the nature, the timing, the scale of our support would be counterproductive for us to discuss publicly.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Mark Stone with Sky News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you both very much.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, a question for you in a moment, if I may.\u00a0 But first of all, for Foreign Secretary Cleverly:\u00a0 It feels as though support for Ukraine is waning a little bit.\u00a0 You may disagree with that, but you can feel it on Capitol Hill with influential sections of the Republican Party and their base across America skeptical now about the never-ending \u2013 seemingly never-ending support for Ukraine.\u00a0 If Ukrainians don\u2019t deliver a decisive victory over the next few months, how do you \u2013 how does Britain persuade America that they must continue to lead support for a Ukrainian victory?\u00a0 And if you can\u2019t, what then?\nAnd a second question for you, if I can, just a little bit more on the long-range missiles.\u00a0 Can you give us any assessment of whether these long-range missiles will come and what effect that will have on the battlefield?\nAnd then in a moment for you, sir.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, I \u2013 I\u2019ve said this \u2013 why don\u2019t you put your question on record, and then (inaudible) my frame of view \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah, okay.\u00a0 Sorry, I will.\u00a0 Yeah, of course.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I want to focus with you on American priorities, if I may.\u00a0 Since Ukraine \u2013 since the war started, there have been nearly 9,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine, according to the UN.\u00a0 In America this year, in the past five months, 15,000 people have died from gun violence; 70,000 people died last year from opioid overdoses, many of those drugs coming from China.\u00a0 Your argument on defending Ukraine is clear, but with so many fundamental challenges here at home and politicians telling people that security begins at home, how do you maintain support for a battle far away?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 So firstly, on our support for Ukraine \u2013 and when I say \u201cour,\u201d I mean the wider alliance of friends who are supporting Ukraine.\u00a0 This means the UK and the United States of America and others.\u00a0 We need to recognize that the outcome of this conflict will have effect all over the world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said over and over again the eyes of the world are watching.\u00a0 They are watching how we respond to this challenge; they are watching to see our resolve.\u00a0 And whether it be in capital cities or non-state actors, the message that we send now is really important.\nI think the message that we should send is that when we commit to something, we stick with it.\u00a0\u00a0 We have the grit, we have the determination, we have the strategic endurance to see it through until its successful conclusion, and anyone watching should learn that lesson.\nI would also make the point that, of course, there has been an economic impact on people in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 This is not a byproduct of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 This is part of the conflict.\u00a0 Economic coercion through their restrictions of hydrocarbons, pinching off the supply of grain to the developing world \u2013 this is part of the conflict; it\u2019s not a byproduct of the conflict.\u00a0 And we should recognize that if we do not re-establish the principles of the UN Charter \u2013 the foundation stone of peace in the post-Second World War era, that powerful nations cannot invade their neighbors with impunity \u2013 the world will be more dangerous, more expensive, more difficult.\nSo this is not just about Ukraine, though, of course, the Ukrainians have been suffering enormously and it\u2019s right that we defend them.\u00a0 It is about us, and it is in our interest, as well as the Ukrainians\u2019 interest, that we stay resolute in our support, because it will become more painful and more expensive if we do not.\nAnd when it comes to the Ukrainians\u2019 forthcoming counteroffensive, I\u2019ve made the point that this is not a film.\u00a0 There are no certainties when it comes to conflict.\u00a0 The Ukrainians have consistently outperformed expectations, but there can be no guarantees in war.\u00a0 So we have to recognize that we are giving the Ukrainians a huge amount of support \u2013 as I\u2019ve said, they have learned quickly; they have adapted very, very successfully, and they have defended themselves incredibly effectively \u2013 and we need to continue to support them, irrespective of whether this forthcoming offensive generates huge gains on the battlefield, because until this conflict is resolved and resolved properly, it is not over.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the message that I have spoken about back home in the UK and I will continue to say to those friends and colleagues here in the United States of America as well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, I can only violently agree with my friend and strongly endorse what he\u2019s just said.\u00a0 We have exactly the same perspective.\nSecond, I would also dispute the notion of waning support.\u00a0 I would refer you, for example, just recently to the very strong statement made by the Speaker of the House McCarthy about support for Ukraine and the enduring support and determination to see this through.\nBut stepping back, there is not a zero-sum choice between some of the work that we\u2019re doing around the world and the work that we\u2019re doing at home.\u00a0 In fact, to the contrary, they\u2019re directly linked and they\u2019re mutually reinforcing.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent the last couple of years making historic investments in ourselves \u2013 infrastructure, our technological edge when it comes to semiconductors, making sure that the United States would continue to lead when it comes to dealing with climate change and producing the technology of the future, green technology for green economies.\nAt the same time, working closely with our partners, we\u2019ve revitalized, re-engaged our alliances, our partnerships.\u00a0 We\u2019ve built new ones.\u00a0 The net result is that we are stronger at home, and our standing around the world is at I think the highest level that I\u2019ve seen in recent years.\nAnd, of course, we are \u2013 I was going to say walking and chewing gum \u2013 running and chewing gum at the same time.\u00a0 Even as we are engaged in helping Ukraine defend itself against this Russian aggression, for all the reasons the Foreign Secretary laid out \u2013 and, as he said earlier, we are equally focused on a very broad global agenda that addresses the needs and concerns of people around the world as well as our own citizens, and, of course, we\u2019re focused on challenges that we have at home.\nYou mentioned opioids, synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\u00a0 We\u2019re relentlessly focused on that, and that is by definition a problem that is both local and global.\u00a0 We\u2019re in the midst of building a much stronger global coalition to deal with the ravages that fentanyl is producing.\u00a0 In the United States, it\u2019s the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 49.\u00a0 So this is right at the top of our agenda.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re working very hard at home to deal with demand, to deal with treatment, to deal with recovery.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re working very closely, including with our neighbor Mexico, on the law enforcement piece to break up the cartels, to break up the financing, to interrupt the distribution.\u00a0 But more broadly, we\u2019re also working to get at the global network that has the production of some of the chemicals that go into fentanyl being made halfway around the world, and then coming close to us, perhaps getting diverted into the illicit produciton of fentanyl, and then winding up in the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what the coalition that we\u2019re building \u2013 and more on that in the coming weeks \u2013 will work to address.\nWe know that in the United States, when it comes to fentanyl and synthetic opioids, to some extent we\u2019ve been the canary in the coal mine.\u00a0 It hit us first, and it\u2019s hit us very hard.\u00a0 But as the markets become saturated in the United States, we see criminal enterprises trying to make markets elsewhere in the world, including in Europe, including in Asia.\u00a0 And there is a growing awareness and urgency on the part of other countries to making sure that we\u2019re tackling this problem.\nSo that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re not only doing it at home \u2013 we\u2019re doing it by building a very strong partnership with other countries, with the private sector, and other institutions to engage on it.\nSo the bottom line is these are not zero-sum choices.\u00a0 These are responsibilities we have: dealing with challenges we have at home, dealing with challenges we have around the world, and understanding the connections that exist between them.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Shaun Tandon with the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi there.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 Another conflict that\u2019s caused a lot of suffering: Syria.\u00a0 Just two days ago, the Arab League voted to readmit Syria.\u00a0 To both of you, do you see this at all as a failure of the efforts to isolate Assad that have been going on for many years?\u00a0 Specifically to Secretary Blinken, across partisan lines in Congress there are calls to continue using the Caesar Act and other authorities to prevent normalization with Assad.\u00a0 Is this still something that can be done, despite the reconciliation by the Arab League and by T\u00fcrkiye, for that matter, with the Assad regime?\nAnd to Foreign Secretary Cleverly, on that note as well, does the United Kingdom agree with the U.S. approach of no reconstruction aid at this point so long as Assad is there?\u00a0 Is that the approach that you think is beneficial?\nAnd just briefly, if I could ask both of you if you had any \u2013 any thoughts on the events today in Pakistan.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Khan was arrested; there was some violence.\u00a0 If you have any thoughts on that \u2013 thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Shaun, thank you.\u00a0 Let me \u2013 let me address Syria first.\u00a0 A few things on that.\u00a0 We do not believe that Syria merits readmission to the Arab League.\u00a0 It\u2019s a point we\u2019ve made to all of our regional partners, but they have to make their own decisions.\u00a0 And our position is clear:\u00a0 We are not going to be in the business of normalizing relations with Assad and with that regime.\nHaving said that, we also clearly have shared goals when it comes to Syria with our partners.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s reflected in a number of the things that they\u2019ve said.\u00a0 First, ultimately the only solution to the crisis inflicted on Syria by Assad has to be consistent with the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 that lays out expectations for a ceasefire, for humanitarian assistance, and for free and fair elections to ensure that Syrians have a government that actually reflects the will of the Syrian people.\u00a0 We agree on the importance \u2013 the imperative \u2013 of expanding humanitarian access to Syria.\u00a0 We agree on the importance of continuing the work to degrade ISIS or Daesh, to make sure that it can\u2019t re-emerge.\u00a0 And we agree on the importance of reducing Iran\u2019s malign influence and presence in Syria, as well as more broadly in the region.\nSo I think the Arab perspective, as articulated through the Arab League, is they believe that they can pursue these objectives through more direct engagement.\u00a0 But the \u2013 we may have a different perspective when it comes to that, but the objectives that we have I think are the same.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where the focus is.\nI think it\u2019s also fair to say that in terms of what\u2019s happened over the last few years, what we\u2019ve set out to do is to work to try to stabilize as best we could from afar the situation; to ensure, as I said, that ISIS cannot re-emerge in Syria; to expand humanitarian access.\u00a0 And on those criteria I think we\u2019ve actually made some progress.\u00a0 Fewer Syrians have lost their lives in the last few years.\u00a0 It\u2019s unfortunately a low bar given the horrors of the last decade, but that is a fact.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken ISIS leaders off the battlefield to ensure that, again, that organization couldn\u2019t re-emerge in the way that it at one point controlled a huge chunk of Syria and used it as a base for potential attacks around the world.\u00a0 And the humanitarian aid has continued to flow.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve managed to expand it, and we even managed to continue it despite the horrific earthquake in Syria.\nSo I think if you look at those various metrics, we have made some progress.\u00a0 And again, with our Arab partners, even if we disagree on the readmission to the Arab League, the objectives that we have remain the same.\nAnd with regard to Pakistan, of course I\u2019ve seen the reports that you\u2019ve alluded to, and we just want to make sure that whatever happens in Pakistan is consistent with the rule of law, with the constitution.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Shaun, yes.\u00a0 Again, this is an occasion where the UK and the U.S. share very, very similar views.\u00a0 I had a number of conversations with our interlocutors in the region ahead of the formal announcement of Syria\u2019s readmission.\u00a0 I say to you now what I said to our friends in the region, that the UK is very uncomfortable with Syria\u2019s readmission to the Arab League.\u00a0 But as Secretary Blinken said, ultimately is a decision for the membership of the Arab League.\nThe point that I have made is that there needs to be conditionality if they choose to take this course of action, have they done \u2013 as they have done.\u00a0 It needs to be conditional on some fundamental changes of behavior from Damascus and from the Assad regime.\u00a0 The protection of Syrians, if they choose to go back to Syria from the refugee camps in the region, needs to be assured.\u00a0 The Security Council Resolution 2254 needs to be at the heart of any engagement with Syria.\u00a0 And we cannot just wish away the actions of the Assad regime over the last few years; the brutality against Syrian people cannot just be ignored.\u00a0 And the UK certainly won\u2019t brush that under the carpet.\nBut we do recognize that there is a huge amount of pressure on countries in the region.\u00a0 They seek to alleviate that pressure through engagement with the Assad government in \u2013 or the Assad regime in Damascus.\u00a0 (Inaudible) if they are going to do that, then my strong view is that they should make sure that any steps that they take are more than matched by fundamental changes in behavior from the Assad regime and commitments that are then adhered to in line with 2254.\nAgain, with regard to Pakistan, I\u2019ve seen the headlines.\u00a0 I have not yet had the opportunity to be briefed in detail.\u00a0 The UK has a longstanding and close relationship with Pakistan.\u00a0 We are Commonwealth partners.\u00a0 We want to see peaceful democracy in that country.\u00a0 We want to see the rule of law adhered to.\u00a0 I\u2019m uncomfortable to speculate any further without having a detailed briefing on that.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll \u2013 final question \u2013 go to Nick Allen of\u00a0The Telegraph.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 If I could turn to trade, please.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, how do you address concerns on the other side of the Atlantic about the Inflation Reduction Act?\u00a0 What do you say to allies who might feel it\u2019s protectionist at their expense?\nAnd Foreign Secretary, in the absence of an FTA, and with the emergence of the Inflation Reduction Act, what specifically are you pushing for to boost joint economic security and the bilateral investment relationship between the two countries?\u00a0 For example, was there any discussion today about critical minerals and a deal similar to the one with Japan?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I think as we\u2019ve said over these last months, our primary focus with the Inflation Reduction Act was making sure that we\u2019re making the appropriate investments in ourselves to make sure that we can deliver when it comes to continuing to produce the technologies that are necessary both for dealing with the climate crisis and that are going to be, I think, central to 21st century economies.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what the act is all about.\u00a0 This is a historic commitment to dealing with climate and also a historic commitment to making sure that our economy is producing the very things that will be front and center for economies around the world over the next decades.\nBut as we\u2019ve also said very clearly, the intent is broader than that in terms of making sure that, collectively, with countries around the world that have a similar approach and are of similar mind, that we\u2019re working together to build the strongest possible collective infrastructure, supply chains, ecosystem to produce those technologies.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also worked to make sure that to the extent there were any unintended consequences coming from the act, that we\u2019ve addressed those, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working to do, I think successfully, over the recent months.\u00a0 This is not at all zero sum.\u00a0 On the contrary, I think it offers the prospects for a collective race to the top, not a race to the bottom when it comes to both addressing the climate crisis and making sure that our economies are producing the very technologies that are going to be front and center in the 21st century global economy and making sure that our countries collectively are doing that and that we are producing the strongest possible diversified and resilient supply chains.\nAll of these things are connected.\u00a0 I think there are profound benefits in the IRA for many of our partners around the world because, again, we will be increasingly joined in a supply chain that we\u2019ve been working to build.\u00a0 So I suspect that when the prime minister is here, we\u2019ll continue with that conversation.\u00a0 As the foreign secretary said, we continue to look at ways to strengthen and deepen what is already an extraordinarily strong economic partnership between our countries.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Nate, I know FTAs are often used as a shorthand for closer economic partnerships.\u00a0 We are not prioritizing an FTA with the United States of America because there are many areas where we can work more closely, more collaboratively, have real economic coordination that does not require the traditional kind of tariff-reducing elements of an FTA.\nOne of the advantages of being able to speak directly and regularly is the ability to coordinate and make sure that the completely understandable and correct desire of every government to make sure that it protects itself against future economic coercion \u2013 for example, that it protects itself against pinch points of critical elements of its supply chain, and that is right and proper that governments seek to do that.\nBut in doing so, it also seeks the opportunity to work closely with likeminded friends and economic allies in the same way that we are amongst the strongest defensive allies in the world as two member states of NATO.\u00a0 We are intelligence-sharing partners through the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship.\u00a0 The UK is also seeking to build an economic alliance which protects the interests of the United States of America while simultaneously protecting the UK\u2019s interests, protects standards, protects against the use of constrictions of key elements of global supply chains as a form of political or \u2013 as a form of coercion.\nAnd all these things are best done in close coordination, which is why \u2013 whether it\u2019s in Japan or in London or in Washington or anywhere else \u2013 we always take the opportunity to discuss, as we do the situation in Ukraine, those other immediate pressing issues, but also some of the long-term ways that we can work more collaboratively to protect those things that Tony quoted that I\u2019ve said in the past: the things that make us healthier and wealthier and more prosperous and safer.\u00a0 And I have no doubt that when my prime minister comes to the United States next month that\u2019ll be very much on the agenda that he discusses with President Biden.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Burdell \u2013 as America\u2019s next ambassador to France.\u00a0 He\u2019s earned it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, to get down to business.\u00a0 Before we get to where you\u2019re headed, let\u2019s just take a moment to reflect on where you\u2019ve come from, or better said, who you\u2019ve come from. \u00a0The people, as you heard the president say, who helped get you to this day, who always believed in you, even when you were a ramblin\u2019 wreck; the people who put their heads down so that you could lift yours up: moms and dads, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, grandparents, best friends.\nMany of them are here today cheering you on, and those who can\u2019t be, are part of who you are.\nThis is their day, too.\u00a0 So let\u2019s give them big round of applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nClass of 2023, I have to tell you I remember almost nothing about what the commencement speaker said at my college graduation.\u00a0 Not because it was a terrible speech \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 or because it was a long time ago \u2013 it was \u2013 but because my mind was elsewhere.\u00a0 And I suspect that may be the case for many, if not most, of you today.\nGraduation is one of those moments when your past, your present, your future all seem to be converging at once.\u00a0 You feel, rightly, immensely proud of what you\u2019ve achieved \u2013 and, at the same time, maybe a little bit anxious or even outright terrified about what you\u2019ll do next.\u00a0 It\u2019s a time when the question of who you are \u2013 and who you\u2019ll become \u2013 looms large.\nI can tell you from experience:\u00a0 It\u2019s a question you\u2019ll probably be grappling with years to come.\nSo I thought the most useful thing that I could do today is to share a few tips from my own experience about how to navigate the periods of uncertainty that lie ahead.\nFirst, get comfortable with what you don\u2019t know.\nTwo decades ago, I was hired as the staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u00a0 A big part of that job was fielding questions from senators, especially the chairman of the committee \u2013 a guy named Joe Biden \u2013 like how much aid we\u2019d given a foreign country over the last decade, or how long judges served on their supreme court.\nA lot of the time, I didn\u2019t have the answer.\nNow, when you get asked a question you don\u2019t know \u2013 especially by your boss \u2013 it\u2019s easy to feel like everyone will realize you\u2019re an impostor.\u00a0 You might be tempted to wing it \u2013 to fake it \u2018til you make it.\nDon\u2019t do it.\u00a0 Memorize this answer instead: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nI still use this line, including in Cabinet meetings with my boss, who\u2019s now President Biden.\nHere\u2019s why:\u00a0 If you give your boss bad information because you\u2019re too embarrassed to admit that you don\u2019t know, you\u2019re on the way to losing their confidence.\nIt\u2019s getting the right answer that matters, even if it takes some time to find it.\nThat\u2019s important when you\u2019re the one in charge, too, because acknowledging that there are things that you don\u2019t know signals to your team that they can also be honest with you.\nAnd it\u2019s also okay not to have the answers to the big questions like what you\u2019re going to do with your life.\u00a0 Everyone struggles with those.\nNow, you probably wouldn\u2019t know that from people\u2019s Instagram or LinkedIn accounts, where everyone seems to be crushing it.\u00a0 But remember, these are kind of like the real-world versions of George P. Burdell \u2013 they\u2019re highlight reels with the toughest parts edited out.\nYou never know what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s life, so err on the side of grace.\u00a0 And don\u2019t compare their outsides to your insides.\u00a0 Focus on your own journey.\u00a0 Be patient with yourself \u2013 you\u2019ll get there.\u00a0 You just may just need to wander a little bit first.\nWandering is how Buckminster Fuller \u2013 one of our nation\u2019s greatest innovators \u2013 found his way.\nHe was born in 1898[i].\u00a0 He failed out of Harvard \u2013 twice.\u00a0 He joined the Navy; he started a family.\u00a0 He had a successful construction company.\u00a0 Then his world unraveled.\u00a0 He lost his three-year-old daughter to a terrible illness; soon after that, he lost his job.\u00a0 Broke, sad, depressed, he considered two paths: either he would take his own life, or he would fully dedicate himself to serving humanity.\nBucky chose life, but he had no idea where to direct his new sense of purpose.\u00a0 He spent two years rigorously observing the world around him, driven by the belief that nature\u2019s patterns would teach him how to use technology to improve people\u2019s lives.\nHis first discovery was inspired by the triangular structures of spider webs and the branches of trees, which led to his realization that the right combination of tension and compression could make light, flexible structures incredibly strong.\nHe called the principle \u201ctensegrity,\u201d and designed an entire home based on it, whose lightweight parts could fit into a single shipping container.\u00a0 It was Bucky\u2019s answer to affordable and sustainable housing, and when\u00a0Fortune Magazine\u00a0put his prototype on its cover, he received 30,000 unsolicited offers.\nBucky led a wildly prolific life.\u00a0 He earned 25[ii]\u00a0patents in everything from cartography to car design, all focused on serving humanity.\u00a0 To this day, his designs are all around us.\nI was in Montreal recently, and we had a town hall at the U.S. pavilion from the 1967 World Expo \u2013 a geodesic dome that\u2019s over 20 stories high.\u00a0 Bucky designed it.\u00a0 And the mace that Vice Provost Jacobs carried when leading you out onto the field today \u2013 its design is based on Bucky\u2019s principle of tensegrity.\nSo get comfortable with not having answers.\u00a0 The search for them will lead to your most important discoveries.\nSecond, know what you do know \u2013 the principles that guide you \u2013 no matter what changes around you.\nJimmy Carter, of course, spent one of his undergraduate years here at Tech, and he later said that the only way he could \u201cget out\u201d was by getting elected president and then picking up an honorary degree.\u00a0 He had a beautiful saying for our core beliefs, which came from his high school teacher: \u201cWe must adjust to changing times and still hold [to} unchanging principles.\u201d\nThat\u2019s true for individuals; it\u2019s true for nations.\nAs President Biden often says, we\u2019re at an inflection point, when we face defining questions about the future we want and how to get there, including when it comes to technology. The unprecedented leaps in AI and biotech and quantum computing and other fields that you\u2019ve studied are already having a profound effect on the lives that we live, how we live, how we learn, how we work.\nIt can be difficult to keep up, no matter what field you\u2019re working in.\u00a0 At the State Department, I\u2019ve realized that I need scientists and technologists in the room just to tell me whether I need scientists and technologists in the room.\nBut as developments in recent years have made clear, technology \u2013 like any other field \u2013 is not inherently good or bad.\nThis fundamental truth is baked into Georgia Tech\u2019s mission statement, which commits this institution\u00a0\u201cto develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, whether technology makes our societies more or less equitable, whether it promotes or represses human rights, whether it brings us together or drives us apart, that will come down in no small part to what you do.\nThat\u2019s the story of Joy Buolamwini, Tech class of 2012.\u00a0 From the moment she started building websites in high school, she knew that she wanted to use her programming skills to serve other people.\u00a0 But Joy spent almost all her time coding, and little time talking to the people who were using what she made.\nThat changed during her junior year at Tech, when she went to Ethiopia to help the Carter Center build an app to track neglected diseases.\u00a0 That experience pushed Joy to get out into communities where she could interact with people who were using the technology that she was designing.\u00a0 And that contact raised questions, questions she hadn\u2019t grappled with before \u2013 like how seemingly minor choices in language could make people feel excluded, or how to engage people in designing the tools that were intended to serve them.\nJoy found a cardinal direction on her internal compass:\u00a0 Always \u2013 always \u2013 see the people behind the code.\nYears later, she was designing an app that could superimpose the faces of other people \u2013 like one of her heroes, tennis legend Serena Williams \u2013 on top of her own.\u00a0 But the software Joy was using couldn\u2019t detect her face.\u00a0 It only worked if she covered her skin, which was black, with a white mask.\nShe tried out other facial recognition programs \u2013 same result.\nSo she peeled back the code and found the problem:\u00a0 The programs were trained on databases made up mostly of the faces of white men.\u00a0 The result was an algorithm that literally \u2013 literally \u2013 couldn\u2019t see Joy or many other black women.\nBut Joy refused to stay unseen.\u00a0 She took the brave step of calling out the facial recognition software made by big tech companies and the harms that algorithms could cause.\u00a0 She published research; she wrote op-eds; she testified before Congress; she created museum exhibits.\u00a0 She convinced companies to sign onto a pledge limiting their use of facial recognition software, and formed a group of coders to fight for greater equity and accountability in the AI that she continues leads to this day.\nSo like Joy, each of you will have to find points on your compass.\nLet me share one of my own, which has a lot in common with Joy\u2019s:\u00a0 Never lose sight of the people \u2013 the real people \u2013 on the other side of your decisions.\nA great journalist from many years ago, Edward R. Murrow, once told a group of American diplomats that the most crucial connection in international relations is made in the last three feet, by one person talking to another.\nThe more layers there are between us and the people whose lives are affected by our actions \u2013 whether those layers are screens or miles or ideological bubbles \u2013 the easier it is to stop seeing the connections that we can only make in those last three feet, and the easier it is to start seeing people as numbers or statistics \u2013 the other \u2013 rather than as fellow human beings.\nAround the dinner table, when I was growing up, I heard a lot about our country as a beacon of hope.\u00a0 My grandfather came to the United States after fleeing pogroms in Russia.\u00a0 My stepmom found refuge here after fleeing the communist regime in Hungary.\u00a0 And my stepdad was rescued by American GIs after enduring the horrors of the Holocaust.\nSo to this day, when I meet with refugees \u2013 whether they\u2019re Ukrainians uprooted by Russia\u2019s brutal invasion, or Nicaraguans who escaped their country\u2019s repressive regime, or the Syrian and Afghan employees that I met earlier today working here in Atlanta at the Refuge Coffee Shop, I see my own family in their shoes.\nThese meetings are also a chance to hear directly from the men, the women, the children whose fates are too often decided without their voices \u2013 in air-conditioned conference rooms, in policy memos, in spreadsheets.\nNow, some people believe that when it comes to shaping our policies, empathy clouds our judgment rather than clarifies it, and that if we want to advance the interests of the American people, we have to worry less about the hardships and injustices faced by people beyond our borders.\nI\u2019ve never seen it that way.\u00a0 In fact, when I look at the programs that continue to make our country a beacon of hope \u2013 and strengthen our standing in the world \u2013 they almost always are ones where we\u2019ve remembered to see ourselves in others.\nPrograms like the President\u2019s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, which has saved more than 25 million lives and counting in the 20 years since President George W. Bush created it. Programs like the international exchanges that have fostered ties between generations of students, professors, leaders from the United States and other countries \u2013 including President Cabrera \u2013 and I\u2019m so delighted that the Fulbright program can take responsibility and credit for you being here, not to mention your marriage.\u00a0 Programs like our sustained efforts to promote the human rights of women and girls and LGBTQI people around the globe.\nIt\u2019s up close, in those last three feet \u2013 that\u2019s where we remember that the true measure of any policy \u2013 or any app, or any start-up, or any organization, anything else that we do \u2013 is the tangible difference it makes in the lives of our fellow human beings.\nThird and finally, always be open to rethinking the things that you thought you knew.\nThat includes the path you\u2019re on.\u00a0 It\u2019s never too late to change course.\nThat\u2019s what happened to me.\u00a0 I went to law school after college and then headed to a big firm. The job checked a lot of boxes.\u00a0 I had brilliant colleagues, intellectually rigorous work.\u00a0 The salary wasn\u2019t bad, either.\u00a0 But my heart just wasn\u2019t in it.\u00a0 So one year, ten months, two weeks, three days, and five hours after I started, I quit.\nSome of my best friends while I was in law school were film students, and a few of them had recently started a production company.\u00a0 So when I left, they asked me if I wanted to join them, and I said yes.\nI loved movies, and the idea of being part of building something from the ground up was incredibly exciting.\nWe produced a handful of films \u2013 including one about a brooding student-turned-vampire \u2013 no, not Twilight \u2013 and we put on a film festival in New York.\u00a0 But most of the creativity was coming from the writers, the directors, the actors \u2013 not me.\u00a0 Collaborating with them made clear they had gifts that I did not.\nAnd as much as I love movies, I was looking out at a world that was changing quickly, and I was feeling the pull to be a part of it.\u00a0 Apartheid was coming to an end in South Africa.\u00a0 The Soviet Union had collapsed.\u00a0 The people of newly independent nations were finding their own way.\u00a0 There were peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, a growing ethnic conflict in the Balkans.\nI wanted to get involved; I just didn\u2019t know how.\nThen I caught a break.\u00a0 Someone that I\u2019d worked for years earlier told me about an opening for an assistant job at the State Department.\u00a0 I applied \u2013 and I got it.\nNow, it was a pretty junior position.\u00a0 My first office \u2013 well, let me put it this way.\u00a0 The previous occupant of my first office was a very large safe, so that gives you some idea about what the office was like \u2013 basically, a windowless closet.\nBut from day one, I was hooked.\u00a0 Diplomacy felt urgent, challenging, directly connected to improving people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 It was a way to serve my country, which I badly wanted to do.\u00a0 I felt grateful every morning walking into work.\u00a0 I still do.\nNow, I\u2019m biased, but I think you might feel the same way.\u00a0 So I hope that some of you will consider putting your skills toward public service \u2013 maybe even toward making our foreign policy better \u2013 for the good of Americans, for the good of people around the world.\u00a0 We need your help.\nIn my case, it took a few tries, but I found my place.\nAnd I learned something important along the way:\u00a0 I had to be open to starting over.\u00a0 When things didn\u2019t turn out the way I hoped, I had to change my experience, not my expectations.\nLong before he was President, Jimmy Carter was a young dad with three small kids and a promising career in the Navy\u2019s nuclear submarine program.\u00a0 One day he got a call that his father, Earl, who was sick with cancer, was dying.\nJimmy drove from his base in New York to Plains, Georgia \u2013 a town of around 600 people where he\u2019d grown up.\nNow, Earl Carter, his dad, cast a big shadow in Plains, and Jimmy had worked hard to get out from under that shadow.\u00a0 But there was something about reflecting on his dad\u2019s life during that visit that planted a question in Jimmy.\u00a0 Not only was the family peanut farm one of the town\u2019s biggest employers, but Earl was a church deacon, a leader in the Elks club.\u00a0 He served on the local school and hospital boards.\u00a0 When kids in Plains couldn\u2019t afford clothes for graduation, the teachers told Earl and he donated them, anonymously.\nIf the family business went under, Jimmy knew the town would go with it.\nSeeing the community that his dad had worked so hard to build made Jimmy wonder whether it made sense and what it would be like if he tried something similar.\nAfter Earl died, Jimmy struggled with whether he should move his family back to Plains.\u00a0 And on paper, it made no sense.\u00a0 The family business was deep in debt, and he knew little about farming or running a business.\u00a0 He had a bright future ahead in the Navy.\u00a0 But he went back anyway.\nHis superiors thought he was crazy.\u00a0 His wife, Rosalynn, was so mad she refused to talk to him except through their kids.\u00a0 The first year, the farm earned $280.\nBut Jimmy found something different in Plains \u2013 something that he\u2019d been missing for years that he hadn\u2019t been able to put his finger on: a sense of community.\u00a0 And as he and Rosalynn turned the business around, he threw himself into local service: getting involved in the Lions Club, the Boy Scouts, the school, hospital, and library boards, in his church.\u00a0 Then he decided to run for a state senate seat, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nClass of 2023, you have a mantra here at Georgia Tech: \u201cWe can do that.\u201d\nAnd it rings true for so many of our shared hopes and ambitions \u2013 far beyond this campus.\nBut I would humbly suggest, as Zaria also suggested, that the most important in \u201cWe can do that\u201d is not \u201cdo\u201d but \u201cwe.\u201d\nWe can do that \u2014 whether that \u201cwe\u201d is a family, a campus, a city, a country, or the world.\nThat\u2019s certainly true today.\u00a0 Think about your experience.\u00a0 Look around.\u00a0 No one gets out by doing it alone.\u00a0 You got out because you did it together.\nAnd I\u2019m confident that as you reflect back on how you made it to this day, behind everything you\u2019ve done and everything you\u2019re proud of, there is a \u201cwe.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the one constant in navigating all the uncertainty that you\u2019ll face \u2013 whether that\u2019s getting through the times when you don\u2019t have the answers, or figuring out the principles that will anchor you in life, or keeping yourself open to rethinking the things that you thought you knew\u00a0\u2013 you must always, always be guided by people you love and trust.\nAnd so, esteemed graduates, don\u2019t forget:\u00a0 The key to navigating all uncertainty is never trying to do it alone.\nFind your \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 and there\u2019s absolutely nothing you cannot do.\nThank you, and congratulations!\n(Applause.)\n[i] 1895\n\n[ii]\u00a028\n\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken Following a Tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Atlanta, Georgia", "date": "May 5, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It really is a pleasure for me to be here at the Centers for Disease Control to spend some time with our colleagues with whom we have an extraordinary partnership between the CDC and the State Department.\u00a0\u00a0 But I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t start first by saying that we send our deepest condolences to the family, the friends of Amy St. Pierre, a member of the CDC community who was killed in the recent violence in Atlanta, someone who dedicated her career to working on maternal health issues and I know was a treasured member of this community.\u00a0 So we\u2019re thinking of her today as we\u2019re here.\nI also want to say at the outset that it was a coincidence but nonetheless powerful to be here with the director, Rochelle Walensky.\u00a0 She\u2019s announced she\u2019s leaving the CDC.\u00a0 She has been an extraordinary leader of this enterprise.\u00a0 She\u2019s made our country healthier and safer.\u00a0 She\u2019s made countries around the world healthier and safer.\u00a0 I could not be more grateful for the collaboration that we\u2019ve had during the time she\u2019s directed the CDC, and our institutions continue that collaboration every single day.\nWe have CDC experts in more than 60 of our embassies around the world, really the front-line defense for the United States in terms of detecting and then dealing with the outbreak of infectious disease.\u00a0 And we all know \u2013 we\u2019ve all experienced over the last few years \u2013 just how something that starts halfway around the world can have the most profound impact imaginable right here in the United States.\u00a0 So that front line of defense, that collaboration with the CDC in country after country, is making a huge difference.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a difference in spotting something as it emerges.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a big difference in helping build the capacity of partner countries to better detect, prevent, deal with the emergence of disease.\nThat remains a vital collaboration.\u00a0 But there is so much more that we\u2019ve been doing together for many years, working together, particularly on HIV/AIDS around the world through the PEPFAR program initiated by former President Bush, where as a result of that program we have helped save well more 20 million lives.\u00a0 And we\u2019re determined to see that it\u2019s reauthorized and to make sure that we complete the mission, because we\u2019re very close to getting that done, eradicating HIV/AIDS around the world as a killer.\nWe\u2019re dealing now together with Marburg and an outbreak that we\u2019ve seen in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania, where again the CDC and the State Department are joined at the hip in working with the host governments in dealing with that outbreak and trying to make sure that it doesn\u2019t go any further than it\u2019s already gone.\nAnd more broadly, we are working together to try to build up genuine global health security in a sustainable way.\u00a0 The thing that we\u2019ve learned powerfully in recent years is that health security is national security.\u00a0 We know that when health security breaks down, it\u2019s almost inevitably going to have an impact on our national security.\u00a0 As disease outbreaks that go uncontrolled and unmanaged, we have everything from, potentially, societal breakdowns to mass migrations, all of which have a profound impact on national security.\nSo one of the things that we\u2019re doing at the State Department \u2013 another reason for this visit today \u2013 is we\u2019re standing up for the first time a Global Health Bureau in our department to make sure that we\u2019re marshaling all our resources in effectively responding to global health challenges.\u00a0 And we\u2019re also here to learn from the experience of the CDC and to integrate into that effort to stand up this bureau some of the experiences, some of the learning, some of the ways that CDC has done things that will help shape what we\u2019re doing at the State Department.\nFinally, right now the number one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49 are synthetic opioids, fentanyl \u2013 the number one killer.\u00a0 Last year we seized enough fentanyl to kill every single American citizen.\u00a0 So the State Department is working aggressively to build an international coalition to help more effectively deal with the fentanyl challenge because it\u2019s by definition a global challenge, an international problem.\u00a0 The precursors that go into making fentanyl often are manufactured somewhere else in the world.\u00a0 They wind up coming toward us, turned into a synthetic opioid, and then they wind up on our streets and kill Americans.\u00a0 So we need global collaboration, global cooperation, as part of dealing with this challenge.\nHere again, CDC is a critical partner, learning from them some of the best practices that they\u2019ve put into dealing with things like fentanyl, synthetic opioids, sharing some of those best practices with our partners around the world \u2013 that\u2019s going to make a difference in combating what is one of the worst scourges that we face as a country.\nSo in these areas and so many more, this partnership, this collaboration, is an essential part of our national security.\u00a0 It\u2019s an essential part of our foreign policy.\u00a0 And to have the opportunity to come here today to be with the leaders of the CDC, to learn from them, and to look at how we\u2019re going to pursue this partnership going forward is a very important part of my agenda.\u00a0 So I\u2019m grateful to our colleagues here, grateful for the collaboration, and very much looking forward to the work ahead.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-american-foreign-service-association-memorial-plaque-ceremony/",

Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "May 5, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good morning, everyone.\nPresident Rubin \u2013 Eric \u2013 thank you for making this event happen.\u00a0 To you, to the American Foreign Service Association, the DACOR Bacon House Foundation, the Senior Living Foundation: we are so grateful for everything that you do to support our diplomats.\nAs Eric said, I\u2019m also very gratified that we\u2019re all here today in person once again.\u00a0 It makes today even more meaningful.\nTo every member of our foreign affairs agencies, whether you\u2019re serving now or whether you served in the past, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the critical work that you do.\u00a0 Thank you for your dedication, your professionalism, your patriotism \u2013 all that you bring to our missions around the world.\nAs President Biden often says, we find ourselves now at an inflection point.\u00a0 So many of the actions that we take today are going to shape the lives of the American people for decades to come \u2013 whether that\u2019s meeting the challenge of great power competition, addressing the climate crisis, shaping the rules for emerging technologies, working to prevent the next pandemic.\nThese challenges make our diplomacy more critical than it\u2019s ever been.\nAnd it\u2019s only by working with allies, with partners that we can actually solve these problems \u2013 and seize some of the opportunities \u2013 that are too big for any one nation to face alone.\u00a0 And you are the ones leading the charge \u2013 following in the footsteps of generations of extraordinary public servants.\nLast year, more than 800 members of the Foreign and Civil Service retired, having devoted decades of their lives to this institution and to the American people.\nAltogether, that cohort dedicated over 22,000 years of service to our country.\u00a0 Its members worked in every single bureau in this department, at posts in more than 170 countries.\nThey tackled the most important issues of our time: protecting the environment, defending human rights, aiding refugees, expanding economic opportunity, negotiating peace agreements.\nThis class built and deepened ties between the United States and other countries.\u00a0 They forged new partnerships.\u00a0 They facilitated exchange programs.\u00a0 They issued countless visas and passports.\nTheir actions, big and small, changed the trajectory of so many lives, here and around the world.\nBut today, we celebrate not only what our diplomats do, but how they do it.\nThese jobs, as President Rubin said, require extraordinary sacrifice \u2013 from diplomats who work long hours; from their loved ones who support them.\nThese jobs demand character.\u00a0 They demand integrity.\nAnd serving as a diplomat also requires courage.\u00a0 Right now, around the world, our colleagues are working in war zones, under foreign surveillance, amidst humanitarian crises, in the aftermath of natural disasters.\u00a0 Some experience serious accidents abroad; others are exposed to severe illness or health hazards.\u00a0 Some of our LGBTQI colleagues serve in places where they \u2013 and their partners \u2013 don\u2019t feel safe to be their full selves.\nJust this week, we lost a treasured local staff member at Embassy Lisbon, Rui Noronha, who died in the course of his duty.\u00a0 His family\u2019s loss is our loss, too.\nBut our diplomats face these situations with tremendous heart, with compassion, with decency, focusing not on themselves, but on helping the people around them, who often go through some of the hardest days of their lives.\nSimply put, that\u2019s our mission.\u00a0 And for generations, our diplomats have carried on despite danger, despite difficulty.\nNowhere is that devotion more clearly illustrated than in the 312 individuals honored on our Memorial Walls \u2013 those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\nThis year, we pay special tribute to two more members of the Foreign Service: Thomas Wallis and Elbridge Lee, both of whom died from COVID-19 in 2021.\nTom dedicated his life to public service \u2013 first as a soldier in the U.S. Army, where he completed several tours, and was awarded a Bronze Star.\u00a0 Then, he became a consular officer.\u00a0 He brought a spirit of service to everything that he did.\u00a0 Tom had a special fountain pen that he used only to sign certificates of death abroad \u2013 to make sure that they looked dignified for the families who received them.\u00a0 When he sat at the consular window \u2013 working with foreigners or helping Americans in crisis \u2013 Tom was calm, he was friendly, he was easy to talk to.\u00a0 He also lifted up his team.\u00a0 He was the kind of person who would stop by his supervisor\u2019s office, just to let her know that a coworker had done a great job.\u00a0 He brought this kindness everywhere he went: from the animal rescue organizations he supported around the world, to trivia games, where he was always everyone\u2019s first pick, apparently, to be on their team.\nElbridge \u2013 who went by his last name, Lee \u2013 specialized in information management, and by all accounts he was a natural diplomat.\u00a0 Thoughtful, compassionate, a talented problem-solver.\u00a0 Whether you were a colleague, a friend, a family member, if you needed advice, you went to Lee.\u00a0 And people wanted to be like him.\u00a0 One of his former teammates said that, in tough situations, he found himself asking, \u201cWhat would Lee do?\u201d\u00a0 Lee was proud to be an American, proud to serve his country.\u00a0 So much so that it rubbed off on the people around him, especially those closest to him.\u00a0 Years ago, he encouraged his wife, Josie, to apply to the State Department.\u00a0 She still works here today.\u00a0 His eldest daughter, Naomi, said that her interest in the world and the people in it came from her dad.\u00a0 And when his youngest daughter, Esther, starts college this fall, she\u2019s planning on studying international relations.\nThe State Department \u2013 the United States of America \u2013 are better because of Tom and Lee.\u00a0 Because of their service, but also because of who they were as people.\nTo their family \u2013 Tom\u2019s wife, Monica; Lee\u2019s wife, Josie, their daughters, Naomi and Esther \u2013 we will be forever grateful, grateful that we got to know \u2013 and that we got to work alongside \u2013 your exceptional loved ones.\nWith this new plaque, we honor the permanent mark that they made on this department, and on our country.\nAnd by carrying out their dedication and compassion \u2013 and continuing the spirit of service that runs through every single name on these walls \u2013 we will work to keep their legacies alive.\nMay God bless you.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-bilateral-peace-negotiation-closing-session-with-armenian-foreign-minister-ararat-mirzoyan-and-azerbaijani-foreign-minister-jeyhun-bayramov/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

I want to start by thanking our colleagues, both foreign ministers, their delegations for traveling here and for spending the time here in \u2013 at the Foreign Service Institute, and especially for their commitment to dialogue, and I think a recognition on the part of both Armenia and Azerbaijan that the only path to a lasting, durable peace is through dialogue.\u00a0 The United States is very happy to continue to offer its support, its engagement, its good offices to host this discussion and any future ones toward an enduring peace.\u00a0 That is the objective.\nThe two sides have discussed some very tough issues over the last few days and they\u2019ve made tangible progress on a durable peace agreement.\u00a0 I hope that they see \u2013 and I believe that they do, as I do \u2013 that there is an agreement within sight, within reach.\u00a0 And achieving that agreement would be, I think, not only historic, but would be profoundly in the interests of the people of Azerbaijan and Armenia, and would have very positive effects even beyond their two countries.\nI think the pace of the negotiations and the foundation that our colleagues have built shows that we really are within reach of an agreement.\u00a0 The last mile of any marathon is always the hardest; we know that.\u00a0 But the United States is here to continue to help both of our friends cross the finish line.\u00a0 And as I say, I think we\u2019re very much within reach of that.\nI have to say, finally, that the leadership that we\u2019re seeing from both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and from my friends the foreign ministers, is inspiring.\u00a0 None of this is easy, but the commitment, the determination to move forward, to deal with the remaining challenging issues is real.\u00a0 And we feel, coming out of these few days, that, as I said, we\u2019ve made very tangible progress.\u00a0 A final agreement is within reach, and we\u2019re determined to continue to help our friends achieve it.\nSo with thanks to both of you, to both of your delegations, as well as to Prime Minister Pashinyan and President Aliyev for sending you here.\u00a0 I thank everyone, and we look forward to continuing.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-closing-remarks-at-the-2023-selectusa-investment-summit/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Good morning, everyone, and it is wonderful to see all of you here, so many of you here.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite an extraordinary turnout.\u00a0 And Don, thank you very much for that introduction and also \u2013 and more important \u2013 my thanks to you and to my good friend, Secretary Gina Raimondo, and the entire team at the Commerce Department for the work that you\u2019re doing every single day to drive economic opportunity for the American people and for our partners.\nSo it really is a pleasure for me to be here at the United States\u2019 biggest investment summit with business leaders from every part of the world, including thousands of foreign investors and representatives from the American private sector.\nA very warm welcome as well to the hundreds of city and state leaders here with us today.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the critical role that you\u2019re playing in attracting and welcoming new businesses into your communities and reminding private and public investors alike why it is always a good bet to invest in America.\nSo throughout this week, this group has heard from leaders across the U.S. Government on why the United States is the best place in the world to invest: our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, driving new products and solutions at scale; a world-class system of universities and colleges, fueling ideas and fostering talent; our rule of law, protecting intellectual property, worker rights, fostering growth.\nToday, what I thought I\u2019d do is just briefly lay out how we\u2019re building on these advantages to try to make the United States an even stronger and more attractive place to invest, to do business.\u00a0 And the short answer really is this: first and foremost, by investing in ourselves.\nWe\u2019ve made, as you know, historic investments in our competitiveness with legislation like the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \u2013 transformative laws that make America an even better place to do business, with more resilient supply chains, a stronger and more inclusive workforce, more regional innovation and technology hubs, improved infrastructure, including new roads, rail transit, waterways, airports, as well as expanded fast and free broadband across our entire country.\nBut investment in ourselves is not a zero-sum proposition.\u00a0 Our approach is predicated on building a strong, resilient, and advanced industrial base with our partners around the world.\u00a0 We can\u2019t build everything domestically, nor would we want to, because it\u2019s to our collective benefit to have diversified supply chains across all of our partners.\nWe\u2019re also trying to modernize our economic partnerships to better position us to address the challenges and opportunities of this moment that we share: from combating the climate crisis, to tackling corruption, to driving sustainable economic growth.\u00a0 New initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity will both protect our national and economic security, and that of our partners \u2013 creating closer connections between our countries, more opportunities for our businesses to invest and to thrive.\nAnd we\u2019re using existing bodies to produce results for our people, like the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, through which we\u2019re coordinating our industrial strategies to be complementary to one another.\nThis approach is delivering results.\nSince 2021, the private sector has invested more than $435 billion in businesses across the United States.\u00a0 A third of the investments announced since August have involved a foreign investor.\u00a0 There\u2019s also record demand for our international business leaders to come to the United States, and that\u2019s something that my department is working to facilitate.\nSo far this fiscal year, we have already issued nearly double the number of business visas that we did at this point last year, and we\u2019ve also surpassed the number of business visas that were issued before the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 so that entrepreneurs and investors can attend professional conferences, negotiate contracts, work with their associates, do the countless things that they do to run successful businesses.\nAs has been very evident this week, there is tremendous pent-up demand for more business travel, so we\u2019re devoting more resources and streamlining our processes to help you secure business and work visas for yourself and for your employees.\nOur Bureau of Consular Affairs stands ready to help.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made it easier to apply for these visas, including by launching the Business Visa Center.\u00a0 That\u2019s a one-stop-shop to help international investors access visas for business travel.\u00a0 Later this year, we\u2019ll be piloting a program to make it easier to renew some of our temporary work visas from within the United States instead of having to traveling abroad.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to save time and it\u2019s going to reduce uncertainty for employers.\nIf you go back to 2011, since then this conference has helped bring in more than $80 billion in private investment.\u00a0 It\u2019s supported more than 60,000 jobs in the United States while helping thousands of foreign businesses and investors enter the U.S. market, to the benefit of themselves, their economies, their fellow citizens back home.\nThese partnerships have also helped us advance critical foreign policy priorities \u2013 something that needless to say I\u2019m focused on.\nAt last year\u2019s SelectUSA Summit, the CEO of Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer GlobalWafers, Doris Hsu, announced plans for a new state-of-the-art facility in Sherman, Texas.\u00a0 It will be the largest facility of its kind in the United States.\u00a0 GlobalWafers broke ground last December, and once completed, this $5 billion facility will support more than 1,500 jobs in the United States.\u00a0 But it will also fill a critical gap in our advanced semiconductor supply chain \u2013 crucial to preserving our competitiveness on a technology that is foundational to the 21st century economy.\nOr consider the example of Delfast, a Ukrainian e-bike company that helped us confront the climate crisis by creating a zero-carbon transportation option.\u00a0 Thanks to the connections that they made with American partners at the SelectUSA Summit last year, as well as ongoing support from our embassy in Ukraine, Delfast was able to open its first store in the United States in September 2021 in Whittier, California.\u00a0 They are growing very quickly in the United States, with 70 percent of their customer base located in this country.\u00a0 In fact, Delfast has been so successful that they\u2019ve announced plans to invest another $25 million in their U.S. operations over the next year, next several years.\u00a0 That will create another 200 jobs in Whittier.\u00a0 And we\u2019re joined by representatives from dozens of Ukrainian startups similarly taking advantage of SelectUSA to thrive.\nNow, I know Delfast just won the premier award that we issue from this gathering.\u00a0 My only disappointment was that in the long journey from my car through the back stage all the way to the stage, I didn\u2019t get a chance to use one of their e-bikes, but maybe on the way out.\nGlobalWafers, Delfast, hundreds of other companies have used this summit to gain the connections and the know-how to enter the United States market.\u00a0 The State Department stands ready to help your company do the same thing.\nWe have 200 Economics and Business Affairs officers in Washington, D.C., and 1,500 economic officers in our embassies and consulates around the world, across more than 150 countries. \u00a0All have the responsibility to help foreign businesses find the strongest investment opportunities here in the United States.\u00a0 They, along with our colleagues in the Department of Commerce\u2019s Foreign Commercial Service, will be able to help you navigate legal frameworks in the United States, connect you with potential partners, and answer any questions that you\u2019ve got along the way.\nSo to our international visitors here today:\u00a0 The United States is very much open for business, and we hope you choose to invest your time and your talents with us.\nAnd to the U.S. businesses that are here today:\u00a0 We are standing by to continue supporting everything that you\u2019re doing as you grow your businesses both here in the United States and around the world.\nIf the innovation, the dynamism on display here this week is any indication, we have a lot to look forward to, a lot to be optimistic about.\u00a0 So to each and every one of you, thank you for being here.\u00a0 Thank you for taking part.\u00a0 We look forward to doing a lot of good business together in the years ahead.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "May 3, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0The only thing better than having the Secretary of State on the screen is having the Secretary of State in person.\u00a0 We\u2019re very happy that Secretary of State Blinken could join us today to celebrate, commemorate World Press Freedom Day.\nIn our business, we like to cover the story; we worry that we\u2019re becoming the story.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had 67 journalists and media workers who were killed last year.\u00a0 We have about 570 who are in prison around the world in 30 different countries.\u00a0 We have a problem.\u00a0 And I want to ask you about the case that we\u2019re focused on most immediately right now, which is that of\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporter Evan Gerschkovich.\u00a0 Tell us about the efforts the State Department has made to get Evan free, and \u2013 in particular I\u2019m curious whether you\u2019ve been able to talk \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Excuse us.\u00a0 We can\u2019t use this day without calling for the freedom of Julian Assange.\nSTAFF:\u00a0 Come on, you got to go.\u00a0 Come on, you go to go.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 The Biden administration must (inaudible) Julian Assange.\u00a0 Stop the extradition request of Julian Assange.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 What about \u2013 two hours and not one word about (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Take it easy.\u00a0 Take it easy.\u00a0 Take it easy guys.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Not one word about journalist Shireen Abu-Akleh, who was murdered \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 by the Israeli occupation forces in Palestine.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Not one word about Julian Assange.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019re here to celebrate freedom of expression, and we just experienced it.\u00a0 Let me continue, Mr. Secretary, to ask you about Evan Gerschkovich and your efforts to get him free.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first, David it\u2019s very good to be here, to be with you.\u00a0 This is an important day.\u00a0 It\u2019s a somber day, for the reasons that my alter ego cited just a few minutes ago.\u00a0 We know that journalists around the world are increasingly under siege \u2013 under siege in a whole variety of ways.\u00a0 That\u2019s now manifested itself once again very powerfully in Evan\u2019s detention and incarceration, in Moscow \u2013 profoundly, unjustly \u2013 for doing his job.\u00a0 We\u2019re intensely engaged with the Russians to seek his freedom, to seek his immediate release \u2013 short of that, just to get what Russia\u2019s obligated to provide, which is consular access, which they\u2019ve done once but have yet to repeat.\nOur Ambassador Lynne Tracy had a chance to be with Evan about ten days ago; found him of incredibly strong of mind and spirit, which is a very powerful thing in this situation.\u00a0 But we have a country in the case of Russia that like a handful of other countries around the world is wrongfully detaining people, using them as political pawns, using them as leverage in a practice that is absolutely unacceptable and that we\u2019re working both broadly to try to deter \u2013 but also at the same time to try to secure the release of those who are being unjustly detained.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0And let met ask, Mr. Secretary, whether you\u2019ve talked directly to your Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, about this.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I have.\u00a0 I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov shortly after Evan was detained. \u00a0I haven\u2019t spoken to him since.\u00a0 I made clear the imperative of releasing Evan.\u00a0 I made clear the imperative of getting consular access.\u00a0 We did get consular access after that.\u00a0 We have a channel that President Biden and President Putin established, some time ago, to try to work on these cases, so we\u2019re engaged.\u00a0 I wish I could say that in this moment there was a clear way forward.\u00a0 I \u2013 we don\u2019t have that in this moment, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working every single day.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ve done something unusual in these cases, which is to impose the Levinson Act and declare the FSB, the Russian secret police, as a target of your sanctions because of wrongful detention.\u00a0 Tell us about that, whether that was a difficult choice to make, and what specific leverage that\u2019s going to give you in getting freedom for Evan.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Look, the Levinson Act is an important tool.\u00a0 It gives us different and new authorities to try to go at those who are directly engaged in wrongfully detaining journalists or wrongfully detaining our citizens.\u00a0 It includes things like travel bans, like asset freezes.\u00a0 And, look, I think it\u2019s clear that in some cases the individuals who are sanctioned may not be planning to travel to the United States anyway; we have to acknowledge that \u2013 or many not have assets here.\u00a0 But our hope is that by applying it, we can have a chilling affect on those who would engage in these practices going forward.\nThere\u2019s something else, though, that\u2019s going on.\u00a0 For a country like Russia that has already severely isolated itself by its aggression against Ukraine, these acts only further its isolation.\u00a0 Increasingly, the message is don\u2019t come here, don\u2019t travel here; whoever you are, you risk being pulled off the street and thrown in jail \u2013 and that is only going to deepen Russia\u2019s isolation.\u00a0 As we speak, to my knowledge there are no reporters of American nationality in Russia.\u00a0 There are about 20 Russians who are formally accredited here with state media organizations.\u00a0 But if this is applied across the board, and you see more and more countries, and the nationals of more and more countries saying \u201cI\u2019m not going there,\u201d that is simply going to further detach Russia from the world, and that is profoundly not in Russia\u2019s interest.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0As someone who has personally been sanctioned by Russia, this has meaning for me.\u00a0 I want to ask you about another\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0colleague, and that is our contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza.\u00a0 He is not a U.S. citizen, but his wife is.\u00a0 He\u2019s been a permanent resident \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 in Washington and his two children \u2013 his children are citizens.\u00a0 Why isn\u2019t he included in your declarations about wrongful detention, which would have some force in leaving the 25-year \u2013 the harsh, harsh sentence that was just imposed on him?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So first, we deplore what is being done to him.\u00a0 Second, when it comes to determinations of wrongful detention, it\u2019s a process.\u00a0 And there are clear criteria, but it\u2019s also true that these cases evolve.\u00a0 And as we learn more, as we fully understand the circumstances, the details as we are able to look at how people similarly situated are being treated, that \u2013 all of that goes into a determination of wrongful detention.\u00a0 So these determinations are not typically made immediately; there is a process and criteria that we apply.\u00a0 And that does not in any way prejudge what we might do coming up as we continue to look at that case and others.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So, just because it\u2019s important, obviously, to his family and to those of us here at the\u00a0Post, I understand you to be saying that the State Department is still examining whether you might \u2013\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s correct.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 \u2014 declare him as wrongfully detained.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That is correct.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And when do you think you might make that decision?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to put a timeframe on it.\u00a0 Again, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at constantly.\nThe other thing I\u2019d say is this, because I think it\u2019s important:\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to fight back and push back around the world to help journalists, who \u2013 in one way or another, are facing intimidation, coercion, persecution, prosecution, surveillance.\u00a0 We have a fund, a technology fund, to try to get technology in the hands of journalists and other civil society advocates to make sure that they can continue even in a surveillance state to communicate with each other and to be connected to the outside world.\u00a0 We have a defamation fund, because increasingly what we\u2019re seeing in country after country is the use of lawfare, trying to put journalists and put media enterprises out of business by litigation.\u00a0 We now have a defamation fund that journalists and independent media can tap into to help defend themselves.\u00a0 We have a program to try to help journalists protect themselves \u2013 physically, or in cyberspace \u2013 from intimidation and coercion by states.\u00a0 We contribute tens of millions of dollars into a media freedom fund for independent media to bolster their capacity to continue doing business even in very difficult places.\u00a0 And we\u2019re part of a Media Freedom Coalition, about 52 countries, pooling resources, pooling information, sharing expertise and knowledge with journalists and independent media enterprises around the world.\nSo, it\u2019s not just a matter of putting a spotlight on this, as we do every day.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just a matter of engaging country after country where journalists are being in one way or another mistreated.\u00a0 We\u2019re actually trying to get tools in the hands of journalists and independent media so that they can push back, so that they can sustain what they\u2019re doing.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful, obviously, for the support of all countries in the United Nations, the United States leading among them, in recognizing World Press Freedom Day and taking this issue seriously, as Secretary-General Guterres did in his comments this week.\nI want to ask you briefly about another\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0colleage \u2013 I wish this list was shorter \u2013 and that\u2019s Austin Tice, who was a contributor to\u00a0The Washington Post, who\u2019s been missing in Syria now for many years.\u00a0 His mother, Debra, told CBS News this week that she wants to see the same urgency and commitment that she hears from top levels trickle down through the State Department, throughout the administration, and that the assurances that have been given that her son will someday be free be realized.\u00a0 What would be your response to Debra Tice, Austin\u2019s mother?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well first, David, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet with Debra Tice on a couple of occasions.\u00a0 I can\u2019t begin to tell you my admiration for her, the extraordinary courage that she and the family have shown, the resilience that they\u2019ve shown.\u00a0 I can\u2019t begin to put myself in her shoes \u2013 almost 11 years now that Austin has been taken and separated from her, from his family, from his friends.\u00a0 And her absolute determination, relentless determination to do everything in her power to push for his freedom is beyond admirable.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really \u2013 I think humility in the face of that is what really comes to mind.\nAnd I know when you\u2019re in the shoes of someone like Debra Tice \u2013 and unfortunately we have 60 or so American families who have their loved ones wrongfully detained somewhere around the world; I\u2019ve met virtually or in person with every single one of them \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly frustrating, because you want to see something happening every single day.\u00a0 And often we\u2019re engaged in efforts to get people home that we can\u2019t talk about even with the families.\nWhat I can say is this:\u00a0 We\u2019re extensively engaged with regard to Austin \u2013 engaged with Syria, engaged with third countries \u2013 seeking to find a way to get him home.\u00a0 And we\u2019re not going to relent until we do.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Let\u2019s \u2013 as more Arab countries establish diplomatic relations with Syria, that\u2019s one hope that we have, is that that leverage will be used to get freedom for him.\nBefore we leave this general topic, I want to ask you a question from a member of our audience, which is a good one.\u00a0 This is from Ramunas Bigalus (ph) in Connecticut.\u00a0 The question is:\u00a0 \u201cShould the State Department warn all journalists to avoid travel to Russia and Belarus?\u201d\u00a0 Given the situation you described, given the threats that are so obvious, should the State Department be saying flatly, \u201cWe don\u2019t think you should go at all\u201d?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, the truth is we\u2019ve instituted something in our travel warnings \u2013 a D indicator, as we call it \u2013 to make sure that every American who is contemplating travel to a certain group of countries understands that they engage in this practice of wrongful detention, so that at least people are put on notice.\nNow, I recognize journalists are in a different category.\u00a0 It\u2019s your job to shine a light everywhere in the world, including in the darkest corners.\u00a0 And\u00a0that comes with extraordinary risk.\u00a0 So yes, as a government we can certainly recommend that anyone with a U.S. passport strongly reconsider traveling to a handful of countries that are known to do this, and we\u2019d say the same thing to journalists.\u00a0 But I also recognize that you feel that you have a job to do, it\u2019s an invaluable job, and ultimately journalists have to balance that risk, calculate that risk.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I have to say we are in the business of ignoring those risks, and going to places where people tell us not to go, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change.\u00a0 I hope it doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 So we wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs as journalists \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if I didn\u2019t ask a little bit about the news of the day, because there\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 And I want to start with the new overnight from the Kremlin, accusing Ukraine of having tried to assassinate President Vladimir Putin with a drone strike on the Kremlin near his residence.\u00a0 Ukraine has denied doing this.\nI want to ask the question this way:\u00a0 What is the United States position on such attacks, on leadership during this war by Ukraine or other combatants?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, I\u2019ve seen the reports.\u00a0 I can\u2019t in any way validate them; we simply don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Second, I would take anything out of the Kremlin with a very large shaker of salt.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s see \u2013 we\u2019ll see what the facts are.\u00a0 And it\u2019s really hard to comment or speculate on this without really knowing what the facts are.\nMore generally, as I\u2019ve said and as we\u2019ve said, when it comes to Ukraine \u2013 which is under daily assault \u2013 and not just its incredibly courageous military forces, but its citizens \u2013 its men, women, and children \u2013 being assaulted on a daily basis by this Russian aggression, being bombed out of their homes, their apartments, and their streets, children killed, families torn apart \u2013 well, we leave it to Ukraine to decide how it\u2019s going to defend itself, and how it\u2019s going to try to get back the territory that\u2019s been seized from it illegally by Russia over the past 14 months and going back to 2014, back to then.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So to clarify, if Ukraine decided on its own to strike back in Russian territory, the United States would not criticize them?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, these are decisions for Ukraine to make about how it\u2019s going\u00a0 to defend itself, how it\u2019s going to get its territory back, how it\u2019s going to restore its territorial integrity and its sovereignty.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 We carried a story this morning that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read in which President Zelenskyy of Ukraine complains about the reporting about the so-called discord leaks, which contained material on almost every imaginable subject around the world, but of special interest to Ukraine \u2013 had information said to be U.S. intelligence estimates that Ukraine was running out of air defense weapons, that this war was likely heading toward a stalemate.\u00a0 Zelenskyy said to our journalists this was not helpful.\nOne thing that the story said was that you, as Secretary of State, had talked to your counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in April about these leaks that were just hitting.\u00a0 What did you tell him?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Without commenting on purported leaks of documents, I can say this generically about the stories that were in the press.\u00a0 What I told him is we very much regretted the unauthorized exposure of these documents, that we took very seriously our obligations and responsibility to protect information.\u00a0 \u00a0We, of course, have arrested someone who is allegedly responsible for this.\u00a0 And at the same time, we were determined to pursue our partnership with Ukraine, our support for Ukraine.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that Ukrainians, as well as many other countries around the world, have benefitted from the extraordinary information that the United States is able to develop and provide that helps support, defend, protect their security as well as ours.\u00a0 I have to say, David, going around the world since then, meeting with colleagues from probably dozens of countries, this has virtually not come up.\u00a0 In fact, to the extent it\u2019s come up, I\u2019ve raised it just to make clear how seriously we take this.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The Ukrainians and President Zelenskyy obviously took the information in these alleged leaks with special seriousness, because of their planned offensive.\u00a0 They\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that they want to push the Russians back, and here were arguments that they may have limited success.\u00a0 Documents aside, you study this every day.\u00a0 This is an anguishing war on your watch.\u00a0 What\u2019s your sense, as we head in the spring and summer, and this long-awaited counteroffensive is about to dawn, about Ukraine\u2019s ability to alter the balance over the course of this year in this war in a way that might make ending the war possible?\u00a0 What do you think?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, this:\u00a0 What was published in the press, in the media reflected a particular point in time.\u00a0 And this is not static.\u00a0 And so, where Ukraine might have been a month ago, two months ago, three months ago is not where it is now in terms of its ability, for example, to prosecute a counteroffensive and to deal with the ongoing Russian aggression.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s one very important thing to keep in mind.\nSecond, we have been engaged intensely over many months with about 50 countries in trying to provide the support that Ukraine needs both to defend itself, but also to help regain territory that\u2019s been taken by Russia over the last 14, 15 months.\u00a0 Lloyd Austin has, I think, worked miracles in bringing together 50 countries in a very coordinated way.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just the equipment that we provide, because while that\u2019s vital, it\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 In and of itself, it doesn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to be able to use it \u2013 training \u2013 you\u2019ve got to be able to maintain it \u2013 we\u2019ve been working on that.\u00a0 And then, the Ukrainian forces have to be able to use everything in a coordinated and combined way, and many countries have been working to support them on that.\nSo, I feel confident that they will have success in regaining more of their territory.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s also important to note that, for Russia, this is already a strategic failure.\u00a0 Russia sought to erase Ukraine from the map, to eliminate its independence, to subsume it into Russia.\u00a0 That has failed.\u00a0 And of course, Ukraine has regained a big chunk of the territory that Russia originally had its footprints on.\u00a0 Where exactly this settles remains to be seen. \u00a0And Ukraine has to make important decisions about exactly where it\u2019s going to go, how far it can get, and how it wants to pursue this.\u00a0 But we\u2019re determined to sustain that support.\u00a0 We\u2019re also determined not only to look at this in the short term with this intense focus on the counteroffensive in the months ahead, but also for the medium and long term.\nBecause what Ukraine also needs \u2013 and what many countries around the world are interested in doing on a sustainable basis \u2013 is to help them develop the kind of military that in the future can effectively deter another Russian aggression \u2013 and if deterrence doesn\u2019t work, to defend against it, and if necessary to defeat it.\u00a0 That is going to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position, as well as helping to rebuild the country and pursuing its integration into Europe, its economic integration.\u00a0 The combination of those things, as well as Ukraine continuing to pursue policies that root out corruption, that put in place transparency, good governance, strong civil society, a vibrant, independent media \u2013 those are the secrets to success, to resilience, to strength for Ukraine over the coming years in being able to resist further Russian aggression.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re walking and we\u2019re running, even, and chewing gum at the same time.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So, that\u2019s a useful summary and a hopeful summary of where Ukraine will end up.\u00a0 I hear you saying they will gain some territory as a result of this counteroffensive.\u00a0 A question that lies ahead after these months is whether there\u2019s some effort to seek a settlement that might include, yes, the United States and Europe, but also China, which has expressed a strong interest in doing so, has a 12-point peace proposal.\u00a0 As I look at the 12 points, many of them are ones that we\u2019d probably write ourselves.\u00a0 What do you think in principle, Mr. Secretary, about the idea of the United States working in parallel at some point down the road with China to seek a stable outcome here?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0In principle, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u00a0 If we have a country, whether it\u2019s China or other countries, that have significant influence, that are prepared to pursue a just and durable peace \u2013 and I\u2019ll come back to what that means in a minute \u2013 we would welcome that.\u00a0 And it\u2019s certainly possible that China would have a role to play in that effort, and that could be very beneficial.\u00a0 There were elements in the plan that China put out, things that actually it had said and many others had said for some time, that were positive.\u00a0 But it has to begin with a couple of things.\nFirst, a clear understanding that in this instance, there\u2019s a victim and there\u2019s an aggressor.\u00a0 There\u2019s no moral equivalence between the two positions.\u00a0 And I have to say, until recently, it was very unclear whether China accepted that basic principle.\u00a0 I\u2019m still not sure that they do, but at least President Xi has now had a conversation with President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 That\u2019s a positive thing, because it\u2019s vitally important that China and other countries that have been seeking to advance peace hear from the victim, not just the aggressor.\nSecond, any peace really has to be both just and durable, and what do I mean by that?\u00a0 Just in the sense that it has to basically reflect the principles that are at the heart of the United Nations Charter, when it comes to territorial integrity, when it comes to sovereignty.\u00a0 It can\u2019t ratify what Russia has done, which is the seizure of so much of Ukraine\u2019s territory.\u00a0 And it needs to be durable in the sense that we don\u2019t want this to land in a place where Russia can simply rest, refit, and re-attack six months later or a year later.\u00a0 So, we have to look at all of that.\u00a0 But as a matter of principle, countries, particularly countries with significant influence like China, if they\u2019re willing to play a positive role in trying to bring peace, that would be a good thing.\nBut, it starts fundamentally with Vladimir Putin actually making that fundamental decision.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not seen that yet.\u00a0 There is zero evidence that Russia is prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 To the contrary, we\u2019ve seen the horrific onslaught, just in the past week, again, on civilian targets in Ukraine.\u00a0 We saw the horrific story of a father in an apartment building who, after this attack, opens the door of his children\u2019s room to find that it\u2019s gone and they\u2019re gone.\u00a0 So, there has to be some profound change in Mr. Putin\u2019s mind and in Russia\u2019s mind to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0One more quick question.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about China.\u00a0 You had a trip that was scheduled to China that you postponed, because of the Chinese spy balloon.\u00a0 And I have to ask you:\u00a0 In a period where there seems to be some warming of relations between the United States, beginning of a thaw, are you hopeful that you may be able to reschedule that trip this year?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I am, and I think it\u2019s important, as President Biden laid out in Bali when he was with President Xi at the end of last year, that we re-establish regular lines of communication at all levels and across our government.\u00a0 We\u2019re in a competition with China; there\u2019s no secret about that.\u00a0 But we have a strong interest in trying to make sure that that competition doesn\u2019t veer into conflict.\u00a0 There\u2019s a clear demand signal from around the world that we manage this relationship responsibly \u2013 a demand signal on us, but also on Beijing.\u00a0 And that starts with engagement, that starts with communicating, it starts with trying to make sure, again, that we don\u2019t veer into conflict.\u00a0 If there are areas where we can actually cooperate, because it\u2019s in the interest of our people, Chinese people and people around the world, so much the better, but at the very least we need to have a floor under this relationship.\u00a0 We need to have some guardrails on it.\u00a0 And the way to do that is through engagement.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So, Mr. Secretary, we want to thank you for coming here, for answering all these questions frankly, and especially we want to thank you for marking with us World Press Freedom Day.\u00a0 This is a period where journalists are under threat.\u00a0 Knowing that senior officials of the U.S. Government, the leadership of the United Nations stand with people in our business in insisting that journalists be free to do their work matters a lot.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0You know, David, we\u2019re also trying, at least in my department, to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.\u00a0 One of the first things we did \u2013 actually, probably the first thing we did \u2013 was to restore the daily press briefing at the State Department.\u00a0 Virtually, wherever I travel, I have your colleagues with me.\u00a0 And, pretty much every stop, we have some kind of press conference, press engagement that brings in our travelling pool but also brings in journalists from the countries that we\u2019re traveling to, including countries that may not have the most open media environment.\nIt\u2019s hugely important to me and to us to demonstrate that we\u2019re holding ourselves accountable by making sure that we\u2019re answering questions, we\u2019re engaging with people who have one of the most important responsibilities in this world, and that is to hold governments, to hold institutions to account, to shine light where there\u2019s darkness, to give people confidence in their institutions, in the people who have the responsibility to represent them.\u00a0 I think, in my experience, there\u2019s actually no more important time for it.\u00a0 I\u2019m incredibly grateful \u2013 even if there\u2019s some days when I don\u2019t feel like it \u2013 incredibly grateful to you and to all of our colleagues.\nThe other day \u2013 and let me end with this \u2013 I got a chance to sit down with Ben Hall from Fox, who was part of our traveling family and then was grievously injured in Ukraine covering the war, trying to shed light on it.\u00a0 Extraordinary story.\u00a0 He\u2019s back.\u00a0 It was just incredibly good to see him and have a chance to talk to him.\u00a0 I said to him when we started the interview how glad I was to see him back, and I said I\u2019d probably regret saying that about five minutes later when the interview was over.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But it was just one powerful example of the dangers that so many of our colleagues expose themselves to so that they can bring forward the story, bring forward the truth, and I\u2019m really grateful for it.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So amen to those comments, and thanks to our courageous colleagues.\u00a0 Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, my friend.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much.\nSECRETARY

you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 It is wonderful to be with all of you here in Denver.\u00a0 And Mike, let me just say to you first off, I can\u2019t thank you enough for your extraordinary leadership in bringing all of this together.\u00a0 The work you did to galvanize the community, to get the support that we needed for this summit, it\u2019s a remarkable contribution not just to this community but to our entire hemisphere.\nAnd I also want to especially thank Governor Polis, Mayor Hancock not just for your hospitality but for your leadership as well in bringing us all together.\u00a0 We picked Denver to host the inaugural Cities Summit of the Americas in large part because of its track record in addressing global challenges at a local level.\u00a0 And that\u2019s really what this summit is all about for us.\nI\u2019m so thrilled to be joined by literally hundreds of mayors and governors, tribal and other indigenous leaders, along with dozens of networks which support them, like ICLEI, U.S. Conference of Mayors, C40 Cities Group.\u00a0 We also want to welcome the many representatives of civil society and the private sector who are here with us today.\nIf you go back to last June, leaders from across our hemisphere came together in Los Angeles for the Ninth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 We agreed to ambitious commitments on issues that actually matter in the lives of all of our citizens: migration, climate change, democratic governance; sustainable, inclusive economic growth.\nEach of you, as city leaders, are on the front lines of tackling these global challenges.\u00a0 You\u2019re welcoming and integrating migrants into your communities.\u00a0 You\u2019re planning for and responding to natural disasters, made more frequent by the climate crisis.\u00a0 You\u2019re addressing the issues that are facing your residents, from law enforcement challenges like ransomware, to public health crises like the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 Your efforts day-in/day-out are helping us make progress on the commitments that we made as countries in Los Angeles.\nCities, when you come down to it, are where democracy is closest to its people.\u00a0 And when cities are responsive to the needs of residents, they demonstrate democracy\u2019s greatest strength: its ability to improve on itself, to empower citizens to hold their leaders accountable, to try out different solutions, and to allow the best ideas to rise to the top.\nWe\u2019re hosting the Cities Summit of the Americas because our collective ability to deliver for our people and to tackle global issues depends on all of you.\u00a0 It\u2019s as simple and as straightforward as that.\u00a0 And we look forward to continuing to elevate your voices in every dimension of our work in the hemisphere, including at the Tenth Summit of the Americas that\u2019ll be hosted by the Dominican Republic.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also why we plan for this to be the first but not the last of many Cities Summits to come.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, what we know is this and what I\u2019ve learned over 30 or so years of doing this going around the world is this:\u00a0 Somewhere, in some part of the world, someone has figured out the solution to a problem that many people are trying to solve; but if we don\u2019t share that information, if we don\u2019t share that knowledge, then everyone else just has to keep reinventing the wheel.\nSo our success in addressing the many issues that we\u2019re trying to tackle right now depends on the best ideas being shared among all of you.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why I hope that the connections \u2013 and that\u2019s the word that Mike used \u2013 is the word indeed that comes back again and again.\u00a0 Connections, interconnectivity.\u00a0 I hope the connections you\u2019ve made here in Denver will last a long time and that you use them to continue to engage with each other, to share ideas, to share solutions.\nAnd as I said, our success depends on these ideas being shared among you.\u00a0 It also depends on national governments learning from you, incorporating the ideas and perspectives of our cities and communities into the policies that we\u2019re making at a national level.\nSo what I thought I\u2019d do today as we\u2019re closing out this summit is to share just three areas where cities are leading the way, and where deeper connections between cities and national governments can make a profound difference in the lives and livelihoods of our people, starting with the first issue I\u2019ll talk about: migration.\nNow, if you step back for a minute and think about the moment we\u2019re in globally, there are more people displaced from their homes around the world than at any time in recorded history: more than 100 million.\u00a0 In our own hemisphere, more than 20 million people are on the move.\nBack at the Summit of the Americas, we came together to try to address what is an unprecedented migration challenge across our hemisphere through something we called the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which reflected the first truly regional approach to the issue.\u00a0 Twenty-one countries agreed that we have a shared responsibility to tackle the migration challenge together, and they agreed on a shared set of principles and priorities, among them expanding protections for migrants who are at risk.\nSo under the leadership of Mayor Claudia L\u00f3pez, someone I\u2019ve had the great pleasure of working with on many occasions \u2013 she\u2019s here with us today, Bogot\u00e1 has been putting this principle into practice since last year.\nI had a chance to visit last time I was in Colombia one of the city\u2019s pioneering migration integration facilities, which offers basically a one-stop-shop where people get a Temporary Protected Status card, they get connected to jobs, they get connected to schools, they get to sign up for essential services like health care.\nBecause of these efforts, Bogot\u00e1 has welcomed more refugees in recent years than any other city in the Americas \u2013 or, as Mayor L\u00f3pez likes to call them, \u201cNew Bogot\u00e1nos.\u201d\u00a0 Colombia as a whole has given refuge to more than 2.5 million Venezuelans who were displaced by their country\u2019s crisis.\nAnd because the protected status that Colombia gives them allows Venezuelans to work, they are also contributing to Colombia\u2019s economy, filling jobs, providing services, starting new businesses.\u00a0 These efforts are driving growth.\u00a0 They\u2019re creating opportunities for Colombians as well as Venezuelans.\u00a0 And they\u2019re showing that we can actually manage migration safely, humanely, and use it as an opportunity to strengthen our communities.\nCity leaders are also stepping up to tackle the second issue I want to talk about, and that\u2019s the climate crisis.\nBack in 2019, the Mississippi River Basin \u2013 and that\u2019s an area that stretches across 31 of our states in the United States \u2013 that basin experienced historic floods, causing more than $6 billion in damages.\u00a0 In the aftermath, mayors from more than a hundred cities and towns \u2013 led by Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons, who\u2019s here with us today \u2013 have been helping prepare their communities for future floods to get ahead of the next problem, the next crisis.\nWorking hand-in-hand with local and global environmental organizations, the mayors and their partners are restoring 66,000 acres of wetlands, of forests, of marshes, and adapting the land to regulate stormwater flow, with a focus on building resilience for communities that have historically been overlooked.\nOnce completed, these restored lands will capture more than 165,000 tons of carbon from the air.\u00a0 Now, that\u2019s the equivalent of taking about 36,000 cars off the road every year.\u00a0 And their efforts are making cities and towns more resilient against floods.\u00a0 When the area around St. Louis \u2013 which is in the basin \u2013 was hit with a \u201conce in a thousand-years rainfall\u201d in 2022, the wetlands there soaked up enough stormwater to fill 750 Olympic-size swimming pools, and that saved millions of dollars in potential damages.\nNow, often innovations at the city level start from the dedicated work of civil society leaders, and that\u2019s the case for the third and final area I want to talk about today, and that\u2019s transparency in our governance.\nIn Chihuahua, Mexico, members of a local anti-corruption nonprofit, Karaywah, came together to tackle lack of transparency in their municipal government.\u00a0 In 2019, when this initiative started, only about 60 percent of municipal contracts were being publicly bid.\u00a0 That meant that many companies were left out of the bidding process \u2013 reducing competition, driving up costs for taxpayers.\nKaraywah teamed up with other Mexican NGOs, with the United Nations Development Programme, and with the U.S. Agency for International Development to put together a digital platform that tracks and publishes open municipal contracts, that follows the bidding process, that allows constituents to monitor where their tax dollars are being spent.\nNow, 100 percent of municipal contracts in Chihuahua City are published online.\u00a0 The tool has been so successful that it\u2019s now being rolled out, free of cost, to 15 other city and state governments across Mexico \u2013 decreasing the potential for corruption, increasing people\u2019s\u00a0 participation and trust in government, something that is especially critical in the times that we\u2019re living.\nOn issue after issue, in city after city, local leaders are pointing the way to effective solutions.\u00a0 This week\u2019s summit shows many more promising opportunities to deliver for our people, including one starting right here in Denver.\nThe City of Denver and the State Department signed an agreement to partner on building early detection systems to track the evolution of new synthetic drugs, like fentanyl, so that we can develop lifesaving interventions early on.\u00a0 We\u2019ll share our findings with partners across the hemisphere, so that we can inform locally-led efforts to counter this public health and security threat.\nNow, this is a powerful illustration of how solutions that we\u2019re finding and answers that we\u2019re finding at the local level can have a powerful impact on the most pressing, most urgent national problems and international problems we face.\u00a0 Fentanyl in the United States is responsible for more deaths among Americans aged 18 to 49 than anything else.\u00a0 Think about that for a second.\u00a0 The leading cause of death in our country for Americans aged 18 to 49 is synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\nLast year, we seized enough fentanyl to kill every single American.\u00a0 That\u2019s the scale of the problem.\u00a0 By definition it has to have an international solution, which we\u2019re working on very hard at the State Department under President Biden\u2019s guidance, but also national and local responses.\u00a0 And I had a chance to see some of the incredibly important work that Denver is doing right here, and I\u2019m grateful for the partnership that we have.\nDozens of cities from across the hemisphere also came together to sign the Denver Declaration, which reflects their shared commitment to addressing the challenges facing our cities, including affordable housing, migration, and the climate crisis.\nAnd thanks to the leadership of Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, more than 45 cities also launched the Anti-Racist Cities Network, through which cities will share best practices for promoting equity and inclusion in our societies.\u00a0 Discrimination robs democracies, including ours in the United States, of the strength, the innovation, the creativity of so many of our citizens, which is exactly what we need to more effectively face the challenges of our time.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why efforts like this one are really important in empowering our full populations.\nTo strengthen the partnership between the United States mayors and their counterparts across the world, we at the State Department recently launched a new City and State Diplomacy Office.\u00a0 So again, people might ask, how is it that we have an office at the State Department to engage at the subnational level?\u00a0 Well, this summit here in Denver demonstrates exactly why it was important for us to do that.\nSince October, Ambassador Nina Hachigian and her team have been working at building the ties that we\u2019re seeing come to full fruition here in Denver.\u00a0 Ambassador Hachigian has held senior positions at the White House, the State Department, and the city of Los Angeles, where she was deputy mayor for international affairs. \u00a0Nina and her team are here in Denver; if you haven\u2019t had the chance to connect up with them yet, I hope in the remaining time that you have you\u2019ll take the opportunity to do so.\nThe city and state diplomacy teams work as a key component, but not the only component, of the State Department\u2019s substantive engagement with cities across our hemisphere.\u00a0 Many of you in this audience have worked closely with our embassies in your countries, in your cities, on a wide variety of issues \u2013 connecting your cities\u2019 businesses with the U.S. private sector.\u00a0 Launching partnerships to strengthen our shared energy security.\u00a0 Combating human trafficking.\u00a0 Promoting global health.\u00a0 In so many ways, the connectivity between our department and your cities is helping to produce real results.\nEarlier today I also had a chance \u2013 and I hope, again, some of you, if not all of you, had the opportunity to do this \u2013 I had a chance to visit the Innovation Plaza at the summit, where many of our companies are displaying solutions that they\u2019ve found to the challenges that you\u2019re trying to address, from accessing government services to recycling and sustainability to housing.\u00a0 These connections, too, between cities and the private sector are another very vital part of this gathering.\nNow, to build on all of this work, we\u2019re devoting additional resources to our engagement with cities.\u00a0 Yesterday we launched something called Cities Forward, an initiative to help cities build a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future.\u00a0 Through this program, which we\u2019re running with our implementing partners ICLEI, Resilient Cities Catalyst, and the Institute of the Americas, we\u2019ll start by connecting 12 American cities here in the United States with 12 Latin American and Caribbean cities so that they can share directly experiences and lessons on everything from how they\u2019re finding new ways to reduce air and water pollution to designing their infrastructure to better withstand more intense and frequent natural disasters.\nWe\u2019ll also support participating cities with funding, technical assistance to develop and implement sustainability action plans that benefit all of their constituents, including those from underserved communities.\u00a0 And while we\u2019re starting with 24 cities, we plan to share our findings with cities throughout our entire hemisphere so that what we learn from this initiative, we can take that and we can scale it.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing a little advertising \u2013 the application for Cities Forward is now live.\u00a0 Consider applying.\nAs you all know well, there is tremendous collaboration already happening in communities across our hemisphere.\u00a0 To cite just one example, look at the work being done here in Denver by community leaders Kristin Lacy and Vivi Lemus, who are also here with us today.\nWhen they first met, Kristin and Vivi realized how much that they had in common.\u00a0 Vivi was born in Guatemala; Kristin had spent years working there.\u00a0 They loved two things: coffee and cooking.\u00a0 They shared a dream of creating a space to build community between Spanish and English speakers.\u00a0 So they started putting away their savings.\u00a0 They got financing from local lenders.\u00a0 A fellow entrepreneur tipped them off to an open space, and city leaders stepped in to help them secure it.\nLast year, Kristin and Vivi opened Convivio Caf\u00e9, Denver\u2019s first women and immigrant-owned, bilingual coffee shop.\u00a0 They source their coffee directly from Guatemalan growers.\u00a0 That allows farmers to earn up to four times the profit they otherwise would, and they use the walls of their cafe as a space to display art that exposes customers to Guatemalan culture.\nConnections like these are leading to tangible benefits for people across our countries \u2013 through greater exports and good-paying jobs that respect labor rights, that give workers a fair shot at getting ahead, providing for their families and their communities.\u00a0 These partnerships are already being built \u2013 not only between our people and businesses, but also city and national governments, labor unions, civil society, multilateral organizations.\nWe\u2019re increasingly bound together through these connections, and what\u2019s so important is that we\u2019re putting them to work, putting them to work to meet the challenges of our time, the challenges we have to face if we\u2019re going to make a meaningful difference in the lives and livelihoods of our fellow citizens.\nPresident Biden has said on more than one occasion that we have everything we need to deliver for our people right here in our own hemisphere \u2013 and work being led by cities across the region, which you\u2019ve shared throughout this summit, shows exactly how we\u2019re doing that.\nSo to each and every one of you who\u2019s participated this week, and to each and every one of you who\u2019s not only participating this week but engaging every single day in these efforts, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your leadership, thank you for your partnership, thank you for the work that we\u2019re doing together as we build toward a more secure, a more prosperous shared future in the Americas.\u00a0 I, for one, am greatly looking forward to seeing all that we can accomplish for our people, and for our hemisphere, in the months and years ahead, following up on everything that\u2019s happened this week here in Denver.\u00a0 Thank you all so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

That speaks volumes at a time when we need those resources.\nAnyway, I was anxious to get a chance to share some of your experiences, and finally I\u2019ll say this:\u00a0 I\u2019m hoping very much that the work that\u2019s being done here and the connections that are being made across our hemisphere continue well beyond the days in Denver.\u00a0 I\u2019m really grateful to Nina Hachigian, who\u2019s leading our efforts in the State Department in what we call sub-national diplomacy, which is an increasingly critical part of what we\u2019re doing, and no one is actually better prepared to do that, having served at the highest levels of our national government but also as deputy mayor of Los Angeles, so not bad.\nIn any event, thank you all for taking some time.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-following-a-meeting-with-mayors-from-the-western-hemisphere-to-discuss-efforts-to-combat-fentanyl/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

the sea is much larger.\u00a0 The number one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49 is synthetic opioids, notably fentanyl.\u00a0 And by its very nature, this is a problem that requires us to work at a local level, at a national level, and at an international level.\nAs the mayor said, you might ask why someone in my job focusing in on this here in Denver, and it\u2019s precisely because of that.\u00a0 Just to give you a couple of quick examples, what Denver is doing so remarkably well both on dealing with prevention, with treatment, with recovery, with detection, with law enforcement, all of that is a powerful example for other communities that may be affected down the road if they\u2019re not already affected by synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\nAnd what we\u2019ve seen here is the United States has been something of the canary in the coal mine.\u00a0 It hit us here before it\u2019s hit many other places, but now we see it picking up in Mexico, in Canada.\u00a0 We heard from our colleague from Vancouver the numbers in Canada are dramatic, and we know it\u2019s going to spread to other places in the world.\u00a0 Our market is increasingly saturated.\u00a0 The criminal enterprises that are engaged in producing and distributing synthetic opioids like fentanyl are trying to make markets elsewhere.\nSo the more we can learn about how a city like Denver is being affected in dealing with the problems at a local level, the better we\u2019ll be able to share that with countries around the world.\u00a0 But we also need their help.\u00a0 Much of the fentanyl that\u2019s coming into the United States starts halfway around the world with perfectly legal chemicals that may be produced in one country then sent somewhere else, including to Mexico, and diverted into illegal use and used to manufacture fentanyl.\nSo having the cooperation and collaboration of countries around the world to prevent that diversion is critical.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got to get countries involved, we have to get the private sector involved because these chemicals are made, manufactured, and shipped.\u00a0 And all of us together can do a much better job in making sure that these chemicals are not diverted into illegal use and fabrication of fentanyl.\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons why President Biden is building an international coalition of concerned countries to work together to get ahead of this around the world.\u00a0 But at the same time, when I\u2019m going around the world and people are asking, well okay, what is the United States doing about this at home, I\u2019m able to point to a city like Denver that\u2019s leading on this effort in trying to reduce demand, in dealing with prevention, in dealing with treatment, in dealing effectively with law enforcement.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly powerful example that I can share.\nAnd then finally, there\u2019s a big law enforcement component to this at a local level but also at an international level.\u00a0 Much of this is driven by large transnational criminal enterprises that we\u2019re working every single day to break up, to break down, to break down the financing, the production, the distribution.\u00a0 But if we\u2019re not working at every single one of these levels \u2013 at the local level, at the national level, the international level \u2013 we\u2019re not going to solve the problem.\nSo being here, having so many of our colleagues from around the hemisphere here in Denver, to see what you\u2019re doing and how you\u2019re doing it, and then being able to share their own experiences and for us to be able to then build partnerships, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re ultimately going to get ahead of this problem.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really grateful \u2014 Mr. Mayor, to you; Mr. Director to you \u2013 for sharing everything that you\u2019re doing here in Denver, and we\u2019re determined together to get ahead of it.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-state-luncheon-in-honor-of-republic-of-korea-president-yoon-suk-yeol/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

", "date": "April 27, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Please, take a seat.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Please take a seat.\u00a0 Good afternoon, and welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 President Yoon, Mrs. Kim, it is a great pleasure to have you here with us today.\nNow, some of you may have heard this and actually seen it, but last night President Yoon \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 brought down the house at the state dinner \u2013 (applause) \u2013 singing \u201cAmerican Pie.\u201d\u00a0 So, Mr. President, I want you to know we have two great American musical giants with us here today, Herbie Hancock and Diane Reeves.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So if you feel moved to deliver another performance \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 don\u2019t let the music die, Mr. President.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nEvan and I are delighted to join Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, in welcoming all of you here today.\u00a0 And I know we\u2019re joined by an incredible group of friends, colleagues.\u00a0 Particularly I want to salute the members of Congress who are here.\u00a0 President Yoon just came from delivering an extraordinary speech to a joint session.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt has been 70 years since the United States and the Republic of Korea formed our alliance, making official a bond that was forged by Korean and American soldiers in the crucible of war.\u00a0\u00a0Katchi kapshida\u00a0\u2013 we go together \u2013 that was their motto.\u00a0 And indeed, they lived and fought and died shoulder to shoulder.\nFrom the beginning, American and Korean leaders understood that our alliance was about more than our two nations.\u00a0 President Eisenhower, speaking to Congress, said that it was an affirmation of our belief that the security of an individual nation in the free world depends on the security of its partners and constitutes another link in the collective security of free nations.\nIt was also a way to create space \u2013 space for Korean and American entrepreneurs and innovators, scientists and artists, governments and citizens \u2013 to use that security and their freedom to improve our societies in real ways.\u00a0 And who, looking at how far we\u2019ve come since that time, would question whether our partnership has lived up to its promise?\u00a0 We see the extraordinary emergence of Korea in virtually every domain around the world, not just as the strongest of security partners for the United States, but in science, technology, the arts, culture.\u00a0 We have never wavered in our commitment to our mutual defense.\u00a0 We\u2019ve invested in our shared prosperity and competitiveness.\u00a0 And we have decades of mutual growth to show for it, including in the industries and technologies that are shaping the future \u2013 from quantum computing to renewable energy to biotech.\nWe\u2019ve invested in the foundation of our strength, our democracies, while also deepening ties to our partners who share our commitment to freedom, to equal opportunity, to human rights, to the rule of law.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden convened the first two Summits for Democracy, the second of which was co-hosted by President Yoon.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why Seoul will take up the mantle now in leading the third Summit for Democracy next year.\nAs we think about all the ways that our countries go together, it\u2019s easy to take for granted our closeness, to see as somehow inevitable the parallel arcs that U.S. and Korea have traced over time.\u00a0 But the reality is this: the friendship between nations, like all friendships, ultimately comes down to the actions of individuals.\nAnd it\u2019s here that I\u2019d like to express our enormous gratitude to President Yoon.\u00a0 At a time of tremendous challenge to the international rule of law and the United Nations Charter, to our democracies, indeed to our planet, Mr. President, your principled leadership has helped bring us even closer together and has made Korea a global pivotal state.\u00a0 And that\u2019s to the benefit of Koreans, Americans, and indeed to people around the world.\nNow, it\u2019s not just our leaders who are committed to deepening our friendship, but our people, starting with Korean Americans.\u00a0 This year also marks the 120th anniversary of the arrival of the first Korean immigrants to America, a hundred or so men, women, and children who arrived on Honolulu\u2019s shores.\u00a0 Today, the extraordinary contributions of generations of Korean Americans are woven into the fabric of American society, from the sweeping histories of Min Jin Lee\u2019s novels to the explosive flavors of David Chang\u2019s dishes to the exceptional service of diplomats right here at the State Department, like one I\u2019d like to mention today: Julie Chung.\nJulie was just five years old when, in 1977, her family moved from Seoul to California.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t speak a word of English.\u00a0 Her dad got a job on the drafting floor of an engineering company.\u00a0 Her mom worked nights washing dishes in a restaurant.\u00a0 Julie\u2019s mom went on to become a librarian and a church deacon.\u00a0 Her dad later designed a heating system to prevent O-rings from freezing on space shuttles \u2013 that\u2019s what had caused the Challenger explosion \u2013 allowing NASA to restart the space missions.\u00a0 And Julie joined the first cohort of Pickering fellows at the State Department, which encourages the service of historically underrepresented minorities.\nToday, Julie\u2019s dad\u2019s engineering company is working on technology that will help the United States, Korea, and other partners who are joined in the Artemis Accord return astronauts to the Moon, including the first woman and first person of color.\u00a0 And Julie is the United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka.\nIf these are the threads that are connecting the United States and Korea through a single family, just think how rich, how deep the ties are that are binding our nations together.\nSo, President Yoon, Mrs. Kim, all of our distinguished guests, I ask you to raise a glass with me \u2013 and we\u2019ll even find a glass to raise.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 To all the ties that make our nations go together, and to all the places that they\u2019ll take us.\u00a0 Mr. President, cheers.\n(A toast was offered.)\nAnd now it\u2019s my great pleasure to turn it over to the Vice President of the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The Vice President delivered remarks.)\n(A toast was offered.)\nPRESIDENT YOON:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Emhoff, Secretary Blinken, White House Cabinet Secretary Ryan, and distinguished guests:\u00a0 I extend the gratitude to you for inviting me to the heart of global diplomacy, the Department of State.\u00a0 With Vice President Harris, a fearless fighter, and with strong supporters of the ROK-U.S. alliance, it feels as though there is no obstacle that we cannot overcome.\u00a0 It is truly reassuring.\nI heard that the name of this building is the Harry S Truman Building.\u00a0 President Biden gifted me a plaque with President Truman\u2019s words that I keep on my office desk.\u00a0 He granted me this plaque last year in Korea, and the plaque reads, \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d\u00a0 This place reminds me of the devotion and responsibility for freedom and democracy.\u00a0 And as you are well aware, President Truman in 1953, when communism attacked Korea, he dispatched U.S. forces and also put together the UN Security Council and came to our rescue.\u00a0 For the past 70 years, the ROK-U.S. alliance has developed into the most successful alliance in history on the soil that was fortified by the sacrifice of Korean War veterans.\u00a0 The Republic of Korea was able to rise from the ashes of war to become a country with global stature thanks to the power of the ROK-U.S. alliance.\nYesterday, President Biden and myself had an invaluable discussion on where the ROK-U.S. alliance should head towards.\u00a0 And based on our discussion, I plan to develop our alliance in a way that expands practical benefits for the peoples of both our countries.\u00a0 Our future will be brighter than the past.\u00a0 Our two countries will build peace through strength and lead the solidarity of freedom to promote peace in East Asia and the rest of the world.\u00a0 We will further strengthen our solidarity on cooperation in cutting-edge future technologies, including semiconductors, quantum, artificial intelligence, space, and cyber.\u00a0 And the young talents of our two countries will learn from one another and build a free, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 We will also work very closely together in response to pending global issues.\nVice President Harris, Secretary Blinken, and all distinguished participants gathered here today are the mainstays of the global comprehensive strategic alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States.\u00a0 We look forward to your continued support as the ROK-U.S. alliance marches forward.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas at a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Press Briefing Room", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "April 27, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Let me just say at the top that besides being delighted to be joined by Secretary Mayorkas, I also want to take this opportunity to say how thrilled I am that we have Matt Miller joining us as our new spokesperson.\u00a0 Probably have more to say on that in the days to come.\u00a0 But I couldn\u2019t be more pleased, not just for me but for the department and, indeed, for our country.\u00a0 An extraordinary professional I\u2019ve had the benefit of working with over many years.\u00a0 And I\u2019m equally grateful to Vedant Patel, who\u2019s done an extraordinary job as our spokesperson these past weeks.\nIn two weeks\u2019 time, the CDC\u2019s temporary Title 42 public health order will expire, as required by court order.\u00a0 President Biden and agencies across our government have been taking robust steps to prepare for the effect this will likely have on our immigration system, our partners in the region, and the movement of people across our hemisphere.\nSecretary Mayorkas will speak about the immediate impact of Title 42\u2019s expiration and our stepped-up enforcement efforts.\u00a0 But first, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to put this in the context of our broader approach to migration in the region, which we\u2019ll continue to build on in the coming weeks.\u00a0 It\u2019s an approach focused on making migration more safe, orderly, and humane, and on advancing the interests of the American people.\nIf you step back \u2013 and it\u2019s really important to do that \u2013 globally there are more than 100 million people on the move today, compelled to leave their homes in search of security and better lives.\u00a0 That is more people than at any time in recorded history.\u00a0 And in our own hemisphere, we are facing an unprecedented migration challenge.\u00a0 Long-term drivers like violence, corruption, lack of economic opportunity, continue to push people from their homes \u2013 problems that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, crises of governance, extreme weather events caused by the changing climate.\u00a0 Twenty million people are displaced across this hemisphere, and the strain on transit and host countries is high.\nMigration is the definition of a challenge that no country can solve alone.\u00a0 The magnitude, the range of drivers, the push and pull factors \u2013 all demand that we work together.\u00a0 That\u2019s why last summer President Biden brought together leaders from nations across the Western Hemisphere to agree to the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection; 21 countries have joined that declaration.\u00a0 The LA Declaration is an acknowledgment of our shared responsibility on migration, and our shared commitment to work together and leverage the strengths of partners across government, civil society, the private sector, humanitarian organizations, multilateral organizations, all coming together to address this challenge.\nSo let me highlight some of the ways the United States is working with our partners in the region on migration so as to take, among other things, pressure off our borders by giving people alternatives to making a hazardous journey to seek asylum in the United States.\nOf course, fundamentally we\u2019re working to tackle the root causes of migration so that people don\u2019t have to leave their homes in the first place.\u00a0 That includes investing and redirecting and mobilizing resources toward greater economic opportunities, as we\u2019ve done through the more than $4.2 billion in private sector commitments that Vice President Harris has helped to secure for northern Central America.\u00a0 These investments by businesses and social enterprises will sustain and create jobs, connect people to the digital economy, expand access to financing, provide training and education for young people and workers, and improve economic livelihoods across the region.\nWe\u2019re also investing in economic opportunity through the nearly $1.2 billion that we provided in humanitarian assistance across the region last year, and through initiatives like our commitment to work with our partners to train and equip 500,000 local healthcare workers across the hemisphere over the next five years so that more people can get quality care in their own communities.\u00a0 All of these investments will help people feel that they have a future in their own communities.\nNow, of course many of these investments can take time to bear fruit.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working in parallel on critical collaborations and initiatives with partners in the hemisphere to have a more near-term impact.\u00a0 First, we\u2019re supporting host countries as they provide legal protections and assistance to refugees and migrants so that they can thrive in their new communities.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that by delivering funding to schools, health facilities, and other providers of support to migrants, funding the staffing and capacity-building of local asylum centers and systems, and supporting registration and documentation efforts so that individuals can gain and demonstrate legal status, which is critical for access to work, to schools, to social services.\nOur partners in turn are doing extraordinary work in this area.\u00a0 Colombia, for example, has given 10-year temporary protected status to approximately 2.5 million Venezuelans, allowing them to work, to study, to access public services.\u00a0 Ecuador, Costa Rica, Belize are also undertaking similar efforts to regularize migrants from Venezuela and Nicaragua, as well as Peru.\u00a0 We see efforts as well to forgive existing migrant overstay fines, effectively removing one of the largest barriers to regularization.\u00a0 Brazil\u2019s \u201cOperation Welcome\u201d helped over 100,000 Venezuelans voluntarily resettle in places where they have greater economic opportunity.\u00a0 Mexico and Canada are increasing the number of people that they welcome on a humanitarian basis.\nWe\u2019re also working with partners in the hemisphere to accept repatriation flights, increase security forces along migration routes, provide more assistance to migrants and refugees.\u00a0 We continue to surge assistance to host countries throughout the hemisphere to help integrate refugees and migrants, and increase humanitarian aid and protection for vulnerable populations.\nSecond, we\u2019re announcing a 60-day surge of urgent assistance to regional partners to enhance security, to counter smuggling \u2013 an effort that Ali will share more about in a few moments.\u00a0 We\u2019re also working to counter disinformation being spread by traffickers and other bad actors, including by expanding our paid and earned media outreach to high out-migration communities and migrant routes through channels potentially reaching upward of 85 million people \u2013 so that people who want to migrate have accurate information about how to do so legally and safely, and know the dangers of putting themselves in the hands of traffickers.\nThird, we\u2019re significantly expanding access to lawful pathways for migration for those in need, including the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.\u00a0 For too many people in too many places, these pathways feel far from reach.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working to create more opportunities, and to make them more accessible.\u00a0 The United States welcomed six times as many refugees from Latin America and the Caribbean in 2022 than during the previous year.\u00a0 We\u2019re on track to more than double those arrivals in 2023.\nAnd in January, President Biden committed to welcoming 30,000 individuals every month from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, and Nicaragua through a parole program.\u00a0 Irregular migration from those four countries fell by more than 97 percent within the first month \u2013 because people now have a legal and safe pathway.\u00a0 That means tens of thousands of people are no longer making the perilous overland journey to our border, or putting themselves at the mercy of abusive smugglers.\nWe\u2019re partnering with both national and international NGOs to connect the most vulnerable populations \u2013 including religious minorities, political dissidents, LGBTQI+ persons, and survivors of gender-based violence \u2013 to expedited resettlement processes.\nWe\u2019re developing new ways to increase the scope and effectiveness of our migration system, like Welcome Corps, which \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 allows American individuals to sponsor refugees.\nAnd soon we will stand up Regional Processing Centers in select locations in the region.\u00a0 I want to thank Colombia and Guatemala specifically for their role as excellent partners of the United States in these efforts.\u00a0 These centers will be operated by international organization partners and improve qualified individuals\u2019 access to accelerated refugee resettlement processing, family reunification, and labor pathways in the United States.\u00a0 They will also be a referral point for lawful pathways as well, as well as humanitarian and refugee protections in other countries, like Canada and Spain.\nThese centers will take a hugely important step to prevent people from making the dangerous journey to the border by providing a much safer legal option to migrate that they can pursue in and from their own countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new and innovative approach that does right by people who want to migrate, and that enhances security and stability in the region.\nLater today, I\u2019ll have a chance to travel to Denver for the Cities Summit of the Americas, where we\u2019ve convened leaders to talk about how governments can better deliver for their people.\u00a0 And that mission is at the heart of the migration challenge:\u00a0 How can we all work together, as we are, to provide the foundation for better, more secure, and more hopeful futures for all our citizens?\nWith that, let me turn it over to Secretary Mayorkas.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 As the Secretary described, this is a hemispheric challenge that demands hemispheric solutions.\u00a0\u00a0 Working with our neighbors in the region, we can and will reduce the number of migrants who reach our southern border.\u00a0 The Regional Processing Centers announced today will be a critical addition to the programs and processes DHS has in place for qualifying individuals to obtain authorization to enter the United States before arriving at our borders.\nThis is particularly important because we have a humanitarian obligation to cut the smugglers out.\u00a0 We have seen a dramatic rise in the reach, sophistication, and cruelty of the smuggling organizations over the past ten years and the challenges that presents.\nThe comprehensive plan we have developed and are executing takes this reality into account.\u00a0 We are building lawful pathways for people to come to the United States without resorting to the smugglers.\u00a0 At the same time, we are imposing consequences on those who do not use those pathways and instead irregularly migrate to our southern border.\nThis plan has proven effective.\u00a0 Building on the success of Uniting for Ukraine, we created parole processes for qualifying Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, and we expelled individuals from these countries who sought to enter at our southern border.\u00a0 We have seen a high degree of interest in these parole processes and a dramatic drop in encounters from these nationalities.\u00a0 Overall, the number of Border Patrol encounters in March 2023 was down 23\u00a0percent compared to March of last year.\u00a0 When people have safe and orderly pathways to come to the United States and face consequences for failing to do so, they use those pathways.\nAfter May 11th, our court-compelled use of Title 42 will end and we will once again process all migrants under Title 8 of the United States code.\u00a0 This is a longstanding immigration enforcement authority that multiple administrations \u2013 Republican and Democratic alike \u2013 have used to process individuals.\u00a0 It carries stiff consequences for irregular migration, including at least a five-year ban on reentry and potential criminal prosecution for repeated attempts to cross unlawfully.\u00a0 The return to processing migrants under Title 8 authorities will be swift and immediate.\nWe have been preparing for this transition for more than a year and a half.\u00a0 Notwithstanding those preparations, we do expect that encounters at our southern border will increasing, as smugglers are seeking to take advantage of this change and already are hard at work spreading disinformation that the border will be open after that.\u00a0 High encounters will place a strain on our entire system, including our dedicated and heroic workforce and our communities.\nThe smuggler\u2019s propaganda is false.\u00a0 Let me be clear:\u00a0 Our border is not open and will not be open after May 11th.\nToday, we are announcing the expansion of our plan to build lawful pathways and to impose consequences for failure to use those pathways.\nFirst, the Department of Homeland Security is proud to work with the State Department in establishing the Regional Processing Centers that Secretary Blinken described.\u00a0 We are dedicating specially trained refugee officers to the centers.\u00a0 They will interview applicants for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and provide for the swift processing of a greater number of individuals.\u00a0 In addition to refugee processing, migrants may be screened at these centers and referred to pursue additional pathways to the United States or to other countries for which they may be eligible.\nSecond, we are streamlining the long-established family reunification parole processes for Cubans and Haitians so that individuals from these countries with approved family-based petitions can more quickly reunite with their families here in the United States.\nThird, I have directed my team to develop family reunification processes that will extend this well-recognized model to certain individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Colombia.\u00a0 More information about these processes will be available by May 11th.\nFourth, we will continue the successful processes we announced in January.\u00a0 Through our CPB One mobile app, we will enable individuals to schedule more appointments at ports of entry, consistent with Title 8 processing.\u00a0 The Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela parole processes, as well as the corresponding returns to Mexico for those without a legal basis to remain will continue.\nAt the same time, we are imposing consequences for individuals who do not use our lawful pathways.\nBeginning on May 12th, we will be \u2013 we will place eligible individuals who arrive at our southern border in expedited removal proceedings.\u00a0 Those who arrive at our border and do not have a legal basis to stay will have made the journey, often having suffered horrific trauma and having paid their life savings to the smugglers, only to be quickly removed.\u00a0 They will be removed most often in a matter of days in just a few weeks.\nUnlike the Title 42 public health authority, the penalty for being removed from the United States under Title 8 through expedited removal and other immigration laws we will be enforcing is not just removal.\u00a0 An individual who is removed is subject to at least a five-year ban on admission to the United States and can face criminal prosecution for any subsequent attempt to cross the border illegally.\nWe will process eligible single adults for expedited removal while they are in our Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\u00a0 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will be conducting any credible fear interviews.\u00a0 We have expanded our holding capacity and set up equipment and procedures so that individuals have the ability to access counsel.\u00a0 We have digitized processes, surged personnel, and with the cooperation of partner governments increased return flights.\u00a0 We are ensuring that removals are accomplished fairly, efficiently, and quickly.\nFamilies have always presented unique challenges within our immigration system, particularly for an administration like ours that priorities family unity and opposes family separation.\u00a0 Like single adults, families will be placed in removal proceedings, including expedited removal.\u00a0 We are currently focused on utilizing the full spectrum of our Alternatives to Detention Programs, including GPS monitoring and enhanced supervision, such as curfews and expanding case management services.\u00a0 This will be coupled with more stringent measures for those who do not comply.\nThe same principle will apply to single adults and families.\u00a0 They will have an opportunity to seek protection or other relief from removal.\u00a0 If they receive a final order of removal, we will enforce the law, and they will be removed.\nIn addition to our land border, we will continue to confront the challenge of migration on our seas.\nSince we announced our parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, we have made it clear that those who arrive at our southern border are not eligible for the parole processes.\u00a0 We are announcing today that that ineligibility will now extend to individuals who take to the seas and are interdicted trying to arrive at our maritime borders.\u00a0 We have seen too many people \u2013 families, women, children \u2013 perish in the rough seas.\nWe have increased the presence of our United States Coast Guard to interdict migrants trying to reach the United States by sea.\u00a0 We have saved countless lives, and we have returned the migrants to their home countries.\u00a0 That will continue.\nIn addition, we are finalizing the regulation that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security jointly proposed earlier this year.\u00a0 That proposed regulation will incentivize individuals to avail themselves of lawful, safe, and orderly pathways, and disincentivize dangerous border crossings by placing a new condition on asylum eligibility for those who fail to use those pathways.\u00a0 The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security aim to have the rule finalized by May 11 and will swiftly implement it.\nThe work we have been performing to prepare for post Title 42 continues, as I have previously outlined in our six-pillar plan.\u00a0 We are surging resources to our border, modernizing processes, attacking the smuggling organizations with unprecedented law enforcement focus, strengthening our immigration enforcement tool of expedited removal, working to increase information sharing and resources \u2013 having distributed over $130 million this fiscal year with 290 more to be awarded in the coming weeks \u2013 for local communities and their non-profit organizations.\u00a0 We are partnering with nations in the region to address the challenges of unprecedented migration throughout the hemisphere.\nFor example, two weeks ago we reached a trilateral agreement with Colombia and Panama to attack the smugglers who falsely coax people into the treacherous terrain of the Darien.\u00a0 We initiated a 60-day coordinated campaign with Panama and Colombia to prevent the incredibly dangerous humanitarian situation of migrants traversing the Darien jungle.\u00a0 We have made more than 10,000 smuggling arrests since April of last year and seized more than $47 million in smugglers\u2019 illegal property and finances.\u00a0 The Canadian commitment to accept an additional 15,000 migrants was part of a complementary effort to create lawful pathways.\nEveryone agrees \u2013 everyone agrees \u2013 our immigration system is outdated and badly broken.\u00a0 We must tackle the challenges before us together.\u00a0 This includes the potential for increases in migration after May 11 and the strain it will place on our communities, our workforce, and our system.\nThat\u2019s why today we notified Congress of our intent to reprogram funds within our budget to support other emerging requirements across DHS.\u00a0 This reprograming of existing funds will not meet our longer term needs for securing our border and enforcing our laws.\u00a0 The administration requested $4.9 billion for these requirements but received only $2.7 billion in the funding bill passed this December.\u00a0 While the department is prudently utilizing the limited funding Congress has provided to prepare for the post-Title 42 environment, this notification of repurposing existing funds is only a fraction of what we will ultimately need.\nWe know smugglers will seek to take advantage of the end of Title 42 and that the first few weeks will be challenging, but I have full confidence in the dedicated men and women of DHS.\u00a0 We will do all we can to manage our border and increased encounters in a safe, orderly, and humane way.\u00a0 We are working with our regional partners.\u00a0 We are going after the smugglers.\u00a0 We are surging resources to the border.\u00a0 But we cannot do everything that we need to do until Congress provides the needed resources and reforms.\u00a0 We call on Congress to provide the resources we need to continue our work.\u00a0 We stand ready to work with Congress to pass desperately needed reform to our immigration and asylum system.\u00a0 In the meantime, we will continue to do our part, implementing the approach we have described here today.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We will take a couple questions.\u00a0 I see we have a special guest today.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you want to ask the secretaries first.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 It\u2019s Take Your Children to Work Day, and we\u2019d happy \u2013 happy to take a question from you, if you have one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Or you can whisper to Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Well, I think she wanted to ask about the geopolitical and strategic implications of the U.S.-China-Russia rivalry, but that\u2019s a little bit off topic.\u00a0 Instead, she had a joke she wanted to tell, but I don\u2019t \u2013 not sure if she\u2019s got a little bit of stage fright.\u00a0 So let me go ahead and start.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Go ahead, Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 One, for either of you, on the Regional Processing Centers, do you have a target, an estimate, of how many people will be able to \u2013 the capacity for these, like per week or per month?\u00a0 And whether you do or not, if you think that they will be so successful and are truly new and innovative, why hasn\u2019t this been done before?\nAnd then secondly, for Secretary Blinken, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any updates on the Sudan evacuation or non-evacuation situation in terms of the State Department.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Do you want to start, Ali?\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 Happy to.\u00a0 So this is a process that will scale up over time.\u00a0 We are going to begin in collaboration, of course, with the State Department and our partner countries to begin several thousand each month, 5-6,000 plus each month individuals processed, a material impact on the decision-making of people who are seeking relief in a country.\u00a0 The whole model is to reach the people where they are, to cut the smugglers out, and to have them avoid the perilous journey that too many do not make.\u00a0 But we are beginning in Guatemala and Colombia.\u00a0 We are beginning at the level that I described and we will scale up.\u00a0 We are incredibly proud of the fact that we negotiated this agreement with those foreign countries and we hope to expand beyond there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Ali.\u00a0 And Matt, just to add one point on that, I think as this effort moves forward and we establish it, my expectation would be that even beyond the numbers of people who might be processed in a given month, other people, having \u2013 seeing that this is now a way to access legal pathways to the United States that doesn\u2019t require them to, again, take the hazardous journey to our border and to put themselves in the hands of smugglers, and then to come only to be turned away in any event, my expectation would be that many other people beyond those who are actually being processed in a given month will stay put and wait to avail themselves of this additional way of accessing legal pathways.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We have to build it out and we\u2019re very actively working on doing that.\nAs to why this hasn\u2019t been done before, well, I mean, it\u2019s like any good idea.\u00a0 You can say, \u201cGee, why didn\u2019t we think of this before?\u201d\u00a0 But the fact is we\u2019re working on it now, and we\u2019re working to make it real and effective.\nOn Sudan, just a few things.\u00a0 First, we are very actively working to extend the ceasefire.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a 72-hour ceasefire, which like most ceasefires is imperfect but nonetheless has reduced violence.\u00a0 And that\u2019s obviously created somewhat better conditions for people in Sudan.\u00a0 It\u2019s also enabled some humanitarian assistance to continue to move around.\nBut we want to make sure that, if possible, this is extended.\u00a0 We\u2019re very actively engaged on that.\u00a0 I hope and expect to have more information on that in the coming hours.\u00a0 And the focus, again, is on extending the ceasefire and making sure there is humanitarian access.\nWith regard to American citizens in Sudan, a few things to be said about that.\u00a0 We are providing the best possible advice that we can to anyone asking for our assistance about conditions, about safety, about security, so that they can make decisions with the most information possible about what they want to do, whether they want to stay, whether they want to try to go.\nAs you know, the vast majority of American citizens who are in Sudan are dual nationals, most of whom have made their lives and livelihoods in Sudan for years, decades.\u00a0 So these are very challenging decisions for people to make.\u00a0 But we\u2019re in contact with Americans who have registered with us in one way or another, and very active contact.\nWhat\u2019s happened over the last 72 or so hours is that the reduction in violence that we were able to achieve through the ceasefires that we helped produce has allowed partners and allies, in coordination with us, to conduct some aerial evacuations.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing important logistical support to these efforts.\u00a0 This is a collaborative process and we have managed to direct many Americans who have \u2013 were seeking to leave to that evacuation process so that they could, along with other nationals, take advantage of it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s ongoing.\nAt the same time, what happens in these situations is you have people who are not all at once\u00a0\u2013 everyone making a decision in a given moment, at a given time, about what they\u2019re going to do or not do.\u00a0 This changes over time.\u00a0 So people who today think that they\u2019re going to stay put may decide next week, next month, that they want to leave.\nWhat we need to do and what we\u2019re working to establish is a sustained process for enabling people to leave, assuming that the conditions that we see now are maintained, by which I mean on the one hand, yes, a ceasefire, however imperfect, but also ongoing violence, confrontation between the two rival military groups, et cetera.\nAs we\u2019ve looked at this, we believe that the best way to have an enduring capability to help people leave Sudan, if that\u2019s what they so choose, is overland.\u00a0 And we are working to establish a process that would enable people to move overland to a place where they can more easily exit the country \u2013 in all likelihood, Port Sudan.\u00a0 So that\u2019s under very active development, and again, that will be the most effective way to have a sustained process, a sustained mechanism, an enduring capability to enable people to leave if that\u2019s the choice they make.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Tracy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A couple of technical questions and then something broader for either of you.\u00a0 Following up on the regional centers, how many more countries are you negotiating with to set up centers to add them down the line?\u00a0 You have set a goal, I think you said, of doubling the number of refugees to be admitted.\u00a0 Is that realistic given the huge backlog, the enormous demand, and how long it does take to scale up to the 6,000 a month or whatever it is?\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering how many more people will really be helped in these new measures.\nSecretary Mayorkas, you said something I didn\u2019t quite get about family detention.\u00a0 Will entire families now be detained?\u00a0 Is that the idea?\nAnd finally, for Secretary Blinken, you mentioned the global aspect of immigration, and so I wanted to ask about Russians who\u2019ve been coming to the United States seeking asylum, saying they\u2019re fleeing conscription.\u00a0 Many of them are minorities, and it seems like their cases are being turned down.\u00a0 Many have been detained by ICE and a few that we know of have been deported back to Russia.\u00a0 So why is that not a \u2013 why do they not have a credible fear case?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 So let me \u2013 I can take the questions, if I may.\u00a0 So the issue of credible fear, the determination of credible fear is a very case-specific, individualized determination.\u00a0 Our very experienced asylum officers make those determinations based on the facts presented to them as well as their background information with respect to the country conditions.\u00a0 And so they evaluate the claims based on the people before them and the case that those individuals present.\nWe are indeed in discussions with other countries to expand the Regional Processing Centers, and they will have a significant impact on the migratory decisions of individuals in the region, and our parole processes really communicate that fact quite powerfully.\u00a0 People don\u2019t want to place their lives and their life savings in the hands of ruthless smugglers.\u00a0 If they have a lawful, safe, and orderly pathway to come to the United States or another destination country \u2013 like Canada or Spain, as Secretary Blinken mentioned \u2013 they will avail themselves of those lawful pathways.\u00a0 That has proven true through our parole processes and other lawful pathways that we have implemented to date.\nThat is especially true when, if they do take that perilous journey and happen to survive, because all too many do not, they will find that the border is not open and they are subject to removal.\u00a0 And removal will occur in the expedited removal context swiftly, in a matter of days or just a few weeks.\nThe Regional Processing Centers will indeed make a big difference because we are surging asylum officers to work with the international organizations \u2013 the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration \u2013 to screen people very quickly.\u00a0 We are going to be delivering efficiencies in the refugee screening process to move that process more rapidly than before.\u00a0 This is going to have a material impact in a number of ways.\u00a0 One, we will provide relief for a greater number of people; and two, an even greater number of people will wait to avail themselves of this pathway because of its magnitude and the consequence of not doing so.\nWe have no plan to detain families.\u00a0 As I mentioned, we will be employing alternatives to detention, including some innovations in that regard, and we will on a case-by-case basis use enhanced alternatives to detention as warranted.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Camilla.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 The \u2013 my understanding is that the U.S. intends to continue deporting Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans to Mexico if they crossed the southern border unlawfully.\u00a0 So do you know how many migrants or deportees Mexico has agreed to accept, if any?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think Mexico has spoken about it publicly.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 To date \u2013 to date, Mexico has agreed to accept up to 30,000 expulsions under Title 42 per month.\u00a0 That is a decision that they have made.\u00a0 We intend in a post-Title 42 environment, when we are using expedited removal \u2013 our Title 8 of the United States Code authorities \u2013 we intend to return individuals to Mexico from those nationalities.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Leon.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Just a technical question on these regional centers, if I may.\u00a0 If I understood you correctly, you said they were being \u2013 they would be operated by international partners.\u00a0 Are you outsourcing the immigration process?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start with that.\u00a0 No, the point here is to do the following:\u00a0 It\u2019s to take advantage of the fact that international partners have physical locations in a number of countries where they are doing very, very important work, and to be able to bring some of our own officers and experts into these centers so that people can come to them and explore whether they are eligible for one of the various legal pathways to come to this country, whether it\u2019s as a refugee, whether it\u2019s for family reunification, whether it\u2019s for a labor pathway.\u00a0 And that means that it\u2019s a lot easier for people who are contemplating coming to determine from their own countries whether they have a legal pathway to do that, so it\u2019s making legal pathways much more accessible.\nAnd as Secretary Mayorkas was saying, as this gets up and running and as people see that there is now a more accessible way to determine whether they are eligible to come to the United States through a variety of pathways, we believe that that will take significant incentive away for people to instead make this incredibly hazardous journey to the United States, put themselves in the hands of smugglers, encounter all the terrible dangers that we know they encounter along the way in an effort to pursue asylum, and in any event not get in.\nSo that\u2019s the idea.\u00a0 But no, it is reliant on our own people to share the information and to do some prescreening of individuals who come to these centers.\nAnything you want to \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Have you discussed with Colombia about returning migrants?\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\n\n"}, {"url":

everyone, and a very warm welcome to my friend the Cabinet Secretary Mutua.\u00a0 Alfred, very good to have you here, and I really appreciate the good, productive conversation that we had a short while ago.\nHowever, before I turn to that and to the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Dialogue, which is underway today, let me just share a brief update on Sudan.\nOn Saturday, I directed the temporary suspension of operations at Embassy Khartoum, and we conducted a successful operation to safely evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel and their dependents.\nI want to reiterate my appreciation for the leadership of Ambassador John Godfrey and the entire embassy team who managed the consolidation of our people and the necessary preparations for the evacuation under a very fluid security situation, even as they were tirelessly working to broker an Eid ceasefire.\u00a0 I could not be prouder of our team, most of whom are now en route back to the United States.\nI especially want to express my gratitude to Secretary of Defense Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Milley, and the men and women of the U.S. military who executed the evacuation operation with their usual extraordinary precision and skill.\u00a0 They once again demonstrated that they are the finest in the world.\nA decision to suspend operations at the embassy, remove our personnel from their assigned post, is among the most difficult that any Secretary has to make.\u00a0 But my first priority is the safety of our people, and I determined that the deteriorating security conditions in Khartoum posed an unacceptable risk to keeping our team there at this time.\nI want to be clear that even as we have temporarily suspended operations on the ground in Khartoum, our diplomatic and consular work in Sudan continues.\u00a0 Indeed, in just the last 36 hours since the embassy evacuation operation was completed, we\u2019ve continued to be in close communication with U.S. citizens and individuals affiliated with the U.S. Government to provide assistance and facilitate available departure routes for those seeking to move to safety via land, air, and sea.\nThis includes Americans who are traveling overland in the UN convoy from Khartoum to Port Sudan.\u00a0 We also continue to coordinate with allies and partners who are conducting their own operations, and to leverage those efforts to include Americans.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking further steps to support Americans and are exploring options to return the diplomatic and consular presence to Sudan as soon as possible.\nWe also continue to engage directly with General Burhan and General Hemedti to press them to extend and expand the Eid ceasefire to a sustainable cessation of hostilities that prevents further violence and upholds humanitarian obligations.\u00a0 The Sudanese people are not giving up on their aspirations for a secure, free, and democratic future; neither will we.\nThe United States will work with all parties, in coordination with regional and international partners, to bring an end to the fighting and a return to the transition to a civilian government.\nKenya, under President Ruto, has been a strong partner in this effort.\u00a0 And indeed, Kenya is a security leader throughout the region.\u00a0 That\u2019s evident not only in its commitment to resolving the current crisis in Sudan, but also in its support for United Nations and African Union peacekeeping efforts and the counterterrorism mission in Somalia, in its partnership to reach the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Ethiopia, and in its stewardship of the Nairobi process to advance peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAnd over the last two years, its tenure on the UN Security Council, Kenya has consistently stood up for the UN Charter and focused members on addressing the humanitarian and human rights crises across the continent and beyond.\nBeyond peace and security, Kenya and the United States are partnering on a wide range of issues.\u00a0 And that\u2019s reflected in the breadth of topics that we\u2019re tackling in the Strategic Dialogue.\u00a0 One of the major focuses we had today is public health, an area in which Kenya is demonstrating its potential to be a regional and indeed a global leader.\u00a0 The United States is supporting Kenyan-led vaccine production, including through Moderna\u2019s $500 million investment in a new manufacturing facility near Nairobi, which will produce mRNA vaccines to tackle viruses from COVID-19 to Ebola, from RSV to HIV.\nKenya remains at the forefront of the global HIV response.\u00a0 Today that\u2019s nearly reached \u2013 and has nearly reached \u2013 excuse me \u2013 its 95-95-95 targets: diagnose 95 percent of all HIV\u2011positive individuals, provide anti-retroviral therapy for 95 percent of those diagnosed, and achieve viral suppression for 95 percent of those treated.\u00a0 That is a tremendous milestone that is saving countless lives, and we\u2019re proud to have supported this effort over two decades with PEPFAR as it\u2019s been operating in Kenya.\u00a0 Now, we\u2019re building on that success by moving to a Kenya-owned, Kenya-driven, and Kenya-funded framework that will position the country to achieve sustained HIV epidemic control by 2025.\nHealth security and food security are closely intertwined.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard loudly and clearly from African leaders that emergency aid cannot be the only solution.\u00a0 So we\u2019re investing in sustainable, long-term African food production.\u00a0 That includes our work, with the AU and the UN, to invest in nutritious, climate-resilient crops and develop climate-smart agriculture.\u00a0 And it includes mobilizing the private sector in that effort.\nPresident Ruto recently announced 14 investments valued at over $150 million by private firms in Kenya\u2019s agro-industrial productivity.\u00a0 In total, these new partnerships will create over 20,000 Kenyan jobs, boost incomes by \u2013 for more than 1 million smallholder farmers, and increase sales and exports by over $130 million \u2013 while, of course, dramatically increasing local crop production and reducing malnutrition.\nU.S. companies are eager to invest in Kenya\u2019s success.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to supporting U.S. investment in Kenya \u2013 particularly in key sectors like information and communications technologies, agriculture, renewable energy \u2013 which will help Kenya achieve its goal of reaching upper-middle income status by 2030, while creating jobs and opportunity for people in both our countries.\nFinally, we\u2019re discussing through the Strategic Dialogue how the United States can continue to support Kenya\u2019s democratic progress.\u00a0 Its recent and fair elections and orderly and peaceful transition of power are a model for the region \u2013 demonstrating the commitment of its people, civil society, and leaders to transparent governance that is accountable to its citizens.\nSo we have made a lot of progress, and we\u2019re proud of it, and we have a lot on the agenda today.\u00a0 And as with all of our Strategic Dialogues, particularly with Kenya, the work of today is also the work of the 364 days that follow.\u00a0 This is an effort that takes place day-in, day-out between our governments, between our officials, between our experts, but also between our private sectors, our civil societies, our citizens, building, strengthening a partnership between our countries.\nI want to thank the cabinet secretary for his commitment to advancing this agenda, and Alfred, the floor is yours.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I\u2019m very happy to be here with my team.\u00a0 And I want to thank you for the warm welcome that you have given to us and the hospitality, and this Strategic Dialogue that is very important for both our countries, and not just both our countries, but also the African continent.\nLet me start the way you finished, and that is the issue of democracy.\u00a0 Kenya prides itself to be a democratic country that believes in the rights of the people to be able to go to the ballot box and choose their leaders and to live in a stable country where there\u2019s economic growth.\u00a0 And we want to thank the United States for the support you\u2019ve given us over the years in ensuring that we have a democratic country.\u00a0 And we will continue expounding the views and the principles and philosophies of true democracy as it is and stability in the region.\nKenya is open for business, as we usually say.\u00a0 We are moving into an era where we are saying we want more trade, not aid.\u00a0 Kenya is well placed in the African continent to be a hub for American investors.\u00a0 In the African continent, we now have the African Continental Free Trade Area, with a population of 1.3 billion people.\u00a0 When you come and invest in Kenya, it means you\u2019re investing in the continent of Africa.\u00a0 You\u2019re able to supply your goods, you\u2019re coming from a hub that can able to help you.\u00a0 We have worked very closely with American companies, and we had a very good Chamber of Commerce meeting in Nairobi, where a raft of new initiatives were announced to enable people to be able to \u2013 American farms to be able to come and invest in Kenya.\u00a0 So welcome, Americans, to come and invest in Kenya as you continue.\nIn the area of our cooperation and Strategic Dialogue, you mentioned Moderna as a company that is about to break ground in Kenya.\u00a0 We welcome more companies to come to Kenya, because we\u2019ve always been very good partners, and we\u2019ll continue working well together.\nIn this Strategic Dialogue, I think we\u2019re also talking about issues of climate change.\u00a0 The reality is that it is not a matter of when but if the world has transitioned from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\u00a0 Kenya, we\u2019re at a good place and only 2 percent of our energy is renewable energy, using hydro, geothermal, solar, and wind.\u00a0 And we want to grow that to 100 percent by 2030.\u00a0 And we want to work with American farms and American Government towards supporting the production of green hydrogen, which is what the future will need.\nSo we have looked at the past.\u00a0 We have fossil fuels.\u00a0 We\u2019ve decided not to tap into them because the environment is very important.\u00a0 We have to protect now for future, otherwise the world will not be in a very, very good place.\u00a0 So we want to be able to work together in those many ways.\nWe\u2019ll be discussing many issues, ranging from security, peace in the region \u2013 as you know, Kenya has been quite involved in the mediation in Ethiopia, and also looking at what you can do for Democratic Republic of Congo.\u00a0 COVID has taught us that what happens in one part of the world will happen \u2013 will have an influence or an impact on what happens in the rest of the world.\u00a0 So we want to acknowledge the support we have been receiving, and the comradeship between us and the United States in terms of bringing peace to the region.\u00a0 And we are committed to be the peacemakers of the continent of Africa, if not the world, looking at silencing the guns, people sitting down and being able to work together.\nIt is in the same spirit we are talking about the Russia and Ukraine conflict where Kenya recognizes Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders, and we\u2019ve been calling for cessation of hostilities, and the steps that have been taken so far to tell others that you cannot roll back history.\u00a0 We\u2019re at a place we are by now; we have to move forward.\u00a0 You can\u2019t start claiming countries, or claiming countries that are part of you.\u00a0 Nostalgia is not the order of the day now.\u00a0 We need people to be respected, they need peace and security, and we have to have a system where we don\u2019t let things get out of hand.\u00a0 Because today it\u2019s Ukraine; what about tomorrow?\u00a0 What will it be?\nWe also are very happy about many things that are happening.\u00a0 But as they happen also, we are quite sad of what\u2019s happening in the Sudan.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been working closely with the Government of Sudan, trying to get to a place whereby we can have peace and stability.\u00a0 It is quite tragic that we have more bullets coming into Sudan or being used in Sudan than food.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a tragedy, because we see from where we sit a lot of international interference, a lot of other players trying to use Sudan as a playing field for whatever reason, for the gold in Sudan, for territorial strength and control of the region.\nAnd we\u2019re trying to ask \u2013 we are asking external forces to leave Sudan alone.\u00a0 As an African continent and the AU and intergovernmental organization called IGAD, we are trying to find solutions for Sudan.\u00a0 I know you\u2019ve pulled your teams out.\u00a0 Kenya is not pulling its diplomatic offices.\u00a0 We\u2019re not shutting them down because we want to have a presence as we negotiate.\nPresident Ruto is looking forward to going to Sudan as soon as it stabilizes and there is enough security to try and see how we can engage the leaders.\u00a0 We are trying to engage the two warring parties, we\u2019re trying to bring them to the table so that we can have a good end, to a cessation of the violence.\u00a0 And what we want is civilian rule eventually over there.\nPresident Ruto has offered Kenya to mediate the conflict and to restore civility and peace.\u00a0 And we are quite persuaded that a peacefully negotiated solution to the conflict in Sudan is within reach.\u00a0 And as always, we stand ready to make our contribution, and we\u2019ll be playing hand-in-hand with that.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll be able to work together and see what we can do.\nI want to thank you.\u00a0 There are many topics we can talk about.\u00a0 We look forward to welcoming you back to Kenya sometime soon, and we look forward to President Biden also visiting Kenya, and President Ruto coming back, and thus holding these meeting at presidential level as we continue to work.\nWhat I can assure you is that Kenya will remain a good partner, will remain a friend of the United States, and we\u2019ll be able to work in sync as we try to improve the world that we live in.\u00a0\u00a0 When it comes to issues of trade, when it comes to the issue of health, when it comes to the issue of peace and stability, when it comes to issues of humanity, we are all the same people and we want to have a good life while we\u2019re here.\u00a0 And if we can work together as friends, it will be very good.\nAnd at that note, I want to welcome Americans to visit Kenya.\u00a0 We don\u2019t get as many Americans coming to Kenya as they should.\u00a0 I think our elephants and lions are complaining that they don\u2019t see a lot of Americans in our national parks.\u00a0 So Kenya is a safe and happy place, and we welcome Americans to come down for safari where you actually get to interact with the animals as long as they don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t get too close.\u00a0 But they\u2019ll be happy to see you.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take three questions.\u00a0 First, we\u2019ll go to Cindy Spang from Voice of America.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, thank you.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 I have one question for you, Secretary Blinken, and several questions for both of you, please.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, do you have numbers of how many Americans remain in Sudan?\u00a0 And could you share any updates on their safety and well\u2011being?\u00a0 And what options are there for those who want to leave?\nAnd for both of you:\u00a0 Cabinet Secretary Mutua, you mentioned foreign involvement in Sudan.\u00a0 Could you elaborate on that, please?\u00a0 And have either of you seen direct or indirect involvement from Egypt or the United Arab Emirates?\u00a0 And if so, have you spoken to their leaders about that?\u00a0 And have you seen involvement by the Wagner Group, and you are \u2013 how concerned are you that Russia may fan the violence?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 First, in terms of American citizens in Sudan, as you know, in any country around the world, whether it\u2019s Sudan or anywhere else, we never know with any precision how many Americans may be there at any given time because Americans are not required to register with the embassy, with the government, either when they go, when they reside, or when they leave.\u00a0 So we don\u2019t have a good fix on the number of Americans who are there at any given time, including now.\nWe do know, of course, the number of Americans who have registered with us and with whom we\u2019re in very active touch, communication.\u00a0 And of those, I would say some dozens have expressed an interest in leaving, and as I mentioned just a few moments ago, even with the withdrawal of our embassy personnel from Sudan, our efforts to provide services to American citizens who are there \u2013 consular services, other services, advice \u2013 continues, and we\u2019re in regular communication with American citizens.\u00a0 We are looking to see how we can help them ensure their own safety.\u00a0 We have been working with allies and with partners to do as much as we can to enable them to find their way out if that\u2019s what they choose to do.\nNow, keep in mind as well that the overwhelming majority of American citizens in Sudan are dual nationals who have made their lives there, been living there for years, for decades, for generations, and many want to continue to do that.\u00a0 But for those who are seeking to leave, we\u2019ll continue to engage directly with them to see what we can do to help them, and as I said, with allies and partners as well to help facilitate their departure.\u00a0 And this is going to be an ongoing process.\nIn addition, we\u2019re looking at what options we have to perhaps resume a diplomatic presence in Sudan, including in Port Sudan; that\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 But conditions are very challenging and we\u2019re tracking that very carefully.\nJust to pick up on the second part of the question, look, on one level, a whole variety of countries are involved in Sudan, have been engaged there, and engaged in \u2013 to some extent in trying to help Sudan move forward with its transition to a civilian-led government.\u00a0 And we have been in touch repeatedly throughout this crisis with a variety of them.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken directly to counterparts in Saudi Arabia, in the United Arab Emirates; other members of our team have spoken to Egypt and other countries, the United Kingdom \u2013 all to the same end, which is trying to get a ceasefire, trying to get a more sustainable cessation of hostilities, and then trying to get the country back on track to the transition to a civilian-led government that it was on before the violence that erupted derailed that effort.\u00a0 And it remains vitally important that countries use whatever positive influence they have to try to move Sudan in that direction.\nWe do have deep concern about the engagement of the Prigozhin group, the Wagner Group, in Sudan.\u00a0 It\u2019s in so many different countries in Africa \u2013 an element that, when it\u2019s engaged, simply brings more death and destruction with it.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very important that we not see its further engagement in Sudan.\u00a0 And I know a number of countries are very concerned with that prospect.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I agree with you there with the last statement about all these groups coming in and destabilizing.\u00a0 Currently in Sudan, we are trying also to evacuate Kenyans who have been working and living in Sudan.\u00a0 We\u2019ve (inaudible) to a lot of requests by the international organizations, the UN particularly, and other countries to help evacuate some of their people and bring them to Kenya or get them out of Sudan because of current need to accompany, and so we\u2019ll be proceeding.\nBut it would be good if we can find a way of establishing a ceasefire, even for a few hours or even a half a day or a day, to enable people to be able to move, to enable food and supplies to be brought in to the \u2013 especially in the capital, Khartoum, and other places.\nIn terms of involvement and indirect and direct involvement of various groups, we\u2019ve been quite concerned by some of our friends in the Middle East as (inaudible) Russia and others who for a long time have been friendly to either one or the other side.\u00a0 And we are just saying that at this particular time, it is not a time to take sides in a war.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to be able to come together and bring them together because at the end of the day, peace has to prevail.\u00a0 And so it doesn\u2019t matter who you support; at the end of the day, we need to have the people of Sudan have stability.\nSo all these other interests, if they can just keep off and let us bring peace to Sudan, we do believe it is possible.\u00a0 And that is where we are working towards as Kenya, together with our partners.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t want to be talking to people who are being supported and armed more and given strength by outsiders who don\u2019t live in Sudan.\u00a0 We care about Sudan.\u00a0 As part of the African Union, we want to silence the guns in Sudan, want to find an African solution to African problems with the support of our friends.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t effectively do that if we are talking to groups that are being strengthened every day by the parties who believe that all they need to do is to fight to the end.\u00a0 There is no fighting to the end.\u00a0 At the end of the day, it\u2019s the local and the normal people who lose, not just their leaders.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Julian Pecquet from\u00a0The Africa Report.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Julian Pecquet of\u00a0The Africa Report,\u00a0Jeune Afrique.\u00a0 You mentioned, Secretary Mutua, about President Ruto\u2019s involvement with IGAD and the talks with the Sudanese, so I have a few questions.\u00a0 One of them is what are you hearing from the parties to the conflict?\u00a0 What are you telling them?\u00a0 What kind of progress are we seeing, are we making since the past week?\u00a0 Any progress on when the president might host the parties in Nairobi if he can\u2019t go to Sudan because of the security situation?\u00a0 And how are you working with the African Union, which has its own effort going on?\u00a0 Secretary Blinken perhaps can talk to what the U.S. can do to help with the African-led negotiations.\nEastern Congo is another conflict where foreign actors are working at cross-purposes.\u00a0 I wanted to ask if Kenya can be a meaningful force in the DRC.\u00a0 Are you willing to take on the fight to the M23, which is what the Congolese seem to want?\u00a0 And can you tell us what the latest is with negotiations to renew the mandate of the East Africa Community regional force?\u00a0 And here as well, what role can the U.S. play?\nAnd then finally, on trade, perhaps we can talk about agriculture specifically, which is a very big deal to the Kenyans, obviously.\u00a0 What kind of progress are we making in the bilateral talks on agriculture, and particularly U.S. GMO exports to your country?\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 As members of IGAD, we have decided to be at the forefront in finding a solution to all these problems.\u00a0 We do believe that we are at a good place because the two warring leaders are talking to us, so that\u2019s a good sign.\u00a0 They are not \u2013 they \u2013 when you talk \u2013 when they are being talked to, they\u2019re talking back, and we\u2019re able to open the channels of communication.\u00a0 The fighting is still going on in Sudan, but we just feel that at least we have an entryway.\u00a0 They have not locked themselves up and shut their ears to the world.\u00a0 They are listening to the world, and they know the pressure that is being felt around them.\nOur president is ready.\u00a0 We have said that Kenya is ready at any moment\u2019s notice.\u00a0 Even if our president may not be able to go there immediately, we are ready to start discussions, and that\u2019s a message we are communicating to them, is that send us part of your teams.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start talking about what needs to be achieved because there\u2019s a reason they are fighting.\u00a0 They are fighting because they can\u2019t agree about something and we need to be able to sort out what they can\u2019t agree about, find a common, agreeable ground and then be able to move forward.\u00a0 And this is also under the auspices of the African Union.\u00a0 The African Union had a ministerial meeting where they called cessation of fighting, where they called for dialogue, and so this is part of the process.\nWhat we are doing as Kenya is that we are not just going to wait.\u00a0 We are saying \u2013 we\u2019ve put \u2013 stuck our necks out and said, we can provide a solution.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been in this game for some time.\u00a0 We\u2019ve \u2013 kind of have a bit of experience in how these things are done, and we love the people of Sudan so much that we say that we are ready to commit ourselves to hosting a negotiation between the two of you, the two warring groups, and trying to find solution so that the innocent people of Sudan \u2013 great people of Sudan \u2013 who are suffering can have this burden lifted from them.\nIn terms of eastern Congo, yes, our troops are on the ground, and it\u2019s not about us fighting the M23.\u00a0 We are not there to fight M23 or to fight anybody.\u00a0 We are there to provide a corridor that allows the groups that are fighting the Congolese Government and the ones that are being fought by the Congolese Government to have a sense of security through there.\u00a0 That they can start \u2013 we can \u2013 they can start putting down their guns and getting to the table and be able to negotiate.\nIt is important to note that M23 has been in operation for over 30 years.\u00a0 It is not just a simple problem that just started yesterday.\u00a0 So we are working together, and the Nairobi processes are still \u2013 is still going on, process still going on.\u00a0 We have Nairobi 4 coming up, and so we are fully engaged.\u00a0 And they have different meetings being called this coming month to try and sort out the issue.\nIn terms of the regional force and extending, that\u2019s in the process, and we are confident that will be \u2013 Kenya is not planning to withdraw its troops until we find an amicable solution.\u00a0 And we want to thank our partners, the United States and others, for the promised support that we can be able to work together to ensure that that region is stable.\nMaybe you can take agriculture fast, then I can \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Alfred.\u00a0 Let me just add that in terms of our engagement in Sudan, first, we\u2019ve been deeply engaged directly with the parties.\u00a0 I have spoken to Generals Burhan and Hemedti on multiple occasions.\u00a0 We strongly support African-led efforts to help both mediate this crisis, to end the hostilities, and, as I said, get back on the \u2013 on track to transition to a civilian-led government.\u00a0 We participated in, I think, an important meeting by video conference that was convened by the chairperson of the African Union, Mr. Faki, just at the end of last week that included the secretary-general of the United Nations, that included virtually all of the stakeholders in Africa and beyond who have an interest in trying to help Sudan get back on track, and we continue to support those efforts.\nWe all have the same goal.\u00a0 We\u2019re all driving to the same place.\u00a0 That is a ceasefire that\u2019s genuinely durable, that turns into a full cessation of hostilities between the competing forces, and that resumes the very important negotiations that were underway to create a transition to a civilian-led government \u2013 negotiations that had produced very significant progress, including the agreed framework.\u00a0 So that is everyone\u2019s goal, and we\u2019ll use both our direct engagement as helpful and as appropriate, but also strongly in support of AU-led efforts to put this back on track.\nWith regard to the United States and Kenya and trade, I think first it\u2019s worth pointing out that it\u2019s up 20 percent over the last year.\u00a0 That in and of itself speaks volumes.\u00a0 And when it comes to agriculture, that\u2019s exactly one of the things that we focused on today in a variety of ways, and I think that\u2019s going to be also the product of the Strategic Dialogue that we\u2019re having today and that you\u2019ll hear more about when we conclude our conversations.\nOne of the things that we talked about \u2013 and this has been part of an ongoing conversation \u2013 is of course Kenya is on the receiving end of an acute food insecurity challenge, like many other countries in Africa and beyond.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen an almost perfect storm that\u2019s emerged \u2013 the combination of climate change, of COVID, and of conflict, including the Russian aggression against Ukraine \u2013 all of which have contributed dramatically to rising food insecurity in Africa and beyond.\nWe have been deeply and intensely engaged in meeting this challenge.\u00a0 If you go back to February of last year when Russia invaded Ukraine again, we\u2019ve provided since then about $13.5 billion toward building greater food security, including direct assistance to Kenya and to many other countries.\u00a0 The United States has provided about 75 percent of the United Nations appeal for Kenya when it comes to food security.\nBut for all of the efforts that we and other countries are making in partnership with Kenya and other friends to address the immediate crisis, we\u2019re equally focused on helping countries build sustainable, long-term, productive capacity themselves.\u00a0 That is fundamentally the answer to the challenge.\u00a0 And I think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity there, including in the work that we\u2019re doing with Kenya.\nOne aspect of that is making sure that, using remarkable technology that we\u2019ve developed over recent years, that two things are addressed: the health and strength of soil, and the resilience of seeds.\u00a0 We have the capacity to basically map soil anywhere to determine whether it\u2019s strong or not and needs help.\u00a0 We also have remarkable technology when it comes to seeds to make sure that they are much more resilient to climate change, to droughts, to extreme conditions.\u00a0 And this is one of the things that we\u2019re working on with Kenya, as well as building out the entire production infrastructure that\u2019s also vital to making sure that there\u2019s genuine food security.\nSo this is very much part of our dialogue.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of our ongoing conversation.\u00a0 And I expect you\u2019ll see more on that in \u2013 both today and in the months to come.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\u00a0 Just to add on to issues of agriculture, and this is where with the impact of climate change I think it\u2019s a lesson to all of us that we can\u2019t keep on relying on rainfed agriculture.\u00a0 So we have a massive program in Kenya of building dams so that we can be able to conduct irrigation \u2013 hold irrigation programs so that now when it rains \u2013 it doesn\u2019t rain at least over there, but we still have to combat climate change.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we are planting 15 billion trees over the next few years to try and roll back what is happening.\nAgriculture in our region will only thrive if our farmers feel that they need to use it for economic reasons.\u00a0 Agriculture is not only for food, because when a farmer grows crops, that farmer uses \u2013 sells those crops, eats some and sells the crops and gets money for school fees, for building, for their car, et cetera, et cetera.\u00a0 So to us when it came to agriculture is also an economic issue, and that\u2019s why we are talking about value addition in the conversation we\u2019re talking about, getting our products here.\nI can say with no fear of contradiction that Kenya has the best tea and coffee in the world, and so we would like to be able to get more of that in the United States.\u00a0 And even our products \u2013 as we add value to our products, which means that with opening up of the markets means that our farmers get more money in their pocket as a motivation, they engage more into growing crops, and then it becomes a cycle that is able to continue.\u00a0 So it\u2019s about sustainability.\nMR. PATEL:\u00a0Final question. Kylie Atwood, CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Thanks, you guys.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to start with Secretary Mutua, please.\u00a0 I just wonder if you could be a little bit more explicit for us in terms of how exactly Kenya has seen the Wagner Group\u2019s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Sudan.\u00a0 And you said that you believe that a peaceful resolution is in reach in Sudan.\u00a0 Why exactly do you feel that that is in reach?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, just questions on Sudan and then also on Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 First, on Sudan, have the convoys that have attempted to leave Sudan, that have American citizens who have joined them, run into any problems, any violence along the routes on the way out, as far as the U.S. knows at this point?\u00a0 And you mentioned potentially resuming a U.S. diplomatic presence at Port Sudan.\u00a0 Could that happen as soon as this week?\nAnd then just one question about a report this morning in\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0on the \u2013 on Ukrainians planning to attack Moscow earlier this year, on the one-year anniversary of the war.\u00a0 Based on that article, which comes from leaked classified U.S. Intelligence documents, it says that the country\u2019s military intelligence directorate agreed to postpone the strikes at Washington\u2019s request.\u00a0 Have Ukrainian officials ever discussed with you such potential plans for an attack on Moscow?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your message to any Ukrainian Government officials who may be privately advocating for such an approach?\u00a0 Thank you.\nCABINET SECRETARY MUTUA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I think the position that Kenya holds is that we don\u2019t want interference by any group, may be Warner Group or individual countries that may be involved directly or indirectly.\u00a0 At this particular time, we\u2019d just like us to be left with Sudan without foreign and other groups interfering with the peace process.\nWe are quite encouraged about peace being found in Sudan very soon.\u00a0 This is because we\u2019ve had negotiations and mediation and a process in Sudan that has gone on for some time.\u00a0 And a few weeks ago, there was a very successful forum held in Khartoum, where there was an agreement basically in terms of returning the country to civilian rule, in terms of when the next elections will be held, in terms of the balance of how things will run.\u00a0 And it was only one item that there was a bit of disagreement, and it\u2019s not even a major item.\u00a0 It was all about the militia \u2013 the RSF joining the national military and how the timelines and the groups \u2013 which was a very, very small issue, and we are confident that that is an issue that you can tackle.\u00a0 Basically, it\u2019s a 2 percent that remains; 98 percent has already been done and agreed and signed to.\u00a0 That is why we are very confident that, once there\u2019s cessation, and with a bit of mediation, we believe that by the end of this year we\u2019ll be talking a different story about Sudan.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, in terms of the convoys, it\u2019s \u2013 look, it\u2019s a moving picture, and we\u2019ve seen to date different things.\u00a0 Some of the convoys that have tried to move people out, including all the way to Port Sudan but also to places closer into Khartoum, some of them have encountered problems, including robbery, looting, that kind of thing.\u00a0 Others not.\u00a0 But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking very, very carefully.\nTo the extent that we\u2019ve been able to facilitate Americans being folded into some of those convoys, we\u2019ll continue to do that.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also trying to provide the best possible advice we can to anyone asking for our assistance about conditions, about safety, about security, so that they can make their own decisions with the most information possible.\u00a0 But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking as carefully as we can, and of course we\u2019re in very close contact with a number of countries that are engaged in removing their personnel from Sudan to make sure that we know from them what they\u2019re experiencing, what they\u2019re encountering.\u00a0 All of that factors into the advice that we can provide and the decisions that we make.\nWhen it comes to resuming our own diplomatic presence in Sudan, look, that\u2019s going to be entirely dependent on the conditions in Sudan. \u00a0Again, something that we\u2019ll look at day-in/day-out, but I can\u2019t put a timeframe on it at all.\u00a0 It\u2019s really conditions dependent.\nAnd finally, the last part of your question:\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to comment on any purported intelligence documents that are being reported on in the press.\u00a0 Thanks.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 When it comes to what Ukraine does to defend itself against the Russian aggression, these are decisions for the Ukrainians to make.\nThank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-japanese-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken At a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "The Prince Karuizawa ", "location": "Karuizawa, Japan", "date": "April 18, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone. \u00a0Let me \u2013 let me start with the situation in Sudan. \u00a0For the past 36 hours, we and our partners have been focused on how to stop the widespread fighting in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. \u00a0Indiscriminate military operations have resulted in significant civilian deaths and injuries, and are recklessly endangering the Sudanese people, diplomats including U.S. personnel, and humanitarian aid workers.\nThis morning, I made calls to Generals Burhan and Hemedti, urging them to agree to a 24-hour ceasefire to allow Sudanese to safely reunite with their families and to obtain desperately needed relief supplies.\nI also underscored in both calls the responsibilities that Sudanese fighting forces bear for ensuring the safety and security of U.S. and other diplomats who are resident in Sudan, as well as for UN staff and other humanitarian partners. \u00a0If implemented successfully, a ceasefire for 24 hours can create a foundation to build upon for a more sustained halt to the fighting and a return to negotiations on a durable end to the hostilities.\nThe people of Sudan have made clear their democratic aspirations. \u00a0After months of talks, they were close to restoring a civilian-led government.\u00a0 We remain committed to helping them achieve that goal. \u00a0At the same time, we will take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of our people.\nNow, we just finished up a marathon couple of days, during which the G7 foreign ministers came together to address some of the most consequential issues confronting our countries and people all over the world.\nI want to thank our Japanese hosts and especially my friend Foreign Minister Hayashi for the warm hospitality and for his leadership.\nTogether, we have strengthened the centrality of the G7 as the steering committee of the world\u2019s advanced industrial democracies, and deepened ties with other countries around the world. \u00a0And together, we emerge from this ministerial more globally engaged than ever.\nA major theme of this G7 was how our nations can leverage our strengths to work with our partners to deliver better futures for people around the world, to focus on the issues of most concern to them in their daily lives. \u00a0And this means combining our political and economic muscle and our development dollars, yen, euros, and pounds to support countries on every continent in meeting their food, energy, climate, infrastructure, and technology challenges.\nIt means shaping a more inclusive international system \u2013 including with UN reform, making the international financial system more responsive to the actual needs of countries, and finding new formats for consultation that welcome more voices. \u00a0It means offering more countries better, more sustainable, and more equitable ways to prosper, while respecting their sovereignty. \u00a0From Central Asia to the Pacific Islands to Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, our goal is to offer leaders and citizens better choices \u2013 free from coercion, unsustainable debt, and malign influence.\nWe also discussed a range of challenges to our shared vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous international system. \u00a0The most immediate challenge, of course, is Russia\u2019s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.\nYesterday, we recommitted to Ukraine: with the security and economic support that it needs today to defend its sovereignty and people, and for the long term to ensure that Ukraine doesn\u2019t just survive, that it thrives \u2013 and that Russia is deterred from further aggression.\nThis includes continuing to tighten sanctions and export controls, putting that pressure on Russia to limit its ability to wage its war, cracking down on sanctions evaders wherever they hide, rejecting Moscow\u2019s nuclear blackmail, and ensuring accountability for war crimes.\nThe G7 from the get-go has led the world in galvanizing and sustaining support for Ukraine. \u00a0Now, as Ukraine prepares to launch a counteroffensive to take back its land, to liberate its people in occupied territories, to stop the missiles, bombs, and drones which continue to rain down daily on its civilians, we stand with Ukraine.\nAnd when the inevitable voices, led by a Russia that is losing its war of conquest, talk about avoiding escalation or call for Ukraine to stop reclaiming its own territory, we will remind the world who is the aggressor and who is the victim \u2013 who has 20 percent of its land occupied by enemy forces; whose children are being disappeared, and whose civilians are being killed and left in mass graves.\nAt the same time, Russia is again blocking Ukraine\u2019s grain from reaching the world, spiking food prices for people everywhere. \u00a0For the last few days, no ships have gotten out of Ukraine, and more than 50 have been blocked from going in to load up. \u00a0Countries around the world depend on this life-saving grain. \u00a0Russia is breaking its promises to them.\nWe also discussed China. \u00a0All of our nations have consequential relationships with Beijing, and a number of G7 colleagues have recently visited. \u00a0What struck me in hearing the readouts of those conversations is that we are resolved and united in the need for candid discussions with Beijing about its unfair trade practices, its actions that undermine the international rules that all nations benefit from, and the risks if it breaks its word and starts arming Russia. \u00a0And of course we\u2019re united in making clear to Beijing our opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo with Taiwan.\nWe\u2019re also equally committed, individually and collectively, to constructively engaging with Beijing if it chooses to contribute its efforts \u2013 to efforts to address shared global challenges. \u00a0That is what the world expects of responsible powers.\nAt this ministerial, we also focused on nuclear proliferation. \u00a0I\u2019m grateful to Japan for the high priority that it has placed on countering nuclear threats \u2013 including from the DPRK\u2019s dangerous ballistic missile launches; Iran\u2019s expansion of its nuclear activities, including the operation of advanced centrifuges and the accumulation of highly enriched uranium, for which it has no credible civilian explanation or purpose; Russia\u2019s New START suspension and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric; and the PRC\u2019s opaque and rapid build-up of its own nuclear arsenal. \u00a0These actions only strengthen our determination to address nuclear dangers.\nWe\u2019re also focused on the threat posed by synthetic opioids. \u00a0Our communique speaks to our collective commitment to developing and implementing solutions to this crisis, and we will continue to cooperate closely \u2013 indeed, we will strengthen that cooperation \u2013 addressing illicit financing, disrupting trafficking networks, supporting public health responses, and more.\nSo it\u2019s been a very productive and important few days which lay the groundwork for the Leaders Summit in Hiroshima in a month\u2019s time.\u00a0 And I commend to you the joint statement that we issued, or will soon issue, reflecting the work that we\u2019ve done.\nWith that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 All right, we\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First, Nike Ching from Voice of America.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Nike, how are you?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Inaudible.) \u00a0Thanks for the press conference.\u00a0 On Sudan, can you provide more details on reports that a U.S. embassy vehicle was targeted in Khartoum, which means (inaudible) divided?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your plan to ensure the safety and security of U.S. citizens and diplomats?\u00a0 Is there a plan to evacuate the embassy there given the newest developments?\u00a0 And if I may, do you support the calls from some senators to sanction generals of the two fighting military factions?\nAnd finally, if I may, on\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporter.\u00a0 Do you have more details on Ambassador Lynne Tracy\u2019s access to Evan Gershkovich given reports that a Moscow court is scheduled on Tuesday to hear an appeal on his case?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to Sudan, look, I\u2019m limited in terms of the details and what I can get into from here, but I can confirm that yesterday we had an American diplomatic convoy that was fired on.\u00a0 All of our people are safe and unharmed.\u00a0 But this action was reckless, it was irresponsible, and of course unsafe \u2013 a diplomatic convoy with diplomatic plates, a U.S. flag, being fired upon.\nIn the calls that I had this morning with Generals Hemedti and Burhan, I made very clear that any attacks, threats, dangers posed to our diplomats were totally unacceptable.\u00a0 This particular incident is still being investigated in terms of understanding exactly what happened.\u00a0 The initial reports that we have is that it was undertaken by forces associated with the RSF, and again, I made very clear in my conversation with General Hemedti that any attacks that endanger our diplomats are totally unacceptable, and I shared the same with General Burhan.\nWe have deep concerns, of course, about the overall security environment as it affects civilians, as it affects diplomats, as it affects aid workers.\u00a0 World Food Program had to suspend its operations; three of its people were killed.\u00a0 That potentially has terrible consequences for the Sudanese people, who are in desperate need of the assistance provided by the World Food Program.\u00a0 That only underscores the imperative of getting a ceasefire and putting Sudan back on the track that it was on, which was talks and negotiations toward the restoration of a civilian-led government.\nWe will continue to track this very closely and very carefully.\u00a0 My number one priority, of course, is the safety and security of our personnel.\u00a0 I\u2019m in very close contact with \u2013 as is my entire team \u2013 with Ambassador John Godfrey and our entire team in Khartoum.\u00a0 Again, I won\u2019t go into any details except to say that we are and will continue to take every responsible measure to make sure that our people are safe and secure.\nWe\u2019re also in very close coordination with other countries that have influence in Sudan.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been on the phone with counterparts from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, to make sure that we\u2019re coordinating carefully.\u00a0 Our team as well has been in very close contact with the African Union, with other international organizations \u2013 again, to make sure that everyone is coordinated and that we are channeling the shared determination among the international community to get to a ceasefire as quickly as possible and to put Sudan back on the track of talks, negotiations, again, to restore civilian-led government in Sudan.\nBut first things first, the imperative is getting quickly to a ceasefire so that the guns stop firing, people can move about safely, reunite with their families, get the assistance they need, and all of us can continue to engage in supporting Sudan as it makes its transition.\nWith regard to Evan Gershkovich, yes, Ambassador Tracy and our chief consular officer were able to see Evan in prison in Moscow.\u00a0 I can report, based on what Ambassador Tracy has said, that he is in good health and good spirits considering the \u2013 considering the circumstances.\u00a0 We continue to call for his immediate release from this unjust detention.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Tetsuo Shintomi with Kyodo News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I would like to ask on the nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation, which is of big interest among Japanese people.\u00a0 As you know, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida has expressed his hope to discuss on a world without nuclear weapons at coming G7 Leaders Summit.\u00a0 As you are wrapping up foreign ministers meeting here in Karuizawa, do you feel any tangible progress toward that end?\u00a0 And how do you think about the possibility of a world without \u2013 achieving a world without nuclear weapons despite all these challenges?\nAnd in addition, if I may, many local people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including a\u00a0Hibakusha, which is an atomic bomb survivor, are looking forward to a U.S. leader\u2019s visit to Hiroshima in May.\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering if you had any message to them.\nThank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, I should tell you that we had \u2013 during this G7 meeting we had dedicated sessions on specific issues, the most important issues on our agenda.\u00a0 And the final session that we had, dedicated session, was on arms control and nonproliferation, which in and of itself underscores the importance that the G7 attaches to it.\u00a0 And I have to praise Japan\u2019s leadership, as always, on this issue.\nWe, as G7 countries, are committed to maintaining and strengthening disarmament and nonproliferation efforts toward a more secure, stable, and safer world.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be convening, as you noted, at a leaders level in Hiroshima, which together with Nagasaki offers the most powerful reminder of the unprecedented devastation and immense human suffering that the people of Japan experienced as a result of the atomic bombings in 1945.\nThe overall decline in global nuclear arsenals has to continue and must not be reversed.\u00a0 If you look at the trajectory from the onset of the Cold War through to today, we\u2019ve seen that overall decline.\u00a0 And that can and should be achieved through a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach to arms control and nonproliferation.\nHaving said that, we also see some very significant challenges not just on the horizon but fully present, and we have to continue to work collectively to counter these challenges: Russia\u2019s suspension of the New START agreement, irresponsible nuclear rhetoric; the DPRK\u2019s dangerous ballistic missile launches and further development of its own nuclear program; Iran\u2019s expansion of its nuclear activities; and China\u2019s pursuit in a very opaque way of a rapid nuclear arsenal buildup.\nSo based on our conversations today, I can tell you that these actions only strengthen our determination to address nuclear dangers, and it\u2019s particularly why I\u2019m grateful to Japan for the high priority it\u2019s placed on this topic under its G7 presidency.\nI can also tell you that the President very much looks forward to being in Japan for the G7 leaders and in Hiroshima specifically, and I know he\u2019ll have much more to say when he\u2019s here, but it\u2019s something that he\u2019s very focused on and looks very much forward to.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg news.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary. \u00a0Chinse leader Xi Jinping has recently, obviously, made diplomatic waves both with the Saudi Arabia-Iran deal and its own proposal for peace in Ukraine.\u00a0 Just the other day, Brazil\u2019s president said the U.S. should stop encouraging war and start talking peace, and Brazil\u2019s foreign minister also criticized Western sanctions for taking an unnecessary toll on nations involved in the conflict.\u00a0 Do you think the Brazilian comments suggest that the U.S. is potentially losing the battle for public opinion on Ukraine in the Global South?\u00a0 And do you think it\u2019s time that Washington should meaningfully engage with China\u2019s peace proposal, even despite the reservations about it freezing Russia\u2019s territorial gains?\nAnd secondly, just on China.\u00a0 It\u2019s been weeks since Biden said he would try and speak with Xi, and there\u2019s still no clear plan for your own previously postponed trip to Beijing.\u00a0 Given your own G7 counterparts are visiting China and urging engagement, do you think it\u2019s time the U.S. started more substantive, meaningful engagement with senior Chinese officials or do you think Beijing\u2019s unwillingness to engage is holding that back?\nThanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, just speaking to the G7 itself and what I heard here and what we\u2019ve been discussing over the last few days, what I \u2013 what I heard, again, is remarkable convergence on concerns related to the PRC and on what we\u2019re doing to address those concerns.\u00a0 And I think some of you heard my counterparts speaking to that directly, and I\u2019d also invite you to read the joint statement that we put out that reflects very well the shared approach that we have to China \u2013 both the challenges it poses as well as the need for engagement that we all see and share.\nBut in general, over the past two years what I\u2019ve seen not just in Europe but also in Asia is much greater convergence on the approach to take to China, which for all of our countries is among the most consequential as well as complicated relationships that we have.\u00a0 We believe \u2013 the United States \u2013 that having lines of communication, being able to engage across the broad range of issues that animate the relationship, is important.\u00a0 And we also believe that countries around the world expect us to manage the relationship with China responsibly, and that starts with engagement, with having lines of communication.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what President Biden sought to reinforce in Bali when he met with President Xi, and my expectation would be that we will be able to move forward on that.\u00a0 But it does require China to make clear its own intentions in doing that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll look to see if they do so, but if they do so my expectation would be that we will find ways to engage as the presidents agreed during their Bali meeting.\nBeyond that, I\u2019m not going to speak to any individual countries.\u00a0 I can just say more generally with regard to Brazil that President Biden, President Lula had a very good meeting when President Lula visited the White House \u2013 I think his first or certainly among his very first visits to any country.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 The final question, Ryo Kiyomiya from\u00a0Asahi Shimbun.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Welcome to Japan.\u00a0 I have several questions on Taiwan and engagement with the Global South.\nFirst, on Taiwan, French President Macron said in his interview that Europe must not be a follower of either the U.S. or China on Taiwan, and we heard that there was some discussions on this comment during the ministerial meeting.\u00a0 How much are you worried his comment may undermine global support for Taiwan?\u00a0 And do you think they represent perhaps a small victory for Xi Jinping in China\u2019s effort to divide Europe and the U.S. on foreign policy issues?\nAnd secondly, on the Global South, to address the challenges of Russia and China\u2019s influence in the developing world, how do you mean to offer an alternative to China by engaging more with the Global South?\u00a0 And also, what kind of role do you expect Japan to play in increasing engagement with the Global South?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to Taiwan, there is clear unanimity in the approach that we\u2019re taking with all of our G7 partners and many other countries around the world, and that is an expectation that any differences be dealt with peacefully and that neither side take any unilateral actions that would disrupt the status quo that preserves peace and stability.\u00a0 That is clearly what every single one of our G7 partners believes.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s reflected well in the G7 statement that we\u2019re putting out today.\u00a0 And again, a number of partners spoke directly to their views, to their countries\u2019 views, on the broader relationship with China and the more specific question of Taiwan.\u00a0 And as I said a moment ago, in my experience we actually have not seen greater convergence at any other time in the approach than we see now, both with Europe as well as with key countries in Asia.\nWith regard to what\u2019s called the Global South, I think if you look at the discussions that we had just over the last two and a half or three days, the vast majority of the time was spent on looking at the issues that are actually affecting people\u2019s lives around the world and focusing, as I said, on how we can leverage our strengths to deliver actual solutions on the issues that, as I said, are having an impact on the lives of people around the world as well as in our own countries.\nSo look at what we spent our time focused on and developing concrete action plans on: food security; energy and climate change; health security; building infrastructure that addresses the needs of countries around the world; catalyzing more investment from the private sector; broader and more inclusive economic growth; international financial institutions that actually respond to the needs of countries around the world.\u00a0 That was probably two-thirds of the discussion that we had over the last two and a half days, and I suspect that you\u2019ll see the leaders do the same when they meet in a month\u2019s time.\nAnd what this comes down to is that we as a G7, as individual countries, along with many other countries that are not part of the G7, want to spend our time, our focus, our resources on addressing these challenges and making it clear to countries around the world that this is not about asking or making them choose; it\u2019s about offering a good, indeed a better \u2013 a better choice.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve focused our attention on.\u00a0 Again, I invite you to take a look at the statement that we put out.\u00a0 I think it reflects it very well, and it\u2019s a very good prelude to the meeting that the leaders will have in a month\u2019s time.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY

everyone.\u00a0 So I have been long been looking forward to returning to Vietnam and making my first visit here as Secretary of State.\u00a0 I was here as deputy secretary in 2015 and 2016, but I am so pleased to be back today.\nA decade since the United States and Vietnam launched our Comprehensive Partnership, and nearly 28 years since we normalized relations, our nations have forged a relationship that is robust, dynamic, and consequential.\nI\u2019m here at the behest of President Biden to further broaden and deepen that partnership following the President\u2019s call with the general secretary last month and building on earlier high-level visits, including from Vice President Harris, Secretary of Defense Austin, U.S. Trade Representative Tai, USAID Administrator Power, and recently as well members of Congress.\nThroughout my engagements today, I focused on how the United States can continue to support Vietnam\u2019s success \u2013 which is good for the Vietnamese people, for Americans, and indeed for the entire region.\nOur countries are collaborating on an incredibly broad range of shared interests, and we believe that by supporting Vietnam\u2019s ambitions we advance our own, from the creation of American jobs and the strengthening of American businesses, to progress on the climate crisis that affects us all, to preventing pandemics.\nI also focused on how our countries can advance a free and open Indo-Pacific, one that is at peace and grounded in respect for the rules-based international order.\u00a0 When we talk about \u201cfree and open,\u201d we mean countries being free to choose their own path and their own partners and that problems will be dealt with openly; rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly; and goods, ideas, and people will flow freely across land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\nIn my meetings with General Secretary Trong, with Prime Minister Chinh, with Foreign Minister Son, and External Relations Commission Chairman Trung, I discussed our work to promote broad-based prosperity in Vietnam and throughout the region, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 Vietnam has joined negotiations on all four pillars of IPEF, and that will help lead a race to the top on the issues that are shaping the 21st century economy, including supply chain resilience, the clean energy transition, digital connectivity, and that will benefit Americans and people across this region.\nWe discussed our mutual respect for ASEAN centrality and our close partnership through regional economic frameworks, including APEC, which the United States is proud to be hosting this year, and the Mekong-U.S.\u00a0 Partnership.\u00a0 We appreciate Vietnam\u2019s indispensable leadership in solving development challenges in the Mekong region that have been made worse by dam construction, climate change, and overfishing.\nWe\u2019re also growing our bilateral economic partnership.\u00a0 The U.S. is helping Vietnam double down on key reforms it\u2019s embraced \u2013 including on labor, intellectual property, fair trade \u2013 which have made it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\nWe believe that Vietnam can achieve its goal of becoming a connected, high-income country by 2045 by pursuing growth that lifts up all communities, while building resilience to adapt to climate change.\nWe know Vietnam is increasingly vulnerable to threats posed by the climate crisis.\u00a0 As Vietnam takes steps to become a leader on climate energy transition, the United States is investing in that tremendous potential.\nWe\u2019re launching new bilateral climate initiatives that were announced by Vice President Harris during her August 2021 visit to Vietnam, which do everything from conserving ecosystems and reducing emissions from rice farming in the Mekong Delta, to expanding a market-driven clean energy system and scaling up adoption of electric vehicles, to leveraging our private sectors to drive climate action.\nWe\u2019re also harnessing the power of regional frameworks like the Just Energy Transition Partnership.\u00a0 Vietnam recently joined that partnership.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to deploy $15.5 billion to help the country deliver on its ambitious Net Zero 2050 goal as well as the Japan-U.S.-Mekong Power Partnership.\nWe\u2019re also collaborating to build up Vietnam\u2019s public health capacity, including by establishing a national CDC here in Vietnam.\u00a0 We\u2019ve partnered closely to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, with the United States donating more than 40 million vaccine doses, followed by Vietnam\u2019s donation \u2013 following \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Vietnam\u2019s donation of millions of articles of PPE during the earliest part of the pandemic, when America was at a time of its greatest need.\u00a0 And I have to say this is a very powerful example of countries coming together and coming to each other\u2019s assistance when each of us needed it most.\nAs part of our bilateral security partnership, which is growing, we\u2019re finalizing the transfer of the third U.S. Coast Guard cutter to Vietnam, complementing a fleet of 24 patrol boats and other equipment, training, and operational facilities that we\u2019ve provided since 2016.\u00a0 All of these efforts bolster Vietnam\u2019s capacity to contribute to maritime peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nThe United States is committed to supporting a strong, prosperous, independent, and resilient Vietnam.\u00a0 And we respect Vietnam\u2019s right to shape its future under its own political system.\u00a0 At the same time, we continue to underscore how future progress on human rights is essential to unleashing the full potential of the Vietnamese people.\u00a0 That\u2019s the central focus of the U.S.-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue.\nFinally, the United States is committed to our ongoing work to address the legacies of the war, even as we focus on the future.\u00a0 This is a matter of trust, of commitment, and of duty.\nWe\u2019re continuing our joint efforts to clear unexploded ordnance.\u00a0 Next month, we\u2019ll complete the survey of the heavily bombed Quang Tri Province.\u00a0 We\u2019re making significant progress cleaning up dioxin hotspots from the war.\u00a0 Last month, we announced a new $73 million contract to treat contaminated soil and sediment at Bien Hoa Air Base.\nAnd we\u2019re continuing the important humanitarian work to account for those missing from the war, including by increasing Vietnam\u2019s capacity to identify its own missing and dead.\u00a0 We recognize the longstanding support of the Government of Vietnam to account for U.S.\u00a0 personnel lost during the war.\u00a0 Our reciprocal cooperation for ensuring families from both countries receive the closure they deserve remains vitally important.\nToday, we took another step to strengthen our relationship by breaking ground on our new embassy compound.\u00a0 When completed, our new embassy in Hanoi will be a state-of-art facility worthy of our ambitious vision for the future of our partnership and worthy of the American and Vietnamese people who work every day to make that vision a reality.\nWith that, I\u2019m happy to take some questions.\u00a0 Vedant.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll do four questions today.\u00a0 First question, John Hudson of\u00a0The Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, a three-part question on Vietnam if you\u2019ll indulge me.\u00a0\u00a0 You have underscored that the U.S. and Vietnam \u2013 the U.S. and Vietnam are aligned on a common view of free and Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 How does this square with Vietnam\u2019s recent crackdown on dissent?\nSecondly, advocacy groups say Vietnam deported several Russian residents who expressed opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\u00a0 And Vietnam earlier this year also voted to abstain from a UN vote to condemn the Russian invasion.\u00a0 Did you discuss Vietnam\u2019s position on the war with leaders today?\u00a0 And if so, what did you hear from them?\nAnd then lastly, from your discussion today, what ways does the U.S. and Vietnam share concerns about China\u2019s assertiveness in the region?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, John.\u00a0 So first, I am not aware of the deportations that you referenced.\u00a0 We did talk about Ukraine and about the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 Vietnam has a long history and relationship with Russia.\u00a0 We understand that and recognize that.\nAt the same time, I\u2019ve heard clearly from our Vietnamese interlocutors and I\u2019ve heard them state publicly their commitment and the importance that they attach to the basic principles that are also under threat by Russia\u2019s aggression, the principles at the heart of the UN Charter \u2013 territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence.\u00a0 Vietnam stands strongly for those.\u00a0 They\u2019ve made that clear.\u00a0 They\u2019ve said so publicly and they repeated that in conversation with us today.\nWith regard to human rights and the relationship that we have, this is a conversation that we regularly engage in.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve said to our counterparts, it\u2019s very important that we continue to speak directly, openly, candidly about our concerns.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly, exactly what we do.\nWe continue to seek progress on issues like freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of religion.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen, I think, positive steps taken in some areas, to include, for example, the respect for the rights of the LGBTQI+ community.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen important work that Vietnam has done with UNHCR on the right of stateless people, for example.\u00a0 But in these other areas we continue to have concerns that we\u2019ve shared.\nAs well, I think it\u2019s important that the space be expanded for nongovernmental organizations to be able to register, to operate without burdensome intrusion by the state.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve noted and we\u2019ve noted the important contributions these organizations make to issues that matter to all Vietnamese, for example, on climate change, on conservation, on dealing with transnational crime.\u00a0 But this is an ongoing part of our dialogue and an important one.\nFinally, on South China Sea, I think it\u2019s very clear that countries throughout the region, to include Vietnam, feel strongly about the importance of respecting the rule of law, particularly under the Law of the Sea Convention, when it comes to issues of freedom of navigation, when it comes to maritime disputes, when it comes to illegal fishing, et cetera.\u00a0 And a lot of good work is being done, for example, through ASEAN to try to address these issues.\u00a0 That\u2019s been going on for some time.\nAnd in our own relationship with Vietnam, with other countries in the region, one of the things that we\u2019ve worked on, I think very productively, is helping countries strengthen what we call maritime domain awareness \u2013 having the capacity to see very clearly what is happening in the seas that surround their countries, particularly when it comes to things like piracy, like illegal fishing, or like any use of coercion by other countries against \u2013 against these countries, against their fishing fleets, et cetera.\nSo that\u2019s an important part of the conversation as well, and it does go to the heart of what we have as a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, one in which, again, countries are free to pursue their own policies, their own partnerships, and in which everyone in the region abides by the international rule of law.\u00a0 This is something that joins us together with Vietnam.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to\u00a0H\u00e0ng Duy Linh with Tuoi Tre.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So let me ask you in Vietnamese, okay?\n(Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, before your arrival there are already speculation that this year will be the very good year to change the partnership from comprehensive to strategic partnership.\u00a0 Why would the U.S. would like that, and what do you think whether you can \u2013 the two countries can result in that goal?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I think from the perspective of the United States \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to speak for our Vietnamese colleagues, but certainly from our perspective \u2013 we think this is an auspicious time to elevate our existing partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had for the last 10 years this Comprehensive Partnership that has created an incredibly strong foundation of cooperation across many different areas.\nAnd as a result, we think this is a good moment to go even further.\u00a0 And by that we mean this: to make even more effective the existing cooperation that we have, and then to work in new areas of cooperation and collaboration in the partnership.\u00a0 And this is something that the \u2013 that President Biden and the general secretary discussed when they spoke on the phone a couple of weeks ago, and it was very much part of the conversations that we had today.\nSo I think what you\u2019ll see in the weeks and months ahead is our teams working on this.\u00a0 There are so many areas where we can either deepen cooperation or really add cooperation to what we\u2019re already doing, whether it\u2019s on climate change, whether it\u2019s on health, security, science and technology, and education.\u00a0 I was just at the Hanoi University for Science and Technology and saw some remarkable young Vietnamese innovators, including a robotics team that will be coming to the United States. \u00a0We think there\u2019s an area there for significant collaboration in building up science and technology in Vietnam and also deepening even more educational exchanges.\u00a0 We have many Vietnamese students in the United States.\u00a0 We want even more.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to see Americans come here.\nBut also the digital transformation, which is part \u2013 already part of IPEF, strengthening supply chains and building more resilient ones, deepening the work that we\u2019re doing together in the Mekong Delta.\u00a0 Each of these areas, whether it\u2019s an existing area of cooperation or one that we can add, I think would go to an enhanced partnership that we\u2019ll be working on in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Matt Lee with The Associated Press.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thanks, Vedant.\u00a0 Hi, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 A couple things.\u00a0 One, do you have any understanding of what the situation \u2013 what\u2019s going on in Khartoum right now in Sudan?\nAnd then more to the point of this trip, tomorrow you\u2019re going to be beginning almost three days of talks with your G7 colleagues in what is the first big international meeting since these leaks of the highly classified information.\u00a0 Whether or not you expect or worry that your colleagues in Japan might ask you about that or raise it as a problematic issue, what do you say to people who ask whether the U.S. can still be a trusted partner and ally given that this set of leaks is like the fourth major one in about a decade from Americans?\nAnd then lastly on Evan Gershkovich, is there any update on his situation in terms of getting consular access?\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that the Russians have said that they might be willing to arrange some kind of a swap for him.\u00a0 Is there anything to report on that front?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Matt.\u00a0 First on Khartoum, the major parties in Khartoum some weeks ago reached a very important framework agreement on how to proceed with a transition to civilian government.\u00a0 And there\u2019s been real progress in trying to move that forward.\u00a0 I spoke to General Burhan just a couple of days ago on that very topic, and there are still some remaining \u2013 important remaining issues that need to be dealt with.\u00a0 But I think there\u2019s a real opportunity to move forward on the agreed framework, and certainly that\u2019s what we\u2019re strongly supporting.\nIt\u2019s a fragile situation.\u00a0 There are other actors that may be pushing against that progress.\u00a0 But this is a real opportunity to finally carry forward the civilian-led transition, and one that we and other countries are trying to bolster.\u00a0 So we\u2019re very focused on that along with other partners.\nOn the intelligence leaks, what I can tell you is this:\u00a0 We have engaged with our allies and partners since these leaks came out, and we have done so at high levels, and we have made clear our commitment to safeguarding intelligence and our commitment to our security partnerships.\nWhat I\u2019ve heard so far at least is an appreciation for the steps that we\u2019re taking, and it\u2019s not affected our cooperation.\u00a0 I just haven\u2019t seen that.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard that.\u00a0 And of course, the investigation is taking its course.\u00a0 There\u2019s now, as you know, a suspect in custody but importantly as well, I know, measures being taken to further safeguard information.\u00a0 But to date, based on the conversations I\u2019ve had, I have not \u2013 not heard anything that would affect our cooperation with allies and partners.\nOn Evan Gershkovich, I don\u2019t have anything new to share.\u00a0 We continue to seek consular access.\u00a0 That has not yet been granted.\u00a0 It needs to be.\u00a0 This is a Russian obligation, and so we\u2019re looking to that.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve heard some of the comments that have been made, but there\u2019s nothing \u2013 nothing that I have to report on where this might go.\u00a0 We continue to call for his immediate release, and certainly we need to see consular access now.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, B\u00f9i Ki\u1ec1u Li\u00ean with Bao Chinh Phu.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam, how does it progress?\u00a0 How has it been progressing since?\u00a0 And what that relationship, the result of that relationship, the economic-wise and politically-wise?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s fair to say this has been one of the more remarkable evolutions in relationships that we\u2019ve seen in recent years and in recent decades.\u00a0 And it\u2019s one that is very gratifying to me and to the United States as a whole.\nLet me just give you one example.\u00a0 When we lifted the trade embargo in 1994, there was virtually no trade between Vietnam and the United States.\u00a0 Twenty years later in 2015, the first time that I was here as a representative of the United States, trade was roughly $45 billion between our countries.\u00a0 So it had gone up from virtually zero to $45 billion.\u00a0 Today, we\u2019re approaching $140 billion in trade.\u00a0 So just looking at that aspect of the relationship, we\u2019ve seen a dramatic, dramatic change.\nBut much more broadly than that, we\u2019re seeing the United States and Vietnam working closely together in virtually every area that matters to people in both of our countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in building the strong economic trade and investment relationship.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in the work that we\u2019re doing together now on climate change.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it in the work that we\u2019re doing on building the resilience of our supply chains, which we know is so critical.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together to address the needs in the Mekong Delta, including on agriculture.\u00a0 In fact, our Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack will be here, I think, tomorrow following my visit.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve had a whole host of senior officials from across our government reflecting the full range of actions that \u2013 and activities that we\u2019re engaged in.\nBut whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy security, whether it\u2019s trade and investment, in science and technology, education \u2013 all of these areas, cooperation, collaboration between the United States and Vietnam has grown exponentially.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re also working very closely together in regional organizations like ASEAN, APEC, and collaborating to advance the international rule of law that both of our countries strongly adhere to and want to make sure is upheld and strengthened.\nAnd so in so many ways we become genuine partners trying to advance mutual interests and doing it in a way that reflects the interests of our people.\u00a0 As I said a moment ago, earlier today I had the opportunity to break ground for our new embassy compound, and that in and of itself is very symbolic of the relationship.\u00a0 The fact that we need that compound because we were doing so much together that our diplomatic presence is even more important than it\u2019s ever been.\nSo for us, for President Biden, for Washington, this is one of the most dynamic and one of the most important relationships\u00a0 we\u2019ve had.\u00a0 It\u2019s had a remarkable trajectory over the last couple of decades.\u00a0 Our conviction is that it can and will grow even stronger in the decades ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "U.S. Embassy Hanoi ", "location": "Hanoi, Vietnam", "date": "April 15, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you, everyone, very, very much.\u00a0 This really is a particular pleasure because this has been a day long in the making.\nI heard about this project, I think, the first time I was here as deputy secretary from Ambassador Osius, then Ambassador Kritenbrink.\u00a0 Marc, congratulations.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But thank you, in all seriousness, for your extraordinary leadership at a time of tremendous importance.\nTo my friend the foreign minister, we\u2019re so grateful not just for your presence but for our partnership every single day and for the work that you are instrumental in doing in bringing us to this day.\nAnd to the vice minister, to our colleagues from the city as well, the planning commission, thank you, thank you so much.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for this partnership, this collaboration.\u00a0 And it doesn\u2019t take that much imagination \u2013 maybe just a little bit \u2013 to see what this could be in just a few years\u2019 time, but also to see what it\u2019s going to represent in both symbolic and practical ways for the relationship between our countries.\nTo everyone who\u2019s here from the Government of Vietnam, from our embassy team, all colleagues past and present: \u00a0Thank you for all of the hard work that has gone to making this day possible.\u00a0 I know that it took a lot of work.\u00a0\nSo in a few moments, we will symbolically break ground on the new embassy campus here in Hanoi.\nYears in the making, this is the culmination of dedicated and often very creative engagement between countless Americans and countless Vietnamese diplomats.\nAnd again, that\u2019s something I saw firsthand when I was here in 2015 and 2016 as deputy secretary working together to find the land for the campus.\nNow, this groundbreaking \u2013 and the new embassy that we\u2019ll build \u2013 represents another significant step toward strengthening a vital partnership between our countries and between our people.\nBack in 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Hanoi to normalize diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.\u00a0 Opening the embassy was a key part of that effort.\nNow, back then, things looked a little bit different at the U.S. embassy.\u00a0 There were fewer than 30 American employees.\u00a0 Much of their work was done with a very exciting technology that let them communicate instantly with colleagues around the world: the fax machine.\u00a0\nSo we\u2019ve come a little bit of distance from those days.\u00a0 A few things have changed. \u00a0We have emails.\u00a0 And the small team that opened the embassy back then has grown to include more than 600 American and local staff.\nOver the last 27 years, similarly, the ties that connect our countries, Vietnam and the United States, have grown stronger and stronger.\u00a0 And that\u2019s happened in no small part because of our renewed diplomatic presence in Hanoi, because of our exceptional staff \u2013 at the embassy, at our consulate in Ho Chi Minh City \u2013 who have worked day-in/day-out to forge a relationship that\u2019s robust, that\u2019s dynamic, that\u2019s consequential, and that addresses the needs of the people in both of our countries.\u00a0\nToday, we are, as you\u2019ve head, celebrating 10 years of collaboration through our Comprehensive Partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019ve joined forces on everything from improving public health, to expanding inclusive economic opportunities, to accelerating the clean energy transition.\nWe\u2019re advancing together a free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific region, one that is at peace and rooted in respect for the rules-based international order.\u00a0 And we\u2019re continuing to work together to address the legacy of the war in Vietnam.\nFor nearly three decades, our embassy in Hanoi has been at the center of every one of these shared activities, and many more.\u00a0 And what the new facility will enable us to do is to build on that foundation for decades to come, meet modern challenges, and deliver for our people.\nIt\u2019s going to be eight stories tall.\u00a0 The building will be big enough to bring our entire team together under one roof, enabling both greater collaboration and greater efficiency.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have four times the number of consular windows as our current office, so that we can get visas and passports to more people more quickly.\u00a0 And over an estimated six years of construction, the project will provide good jobs for as many as 1,800 local workers, while adding $350 million to the Vietnamese economy.\nWhat\u2019s also powerful and important is that the embassy is going to reflect a fusion of our cultures and our nations.\u00a0 The complex was designed by an American company, inspired by a mix of Vietnam\u2019s topography and Hanoi\u2019s urban architecture.\nThe base of the building will be made from basalt \u2013 a rock that\u2019s found both in Vietnam and the United States.\u00a0 And the embassy\u2019s construction will embody our countries\u2019 shared commitment to environmental sustainability and resilience.\u00a0 We\u2019re building much of the embassy using recycled materials, and the design will both conserve energy and mitigate the risk of flooding from severe storms.\nWhen Secretary Christopher opened the embassy in Hanoi in 1995, he spoke about building a bridge of cooperation between our nations.\u00a0 But what no one could have anticipated, and what is plainly visible to all today, almost three decades later, is everything that building that bridge has enabled.\u00a0 With this new campus, we will be able to foster still more of those connections and all the relationships, the innovations, the opportunities that come with them.\nSo this is really a special day.\u00a0 And I was saying to the foreign minister, when the embassy is actually complete and built, I hope both of us are pulled out of our retirements and brought back to help actually open it.\u00a0 Thank you all very much for being here today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Secretary Manalo, Secretary Galvez, it has been an honor to host you at the State Department for the third ever \u2013 and first since 2016 \u2013 U.S.-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial alongside Secretary of Defense Austin.\u00a0 Today\u2019s meeting builds on the momentum of the high-level U.S. visits to the Philippines just over the past year, including by Vice President Harris, by Secretary Austin, and myself.\nThe Philippines is the United States\u2019 oldest ally in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our relationship is based on the shared interests and values of Americans and Filipinos, including our abiding commitment to democracy.\u00a0 For decades, we\u2019ve worked together to promote peace and stability across the region, and we\u2019re growing that effective partnership in scale and scope every single day, including through very productive, very rich discussions today.\nOur security alliance is an enduring source of strength for both of our nations.\u00a0 Today, we focused on ways to continue our close partnership under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement so that our forces can work even more closely together, including to provide humanitarian assistance and respond to disasters.\u00a0 Secretary Austin and I also reaffirmed the United States\u2019 unwavering commitment to standing with the Philippines against any intimidation or coercion, including in the South China Sea, and to preserving a region that\u2019s governed by international law where goods and ideas and people can move freely.\nWe also discussed deepening our robust economic ties, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity.\u00a0 We\u2019re working closely with other IPEF partners to build out this framework to help our economies grow faster and fairer so that all our people can reach their full potential, lead on issues shaping the 21st-century economy, and do it in a way that is sustainable for our planet.\nOne way that we\u2019re putting our partnership through IPEF to work is by collaborating to increase economic opportunities for women and girls in the Philippines.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing training in growing industries like data science and artificial intelligence, where women have been under-represented, and boosting digital literacy rates.\nAnd more broadly, as we discussed today, we\u2019re committed to expanding our economic cooperation across the board.\u00a0 Indeed, we discussed a number of areas where we can deepen our collaboration, cooperation in pursuit of that goal.\nTogether, we\u2019re stepping up to address global challenges that no country can solve alone.\u00a0 We discussed our shared efforts to combat the climate crisis and strengthen energy security.\u00a0 The United States is committed to helping the Philippines reach its ambitious goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent by 2030.\u00a0 To do that, the U.S. Government and critically, the private sector, are supporting the growth of the offshore wind market, the development of nickel and cobalt facilities that will help the Philippines sustainable process \u2013 sustainably process minerals essential to the clean energy transition.\nWe\u2019re also providing technical assistance and regulatory guidance to support the growth of the Philippines\u2019 civil nuclear energy program.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking to grow our cooperation through a 123 agreement on civil nuclear cooperation which will make it easier for us to share technical knowledge as well as nuclear material and equipment.\nWe\u2019re delivering solutions to the food security challenges impacting the Philippines like so many other countries.\u00a0 Philippines-based companies, with the support of the United States Government and the American private sector, are making impressive progress in developing climate-smart food systems, increasing their productivity, and the sustainability of their supply chains.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking forward to continuing this progress at the inaugural U.S.-Philippines Food Security Dialogue a little bit later this year.\nWe\u2019re able to do this work not only because of the partnership between our governments but also because of the partnership between our peoples.\u00a0 This year, we\u2019re celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Fulbright Program in the Philippines, the longest running Fulbright Program in the world.\u00a0 More than 22,000 Filipinos have come to the United States through the Fulbright and other U.S. exchange programs, enriching our communities with their perspectives and experiences, innovating and launching businesses, building enduring bonds between our people \u2013 bonds that to this day renew and revitalize the friendship between our countries.\nAcross all of these areas and more, the United States values and is proud of our robust and deepening partnership with the Philippines.\u00a0 Secretary Austin and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss in-depth how we\u2019ll make this essential relationship even stronger in the months and years ahead.\nSo really grateful to our colleagues for being here today, grateful to their teams at the hard work that\u2019s been done, but not grateful simply for their presence but also the spirit in which together we are working to strengthen the bonds between our countries.\nRicky, over to you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Tony.\u00a0 Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Senior Undersecretary and OIC Carlito G. Galvez, Jr., friends from the media, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\u00a0 I\u2019m very pleased to be here in Washington and to address all of you today.\u00a0 Some of you were with Secretary Blinken when we held our first meeting in our current capacities in Manila last August.\u00a0 We agreed then to work together in sustaining the positive momentum and trajectory of Philippine-U.S. relations, including by reconvening our 2+2 ministerial dialogue in 2023.\u00a0 And I\u2019m happy to report that we have in fact followed through on that commitment.\nToday is only the third iteration of our dialogue in the 2+2 format since it was established in 2012.\u00a0 After a seven-year gap since the second meeting in 2016, this meeting holds particular significance as it further reaffirms our shared commitment to advancing our common priorities as treaty allies and close partners amidst evolving regional and global security challenges.\nThe joint statement we will issue today, and the various areas it covers, demonstrates the breadth and depth of our bilateral relationship.\u00a0 We have reached a number of key understandings that the Philippines believes will truly elevate our relationship and translate into direct, substantial, and tangible benefits for our peoples and countries.\nAt today\u2019s meeting, we redoubled our commitment to modernizing the Philippine-U.S. alliance, recognizing that our partnership will need to play a stronger role in preserving an international law-based international order.\u00a0 This means ensuring the conduct of high-level and high-impact, high-value joint exercises, trainings, and other related activities.\u00a0 We especially welcome the United States pledge to fast-track and to ramp up support for the modernization of our defense, civilian law enforcement, and humanitarian assistance and disaster response capabilities, especially in the maritime domain, as well as the implementation of EDCA projects and investments in and around EDCA-agreed locations.\nI wish to point out that we also underscored the importance of equally ensuring that our modern alliance not only serves as an instrument as peace, but it shall also be a force for good that brings about sustained economic benefits to our two countries, down to our local communities.\nOur discussions and proposed ways forwards are aligned with the Philippines\u2019 priorities on agriculture, food security, promoting energy security as we transition to clean energy, boosting trade, and building resilience of our supply chains, as well as enhancing connectivity and digitalization.\u00a0 Our discussions focused also on areas such as economic cooperation, climate change, renewable energy, economic resilience, and economic security.\nThank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Manalo, and Secretary Galvez, I\u2019m honored to be here with you today for the third U.S.-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue.\u00a0 As you\u2019ve heard, this is the first of its kind in seven years.\nBut first, let me just say a few words about the story that I know many of you are tracking.\u00a0 I was first briefed on the reports of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and classified material on the morning of April 6th.\u00a0 And since then, I have been convening senior department leaders daily on our response, and I have directed an urgent cross-department effort.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve referred the matter to the Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal investigation.\u00a0 Now, I can\u2019t say much more while the Justice Department\u2019s investigation is ongoing, but we take this very seriously.\u00a0 And we will continue to work closely with our outstanding allies and partners, and nothing will ever stop us from keeping America secure.\nNow, let me turn to today\u2019s important discussions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come together at an historic moment in our alliance.\u00a0 For more than seven decades, the U.S. and Philippine forces have trained and fought alongside each other.\u00a0 And today we\u2019re building on those bonds to bring greater security, stability, and prosperity to the Indo-Pacific for the next 70 years and beyond.\u00a0 The commitments that we made today will spur even deeper cooperation to help ensure that we\u2019re poised to tackle the defining challenges of our time \u2013 together.\nWe all reaffirmed today that our Mutual Defense Treaty remains the bedrock of our cooperation.\u00a0 As Secretary Blinken and I have said clearly and repeatedly, the Mutual Defense Treaty applies to armed attacks on either of our armed forces, our aircraft, or public vessels \u2013 including our Coast Guard \u2013 anywhere in the South China Sea.\nAnd so today we built on our work together during my recent visit to Manila and discussed plans to operationalize the four new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement locations in Palawan and northern Luzon.\u00a0 These sites will support combined training exercises and interoperability between our forces to ensure that we\u2019re even better prepared for future crises.\nWe\u2019re proud of the investments we\u2019re making, and by the end of FY \u201923 we expect to have allocated more than $100 million in infrastructure investments at the new and existing EDCA sites.\u00a0 So those investments will spur job creation and economic growth in local Philippine communities.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also committed to swiftly finalizing the U.S.\u2013 Philippines bilateral defense guidelines, which charts our vision for alliance cooperation across all operational domains, including space and cyberspace.\nIn the face of coercion and gray zone aggression, Secretary Galvez and I agreed to redouble our efforts to strengthen our combined ability to resist armed attack by modernizing our armed forces.\u00a0 We also discussed near-term plans to complete a security sector assistance roadmap to support the delivery of priority defense platforms over the next five to ten years, including radars, unmanned aerial systems, military transport aircraft, and coastal and air defense systems.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on the some 500 defense engagements that our militaries conduct each year, and we\u2019re forging new ties between our militaries and expanding the breadth of our cooperation.\nYesterday, we celebrated the start of our 38th annual Exercise Balikatan.\u00a0 More than 17,000 troops are participating this year.\u00a0 It is the largest and most complex iteration in the exercise\u2019s history.\u00a0 Now the commitments that we made today will further integrate our strong bilateral ties into multilateral networks, including with Japan and Australia, and we discussed plans to conduct combined maritime activities with likeminded partners in the South China Sea later this year as we work to enhance our collective deterrence.\nOur alliance is ultimately guided by our deep and enduring commitment to freedom.\u00a0 So we\u2019re not just allies, we\u2019re democratic allies, and the United States and the Philippines are bound by a common vision for the future \u2013 a vision that\u2019s anchored in the rule of law and freedom of the seas and respect for the territorial integrity of sovereign states.\nAnd Secretary Galvez, Secretary Manalo, and Secretary Blinken, thank you for your leadership and your steadfast partnership as we build this future together.\nSecretary Galvez, the floor is yours, sir.\nOFFICER IN CHARGE GALVEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Foremost, my highest courtesies to the Secretary Antony J. Blinken and Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, to my most esteemed colleague Secretary Enrique Manalo.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\nFirst of all, we would like to take this moment to express our profoundest thanks to the U.S.\u00a0 We are grateful to the U.S. Government and the American people for their kind assistance in our current environmental sea disaster in containing the oil spill in Oriental Mindoro.\u00a0 Upon our request for assistance, the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Embassy, and the U.S. Navy manifested their unwavering support to its deployment of the Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, as well as the technical support provided by the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to help contain an oil spill.\nThe timely and efficient response of our allies in providing the technical and material support, amounting to more than $20 million U.S., was very instrumental in mitigating the impact of this environmental disaster on our coastal communities that may affect millions of Filipino people.\u00a0 The aid and cooperation demonstrates the strength of the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance, and we are very proud to be partner of the United States.\u00a0 And your commitment to assisting us in this time of need has reinforced the band of friendship and mutual trust between our nations.\u00a0 We will not forget.\nAs to vaccine, sir, I would like also to \u2013 like to reiterate our appreciation for the 3.6 million vaccine doses donated by the U.S. Government to the Philippines, which save millions of Filipino lives and help our economy to recover.\nToday, we have just concluded the third 2+2 ministerial meeting between the Philippines and the United States.\u00a0 And I am pleased to announce that it had been a most productive meeting, which expanded to even to economic security.\u00a0 The last time the 2+2 ministerial consultation were convened was in January 2016.\u00a0 The fact that we are able to convene once again highlights the continued importance and relevance of our partnership and the need for continued dialogue and cooperation on matters of mutual interest.\nIt is also noteworthy that this is the first time the meeting will be convened under the Marcos administration, which highlights the Philippine Government\u2019s commitment to strengthening our alliance with the United States.\u00a0 Our meeting today will set the direction that we would like to be the Philippine-U.S. alliance to take in consideration of our present-day realities and common security challenges.\nAlong this line, I wish to emphasize the strength and credibility of the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance, which is founded on a shared commitment to regional peace, stability, and security.\u00a0 Our partnership has weathered many challenges in the past and continues to stand strong today.\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to the Mutual Defense Treaty, which is our cornerstone of our partnership.\nOur defense establishments recognize the need to work together to enhance our interoperability, increase our defense capacity, and build our resilience against emerging challenges.\u00a0 To this end, we agreed to explore new areas of cooperation and deepen our existing partnership in key areas such as mutual defense, maritime security, and information/intelligence sharing, and joint sails and solidarity patrols.\nWe also welcomed the ongoing conduct of the biggest ever Exercise Balikatan, which involved 17,000 forces \u2013 12,000 U.S. personnel, 5,000 AFP personnel, and 111 Australian defense forces and observers from other likeminded countries, which capacitates our armed forces to train and operate together, improve interoperability, and enhance our respective capabilities.\nWith the announcement of the four additional sites where Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement agreed locations can be developed, and we reaffirm our commitment to work together in implementing the EDCA through the completion of both existing and potential projects.\nLastly, we discussed opportunities for future cooperation with likeminded partners in the region.\u00a0 We recognize that we cannot address such a wide range of security challenges and that we need to work with other countries who share our interest in accordance with our respective national laws and policies.\u00a0 We affirm the commitment to sustain regular exchanges through existing platforms, namely the 2+2 ministerial consultations, Bilateral Strategic Dialogue, the Mutual Defense Board, Security Engagement Board, and among others.\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize that the Philippine-U.S. defense alliance is strong and credible, and we are committed to modernizing our alliance to meet the evolving security challenges of the region.\u00a0 This alliance is for peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take three questions.\u00a0 First we\u2019ll go to Demetri Sevastopulo with\u00a0The Financial Times.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 I have questions for both sides.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, can you give us a sense of what kinds and numbers of military assets and personnel that you intend to position or rotate through the EDCA sites in the Philippines?\u00a0 And can you explain how specifically does this enhanced cooperation increase your ability to prepare for any possible conflict with China over Taiwan?\nAnd to Secretaries Manalo and Galvez, how will the EDCA sites be used if the U.S. and China go to war over Taiwan?\u00a0 And will there be any restrictions on what the U.S. military can do with the sites?\nAnd finally, Secretary Blinken, this is a China question.\u00a0 Your relations with China appear to be deteriorating continuously with only sporadic signs of positive developments.\u00a0 Is this the long-term future of U.S. relations with China, or is there some kind of a realistic way to turn things around?\u00a0 And when do you expect to go to Beijing?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, thanks for your question, Demetri.\u00a0 EDCA is a key pillar to our alliance.\u00a0 It provides us the opportunity to train together, to increase interoperability.\u00a0 And you know, Demetri, interoperability is not something that you can show up at the last moment and snap your figures and achieve.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that you\u2019ve got to work on each and every day.\u00a0 And so the addition of these EDCA sites puts us in a position to be able to not only train together but also respond to meet the needs of the Philippines in the event of a crisis like a natural disaster or a requirement to rapidly provide humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 And so I think it helps us not only work together, but it helps us address the needs of the Philippines as well.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s essential to our ability to strengthen our combined deterrence posture.\nI think it\u2019s a bit early to try to discuss numbers and specific timing of rotations, but certainly these are things that Secretary Galvez and I will continue to work on going forward.\u00a0 But again, it is a tremendous opportunity.\nI would finally emphasize that whatever we do in the future in terms of rotations and numbers of troops, it is a joint decision between the Philippines and \u2013 the Philippine Government and the U.S. Government.\u00a0 So again, a great opportunity.\u00a0 I\u2019m excited about the ability to increase interoperability and look forward to continuing our great work together.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0 Thank you very much for your question.\u00a0 What I can say at this stage is that the new sites that have been identified, the new EDCA sites, are mainly aimed at increasing or improving interoperability as well as addressing potential human, humanitarian disasters or climate-related disasters.\nAnd in operationalizing these sites, of course, much work still has to be done.\u00a0 We have to identify the terms and references, how these activities will be undertaken.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really at any stage yet to answer how they might be used.\u00a0 They\u2019re still open to discussion.\u00a0 But I think we have already reached an understanding that the basic elements of these sites would be, the basic purposes of these sites would be to address humanitarian disaster-related events, to increase and improve interoperability and training of Filipino and American assets, and also to be in a position to improve the interoperability and perhaps respond to other types of security challenges.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Demetri, with regard to China, you\u2019ve heard me say before, Secretary Austin and others say before, that the relationship between our countries is among the most consequential and also the most complex of any that we have, and the same could probably be said for many other countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re not reducing it to a bumper sticker, as \u2013 again \u2013 I\u2019ve said before.\u00a0 It has different aspects to it: certainly competitive, cooperative in other respects, and in some instances more adversarial.\nWhat we\u2019ve been working to do, first of all, is to make sure that when it comes to our own strategy and our own approach we\u2019re following through on it, making investments in ourselves and our strength at home.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that, aligning increasingly with partners around the world, whether that\u2019s in Europe and Asia, and we\u2019ve done that with greater convergence than I\u2019ve seen at any time with key partners on the approach to some of the challenges posed by China, and putting those assets together so that we\u2019re competing very vigorously in upholding our interests, upholding our values, and building our vision for the future.\nWhat I hear from countries around the world and what I believe is profoundly in our interest is for us to manage the relationship with China responsibly.\u00a0 And our goal is peace, security, stability, and creating opportunity.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to engage in a new cold war.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to contain China.\u00a0 But in doing that, in trying to advance a world that is peaceful, secure, stable, and with more opportunity, we\u2019re going to stand up very vigorously for our values and for our interests, and we\u2019re doing that with regard to China.\nWe\u2019re also prepared to work cooperatively with China where it\u2019s in our interest and their interest and, I believe, in the interests of the world.\u00a0 And there are a number of issues that we\u2019ve laid out \u2013 transnational challenges that no one country can solve alone where it would benefit all of us and benefit the world for us to find ways to work together.\nThrough all of this, it\u2019s, I believe, important to maintain channels of communication to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to each other clearly, and we\u2019ve certainly continued to do that even through what\u2019s been a challenging period in our relationship.\u00a0 I think as our two presidents agreed when they met in Bali at the end of last year at the G20, it would be important to continue to find ways to strengthen those channels of communication.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We look to do that in the time ahead.\nAnd when it comes to my own visit to China, when the conditions are right I\u2019ll certainly look forward to pursuing that.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, you just said that you first learned about the leaked documents on the 6th of April.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been online for months.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t U.S. intelligence, the rest of U.S. Government, see those leaked documents online for all those months?\u00a0 Is that an intelligence failure?\nAnd I\u2019d like to ask Secretary Blinken that same issue, as well as your conversations with Foreign Minister Kuleba of Ukraine.\u00a0 We have seen documents that indicate that Ukraine has crossed \u2013 with Ukrainian agents working for the government have launched drone attacks in Russia and in Belarus, contrary to commitments that they would not do that.\u00a0 Are you concerned that this would \u2013 will \u2013 undermine Western support for Ukraine?\u00a0 And can you talk about the overall damage that these leaks have caused to our reputation for handling intelligence with our closest allies?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, do you have concerns about sharing intelligence with the United States given the fact that these leaked documents were online for so many months?\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Thanks, Andrea.\u00a0 The documents that we are aware of are dated the 28th of February and 1st of March.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if there are other documents that are \u2013 that have been online before.\u00a0 These are things that we will find, find out as we continue to investigate.\u00a0 But the documents that we are focused on\u00a0thus far \u2013 28th of February and the 1st of March.\u00a0 Again, we will continue to investigate and try to determine the full scope of the activity.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But, sir, why did we know about it and why didn\u2019t you know about it before April 6th?\u00a0 That means that they were up for at least many weeks, months, before U.S. intelligence knew that they were in the public domain.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, they were somewhere in the web, and where exactly and who had access at that point we don\u2019t know.\u00a0 We simply don\u2019t know at this point.\u00a0 So \u2013 and again, I won\u2019t speculate, Andrea.\u00a0 I will tell you that we take this very seriously and we will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Andrea, my \u2013 I don\u2019t have much to add beyond what the Secretary said.\u00a0 Let me just say with regard to, broadly, allies and partners and these documents, we have engaged with allies and partners at high levels over the past \u2013 the past days, including to reassure them about our own commitment to safeguarding intelligence and, of course, our commitment to our security partnerships.\nWith regard to Ukraine itself, I did speak to Foreign Minister Kuleba today, and in speaking to him, among other things, I reaffirmed our enduring support for Ukraine and for its efforts to defend its territorial integrity, its sovereignty, its independence; reaffirmed the extraordinary support that we have provided to Ukraine along with dozens of other countries over the last year to help it defend itself, support that will be ongoing and indeed, as you\u2019ve seen just as recently this week, additional support that was provided.\nI\u2019m not going to comment on specific actions that Ukraine takes when it comes to defending its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, but we are determined to assist Ukraine in the efforts that it\u2019s making to regain the territory that\u2019s been seized from it, and I reaffirmed that commitment today in speaking to Foreign Minister Kuleba.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Are you concerned about cross-border attacks?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, I\u2019m not going to speak directly to any particular actions, and I\u2019m certainly not going to comment on these purported documents.\u00a0 But Ukraine has to make decisions about how it can most effectively defend itself against Russian aggression and take back the territory that\u2019s been seized from it.\u00a0 We give our advice as appropriate, we provide the support; that is well-known.\u00a0 But Ukraine makes the decisions about how it actually prosecutes the effort to regain its territory.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Oh.\u00a0 First let me also share the view of Secretary Blinken that we are very confident after \u2013 especially after today\u2019s meeting of the commitment to our alliance and our partnership.\u00a0 And I really don\u2019t want to jump to any speculation or jump to any conclusions at this stage.\u00a0 We have full confidence in the investigation that will be undertaken.\u00a0 And certainly we would have to wait for the results before we can even comment.\nBut just let me say that we are confident of the strength of our relationship and our growing partnership.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question, Will Mauldin of\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 First for Undersecretary Galvez, the mentioned exercise is going to take place later this year in the South China Sea.\u00a0 I wonder what countries would be involved in those exercises and whether there are any concerns that these exercises or the ongoing ones or different steps that the U.S. is taking with its allies and partners in the region would generate a response \u2013 a dangerous response from China.\nFor Secretary Austin, I wanted to ask:\u00a0 Irregardless of where the investigation into the documents take us or the veracity of the documents, they\u2019re posted online and definitely seen by the Russians as well as the Ukrainians.\u00a0 I wonder to what degree this will affect the tactics of the expected Ukrainian offensive this spring or summer.\u00a0 How \u2013 to what degree will their tactics need to change?\u00a0 To what degree will you recommend changes in those tactics?\nFinally, for Secretary Blinken, I wanted to ask about my good friend and colleague Evan Gershkovich.\u00a0 You found him wrongfully detained, and so I wanted to ask when your staff will be able to get consular access to him in Russia.\u00a0 What\u2019s taking so long there?\u00a0 And will there be any leverage that you can exert?\u00a0 Is there any leverage that you can exert to get Russia to provide that access and what strategies will you work on and will the administration be working on to free him?\nThank you.\nOFFICER IN CHARGE GALVEZ:\u00a0 The Balikatan exercise \u2013 this is its 38th activation, and it\u2019s been \u2013 we are doing the Balikatan yearly.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t expect any violent reaction considering that this exercise is intended for our collective defense with the U.S. and other allies.\nFor today, for this Balikatan, we have the participation of, as I have said earlier, 17,000 troops, including 12,000 Americans, 5,000 Filipinos, and 111 Australians.\u00a0 We have also observers from the ASEAN nations and also from other allies, and we are happy to say that\u00a0these exercises are varied exercises on counterterrorism, humanitarian response, and also on developing interoperability with our U.S. forces and also our Australian friends.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0Hey Will, thanks for the question.\u00a0 I just spoke with my counterpart in Ukraine today, Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.\u00a0 And we talked about a number of issues, but \u2013 as we typically do.\u00a0 But he and the leadership remain focused on the task at hand.\u00a0 And I have every confidence that they will do what good leaders, great leaders do:\u00a0 They will fight the enemy and not be driven by a specific plan.\u00a0 They have a great plan to start and \u2013 but only President Zelenskyy and his leadership really know the full details of that plan.\nSo they have much of the capability that they need to continue to be successful.\u00a0 We\u2019ve trained an enormous number of troops.\u00a0 We have provided a substantial number of platforms.\u00a0 And so I think he feels that he\u2019s in a \u2013 they\u2019re in a pretty good position.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll stay focused on continuing to generate security assistance capability so that they can continue to be successful whenever they choose to take up offensive operations.\nAnd again, sustainment will be there throughout.\u00a0 We\u2019ll stay connected with our allies and partners.\u00a0 We next meet for our next round of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on the 21st, and I look forward to seeing him and the rest of our colleagues at that meeting.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And Will, as to your question regarding Evan, yes, I made the determination yesterday that he is being wrongfully detained by Russia.\nPresident Biden had an opportunity to speak to his family today, I believe.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken to your colleagues, including leadership at\u00a0The Wall Street Journal, multiple times about Evan\u2019s situation.\u00a0 When I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov about a week ago now, just after Evan was detained, I of course pressed for his immediate release, but I also pressed for immediate consular access to him.\u00a0 The fact that Russia has not granted that access puts it once again in violation of international commitments it\u2019s made, commitments that are at the heart of diplomatic relations between countries and the ability of our citizens as well to be able to safely be present in other countries.\nI think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access \u2013 never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes \u2013 is going to do even more damage to Russia\u2019s standing around the world, a standing that has been in freefall particularly since its reinvasion of Ukraine last year.\nAnd I think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there lest they be arbitrarily detained, and in the context of being arbitrarily detained not even having access for the diplomats who are there to look out for their interests and who, as a matter of solemn international obligations that Russia has undertaken, should be allowed that access.\nI\u2019m not going to get into what measures, steps we\u2019re taking or might take to do that.\u00a0 I can simply tell you that we are engaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan\u2019s release.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, your Excellencies.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-bangladeshi-foreign-minister-abdul-momen-before-their-meeting-2/", "title":

Blinken  at a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "NATO Headquarters", "location": "Brussels, Belgium", "date": "April 5, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s always good to be back in Belgium, in Brussels, at the NATO Headquarters, which has become almost a home away from home.\u00a0 But this week, these last two days, this has genuinely been a historic NATO meeting.\nYesterday, on the 74th anniversary of the Alliance, I accepted Finland\u2019s membership documents to join NATO.\u00a0 Finland is now our 31st Ally.\u00a0 With this step, Finland is safer; NATO is stronger.\u00a0 We look forward to welcoming Sweden to NATO in the near future.\u00a0 Like Finland, it\u2019s militarily capable.\u00a0 It\u2019s a strong democracy, fully dedicated to upholding the commitments and values that underpin our Alliance, including Article 5.\nAt the NATO leaders summit last summer, the NATO Allies agreed on a new strategy for the first time in a decade.\u00a0 Since then, including at this ministerial, we\u2019ve been working to implement that strategy, making our Alliance stronger, more resilient, better positioned for the future.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on the Wales defense investment pledge to invest 2 percent of our GDP in defense.\u00a0 It is critical that we have the means to replenish stockpiles, to increase the readiness of our forces, to meet force generation commitments for NATO missions and operations, to keep pace with 21st century challenges.\nWe\u2019re developing new partnerships, including in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 At this ministerial, we welcomed the participation of Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, who share our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region but also recognize that many of the challenges that we face are interconnected and global in nature.\nAnd of course, the Alliance remains relentlessly focused on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 The NATO-Ukraine Commission met for the first time in five years, with Foreign Minister Kuleba\u2019s participation, to talk about ways that we can continue to help Ukraine in the weeks, the months, and indeed the years ahead.\nWhen the NATO foreign ministers last convened back in November of last year, President Putin was pursuing his new strategy to win his brutal war against Ukraine.\u00a0 Having suffered devastating setbacks on the battlefield, he tried to bomb and freeze Ukraine\u2019s civilian population into submission.\u00a0 He accelerated his campaign to weaponize energy against Ukraine\u2019s European partners so that they would decide that the cost of supporting the country were too high.\u00a0 And he continued to try to raise food and energy prices in some of the poorest countries in the world to manufacture a false choice between supporting Ukraine and making ends meet for their people.\nPresident Putin has failed.\u00a0 Thanks to the remarkable courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people and unprecedented support from Ukraine\u2019s partners, Ukraine endures.\u00a0 More than 50 countries have been providing security assistance.\u00a0 Dozens of countries jumped in to help Ukraine defend and repair its energy grid in the face of Russia\u2019s onslaught.\u00a0 We sustained and increased the pressure on Russia with unprecedented sanctions and export controls, which are having a dramatic and growing impact.\u00a0 The Kremlin\u2019s usable financial reserves are plummeting.\u00a0 Its budget revenues from oil and gas have been cut in half since last year.\u00a0 Hundreds, even more than a thousand, companies have fled the country and aren\u2019t coming back.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands of young people have fled Russia \u2013 literally Russia\u2019s future.\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated again our unity of purpose and our unity of action.\u00a0 And after this ministerial, I am confident that that will endure for as long as it takes for Ukraine to defend its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, its independence.\nYesterday, the United States announced our 35th drawdown of arms and equipment.\u00a0 That includes more ammunition for HIMARS, air defense interceptors and artillery rounds, as well as antiarmor systems, small arms, heavy equipment transport vehicles, and maintenance support.\u00a0 These contributions will continue to enable Ukraine to protect civilian infrastructure from missile and drone attacks and to hold and retake Ukraine\u2019s territory.\nThe United States and Ukraine\u2019s partners support meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve a peace, but not just any kind of peace.\u00a0 It has to be a just peace that upholds the principles of the UN Charter \u2013 sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence \u2013 and it has to be an durable peace that ensures that Russia can\u2019t simply rest and refit its troops and then relaunch the war at a time of its choosing.\u00a0 That\u2019s the kind of peace, a just and durable one, that 141 countries at the United Nations General Assembly endorsed just a few weeks ago.\nUntil that peace is achieved, the United States, together with allies and partners from around the world, will continue to provide the assistance that Ukraine needs to defend its territory and defend its people.\nThe story of NATO over the last year has been one of unity and resolve.\u00a0 Amid new challenges to our values, to a rules-based order, to our collective security, our Alliance has emerged stronger than ever and now larger than ever.\u00a0 As we prepare for Vilnius and beyond, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to meet the challenges of this moment and the time to come.\nSo with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Vivian Salama with\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Vivian.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I want to ask you about my colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who as of today has been detained in Russia for the last year \u2013 for the last week, sorry.\u00a0 Do you \u2013 it feels like a year.\u00a0 Do you anticipate that you will approve a designation of wrongfully detained for Evan, or do you need to wait however long it will take for the Russians to agree to grant him consular access for that to even happen?\nAnd secondly, prisoner swaps have occurred in recent years to bring a number of detained Americans home.\u00a0 Is there anyone that the Russians want or would be willing to exchange either for Evan or for Paul Whelan, who is also being held on espionage charges?\u00a0 And more broadly, are you concerned that there is a precedent being set now by our adversaries who are detaining Americans in the hope that maybe they would be some sort of prisoner swap in return?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks very much, Vivian. \u00a0First \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard me say this before \u2013 from my perspective, from the department\u2019s perspective, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of American citizens around the world, and that includes those who may be wrongfully detained, held hostage, otherwise kept from coming home, being with their families.\nIn Evan\u2019s case, we are working through the determination on wrongful detention, and there\u2019s a process to do that and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working through very deliberately but expeditiously as well.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll let that process play out.\u00a0 In my own mind, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s being wrongfully detained by Russia, which is exactly what I said to Foreign Minister Lavrov when I spoke to him over the weekend and insisted that Evan be released immediately.\u00a0 But I want to make sure that \u2013 as always, because there is a formal process \u2013 that we go through it, and we will, and I expect that to be completed soon.\nMore broadly, when it comes, first of all, to Paul Whelan, as I\u2019ve also said, there\u2019s a proposal on the table that\u2019s been on the table for some months.\u00a0 Again, with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I reiterated that Russia should move on that proposal so that we can bring Paul home.\u00a0 In any of these instances, there is a balance to be done between trying to bring home people who are being unjustly detained in one way or another and what it takes to do that.\u00a0 I believe that, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past and as a result as well of legislation that we have and other tools that we have, that even as we engage in efforts to bring people home, we can also increase the pressure and increase the penalties on those who would engage in the practice of unlawful, arbitrary detention of American citizens.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing, including, for example, implementing the Robert Levinson Act and other tools that we have.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Vitaliy Syzov with Freedom TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I have one question.\u00a0 Yesterday, after meeting with you, minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine said that he want to see some proposal from NATO during the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 Today, minister of foreign affairs of Estonia said that Ukraine should be provided with a roadmap of accession to NATO.\u00a0 What are your thoughts about this process?\u00a0 Each proposal could expect to get Ukraine during Vilnius Summit.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Our focus right now is relentlessly on doing what needs to be done to help Ukraine defend itself against the Russian aggression and, indeed, to put it in a \u2013 help put it in a position to retake more of the territory that\u2019s been seized from it by Russia.\u00a0 That\u2019s our intense focus.\nWe\u2019re also looking at what we can do over a longer period of time to build up Ukraine\u2019s capacity to deter aggression, to defend against aggression, and, if necessary again in the future, to defeat aggression.\u00a0 And a big part of that is bringing Ukraine up to NATO standards and to NATO interoperability.\u00a0 And I suspect that you\u2019ll see that focus continue at the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the summit, but we are very focused on these very practical steps that can be taken and need to continue to be taken to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards.\nOf course, NATO\u2019s door remain open \u2013 remains open.\u00a0 There\u2019s no change in that, but we have to be in this moment focused intensely on the weeks and months ahead, particularly as Ukraine prepares for a counteroffensive, again, to try to retake more of its territory, as well as work that needs to be done to continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards and NATO interoperability.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll next go to Kylie Atwood with CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Hi, Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you for doing this.\u00a0 It was a momentous week here, but there\u2019s a lot going on at home, so I have a few questions for you.\u00a0 Bear with me.\u00a0 In terms of what happened here, obviously, you said that NATO has become stronger this week with Finland joining, but how tangibly will Ukraine benefit from Finland joining NATO?\nAnd then my second two questions have to do with what is happening at home.\u00a0 First, President Tsai of Taiwan is meeting with Speaker McCarthy today in California.\u00a0 Do you support this meeting at this time?\u00a0 And how concerned are you about China already vowing that it will retaliate?\nAnd then my second question has to do with politics at home.\u00a0 Yesterday, the world watched as former President Trump was arrested.\u00a0 He\u2019s now the first current or former president to face criminal charges, and he\u2019s running for re-election to be president.\u00a0 Have any of your allies asked you about this while you\u2019ve been here at NATO?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your response to revive concerns among Allies that many of us have heard about the long-term reliability of the United States given the polarized nature of politics at home?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Kylie, last question first.\u00a0 As you know well, I don\u2019t do politics.\u00a0 I can tell you, though, that the question you raised about the proceedings in New York actually did not come up in my conversations with NATO colleagues, nor did I get questions about the durability of our approach.\u00a0 I think people are very focused on what we\u2019re actually doing, and what we\u2019re doing is a lot, including what I just went through in terms of the outcomes from this ministerial, the preparations for the leaders summit in Vilnius, the intense focus on everything we\u2019re doing to support Ukraine, to implement the new Strategic Concept for NATO.\u00a0 That\u2019s what everyone was talking about and focused on, and also, as I mentioned, the fact that we have the growing engagement between NATO and other partners, to include our partners from the Indo-Pacific, to include the European Union \u2013 its high representative was here as well today.\u00a0 That was the entirety of the conversation and our focus.\nIn terms of Finland\u2019s membership in NATO and Ukraine, look, in the first instance, irrespective of the \u2013 of that question, as I\u2019ve detailed at some length, a big focus of our meetings here over the last day and a half was on Ukraine and the support that virtually every NATO member is providing individually, as well as the support that NATO institutionally is providing, both in the immediate and also looking toward the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 I mentioned a moment ago work that the Alliance looks to do to help continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards, NATO interoperability, and I think that\u2019s something you\u2019ll see featured at the at the leaders summit.\nFinland\u2019s membership in NATO does two things.\u00a0 It, as I\u2019ve said, makes Finland safer because one of the things that resulted from Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was deep and growing concern among a number of countries that they could be next, and that created what I think is truly historic sea change in both Finland and Sweden, seeking membership in NATO, and thus seeking to benefit from its Article 5 guarantees.\u00a0 So Finland now benefits in that, but Finland also makes the Alliance as a whole stronger, and that\u2019s important in and of itself.\u00a0 I think it may have some additional benefits in the sense that, to the extent Russia thinks about expanding or broadening its aggression, the deterrent that NATO poses to that has now become even stronger.\nNATO is a defensive Alliance; it\u2019s not seeking to engage in conflict with Russia.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a defensive Alliance that has to have a strong deterrent, precisely because we want to make sure that countries think twice, think three times, and then don\u2019t engage in aggression.\u00a0 And I think Finland will \u2013 its membership in the Alliance adds to NATO\u2019s deterrence strength and, if necessary, its defensive strength.\nWith regard to President Tsai\u2019s transit of the United States, I think the first thing to emphasize is that these transits by high-level Taiwanese authorities are nothing new.\u00a0 They\u2019re private, they\u2019re unofficial, but they\u2019ve been going on for years, and President Tsai and her predecessors have done the same thing.\u00a0 In fact, every Taiwan president has transited the United States at one point or another.\u00a0 The meetings, the engagements that the president has also are very much in line with precedent.\u00a0 And similarly, our own approach to Taiwan has remained very consistent and unchanged, including our adherence to the \u201cone China\u201d policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Communiques, the Six Assurances, our opposition to any unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying that, given that, Beijing should not use the transits as an excuse to take any actions to ratchet up tensions, to further push at changing the status quo.\u00a0 And our objective remains the same: to have peace, to have stability across the Taiwan Strait, and to ensure that any differences that exist between mainland and Taiwan are resolved peacefully.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Rikhard Husu with \u2013 from YLE.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for taking my question.\u00a0 A follow-up on Finland:\u00a0 How do you see that Finland will strengthen the Alliance?\u00a0 And do you see that this decision to join can also strengthen the ties, bilateral ties between the U.S. and Finland, for instance in regard to a future defense cooperation agreement?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much.\u00a0 Well, the bilateral ties between the United States and Finland are already extraordinarily strong.\u00a0 But I think Finland\u2019s membership in the Alliance can, if it does anything, will only strengthen those ties, as well as Finland\u2019s ties to all the other members of NATO.\u00a0 But as I said before, what Finland brings to this enterprise is a country that has very strong military capacity, and equally important is a strong and vital democracy.\u00a0 And so both in terms of advancing the interests that bring NATO countries together and the values that we share, Finland is a very compelling member of the Alliance.\nAnd I think what\u2019s important, too, is that Finland and the NATO Alliance have been working closely together for years.\u00a0 What membership does now is it makes, in a sense, formal what\u2019s in many ways been the case for a long time, but it also provides Finland with the commitment of every NATO Ally to Finland and its security and its defense as a member of NATO and as a beneficiary of Article 5.\u00a0 But I would anticipate that, across the board, this has the effect of just further strengthening, deepening relationships, not only between the United States and Finland but between Finland and all the other members of NATO.\nWe also have now even more increasing overlap between membership in the European Union and membership in NATO.\u00a0 And that too has the effect of creating even greater convergence between the United States and Europe than we\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 In fact, I think in my experience now, doing this for 30 years in one way or another, there is more convergence than there\u2019s ever been between the United States and Europe on the big challenges and questions of our time \u2013 dealing with the Russian aggression against Ukraine; meeting some of the challenges posed by China; looking at new things emerging from cyberspace, emerging technologies and their impact on our security and our interests \u2013 much greater convergence in how we approach each of these challenges than we\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0 And I think Finland\u2019s membership in NATO is just one more expression of that, but it really is across the board, and it\u2019s something that, from my perspective, puts us collectively in a much stronger position to deal effectively with all of these challenges.\nWe started with \u2013 this administration started with the basic proposition that American engagement, American leadership is important.\u00a0 It makes a difference because in its absence, some else may try to fill the gap and maybe not in ways that advance our interests and values, or no one does, and then you\u2019ve got a vacuum that tends to be filled by bad things before it\u2019s filled by good things.\u00a0 But the flip side of that coin, the importance of U.S. engagement, is that for virtually all of the challenges that we\u2019re dealing with, no single country, even the United States, can really effectively address them alone.\u00a0 We\u2019re much better off when we\u2019re doing it in partnership, in alliance with other countries, and where we adopt a similar approach.\nThat\u2019s been the story of these last two and a half years: the strengthening of our alliances; creating new partnerships to deal with some of these new challenges, fit for particular purposes; and, fundamentally, a much greater convergence than there\u2019s ever been \u2013 between the United States and Europe, between the United States and Asia, Asia and Europe \u2013 on what we need to do to effectively deal with these challenges.\u00a0 And this ministerial just confirms that trend, confirms that convergence.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken Remarks Before U.S.-EU Energy Council Meeting\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "European Council Building", "location": " Brussels, Belgium ", "date": "April 4, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0High Representative Borrell, Josep, thank you. Thank you for bringing us together today and for continuing an ongoing discussion, an ongoing action that we\u2019ve had with the United States and the European Union on an issue that\u2019s critical in the lives of all of our fellow citizens. I\u2019m very much looking forward to pursuing the discussion we actually began earlier this morning. It\u2019s great to be joined, Tobias, by you, Commissioner Simson, our Deputy Secretary of Energy Dave Turk. Very good to be with everyone this morning.\nWhen this council met on February 7th, 2022, Russia was on the verge of invading Ukraine. Europe was on the verge of an energy crisis. President Putin bet that his threat of stopping gas supplies would deter Europe and the world from standing up to his aggression against Ukraine. He was wrong.\nHe then doubled down \u2013 stopping natural gas supplies to many European countries, dramatically reducing flows to others, forcing record-high prices on millions in Europe and around the world. He sought to wipe out Ukraine\u2019s critical energy infrastructure \u2013 damaging or destroying 50 percent of Ukraine\u2019s grid, leaving millions without reliable power and heat.\nAnd again \u2013 he failed. Ukraine stands \u2013 and stands strong. Europe stands \u2013 and stands strong. The world is reducing its dependence on Russian energy, accelerating the transition to the green economy.\nThis is possible, in no small part, because of the partnership between the United States and the European Union.\nThe U.S.-EU Energy Council has worked as never before to help make Europe more energy secure. The United States has more than doubled our supply of natural gas to the continent \u2013 exporting 56 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas last year. Because of these and other efforts, Russia\u2019s natural gas only accounted for about 16 percent of the EU\u2019s natural gas imports by the end of 2022 \u2013 compared to 37 percent in March of 2022. And as I mentioned, our supplies went up more than twofold \u2013 over 140 percent increase between 2021 and 2022.\nThe EU\u2019s leadership has been vital in this shift \u2013 for example, with its Save the Gas for a Safe Winter program, through which citizens voluntarily lowered their electricity use and used more energy efficient appliances. These and other efforts contributed to a 19 percent reduction in natural gas demand between August of 2022 and January of 2023.\nWe accelerated, as I mentioned, the clean energy transition. The U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security is helping our governments and private sector partners share information to boost energy efficiency and diversify supply, like deploying more heat pumps and smart thermostats.\nHere, too, the European Union has shown remarkable leadership, increasing its goal of energy from renewables from 40 percent to 45 percent by 2030. EU countries added roughly 50 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity last year \u2013 which together generated more electricity than natural gas in 2022.\nLast year, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in American history, and we\u2019re heartened that Europe too is working on ambitious clean energy incentives. Through the Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue, which President Biden and President von der Leyen launched last month, we are working together to make sure that these efforts are mutually reenforcing, so that our incentives create a positive feedback loop of innovation, investment for energy transition, jobs for our people.\nWe also come together to support Ukraine\u2019s energy needs. Together, the EU, the U.S., and our G7+ partners have delivered more than 4,000 power generators, 1,000 transformers, and more than 5 million pieces of equipment, like circuit breakers and cables, to help repair and replace the country\u2019s battered energy grid.\nToday, we\u2019ll talk about ways to continue rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. We\u2019ll also talk about our shared work to deploy new technologies like clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, among other efforts, to advance the energy transition across Europe and the United States.\nThese collective efforts are directly benefiting people on both sides of the Atlantic through more affordable, more reliable energy, good-paying jobs, and a safer, more sustainable future.\nToday\u2019s discussions will bring us one step closer to that future, and like everyone, I\u2019m eager to get the conversation started. So again, Josep, thanks so much for having us here today, and I look forward to our discussions.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-eu-high-representative-for-foreign-affairs-and-security-policy-josep-borrell-remarks-to-the-press/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

morning.\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0I\u2019m very happy to welcome you, Secretary Blinken, in Brussels.\u00a0We just had a very good bilateral meeting marking our great transatlantic cooperation.\u00a0Now we will co-chair the EU-U.S. Energy Council, and later we will see each other also at the NATO Ministerial.\nAllow me some words about our bilateral discussion.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, we start discussing and talking about the Russian war in Ukraine, the situation in Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, and the Middle East peace process.\nIt\u2019s more than one year ago that Putin start destroying Ukraine, and he seems determined to continue with his brutal bloodshed and destruction, and he still escalates further despite not achieving anything.\u00a0\u00a0His newest nuclear gamble \u2013 with nuclear weapons moved to Belarus \u2013 constitutes a new escalation and poses a direct threat to European security.\u00a0\u00a0And this comes, ironically, after Chinese President Xi visited Moscow and mentioned the need for peace and they agreed on the need to not deploy nuclear arms abroad.\u00a0\u00a0Some days later, Russia deployed tactical weapons \u2013 nuclear tactical weapons in Belarus.\nWe have been discussing with Secretary Blinken about the role of China on supporting Russia\u2019s blatant violations of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0\u00a0There is a clear expectation from a permanent member of the Security Council to stand up in defense of international rules-based order.\u00a0\u00a0And China has a moral duty to contribute to a fair peace.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot be siding with the aggressor.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot be militarily supporting the aggression.\nThis is our message to China, from today\u2019s meeting and from all the European Union\u2019s visits going to Beijing.\u00a0\u00a0Today, President von der Leyen will be in Beijing with French President Macron, Spanish Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez was there last week, and I will travel next week too.\u00a0\u00a0So, as you see, a lot of Europeans going to China.\nBut we have been clear with China that its position on Russia\u2019s atrocities and war crimes will determine the quality of our relations with Beijing.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, the European Union stands united and our transatlantic community remains also united.\u00a0\u00a0We are committed to continue supporting Ukraine in its self-defense, and we will maintain the collective pressure on Russia to stop the widespread violations of international law.\u00a0\u00a0We are doing everything we can militarily, politically, and providing financial support to ensure that Ukraine prevails.\nWe also talked about the Middle East, and we shared our concerns about the vicious cycle of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territories.\u00a0\u00a0The latest developments painfully demonstrate that the path towards a resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict is urgently needed.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciated the recent U.S. mediation efforts in Aqaba and Sharm el-Sheikh, and I also shared with you, Secretary Blinken, about my efforts together with partners in the Arab world to try to revive peace efforts by building on the Arab Peace Initiative and adding European peace contribution to it.\nWe also discussed about some topics in Africa.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, on Ethiopia, this was a major crisis, and now, fortunately, things start to move towards solving it.\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s one of the rare good news that we have in the world.\u00a0\u00a0And to sustain the current progress, it is important that the EU and U.S. continue working hand-in-hand.\u00a0\u00a0The message to both the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigrayans is to make them understand that we are watching the settling of the conflict and will only normalize our relations in a gradual way, step by step.\nOn Central African Republic, we exchanged views on the ongoing international efforts, including our own efforts, to help to stabilize the country so they did not have to rely on the Wagner mercenaries.\u00a0\u00a0You know that the Wagner mercenaries, this destructive group, has had a negative impact on each country where they are present, be in Central African Republic and others in the Sahelian area, contributing only to further destabilization and impacting negatively in the entire region.\nFinally, we are going to co-chair now the 10th EU-U.S. Energy Council, but this year is different from our previous meetings in Washington, and the past year has been marked by atrocities, war against Ukraine, and the unprecedented EU-U.S. coordination to support the country and to support our energy security in Europe.\u00a0\u00a0We, the European Union and its member-states, are the lead donors when it comes to energy assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0We have been able to get rid of the Russian dependency on gas, and we will discuss today about how to accelerate the green energy transition, reducing methane emissions, and launching a new global energy efficiency initiative.\u00a0\u00a0That also is a good news.\nThank you.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0And let me just start by thanking the High Representative, my friend Josep, for another very productive and timely meeting, building on the momentum that President Biden and European Commission President von der Leyen produced at the White House just last month.\nThis discussion today reinforced what has been evident to us for some time: U.S.-European Union relations have never been stronger or more important for advancing our shared interests.\nAfter more than a year of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, the stakes for our partnership could not be higher \u2013 for the transatlantic relationship; for Ukraine itself; indeed, for people around the world who are bearing many of the consequences of this aggression.\nThe United States and the EU continue to work in lockstep, together with a broad coalition of partners around the world, to ensure that Ukraine can defend itself, its people, its territory, the right to choose its own path.\nEuropean partners have spent about $13 billion in European \u2013 in military assistance thus far, on top of tens of billions more in economic and humanitarian assistance, extraordinary support for refugees who have come from Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0We very much appreciate the announcement from the EU that it will be providing an additional 2 billion in euros worth of ammunition through its European Peace Facility.\nTogether, we\u2019re freezing the assets of those fueling the Kremlin\u2019s aggression, deploying sweeping sanctions and export controls that are degrading Russia\u2019s capacity to wage war.\u00a0\u00a0The Kremlin\u2019s finances have been squeezed to devastating effect, forcing it to choose between pouring money into the war or providing for its own citizens.\u00a0\u00a0As one Russian billionaire starkly said of Russia\u2019s future: \u201cThere will be no money next year.\u201d\nThe United States and the European Union are further working together to defend the energy and food security of millions of people around the world who have been affected by President Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, to press for accountability for Russian atrocities, and to support meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve a just and durable peace.\nJosep and I also discussed the United States and Europe\u2019s unprecedented cooperation on energy security, and indeed, we\u2019ll take that up in more detail in a few minutes.\u00a0\u00a0We share a commitment to preventing a climate catastrophe, accelerating the global clean energy transition, building resilient, secure, and diversified supply chains for renewable energy \u2013 and doing it in a way that creates good-paying jobs and lowers costs for people on both sides of the Atlantic.\nRussia\u2019s weaponization of energy has underscored the urgency of that task \u2013 and an opportunity to accelerate our progress.\u00a0\u00a0And so, over the past year, the United States and Europe have thrown our energy security cooperation into even higher gear.\nIn 2022, the United States exported 56 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe: that is 40 percent of Europe\u2019s total imports; it\u2019s a 140 percent increase over our LNG exports to Europe the previous year.\u00a0\u00a0The European Union cut dependence on Russian gas from nearly 40 percent at the start of the war to about 15 percent by the end of 2022.\u00a0\u00a0That is extraordinary.\u00a0\u00a0When we convene the council in a few minutes, we will focus on how we can further reduce European dependence on Russian energy, and boost the Euro-Atlantic region\u2019s clean energy production.\nWe also spoke about our continued partnership on economic security.\u00a0\u00a0We have serious concerns about the challenges posed by economic coercion, by the weaponization of economic dependencies, and non-market policies and practices, including by the PRC, and we discussed ways to address these issues.\u00a0\u00a0Later this spring, we\u2019ll hold another meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, where these and other priorities will be on the agenda.\nAs Josep mentioned, we also did something of a tour of the world of challenging places and areas where our work together, our coordination, our cooperation can make a difference, from Ethiopia to the Central African Republic to the Middle East.\u00a0\u00a0And in all of these areas, the coordination between the United States and the European Union is as great and, indeed, I would say greater than it\u2019s ever been.\nFinally, running through our conversation was our focus on revitalizing our democracies and our democratic values \u2013 which bind us, and which brought hundreds of partners together just this week around the world and in Washington for the Summit for

is really a moment to just drop the mic and leave because \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 a few things I wanted to share with all of you, but I think the first and most important is this:\u00a0 Moments like this are important.\u00a0 We don\u2019t usually take the time, even half an hour, 45 minutes, to just press pause and reflect on something that we\u2019ve done, because there\u2019s just too much to do.\u00a0 And the inboxes are overflowing, and it\u2019s always move, move, move.\u00a0 But it is important to do that because when we\u2019re at our best, as each of you has been in this extraordinary chapter, it really is worth reflecting on.\u00a0 And I hope that it inspires, energizes, encourages each of us to keep going, to keep doing this, to keep with this calling that has drawn all of us together in this incredible enterprise.\nErin said something that is I think very powerful and it\u2019s that we get called upon to do lots of things in our careers here at State, other agencies.\u00a0 But there\u2019re not that many moments when you can really say and see directly that something you have done has actually changed someone\u2019s life, and changed it for the better.\u00a0 There\u2019s usually too many points of connection along the way to really see it and really feel it, but the experience that each of you has had \u2013 in this instance, I hope really makes that connection, makes it powerful, and is something that you\u2019ll take with you throughout your careers and throughout your lives no matter what you do going forward.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply the most powerful thing that we occasionally have an opportunity to do, and it really is worth reflecting on.\nTressa, my friend, my travel companion, colleague, this is the epitome of the person here who runs into the burning building every single time, no matter how challenging it is, and gets the job done.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen that again and again.\u00a0 I\u2019m so grateful once again to you for your incredible leadership in this instance.\nThe extraordinary team of volunteers \u2013 and that was a hugely important word, volunteers \u2013 that Mike shared with us.\u00a0 That just inspires me tremendously because, again, I\u2019ve seen it time and again in this department.\u00a0 When we\u2019ve had an urgency, when we\u2019ve had an emergency situation, when we\u2019ve had a daunting challenge, people have been raising their hands.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been standing up.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve been running \u2013 you\u2019ve been running \u2013 into the building, and that makes a huge difference.\u00a0 Your determination, your skill, your heart, which is also very apparent in the stories that we\u2019ve heard from Katherine, from Marta, from Josh, from Hannah, from Gail, from Michael \u2013 that truly is inspiring to me as well.\nAnd to everyone who is joining us today, including folks who are online, as well as everyone here in person, thank you for everything that you\u2019ve done; and thank you for sharing the stories.\u00a0 We know that for each of the six stories, seven stories that we just heard, there are hundreds more \u2013 from across the U.S. Government, from across NGOs \u2013 from people who stepped up to welcome the 222.\u00a0 And I hope that in some way, as well, we\u2019ll find a way to collect some of those stories and maybe share them with colleagues because \u2013 again, I think it\u2019s going to be incredibly inspiring to them.\nBut these doctors, these political leaders, these journalists, these priests, these others who all came together and found themselves together \u2013 as a result of your work \u2013 on that plane, they had one thing that connected them, one overriding aspiration, and that was to simply exercise their fundamental freedoms and to try to safeguard the freedom of their fellow citizens.\u00a0 Tragically, in Ortega\u2019s Nicaragua, that\u2019s a crime.\u00a0 It\u2019s why these activists were imprisoned for months and sometimes years; denied visits from their loved ones.\u00a0 Many were held in harsh conditions, little access to sunlight, to fresh air, writing materials, books.\u00a0 One prisoner recalled reading and re-reading the label on a tube of toothpaste.\nAnd as you\u2019ve heard, living with that constant fear that you could be pulled into another cell to be beaten up, to be tortured \u2013 the constant fear that you might even be executed.\u00a0 Living with that, every single day, is its own kind of horrific torture.\nBut it\u2019s precisely because of the power of their message, their actions, the alternative vision that they have for their own country and the way it should treat its own people \u2013 it\u2019s exactly why the regime stripped them of their citizenship soon after they came to the United States.\u00a0 That too speaks volumes.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also why we felt compelled to do what we could to bring them to safety. \u00a0And it\u2019s why the work that all of you did \u2013 and did together \u2013 was so important.\nNow, that work began, in large part, with our colleagues in Embassy Managua who negotiated with the Nicaraguan Government, creating a system to ensure that each of 222 prisoners was accounted for, and \u2013 when the moment finally came, during the early morning hours of February 9th \u2013 physically escorting them to the airplane and then to their freedom.\nKatherine talked about the \u2013 waiting for that final confirmation, and I know that\u2019s excruciating.\u00a0 And as this was all happening, and Brian and Erin and others were keeping me informed of what was going on, I have to admit, I wasn\u2019t so sure this was really going to come together.\u00a0 I had a funny feeling, oh, this is going to fall apart.\u00a0 It seems almost \u2013 almost too good to be true, but too good to be true because so much work actually goes into this.\u00a0 These things don\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 It takes the incredible effort that started in Managua to actually get it done.\nFrom there, more than 350 \u2013 more than 350 of our colleagues from the U.S. Government, as well as partners from the state of Virginia, NGOs \u2013 you all took over.\u00a0 You worked around the clock, you worked through the weekend, reuniting prisoners with their loved ones.\u00a0 You interpreted for them.\u00a0 You provided them with food, with clothing, with healthcare.\u00a0 You helped them through the jarring process of starting a new life far from their homes and their communities.\nAnd what I heard also in the stories that were told is I think you all responded in a powerfully human way, because I imagine as you\u2019re there with someone who has just had this absolute sea change in their life, you\u2019re thinking and feeling and understanding how totally jarring and disorienting that is \u2013 even in this incredibly positive way.\u00a0 And the humanity that you showed as fellow human beings in helping them navigate this particular passage \u2013 that in and of itself was hugely important.\nAnd indeed, it wasn\u2019t just what you did, it\u2019s how you did it: with care, with compassion, by asking each of our Nicaraguan friends how are you doing, are you okay, what do you need \u2013 probably a question they hadn\u2019t been asked in a long, long time.\u00a0 By arriving at the tarmac with American colleagues that they knew from the past, they were welcomed by familiar faces.\u00a0 And Marta, I know that must have had a powerful impact on them as well.\nAs one of the volunteers put it, \u201cThe whole operation was successful because we all cared too much to accept anything less.\u201d\nNow, because of this work, our Nicaraguan friends are beginning new lives across more than two dozen U.S. states, some now moving on to other countries as well.\u00a0 Some have already jumped back into activism \u2013 no surprise \u2013 rallying international support and pressure for a better future for their country at the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Summit for Democracy just this week.\u00a0 At the summit, we heard some of these voices.\u00a0 Others are starting the process of opening new businesses, continuing their studies, getting on with their lives that were so violently interrupted by the Nicaraguan regime.\nNow, in the months ahead, we have our NGO partners that will continue to support the recent arrivals\u2019 relocation.\u00a0 We have our embassy colleagues who will work to reunify family members in Nicaragua with their newly settled family members in the United States.\u00a0 So, this process goes forward.\u00a0 It carries on.\nAnd at the same time, for us, a government, we\u2019ll join our partners across the hemisphere and around the world to continue to push for a return to democracy and respect for human rights in Nicaragua, while also using all of the diplomatic and economic tools that we have to try to promote accountability for the widespread abuses from the regime.\nSo, in a very small period of time, in a very intense way, you gave us a reminder of who we are when we\u2019re at our best \u2013 which is not every day, but it was in the days that you were engaged in this mission: a country that stands with those on the side of freedom and human rights, and fights for our democratic values around the world.\u00a0 You\u2019ve demonstrated that with your service; you\u2019ve demonstrated that with your dedication.\nSo, I\u2019m so glad we just had a few moments together, again, to press the pause button, to reflect a little bit on what each of you has done, and to take that with you going forward because this career that all of you have been called to in a variety of ways, I know a lot of days can be frustrating.\u00a0 I know we pile on the work.\u00a0 The inbox gets higher, the resources seem to get \u2013 to shrink, and we\u2019re working on all of that.\u00a0 And I know there are days for each of us when we say, is it worth it?\u00a0 Maybe I should be doing something else.\nI hope and I believe strongly that this experience is a reminder of what an incredible pursuit this is, what an incredible responsibility we all have, but also what an incredible privilege it is to actually work for, represent your country, and try to make sure that the country that we love and share and the department that we love and share is actually operating at its best.\u00a0 In this instance it was because you were.\u00a0 And I just wanted to thank you on behalf of the President and as a fellow American.\u00a0 Thanks for exemplary work.\u00a0 Thanks for your service to our country.\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url":

more able to address the issues that matter most in the lives and livelihoods of their populations, whether it\u2019s protecting public health, advancing children\u2019s education, expanding economic opportunity.\nAnd we know that the pursuit of a stronger, freer, more democratic future is shared by people and governments from big and small countries, North and South, developed and developing.\nAs President Biden has said, democracy doesn\u2019t happen by accident.\u00a0 It requires constant effort, constant tending by each new generation \u2013 and by each of us.\u00a0 And indeed, we are at an inflection point when it comes to the future of democracy, where a defining question of this time is whether we are willing to do what it takes to make sure that democracies continue to deliver for their people, continue to thrive.\nThroughout this Year of Action, this group has answered that question with a resounding yes.\u00a0 Since the last Summit for Democracy, we have made \u2013 and we are delivering on \u2013 over 700 commitments that help us defend and strengthen democratic values and institutions.\nThese commitments include new laws and initiatives to combat corruption \u2013 like Ecuador\u2019s new National Anti-Corruption Strategy, the Dominican Republic\u2019s Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture, and Australia\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Commission Act.\nSteps to support a free and independent press \u2013 including the contributions of France, Slovakia, New Zealand, and the United States to initiatives that help independent news outlets become more financially stable and sustainable, and protect journalists, as well as the abolition of laws, as in Zambia, that could be used to silence government critics.\nGovernments have taken measures to bolster democratic institutions, including judicial reform in Albania and Angola; to encourage inclusive representation in government, particularly by women, members of the LGBTQI+ community, and other historically marginalized groups.\nAnd many have taken action to protect civic and human rights.\u00a0 The Democratic Republic of Congo passed landmark legislation to recognize indigenous peoples\u2019 land and cultural rights.\u00a0 Taiwan lifted barriers to prevent the recognition of transnational same-sex marriage.\u00a0 Nepal passed legislation to punish perpetrators of acid attacks and rape, to name just a few.\nThese national commitments are significant.\u00a0 They\u2019re making a difference, an actual difference, in the lives of millions of people around the world.\u00a0 And as we close this second Summit for Democracy, as we prepare for summits to come, we\u2019ll continue to help one another sustain, adapt, and build on our collective efforts.\nBecause President Biden believes deeply \u2013 as do I \u2013 that safeguarding our democracies is a collective effort, one that depends on our governments and on our people working together.\u00a0 Because all people, all nations, all sectors have contributions to make.\u00a0 And for sure, none of us has a monopoly on ideas, never mind good ideas.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why we tried to bring such a wide-ranging group of summit participants together to drive progress on shared priorities \u2013 from promoting youth engagement in politics, supporting an independent press, securing free and fair elections \u2013 and, as we discussed today, shaping the norms around the internet and emerging technologies.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why such a major focus of our work leading up to this summit, and in the months that will follow it, is on multilateral efforts \u2013 including Democracy Cohorts: innovative platforms that bring governments together with leading civil society and private sector groups.\nThis\u00a0shared fight against corruption is just one powerful example of why we need to work together across borders and with partners across our societies.\u00a0 And there has been \u2013 and I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019ve done it \u2013 real focus on combating corruption through our Summit for Democracy process.\nWe know that corruption is a transnational scourge.\u00a0 It discourages investment.\u00a0 It stifles competition.\u00a0 It deepens inequities.\u00a0 And maybe worst of all, it erodes public trust in government and institutions.\nEvery country, unfortunately, has experience in fighting corruption \u2013 experience that we need to be sharing with one another.\u00a0 Over the last 15 months, the United States, together with the Brookings Institution and the Open Government Partnership \u2013 which includes 76 countries, 106 local governments, representing more than 2 billion people, and thousands of civil society organizations \u2013 we\u2019ve been leading a new Financial Transparency and Integrity Democracy Cohort to do just that, to come together, to bring our experiences, our knowledge, and our efforts together in combating corruption.\nBringing these diverse perspectives together, the Cohort has worked to study the problem across regions.\u00a0 And it\u2019s crafting actual solutions based on lessons learned, based on best practices from member countries.\u00a0 Guidelines put together by the Cohort will help prevent bad actors from shielding illicit activity behind shell companies, stopping corrupt government officials and their cronies from enriching themselves, making sure that gatekeepers of the financial system \u2013 lawyers, accountants, investment managers \u2013 don\u2019t enable money laundering.\nThis work \u2013 this summit \u2013 is about looking inward at our democracies: recognizing our challenges, striving to do better by our people.\nAnd in a very profound way, I believe that\u2019s what distinguishes democracies: our willingness to confront these challenges \u2013 out in the open, transparently; to acknowledge our shortcomings \u2013 not to sweep them under the rug, not to pretend they don\u2019t exist.\u00a0 That is one of our greatest strengths.\u00a0 It\u2019s what we mean in the United States when we commit to the enduring task of forming a more perfect union.\nWe don\u2019t believe that we hold all the solutions \u2013 far from it.\u00a0 But we do know that when we join together with our fellow democracies, we make one another stronger, more resilient, more responsive to our citizens, and better able to do what we\u2019re here to do, which is to deliver for them \u2013 and, I hope, for the world.\nSo to each of you who are still here hanging in there at the end of the day, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your participation.\u00a0 Thank you for your engagement \u2013 but not just today, every single day \u2013 in doing this work.\u00a0 It matters.\u00a0 It\u2019s making a difference, and I can think of no recent time in history when it\u2019s been more vital.\u00a0 So thanks to everyone.\u00a0 Have a great evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-session-on-advancing-democracy-and-internet-freedom-in-a-digital-age-summit-for-democracy/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken.\u00a0 To build a more rights-respecting future, it\u2019s clear that democracies need to define an affirmative vision for how technology can promote democracy.\u00a0 Our first session, Advancing Democracy and Internet Freedom in a Digital Age, will help us think through how we might craft a world in which technology and democracy are mutually reinforcing.\nWe\u2019re joined today by three speakers; let me introduce them now.\u00a0 Jorge Arg\u00fcello is ambassador of Argentina to the United States.\u00a0 Nighat Dad \u2013 (applause) \u2013 Nighat Dad is executive director of Digital Rights Foundation.\u00a0 And Funke Opeke is CEO and founder of Main One.\u00a0 And I will now give the floor \u2013 (applause) \u2013 back to our moderator for this session, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Jeanne.\u00a0 So this is what I really like, because I actually get to ask the questions for once.\u00a0 And we have a great group of colleagues to hear from, to listen to, and to learn from.\u00a0 So I\u2019m really thrilled to be able to join each of you today and to, I think, focus on a few things.\u00a0 I think we all recognize that democracies have to make an affirmative case for how societies can leverage technology to actually advance, to make progress, and, as we were talking about just few minutes ago, to actually try to deliver positive results for our people.\u00a0 And I think we also recognize that the same human rights that we are so engaged in defending offline have to be also respected online, and this is one of the big challenges of our time.\u00a0 We have to have an internet, we have to have a digital ecosystem that respects and protects those rights, and each of you in different ways is engaged in that.\nSo a few things that I wanted to try to put on the table and invite our colleagues to talk about.\u00a0 First of all, my friend Ambassador Arg\u00fcello \u2013 Argentina is a member of the Freedom Online Coalition.\u00a0 We\u2019re very proud to chair this effort, and many in this room are members.\u00a0 As you\u2019re looking at it from Argentina\u2019s perspective, tell us a little bit about how you see Argentina working to advance internet freedom and to protect the space that we all have to share.\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0 Perfect.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary, Antony.\u00a0 Good morning to everyone here.\u00a0 First and foremost, I would like to stress that our country\u2019s highly honored to be part of this important event, as well as to be part of the second Summit for Democracy and endorse its final declaration.\u00a0 As you all know \u2013 and you probably know or you may know \u2013 our President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, the president of Argentina, was in Washington, D.C., yesterday in order to have a bilateral meeting with President Biden, which was held yesterday at the White House.\u00a0 Our Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero was part of the presidential delegation.\u00a0 He received the invitation to participate in this panel as a speaker.\u00a0 Unfortunately, he was called away for last-minute business and he is now in Buenos Aires for what he asked me to convey: his deepest apologies to you all.\nBut let me now turn to the topic that gathers us today.\u00a0 Information and communication technologies are in process of constant progress and have become fundamental tools that improve productivity for development, both economically and socially, fostering greater participation of societies and allowing better access to knowledge while promoting the strengthening of education in our countries.\u00a0 Likewise, and from the point of view of government interaction with citizens within the framework of truly democratic societies, these technologies have enhanced the capacity to provide quality, agile services with greater transparency, open communications, and greater participation.\u00a0 In this sense, increasing access to these technologies while strengthening connectivity and achieving the universalization of ICT services is a clear priority that allows us to avoid digital exclusion and reduce inequality \u2013 and reduce inequality.\nTherefore, aspiring to a knowledge society cannot be dissociated from the achievement of the highest possible levels of social inclusion.\u00a0 The achievement of one will not be fair or democratic if it is not built on the basis of the other.\u00a0 The adoption and implementation of technologies are still a challenge for many countries because, while some technologies make leaps of great magnitudes, certain technologies, groups, industries, sectors, workers go at a different pace and require a different policy approach.\u00a0 We must look closely at the different divides \u2013 gender, rural, industrial systems, security systems \u2013 and analyze together, with the private sector and civil society, which are the best policies to address those gaps.\nIn Argentina, ARSAT, the state-owned telecommunications company which operates the federal fiber optic network, plays a key role in connecting the unconnected, reaching the demand of small- and medium-sized companies, cooperatives, and rural areas.\u00a0 ARSAT, the company, was present some weeks ago here in D.C. for the SATELLITE Conference\u00a0and had many meetings with U.S. Government and companies to enhance cooperation in telecommunication and data centers.\u00a0 Also, it is important to highlight that in Argentina, fundamental human rights are protected by a solid legal framework guaranteed by our national constitution and in international treaties that have a constitutional hierarchy.\u00a0 The exercise of the rights of freedom of expression and association and the right to privacy is protected and guaranteed in the virtual and real world by the three branches of government.\nBearing this in mind, I would like to share with you some important milestones of our laws and policies regarding the ICTs.\nArgentina has a law which states that \u2013 and I\u2019m going to read \u2013 the search, reception, and dissemination of information and ideas of all kinds through the internet service is considered to be included within the constitutional guarantee that protects freedom of expression.\u00a0 Another law guarantees the complete neutrality of networks in all telecommunications services and ICT developments.\nNow, due to the boost we provide to the ICT sector, knowledge-based services represent the fourth \u2013 the fourth largest export complex in Argentina, and the development of Argentine technology companies with high levels of competitiveness is on the rise.\u00a0 We have also adopted a new knowledge economy law which broadens and deepens incentives into the sector.\u00a0 Likewise, under the firm conviction that certain vulnerable groups deserve special protection, in 2020 we sanctioned a law which creates a national program for the prevention and awareness of grooming or cyber bullying against children and adolescents, a crime that was also incorporated to our national criminal code.\nOn the other hand, regarding hate speech and its dissemination, it is worth mentioning that such crime is contemplated.\u00a0 As an open, multicultural, and multireligious society, in Argentina we strongly believe in our duty to work for an internet free of hate speech.\u00a0 Our rejection of online terrorism is clear and resounding.\u00a0 Argentina adhered to the Christchurch Call in September 2019.\u00a0 The call focuses on the delicate and sensitive balance between security considerations and freedom of expression and data privacy.\u00a0 Argentina has participated in many areas regarding the right of freedom of expression in digital context.\u00a0 We have adhered to a number of international instances, such as the Information and Democracy Forum or the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.\u00a0 Likewise, since June 2016, Argentina has been a member of the Freedom Online Coalition, and we are very proud to work in that sense.\nIn that regard, we wish the U.S. every success in its new chairmanship and reiterate our willingness to work together constructively.\u00a0 The Argentine Republic plays an active role in international and regional forums on issues related to human rights in the digital environment.\nFinally, Antony, and before giving back the floor to you, I would like to reaffirm our country\u2019s deep commitment to the development of information and communication technologies as fundamental tools for the empowerment of our peoples, with free access, without exclusion, which allows a true strengthening of societies, helping education and culture and access to information, as well as a better economic development.\u00a0 We \u2013 government along with the private sector along with the civil society \u2013 must tirelessly work together to make this happen.\nThank you very much, Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Ambassador, thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you for sharing that with all of us.\nLet\u2019s talk a little bit about digital inclusion.\u00a0 So, Ms. Dad, you are working to do exactly that: to try to make sure that women and girls, other marginalized communities are able to access technology and use it to thrive.\u00a0 So what I want to focus on here is your own experience through civil society in advancing rights and inclusion in the digital ecosystem.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Firstly, it\u2019s a pleasure to share this panel with esteemed panelists.\u00a0 As a civil society in past few years, we have had a front-row seat in seeing the role of digital technologies and internet in both advancing democracies and undermining institutions integral to a free democratic space.\u00a0 And holding these two realities together is important as we truly want to present a holistic picture of the role that technologies play in our democracies.\nThese two binaries also come as no surprise to me, having worked with young women and girls in Pakistan regarding their access to technologies and internet, which can be both as a liberating space in their lives but also abuse and violence not only online but offline as well.\u00a0 So it\u2019s really important that when we all are talking about digital rights, we center the experiences of marginalized groups \u2013 young women and girls, female journalists, women human rights defenders, activists \u2013 when we talk about democracy in the digital age, because\u00a0these experiences have a lot to teach us.\u00a0 And when it comes to technologies and digital spaces, there are two very main stakeholders who are dominating this space.\u00a0 One is governments around the world and the second is tech companies, platforms.\nOn one hand we have governments scrambling to acquire technologies and pass laws that would allow them to control the internet and dominate the pervasive narratives in these spaces.\u00a0 The loss of control over the information we consume and who gets to speak has been troubling for governments with long histories of interrupted and weak democratic rule.\u00a0 Even in countries where rule of law is strong, we \u2013 what we have seen is that they also struggle to come up with really good regulations, the regulations that respect international human rights framework.\nAnd on the other hand, we have powerful platforms dominating this space with so much space, profit margins, power to control content and our data, and often we have seen that \u2013 in my experience, the decade-long work, that we have seen that they are mostly unaccountable towards their \u2013 towards the governments but also mainly towards the users who should be the center of the conversation in these spaces.\nAnd this sort of throws up fundamental question about democracy:\u00a0 Do we want powerful tech companies to decide our democratic future?\u00a0 And while we are looking into these questions about governments and powerful companies, I think it\u2019s important to talk about solutions also, and there is this one solution which is self-regulatory model.\u00a0 It\u2019s an independent \u2013 Meta\u2019s Oversight Board that the company came up with a solution to hold itself accountable.\nBut the question is:\u00a0 Are they holding themself accountable independently and transparently?\u00a0 And the answer is that just this model that came up three years ago, where the people who are actually making decisions around content moderation of this platform are from diverse background.\u00a0 I sit on the board.\u00a0 I am from global majority.\u00a0 English is not my first language.\u00a0 I bring experiences of the marginalized groups not only from Pakistan but South Asia.\u00a0 But then telling companies sitting on this board that the decision that you are making are not truly democratic, are not following international human rights framework, and then come up with solution to tell them what they can do in these situations.\u00a0 And how we are making ourselves transparent is that \u2013 actually releasing our reports, the progress that we have made, the progress that the company has made so far.\u00a0 So I think these are the regulatory models I feel are so important to hold these companies accountable.\nAnd if I talk about my own personal experience as Digital Rights Foundation head in Pakistan, I feel that the global majority is actually at the end of \u2013 at the receiving end the decisions that the Global North, not only governments but the tech platforms, make.\u00a0 And there is very little say of the users, especially from Global South or global majority.\u00a0 There are such initiatives, local initiatives \u2013 if you look around, there are so many civil society organizations around the world who have been working on digital rights for such a long time.\u00a0 They have come up with local solutions.\u00a0 They have been part of international debates.\u00a0 But I think \u2013 and we\u2019ll speak about this later in the panel conversation as well \u2013 that these local solutions need to be taken into account in the global conversations.\u00a0 We cannot really come up with a top-down approach.\u00a0 I think we really need to see what people are locally doing, how they are contextualizing this issue, how they are holding their governments accountable who are coming up with bad regulations and laws while preserving speech in the online space, at the same time holding people in the Global North accountable, that what they are deciding can set bad precedents for the authoritarian regimes as well.\nThank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I think particularly the last point that you were making about the need to look to local solutions, to look to local ideas, to do this from the bottom up and the middle out not just the top down, is going to be vital to success and ultimately to having sustainable ways of doing things, because if people are not bought in, they will opt out one way or the other.\u00a0 So appreciate that very much.\nAccessibility.\u00a0 Ms. Opeke, tell us about how you are looking at this in the work that you\u2019re doing in Africa, and particularly operationalizing accessibility.\u00a0 We talked about this a little bit earlier, but we always run the risk with new technologies of having totally bifurcated worlds and those who have access to them, those who don\u2019t.\u00a0 And this is a vital part of your mission.\u00a0 Tell us how you\u2019re seeing it.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, and truly is an honor to be part of this distinguished panel.\u00a0 As you mentioned, Main One, which is a company that I run, was founded in 2008 to address the digital divide in Africa.\u00a0 It was informed \u2013 the vision was informed at that time with the reality that internet access was only a 10 percent penetration rate when the rest of the world was at 50 percent.\u00a0 Today we have 70 percent global internet penetration, but most of the African continent is at 50 percent or below.\nAnd so we set out to try to close that gap with a focus on West Africa.\u00a0 Now, how were we able to do that?\u00a0 Nigeria, which is the company that \u2013 country that I am from, had returned to democratic rule in 1999, and coming in 2001 on the heels of that was a liberalization of the telecommunications sector, which enabled private sector companies to deploy telecoms infrastructure for the first time to deliver to\u00a0citizens.\u00a0 And so coming on the heels of that, we were able to obtain licenses in Nigeria and Ghana, the first private licenses for open access submarine cables to connect West Africa to the rest of the world through Europe.\u00a0 Doing that, building that 7,000 kilometer cable, which initially served two countries in West Africa but is delivering a mix of services to 11 countries today, is part of what has enabled that growth in access to 50 percent.\nSo what really are the building blocks on which we did that, first, was the liberalization.\u00a0 And it is worth noting that not all African countries today have liberalized their telecommunications laws, which says in the \u2013 that the shortage of resources and the large infrastructure deficits that a lot of these countries face, they\u2019re not able to accelerate digital transformation of the economies because they\u2019re not enabling private capital to come in.\u00a0 The next step of our journey, of course, was private capital.\u00a0 And the African Development Bank was a key anchor, so having the kind of patient, more risk, higher-risk appetite capital to come into this market; obviously, skills; and then access to technology, where we had an American company with a depth of experience and capacity deploy the network for us.\nSo what do we see today is that the work is not done yet.\u00a0 And of course, as you go further down the pyramid and try to enable access and more inclusion, it does get more challenging. The word is\u2026what we have to do in these economics is to truly grow the market. \u00a0Because the value chain, in terms of realizing the return from investment in digital infrastructure, is simply not as mature as what you have in the advanced economies. \u00a0So there is a lot of partnering. \u00a0There is a need for patient capital to consider the affordability and also consider the provision of other elements in the value chain.\u00a0 Which is places like Lagos, Nigeria or Cape Town, South Africa or Nairobi, Kenya on the African continent your starting to see today.\u00a0 But there\u2019s still a lot more to be done.\nThe obvious returns are, there are successful companies of scale delivering the services on the African continent, so it proves that it can be done; and that delivering such infrastructure is also providing dividends for democracy, because as you have greater shared prosperity, job creation, financial inclusion, access to services, people are able to drive better outcomes, they\u2019re able to reduce unemployment rates for more people to work.\nAfrica, when you think of it, with 50 percent internet penetration of a population of 1.4 billion, that\u2019s about 700 million people.\u00a0 The average age on the continent is 19, who do not have access and constitute the workforce of tomorrow.\u00a0 So getting the access to those who have currently been excluded so they can form part of this fabric we are building is really critical.\u00a0 And that\u2019s \u2013 building the partnership to enable that is, I think, going to be critical to get there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I really want to underscore the point that you made about this not being a favor that one group of countries may be doing for another.\u00a0 It\u2019s profoundly in everyone\u2019s interests.\u00a0 And in the case of Africa, as you point out, the next 20 years we\u2019ll have one in four people on this planet being from and of Africa, so bridging these divides is going to be hugely important.\nI want to come back to one thing that you mentioned, then maybe we can go a little deeper on some of the things that people have already touched on.\u00a0 You mentioned the importance of private capital.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And of course, that\u2019s exactly right.\u00a0 And most of our governments, most of our systems, can\u2019t simply dedicate and direct state resources to some of these challenges.\u00a0 What we can do, what our comparative advantage is, is in catalyzing and leveraging private sector investment.\nBased on this experience, though, what do you see \u2013 and you\u2019ve touched on it a little bit \u2013 as some of the impediments to that?\u00a0 And then, are there any thoughts that you have about how that can be facilitated?\u00a0 You mentioned the need to actually make markets.\u00a0 I\u2019m hopeful, for example, that as the free trade area in Africa actually emerges and we get beyond this abnormal situation where African countries trade more with countries outside of Africa than they do with themselves, that will also help create markets that attract investment in an easier way.\u00a0 But are there other things that come to mind based on your experience?\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, understood about governments not being able to write checks, open checks to drive private infrastructure investment in developing countries.\u00a0 However, for the funds that have been identified, I believe helping to create the frameworks, a lot of these lesser developed economies do not have strong institutions.\u00a0 One of the areas where progress can be made and impacts can be driven is helping to strengthen the frameworks, helping to strengthen the work of institutions that are set up to establish and guide those examples.\u00a0 And I really think that\u2019s where the most impact can be made.\nAs you mentioned also with the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, implementation has not kept pace with expectations that were set a few years ago when the free trades agreement went into effect.\u00a0 So what can be done and based on the U.S. experience in setting up and working with such agreements to actually facilitate implementation and impact?\u00a0 I believe that\u2019s probably where the most impact can be had for the kind of checks that can be written by the U.S. Government.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 So we have an expression:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m from the federal government;\u00a0 I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I\u2019m from the federal government; I\u2019m here to help.\nFrom the perspective of civil society, what can governments be doing better, more effectively, to make sure that we\u2019re advancing inclusion, that we\u2019re making sure that in particularly underserved people, community groups, have the benefit of accessibility and also are not finding themselves in the situation where these tools and this technology is actually being used against them?\nMS DAD:\u00a0\u00a0I think for that, there has been a lot of conversation around including civil society in these conversations.\u00a0 I think, first and foremost, is we need to really see who are the people from civil society in these conversations.\u00a0 Are these only people from Western democracy and Global North?\u00a0 And if civil society from global majority is not part of this conversation, then why not?\u00a0 And I think that leads us to the conversation where civil society is being \u2013 the civic space has been eroded very slowly, very gradually, and no one even felt that.\u00a0 And I think what Western democracies who are setting good precedents, they can also hold those governments accountable, that why this is happening, why these civil \u2013 civil society cannot participate in these conversations if they are not truly liberated.\nAnd I think the second point is are they \u2013 do they have resources to do that?\u00a0 I think empowering them, not only making them included in these conversations but also do they have money to do that.\u00a0 And I think while I\u2019m saying these resources, I have seen people doing a lot of labor in these countries for \u2013 labor towards these companies, telling them what are the gaps that they have so that they can make these online spaces safer for their own communities, and telling government that the laws that they are making are problematic.\u00a0 So it\u2019s free labor; it\u2019s a thankless job.\u00a0 And I think what governments like U.S. can do is actually help empowering civil society, not only in their own jurisdiction but around the world, and hold other governments accountable what exactly they are doing to keep these space safer and freer for civil society.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAmbassador, any thoughts from the perspective of your country, your government, both on these questions of inclusion and these questions of accessibility?\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 Well, first of all, I would like to stress the importance of the battle we are facing, and allow me to congratulate you for calling for this gathering.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s very important to share the floor with my Nigerian and Pakistani friend.\u00a0 They do a very important work in their countries from the civil society.\u00a0 And something \u2013 what we must having clear is that they there must be an alliance between the government, the civil society, and the private sector.\u00a0 Otherwise we \u2013 it will not fly.\u00a0 And what we are trying to do is precisely \u2013 is to have it flying.\nIn the case of our country, we are working with different international initiatives.\u00a0 I wrote here the information for Democracy Forum \u2013 we have been working together in that sense \u2013 the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and the Freedom for \u2013 Online Coalition.\u00a0 These are our main activities we develop in the international field.\u00a0 And I would like to stress something that Funke just said:\u00a0 The work is not done yet.\u00a0 The battle is starting.\u00a0 Our democracy \u2013 the national democracy, the international democracy, the freedom is at stake.\u00a0 So we must take \u2013 be part of this discussion.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m cognizant of time \u2013 I want to make sure that we get some other people in on this conversation.\u00a0 So we have a number of \u2013 probably 600 experts in this audience today, but we can\u2019t hear from everyone.\u00a0 But there are a few people I\u2019d like to call on just to get perspectives and also any questions that you have for our wonderful panelists.\nSo Amalia Toledo from the Wikimedia Foundation, who\u2019s working on technology\u2019s impacts on human rights.\u00a0 Amalia, are you here?\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you to the panel.\u00a0 My question is (inaudible) digitalization happening across government \u2013 how can they ensure that tech companies are respecting the human rights of individuals?\nAMBASSADOR Arg\u00fcello:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 If I may, I think that\u2019s a very important question because \u2013 and it needs a clear answer.\u00a0 There is only one way to guarantee that, and it\u2019s the development of a strong legal framework.\u00a0 So I want to reiterate there is an alliance to be \u2013 to put on the table between the government, the civil society, and the private sector.\u00a0 Otherwise, we won\u2019t be able to protect the right of freedom of expression, both, as you said, Antony, online and offline.\u00a0 So I think that that\u2019s our main target to play.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Other thoughts on this?\nMS DAD:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, I mean, yes, governments are powerful, and they are already bringing lot of regulations and laws to hold companies accountable.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s important that we look into other mechanisms where these platforms find themselves accountable as well.\u00a0 And one initiative I have already mentioned, like independent oversight body, which is truly independent, and which is also transparent.\nBut I would also like to be very cautious towards giving an only solution, like regulatory framework and laws, because it really doesn\u2019t work for everyone around the world.\u00a0 There are regulations and laws that we have seen that were made in the name of protecting young women and girls in the online space, cyber harassment, abuse, hate speech, disinformation, but those laws have been weaponized against the very same people.\u00a0 So I think we really need to see how those laws are being made, whether the governments are following international human rights framework, whether civil society is part of those conversations while these laws are being drafted and then implemented, and whether the judges are actually trained to develop good jurisprudence.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNext from our audience, Frane Maroevi\u0107 from the International Press Institute, who\u2019s working on advancing press freedoms around the world.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, excellencies and ladies and gentlemen.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be interested, as digitalization is happening across governments and different departments are working, how can\u00a0you ensure that it\u2019s all coordinated around the human rights agenda, that the human rights is at the focus of the work of each government department as they work on digitalization and promoting media freedom?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good question.\u00a0 Anyone want to jump in?\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Well, maybe that\u2019s for you, Secretary.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I was afraid you were going to say that.\u00a0 No, it\u2019s a hugely important question, and it goes to the work that we\u2019re trying to do to make sure that questions, obligations, responsibilities when it comes to human rights are infused in pretty much everything we do, including in places in our own department that might not naturally take that perspective into account when they\u2019re trying to formulate policy or advance policy.\nSo one of the challenges, I think, for particularly our organizations in government is to make sure that we\u2019re working horizontally as much as possible, because virtually everything we\u2019re talking about today connects to the equities of seven, eight, 10, 12 different offices in my own department, and it\u2019s the same, I\u2019m sure, for the ambassador and other colleagues in government.\nSo one of the things that we\u2019ve made a real effort to do is to make sure that in each of our bureaus, both from a geographic perspective but also a functional perspective \u2013 the human rights perspective and dimension is included in the deliberations.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019ve tried to bring together in the State Department, under one roof, all of these questions, to include the human rights dimension of technology in a new bureau that we stood up for Cyberspace and Digital Policy as well as for emerging technologies.\nSo partly this is a question of making sure that the direction, the responsibility to do that is clearly communicated, but it\u2019s also about setting up the mechanisms within government to make sure that that voice, that perspective is being included \u2013 and we\u2019ve tried to organize ourselves to do that.\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve had a similar experience.\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 Yes, I do.\u00a0 I agree with what you have said.\u00a0 I would add that our target, what we are pursuing when we talk about human rights, is a key word.\u00a0 We are trying to guarantee access.\u00a0 We are \u2013 for everybody, for everyone all over the world.\u00a0 We are trying to guarantee a true democratization of knowledge.\u00a0 That\u2019s human rights.\nAnd allow me to celebrate a decision made by the Biden administration.\u00a0 Argentina has a very firm stand in the human rights field, probably because of our own terrible experience during the last dictatorships in the \u201870s, but I said the international community is still celebrating the return of the U.S. to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations.\u00a0 We are working together.\u00a0 We are coordinating every action, not only between us but with all the members of the committee \u2013 the commission.\u00a0 But I think that is very important, and that will allow us to contribute to guarantee that everybody in \u2013 can engage in this public discussion.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nMS OPEKE:\u00a0 I would like to speak from the standpoint of weaker democracies who \u2013 which governments are not necessarily inclined to protect human rights.\u00a0 And in such economies or such countries, what we\u2019re finding is access in and of itself starts providing citizens with a voice and a means of easier, faster information dissemination to call attention to the issues and actually push for their rights to be protected.\u00a0 So taking another \u2013 yes, there are governments that are working actively to promote human rights, but there are also governments who want to silence those dissenting voices, and the more access is enabled and is free and affordable, the more we\u2019re able to have those dissenting voices speak up.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s a very powerful point.\u00a0 I\u2019ll give you one other example, Frane, because you\u2019re working on press freedom every single day.\u00a0 One of the things we see from autocratic governance is an effort basically to use lawfare to silence journalists who are just doing their jobs.\u00a0 At this very summit a year ago, one of the initiatives that came out of it was standing up a fund to \u2013 that journalists, media enterprises, particularly small, independent media that usually doesn\u2019t have the resources \u2013 a fund that they can tap into if they\u2019re on the receiving end of bogus legal proceedings that are trying in effect to drive them out of business.\u00a0 That\u2019s just one initiative among many as we look at what is being done and how technology is being used or misused to try to silence voices, whether it\u2019s from media or from civil society or human rights defenders.\u00a0 We\u2019re also looking at what tools can we provide to help them more effectively defend themselves, and that\u2019s just one example.\nJohn Morris from the Internet Society, working on expanding internet access and freedom.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 At the Internet Society, we believe that the internet, the globally \u2013 the open, globally connected, secure, and trustworthy internet is a tremendous enabler of democracy, but increasingly decisions in government \u2013 by governments in democratic countries and non-democratic countries are threatening the internet\u2019s operations and its global nature.\u00a0 So my question is:\u00a0 How can we ensure that governments proactively assess the potential harmful impact on the internet from their policy proposals so that we don\u2019t inadvertently undermine both global speech, global internet access, and democracy worldwide?\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 I think we should stress the importance of the civil society.\u00a0 You have invited three of us; two of them come from the civil society, NGOs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s very important, because it\u2019s true that not every government works in this direction.\u00a0 Some governments do exactly the contrary.\u00a0 So the multilateral fora, the civil \u2013 the organizations from the civil society are called to play a key role in this issue.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, I couldn\u2019t agree more with that.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s imperative on us in government in particular to make sure that we have all of the different stakeholders in on the takeoff, not just on the landing, precisely because we need to make sure that we\u2019re factoring in these different perspectives, precisely because there are inevitably \u2013 to your point \u2013 second- and third-order consequences that we may not see because we\u2019re coming at it from one perspective that we need to be able to identify upfront before it\u2019s too late, and we actually have an effect that is not the one that we wanted to have.\nAnd it goes to a point I was making earlier when I was speaking, and I\u2019ve found this over 30 years in government, particularly when it comes to technology.\u00a0 The pace with which it\u2019s moving is so fast and the relative lack of expertise in government is such that we\u2019re constantly playing\u00a0catch-up, and just understanding \u2013 never mind trying to figure out what is the appropriate rule, norm, regulation that actually makes sense, doesn\u2019t have second- and third-order consequences that we don\u2019t like, that somehow balances the different equities that are in play.\nI think one of the answers to this for me, besides making sure that the stakeholders are at the table from the takeoff, is actually to make sure that in government itself we have more of this expertise and that it\u2019s not only, as important as that is, so-called outside stakeholders that are involved, but within our own institutions we have people who have come up in these disciplines, who bring that perspective to bear, and can make a huge difference in making \u2013 helping us to make policy.\nOne of the things that struck me some years ago in government was so much of what we do actually has a technological or innovative solution as part, at least, of the answer, what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But so many of us again are not coming up in these disciplines, and we need technologists, innovators, civil society, and others in the room, sometimes even just to tell us whether we need technologists, innovators, and civil societies in the room because, again, it\u2019s identifying a problem from the outset that we may not see.\nSo I think it just goes to this point that both of us are making, that unless everyone with an equity, a perspective, an experience on these questions is in on the takeoff, we\u2019re probably not going to have a smooth landing.\nSo we have a few minutes left.\u00a0 One of the things that I know bedevils all of us in different ways is how we think about dealing with disinformation and misinformation that\u2019s in our ecosystems, and to do it in a way that is protective of speech, not destructive of it, and to do it in a way, again, that uses \u2013 truth has now become a subjective word so I hate to use it \u2013 but that brings truth to bear.\nI\u2019m just wondering, from each of your perspectives, if this is something that you\u2019ve had to grapple with, to think about, and whether there are any ideas that you want to surface today in helping us think about it.\u00a0 Just throwing that out there.\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 We need a growing, transparent public discussion.\u00a0 This is the way we should follow to pursue the target.\u00a0 I want to share something with you.\u00a0 In Argentina, we are doing an experiment, an electoral experiment.\u00a0 We have called \u2013 I have mentioned government, civil society, private sector.\u00a0 We have called Facebook and Twitter.\u00a0 And there is a public agreement between the government, the political parties, and these two companies related to the electoral debate in Argentina, for example.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2013 what is the idea?\nThe idea is to guarantee transparency in the discussion, the possibility of having everyone on board, every sector on board, and particularly, I would like to stress, to guarantee a real public debate where everyone has the chance to participate.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s a \u2013 might be a new \u2013 in my country it\u2019s going to be a new tool that will provide a better solution \u2013 situation, sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I think that more conversation is needed.\u00a0 Education, awareness raising among stakeholders, government officials, judiciary.\u00a0 But at the same time, I think keeping an eye that there\u2019s always this tendency from the powerful actors to criminalize this kind of speech, and I think we have to be very, very careful, if governments are making these decisions, how civil society can be part of those conversation.\nAnd I believe that more speech is an answer and not banning the speech.\u00a0 And just want to mention one initiative that I\u2019m also part of is, because misinformation and disinformation has harmed women and girls online, female journalists.\u00a0 It has increased gender \u2013 online gender-based violence.\u00a0 And this global partnership on \u2013 to address tech-facilitated violence which, again, U.S. Government is taking the leading role and other governments are part of it \u2013 I think these are the kind of initiatives that we need more.\nAnd also like-minded governments are part of such kind of partnerships.\u00a0 We need to see how we can bring those governments which are not like-minded and how they are becoming part of these conversation.\u00a0 I think that that\u2019s much needed.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR OPEKE:\u00a0 Well, I think what you have are that the most powerful and motivated and the authoritarian voices then try to crowd people out and feed a lot of this misinformation.\u00a0 So I also agree that more conversation is required, but more \u2013 the broadening of access so that the advantage some of these people have in weaponizing, in being the loudest and the \u2013 sometimes the only voices or the strongest voices in the room, can be crowded out by broader sections of society.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Please.\nMS DAD:\u00a0 Secretary, can I just \u2013 like just one last thing.\u00a0 I really want to commend the executive order that has been issued by the President Biden to ban spyware which violates human rights.\u00a0 And I would like to acknowledge that civil society has been doing a lot of work for years around this issue.\u00a0 And I think you guys have set a really good precedent for other governments, and we would like to see this kind of decision coming from other Western democracies and then hopefully from other regimes as well.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, you just heard it, so thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe are predictably out of time.\u00a0 I just want to see if anyone has any last things that they want to say, put on the table, that they didn\u2019t get a chance to say.\u00a0 Ambassador, anything?\nAMBASSADOR ARG\u00dcELLO:\u00a0 I just want to thank you again.\u00a0 This is the way.\u00a0 This is the direction we should work on.\u00a0 So I want you to know that we will try to reproduce this scenario in our country following what you\u2019re doing here today.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Anything?\nMS DAD:\u00a0 I just want to say empower civil society.\u00a0 Give them resources.\u00a0 Make them part of these conversations in proper spirit.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s it.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good way to conclude.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you. (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-on-advancing-technology-for-democracy/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken on Advancing Technology for Democracy\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Washington Convention Center", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "March 30, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Jeanne, thank you so much for the introduction and for helping to move us along today.\nAnd I really want to first extend a very warm welcome to everyone who is here as well as to the many who are joining us online.\nNot long after its invention, Thomas Edison said of electricity: \u201cIt holds the secrets that will reorganize the life of the world.\u201d\nToday, we are again living through a time when technology is reorganizing the life of the world, the world that we all share.\u00a0 Every country \u2013 no matter its form of government, no matter its geography, no matter its size or power \u2013 is being transformed by new and evolving tools from biotechnology altering the building blocks of life, to artificial intelligence changing the production of knowledge, to the devices that we\u2019ve all got in our pockets redefining how we relate to each other as human beings.\nThe test we face as democracies is how we can shape this transformation in a way that maximizes its promise, that minimizes its dangers, and reinforces our core values.\nSo, today, what I wanted to do kick us off is to set out a few of the ways that we\u2019re working to try to meet this test, working together in government, with partners in the private sector and civil society \u2013 a test that as we meet it today, I think will do much to shape many, many years to come.\nPresident Biden likes to say that in many ways we\u2019re at an inflection point where the decisions that we\u2019re making now in the next few years are likely to shape the next decades.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of those moments that comes along every few generations where we\u2019re really at a point of inflection and our actions are going to make a big difference.\nSo first, we are focused on using technology to try to make our democracies a little bit healthier, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more inclusive.\u00a0 We\u2019re building on democracy\u2019s core strengths \u2013 our openness, our transparency, our adaptability, and the faith that we place in our citizens to make the system work better, to actually deliver results.\nJust a few examples of how governments here are using technology to shore up the foundations of democracy, to strengthen its institutions in ways that actually deliver results for people.\nIn the Maldives recently they introduced video technology that allows people to participate virtually in court hearings, freeing up time for judges, reducing costs for citizens.\nIn Estonia, as many of you know, citizens can go online to do everything from registering a new business, to paying their taxes, to requesting refills of medical prescriptions all within minutes.\nAfter Malaysia adopted legislation lowering the voting age from 21 to 18, the government was able to automatically register people online who were newly eligible to vote.\u00a0 Participation in elections shot up 25 percent, giving voice to more than 3 million additional voters.\nAnd of course, it\u2019s not just governments that are using digital tools to improve people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 Transparency advocates are creating open databases that allow members of the public to identify corruption in public works projects.\u00a0 Epidemiologists and researchers are sharing data to accelerate our understanding of deadly viruses and the creation of safe, effective vaccines.\u00a0 Climate scientists are using predictive models to help farmers make better decisions about when and where to plant, increasing agricultural productivity, reducing hunger.\nAcross these efforts, we\u2019re working to make sure that all people have access to digital tools and their benefits because one of the things that history teaches us is that leaps in technology too often deepen instead of diminishing inequities in our societies.\u00a0 And we have to have that constantly in mind as we look at how we\u2019re adapting and shaping the technologies of our time.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re making investments at home and around the world to try to close some of the digital divides \u2013 whether on gender, nationality, race, disability, geography, income, or any other factor \u2013 that perpetuate a lack of access to opportunity for underserved groups and underserved communities.\nHere in the United States to take one example, as many of you know, we passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that dedicates $65 billion to ensuring that everyone in our country has access to reliable, affordable high-speed internet \u2013 rural, suburban, urban; low, middle, high-income.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already helped millions of lower-income Americans and their households pay their internet bills, because as President Biden says, high-speed connectivity is no longer a luxury; it\u2019s a necessity.\nAnd we\u2019re helping partners around the world broaden access too, like the more than $260 million in financing the United States is providing to help upgrade infrastructure in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\u00a0 Rio is in the process of installing 5,000 public Wi-Fi access points, as well as public lighting systems that cut electricity consumption by up to 60 percent, while also lowering costs and cutting their emissions.\u00a0 And three-quarters of these investments will be made in neighborhoods where people live below the city\u2019s average income level.\nSecond, we\u2019re working with partners to update and establish as necessary rules and norms, so that technology is developed and used in ways that reflect our democratic values and interests.\nThat includes for old technologies, like the internet.\u00a0 We\u2019ve long promoted an open, interoperable, secure, reliable internet \u2013 principles that created the conditions for the internet to grow into a dynamic force for learning, for connection, for economic opportunity.\nBut everyone in this room knows, and colleagues who are joining us online know, that the internet is also growing more closed, more insecure, more siloed by the day.\u00a0 More countries are putting up firewalls and shutting down access, using the internet to try to control speech, quash dissent, spread misinformation and disinformation.\nSo we are using all the tools in our kit \u2013 from software to hardware, from trade to diplomacy \u2013 to defend our longstanding vision and stand against these and other threats.\u00a0 A year ago, we launched the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.\u00a0 It reaffirms our commitment to a single, open \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d that respects democratic principles and human rights.\u00a0 To date, more than 65 partners and counting have joined us in making this pledge \u2013 and taking action to make that pledge real.\nWe also recognize that we have to do better at addressing some of the risks that come with the open internet.\u00a0 People have important concerns about how platforms collect, exploit, and share our personal data, fan the flames of polarization and extremism, endanger women and girls, children, LGBTQI+ people, and other vulnerable groups.\nTackling these and other issues requires a delicate balance of the principles at the heart of our vision \u2013 such as between openness and security, between protecting speech and preventing incitement, between fostering innovation and limiting the power of Big Tech.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s more than obvious to say we do not yet have all the answers.\u00a0 We\u2019re all working on them, thinking about them, struggling with them.\u00a0 But we have to engage this.\nOur people and increasingly our companies are looking to democratic governments to help establish limits for how platforms can collect, use, and share citizens\u2019 personal data.\u00a0 We have heard that message.\nThat\u2019s why, in addition to using his authority to address these issues, President Biden has been urging Congress to pass strong bipartisan legislation to protect Americans\u2019 privacy.\u00a0 The President has also made clear that we need to be able to hold platforms accountable when they fail to address the harms caused by their technology, from the content they spread to the algorithms that they use.\nIt\u2019s also why we\u2019re stepping up to shape the rules and guidelines around emerging digital tools, like artificial intelligence.\nThe rollout of AI chatbots in recent months has demonstrated how quickly this technology is evolving, how big of an impact it\u2019s going to have on each of our lives.\u00a0 In October, we put out a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \u2013 five principles to try to guide the way we design, use, deploy automated systems in ways that protect our people and defend our democratic values.\nThese include the principle that people should be protected from unsafe or ineffective AI; that people should know when an automated system is being used and understand how it affects them.\nWe\u2019ve also developed a risk management framework to give individuals, organizations, and societies practical guidance on how to measure and manage the risks of automated systems, and make AI that\u2019s safe, that\u2019s accountable, that\u2019s fair, that protects privacy.\nThese principles and guidelines aren\u2019t meant to be the final word in navigating the extraordinary complexities around AI and other emerging tools.\u00a0 We know the technology is changing too fast for that.\u00a0 And speaking as someone who\u2019s in government \u2013 and again, you all know this, many from experience \u2013 government is constantly playing catch-up when it comes to technology.\u00a0 And at a time when things seem to be evolving more quickly than ever before, that game of catch-up is even more intense than ever before.\u00a0 But we have to find ways to create guardrails that will continue to strengthen and improve \u2013 that we\u2019ll continue to strengthen and improve on together with partners.\nThird big piece:\u00a0 We\u2019re doubling down on investing in democracies\u2019 ability to lead on technological innovation. Our ability to shape the digital landscape depends in significant part on maintaining our competitive edge in innovation.\u00a0 Democracies\u2019 free flow of ideas and information gives us a built-in advantage, but we can\u2019t take our own dynamism for granted.\u00a0 We have to continue to find ways to foster it, to catalyze it, to support it, to encourage it.\nAnd that\u2019s the basic idea behind the historic investment that President Biden and Congress have made through the CHIPS and Science Act, through the Inflation Reduction Act, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\u00a0 It\u2019s the biggest investment America has made in generations in revitalizing key industries, recharging our manufacturing base, leading the global energy transition,\u00a0and boosting basic research \u2013 something we\u2019ve gotten away from in recent decades \u2013 while also bolstering the resilience and security of the supply chains that underpin every single one of these efforts.\nAnd we\u2019re not just investing here at home.\u00a0 We\u2019re laying the foundation for innovation in democracies around the world, because leaps in rights-affirming and privacy-respecting technologies don\u2019t just benefit the countries where they\u2019re invented; they are good for people everywhere.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind the pledge we made at the recent Africa Leaders Summit right here in this Convention Center to dedicate more than $350 million toward digital transformation in African countries, which will unlock catalytic investments from the private sector on the continent.\nWe\u2019re urging allies and partners to make these investments too, because our collective competitiveness depends on it.\u00a0 And democracies are answering the call, such as the G7\u2019s unprecedented commitment to spend tens of billions of dollars on tech infrastructure around the globe in the coming years.\nFourth, we are pushing back vigorously on authoritarian governments\u2019 increasing use of technology to abuse human rights and undermine democracy.\nThat starts with shoring up our resilience against efforts by autocratic governments to sow distrust in democracy, to weaken our institutions, to reach across borders to target people in our countries.\nA key part of that is countering the disinformation and misinformation that authoritarian governments spread to polarize our societies.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that not only by exposing lies and manipulations, but by disseminating the truth through individuals, networks, independent media that local communities trust.\nWe\u2019re taking steps to protect the security of our citizens\u2019 data from authoritarian governments, particularly those with a track record of gathering such information to profile our people, to target those that they see as critics, to steal intellectual property.\u00a0 Protecting this information is also vital to preventing these governments from exploiting platforms to shape what our citizens see online.\nWe\u2019re working to thwart the efforts of autocrats to use technology to repress people within as well as beyond their borders.\nTogether with 35 fellow governments in the Freedom Online Coalition, we led an effort to develop a set of guiding principles to encourage the responsible use of surveillance technology, to prevent its misuse by bad actors, such as targeting people based solely on their race, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, political views, or any other classification that is protected by international law.\nWe\u2019re taking immediate steps to translate these principles into practice.\u00a0 Just this week, President Biden issued an executive order that bans the U.S. Government\u2019s use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our national security or that has been misused by foreign actors to abuse human rights.\nAnd we\u2019re working to help people living under repressive regimes get access to digital tools, including the uncensored internet.\u00a0 Last September, when the killing of Mahsa Amini by Iran\u2019s security forces sparked months of massive protests, the regime cracked down viciously \u2013 killing hundreds of people, imprisoning tens of thousands more, and routinely shutting down the internet.\nIn response, we teamed up with companies and civil society groups to help provide the Iranian people with ongoing access to the internet and other vital communications tools so they could continue to communicate with one another and with the outside world and shine a spotlight on the regime\u2019s abuses.\nNew reforms that we rolled out this week will make it easier for our government to provide similar support for people who are facing digital crackdowns in other countries.\nIt\u2019s not just Iran where the private sector and civil society are working with democratic governments to push back against digital authoritarianism.\u00a0 Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of last year, businesses and citizens from the United States and other democracies have been on the front lines helping Ukraine defend its independence, its right to exist, its very democracy.\u00a0 These volunteers have helped maintain connectivity for Ukrainian Government institutions and citizens, despite the relentless attacks, providing the Ukrainian Government with free access to a secure cloud to store sensitive national databases, helping to counter Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaigns on social media.\nCompanies and citizens from democracies have come forward because they believe technology should be used to affirm people\u2019s rights, not abuse them; and that it should empower people to define their own path, not allow others to use coercion and violence to choose that path for them.\nThis brings me to a final point that I want to leave you with, and it\u2019s the reason that ultimately we feel optimistic about democracies\u2019 ability to deliver in a period where technology is once again \u2013 as during Thomas Edison\u2019s lifetime \u2013 reorganizing the life of the world.\nFor all of the challenges that these disruptive technologies present, no system of government is better equipped to drive the forces that they represent in improving our people\u2019s lives than democracy.\nWe excel at innovation.\u00a0 We\u2019re nimble.\nWe encourage a multiplicity of voices and perspectives to find solutions.\nWe let the best ideas rise to the top, rather than assuming that the best ideas come from the top.\nWe believe our people have a vital role to play in the ongoing process of making our system better, of fixing its flaws.\nWe embrace vigorous and open debate within and across our democracies.\nAnd while we democracies may not be perfectly aligned \u2013 we may not agree on everything, on how to proceed, we don\u2019t try to be.\u00a0 Our willingness to try out different approaches \u2013 openly,\u00a0 transparently \u2013 lets us learn from one another, lets us adapt, lets us improve.\nIndeed, on all four of the priorities that I\u2019ve set out today \u2013 using technology to improve our people\u2019s lives in tangible ways, establishing rights-respecting rules for emerging technologies, investing in our innovation, and countering authoritarian governments\u2019 use of digital tools to abuse people and weaken democracies \u2013 on every single one of those lines of effort, our success ultimately depends on working effectively together.\nTo pass the test, we have to continue to build and broaden coalitions of allies and partners who share our democratic values, who are committed to putting them at the heart of our shared technological future.\u00a0 Whether they\u2019re in government or civil society, whether they\u2019re innovators or regulators, academics or activists, or simply citizens \u2013 we\u2019re counting on them, we\u2019re counting on you, to be part of this collective effort.\nAnd in fact, that\u2019s exactly what we see in the group gathered at the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what gives us confidence that our democracies will not only survive a truly unprecedented period of technological transformation, but \u2013 but \u2013 shape it to the benefit of our people and to people around the world.\nThanks so much for being here.\u00a0 Thanks so much for taking part in the summit, and I\u2019m now looking forward to a conversation with some colleagues.\u00a0 Thanks very much, everyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-opening-remarks-at-the-u-s-mexico-synthetic-drug-conference/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken Opening Remarks at the U.S.-Mexico Synthetic Drug Conference\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "date": "March 29, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHello, everyone.\nI\u2019m glad to join the U.S.-Mexico Synthetic Drug Conference.\nTo our Ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, and our Assistant Secretary Todd Robinson: Thank you for your commitment to making people safer and healthier on both sides of the border.\nAnd to our partners in the Mexican government, particularly Foreign Secretary Ebrard: Thank you for your leadership on this critical priority.\nToday, this group has gathered to discuss one of the most important challenges facing our people: illicit synthetic drugs.\nWe\u2019re all too familiar with the statistics.\nIn the United States, fentanyl is the leading cause of death among people between 18 and 49 years old. In 2021, we lost more than 100,000 Americans to drug overdoses; 70 percent of those were from synthetic opioids like fentanyl. And synthetic drugs are threatening lives around the world, including in Mexico.\nSynthetic drugs are easier to make, transport, and sell than plant-based drugs. They\u2019re more potent and dangerous. And they pose an extraordinary risk to our populations.\nPresident Biden is committed to ending this deadly epidemic. Our Administration has allocated over $24 billion in the last year to strengthen public health interventions, and expanded access to treatment, prevention, and recovery tools, including naloxone and fentanyl testing strips, which can help reduce overdose deaths. We\u2019re also working to target and disrupt trafficking networks in the United States, and arrest those who seek to profit off this epidemic.\nBut no one country or government can stop the spread of synthetic drugs alone. This is a shared problem, with shared responsibility.\nThat\u2019s why the United States is working closely with other governments \u2013 together with public health experts, doctors, business leaders, and law enforcement officials \u2013 to tackle this transnational challenge.\nMexico is one of our closest partners in this fight.\nToday, our nations are updating and adapting our long-standing partnership on transnational narcotics challenges, working to forge a comprehensive, agile, and effective approach to synthetic drugs.\nUnder President Biden and President Lopez Obrador, the United States and Mexico are acting to disrupt illicit supply chains and curb the production and distribution of legal chemicals used to make drugs, including through exchanges of forensic scientists.\nWe\u2019re targeting organized crime and drug traffickers, and intercepting drug shipments. In the last year alone, we used U.S. technology to seize over 1.3 million fentanyl pills together, \u00a0at borders, ports, and other checkpoints. And that\u2019s on top of the work our countries did individually to get drugs off our streets.\nOur countries are improving early warning systems, to track emerging drugs before they spread through our communities.\nWe\u2019re also working to prevent and treat addition, promote public health, and build safer communities, with the United States sharing what we\u2019ve learned to support Mexico\u2019s efforts.\nMexico and the United States are also working with other countries to address this crisis. Earlier this month at a G20 Ministerial, for the first time, the world\u2019s leading economies called for strong, international cooperation against illicit synthetic drugs: recognizing that this is a global health and security threat that requires the full force of our combined efforts.\nTo build on this cross-border collaboration, the U.S. and Canada committed to build a new global coalition against synthetic drugs. This coalition will launch this summer and bring together countries from around the world to develop and implement solutions to this crisis, from supporting public health measures, to growing our partnerships with the private sector. For example, we can help prevent the diversion of licit precursors into the illicit production of synthetic opioids through better information sharing, labeling, and \u201cknow your customer\u201d programs. I encourage countries who are interested in participating to get involved.\nSo much is at stake: The countless lives that can still be saved. Children who can still grow up with their parents. Communities that can remain whole.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s at the heart of our conference this week. And I\u2019m grateful to each of you participating, for contributing your expertise and leadership to help protect our people.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-status-of-women-is-the-status-of-democracy-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the State Department and welcome to the second Summit for Democracy.\nJen, to you for your remarkable leadership at the White House Gender Policy Council; to Kat, for yours here at the State Department on Global Women\u2019s Issues:\u00a0 We could not have a better team, a more dynamic duo, leading our efforts.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful to each of you every day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019re joined in-person and virtually by government leaders from around the world, as well as partners from across the United States Government, multilateral organizations, civil society.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for all the work that you\u2019ve doing every single day to advance women\u2019s equality and thereby advance democracy.\u00a0 These two things are inexorably linked, as you\u2019ve already heard.\nThe President has long believed that democracies are strengthened by the active participation of all citizens, particularly women and girls.\u00a0 And since day one, he\u2019s made advancing women\u2019s and girls\u2019 civic and political engagement a top priority of this administration.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re kicking off this session as one of the summit\u2019s first events \u2013 because the status of women is indeed the status of democracy.\nWe all know in this room and everyone who\u2019s listening in the rights of women in many parts of the world are under threat and under attack.\u00a0 Repressive governments are passing targeted laws to restrict women\u2019s fundamental freedoms, including the right to free speech and assembly.\u00a0 Extremist actors are disproportionately targeting women and girls, especially those from historically marginalized identities like LGBTQI+ people, women from racial, ethnic, and religious communities.\nBut it\u2019s not just in autocracies that women are being denied their full and equal rights.\u00a0 In far too many parts of the world, women and girls still do not have equal opportunities to study and work.\u00a0 Women journalists, advocates, politicians, and others are subject to persistent online harassment and abuse.\u00a0 Women who are victims of violence often do not have equal access to justice.\u00a0 Women are subject to discrimination that often puts them at a disadvantage \u2013 whether through double standards they face in the workplace, in access to reproductive rights, or in nationality laws, which can result in barriers to accessing education, health care, and property for themselves and for their families.\nBut, in the face of these forces, women and girls are leading the charge for their rights and for human rights and democracy around the world.\u00a0 And they\u2019re demonstrating the importance of having women at the decision-making table.\nIn Afghanistan \u2013 in the face of the Taliban\u2019s daily efforts to erase them from daily life \u2013 women are still protesting.\u00a0 They\u2019re still finding ways to document human rights abuses.\u00a0 They are still fighting for a brighter future for their country.\nIn Iran, courageous women are marching in the streets, under great threat to themselves, to call for \u201cwoman, life, and freedom.\u201d\nThe United States stands in solidarity with these women and all who are working for women\u2019s full, free, and equal participation around the world.\u00a0 Through our diplomacy, we\u2019re committed to supporting them and advancing gender equality worldwide.\nAt the last Summit for Democracy, the United States launched our \u201cSupport Her Empowerment \u2013 Women\u2019s Inclusion in New Security,\u201d or \u201cSHE WINS,\u201d as the acronym appropriately has it.\u00a0 This initiative, which supports local women and women-led civil society organizations \u2013 we\u2019re working to increase women\u2019s political and civic participation in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Papua New Guinea, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.\nIn partnership with Denmark, we\u2019ve also been leading the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse, a coalition of 12 countries focused on countering technology-facilitated gender-based violence.\nSoon, you\u2019ll be hearing from leaders like Phumzile Van Damme, a former parliamentarian in South Africa who shared her experiences as a target of online harassment \u2013 and who now works to combat this scourge, including as part of the Advisory Group to the Global Partnership.\nWe\u2019re heartened by the Global Partnership\u2019s initial progress over the past year.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen some member countries increase resources to combatting this issue at home, including by providing more trainings for those in the legal and justice systems, as well as for advocates working with survivors of online harassment.\u00a0 And it is so vitally important that their voices be heard and fully inform our efforts.\u00a0 Others are beginning to collect data to better measure online abuse and its effects.\u00a0 And as a whole, the Global Partnership has worked to build consensus on shared principles to better identify, prevent, and combat this urgent issue at venues from the G7 to the United Nations.\nSo today we have an opportunity to recognize some of these successes, but also \u2013 also \u2013 to recommit to the work that lies ahead in advancing gender equality.\nWhen we succeed, we not only do the right thing, but we also do the smart and necessary thing to make our countries more prosperous, to make them more secure, to make them a little bit more full of opportunity for all of our people.\u00a0 With the group that\u2019s assembled here, we\u2019ve got everything we need to continue making progress toward what is for us an absolutely essential goal.\nSo to each of you who is here today, to each of you who is listening in, thank you again for what you\u2019re doing every single day to advance this agenda.\u00a0 And thank you for helping us kick off the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 Again, what we\u2019re doing here today, what we\u2019ll be doing for the next few days, these are fully joined.\u00a0 And I can think of no more appropriate, no more important way, to kick off the summit than with all of you here today.\nSo welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking forward to some great discussions.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

everyone.\u00a0 Thank you all so much for joining.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to be with friends and partners from around the world as we prepare to open the second Summit for Democracy.\nIn his first year in office, President Biden launched the summit to look at the future of democracy, which we see is at an inflection point.\u00a0 Worldwide, we see autocrats violating human rights and suppressing fundamental freedoms; corrupting \u2013 and with corruption eating away at young people\u2019s faith in their future; citizens questioning whether democracy can still deliver on the issues that matter most to their lives and to their livelihoods.\nAnd we see authoritarian regimes reaching beyond their borders to coerce free and open societies through increasingly aggressive, revisionist foreign policies.\u00a0 Nothing illustrates the gravity of that threat more than Russia\u2019s brutal and unjustified war against Ukraine.\nIn February 2022, President Putin launched a full-scale war against the people of Ukraine: attempting to conquer their country, topple their democratically elected government, redraw their borders.\u00a0 Indeed, President Putin\u2019s overall objective was to erase Ukraine\u2019s identity as an independent, sovereign nation and absorb it into Russia.\nThis war is an attack not only on Ukraine, but on the international rules-based order that seeks to defend international peace and stability, and uphold, in the words of the United Nations Charter, \u201cthe equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.\u201d\nAnd as this group very well knows, the victims of Russia\u2019s aggression are not only Ukrainians but people all around the world.\u00a0 The Kremlin\u2019s war has exacerbated acute food insecurity, already at crisis levels due to COVID-19, climate change, and other conflicts, putting millions at risk.\u00a0 It pushed up the price of fertilizer, fuel, and food, making it harder for families in every part of the world to make ends meet.\nThe world has come together on multiple occasions at the United Nations General Assembly to condemn Russia\u2019s aggression and the atrocities that have come with it.\u00a0 Countries from the North and South, developed and developing, established and emerging democracies, have all called on Russia to end this war and pursue a just and durable peace in Ukraine.\nThe United States is committed to supporting meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve this.\nWe all know that for peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence.\u00a0 And for peace to be durable, it must ensure that Russia can\u2019t simply rest and refit its troops, and then relaunch the war at a time more advantageous to it.\nUkraine, under President Zelenskyy, has put forward a proposal that would forge such a peace.\u00a0 It would end the war and save countless lives.\u00a0 It would restore Ukraine\u2019s territory and respect its democracy.\u00a0 It would reconstruct the country and the economy.\u00a0 It would ensure that \u2013 radiation and nuclear safety.\u00a0 It would uphold the UN Charter and the will of the international community.\u00a0 And it would come to the aid of the millions around the world that have been affected by Russia\u2019s aggression.\nLast December, President Biden hosted President Zelenskyy at the White House, where they discussed Ukraine\u2019s peace formula.\u00a0 And today, we welcome fellow democracies who are standing with Ukraine on the path to a just and durable peace, because Ukraine\u2019s future and the future of the international order on which peace and security depend, that is what is at stake.\nSo that\u2019s why we\u2019ve come together today, and I really appreciate everyone joining.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very honored to have my friend, our colleague Foreign Minister Kuleba here to discuss Ukraine\u2019s peace plan.\u00a0 Dmytro, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Dear Secretary, dear colleagues, dear friends, excellencies, President Zelenskyy has asked me to convey his apologies for not being able to join you today.\u00a0 As you may have seen on the news, he is visiting regions of Ukraine bordering the front line and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.\u00a0 So I am grateful to you, Tony, for convening this important meeting that allows me to present President Zelenskyy\u2019s and Ukraine\u2019s vision for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.\nFirst of all, I applaud the United States for taking the lead around the world in defending democracy.\u00a0 This year\u2019s summit is vital, for democracy faces existential threats.\u00a0 Nowhere is this more acutely felt than in Ukraine.\u00a0 Although Russia seeks to destroy Ukraine, its aggression is not only about Ukraine.\u00a0 Russia also aims to destroy the world order based on international law and the UN Charter.\nFor more than nine years, our best sons and daughters have not only been fighting for their future, but also defending our common democratic values at the cost of their lives.\u00a0 In this fight, we are defending the entire democratic world.\u00a0 No other nation wants peace more than Ukraine, but peace at any cost is an illusion.\u00a0 For peace to be a lasting one, it needs to be just.\nThe cessation of Russia\u2019s aggression and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity are essential conditions for peace.\u00a0 Ill-advised concessions to the aggressor would only encourage Russia to intensify its attacks on democracy, giving it times to rebuild its military capabilities and resume the armed offensive against Ukraine.\u00a0 We need a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, and we know how to get that.\nTo that end, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as you are all well aware, presented our peace formula.\u00a0 This initiative is a clear plan of action that should not only bring peace to Ukraine but also restore the world order based on the norms and principles of international law.\u00a0 We notice that other nations are also putting forth their own initiatives.\u00a0 We appreciate their focus on a problem that jeopardizes global security.\u00a0 However, I would like to emphasize that the Ukrainian people will accept peace only if it guarantees the cessation of Russian aggression in full, the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, and the restoration of our state\u2019s territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders.\nUkraine\u2019s peace formula contains all of these just conditions for ending the war.\u00a0 Our peace plan has already been recognized and approved, including during the vote on the UNGA resolution, \u201cPrinciple of the United Nations Charter Underlying a Comprehensive, Just, and Lasting Peace in Ukraine\u201d end of quote.\u00a0 The resolution, which reflects many key points of the peace formula, was approved by 141 countries.\u00a0 The Group of 7 welcomed and supported Ukraine\u2019s efforts to advance the peace formula\u2019s vision of a comprehensive, just, and enduring peace.\u00a0 The European Union has endorsed the Ukrainian initiative.\u00a0 The same stance is taken in bilateral agreements with our partners.\nI am deeply grateful to the countries that have already stated their willingness to participate in the implementation of the peace formula.\u00a0 We are confident that by working together we will restore justice, protect democratic values, and restore respect for the UN Charter\u2019s principle.\u00a0 We want to involve as many countries as possible; we count on your help in this.\u00a0 And I believe that every democracy has to contribute to this cause.\nToday I will briefly reflect on some of the formula\u2019s details.\u00a0 The peace formula consists of 10 points that can be implemented one at a time or simultaneously.\u00a0 Their implementation should bring long-awaited peace to Ukraine and guarantee security to the whole world.\nThe formula\u2019s first point is about radiation and nuclear safety.\u00a0 Russia has resorted to nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats, which is completely unacceptable.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s military forces continue to occupy Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, preventing its employees from performing their duties effectively.\u00a0 Only by returning full control of the facility to Ukraine can this be stopped.\u00a0 Russia must withdraw its troops from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and cease its reckless and dangerous threats.\u00a0 The aggressor must follow the terms of the Budapest Memorandum, which guaranteed Russia\u2019s non-use of force, including nuclear weapons, in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s voluntary nuclear disarmament.\nThe formula\u2019s second component is food security.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s aggressive war is destroying global food supply chains.\u00a0 We are grateful to T\u00fcrkiye, the UN, and other partners for their assistance in implementing the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 It enables the distribution of grain to those in greatest needs.\u00a0 However, the problem is not completely resolved, and will not be resolved until Russia ends its naval blockade of Ukrainian ports and attacks on critical infrastructure.\u00a0 The Black Sea Grain Initiative should be expanded and continued to reduce the threat, and freedom of navigation in the Black Sea should eliminate it.\nEnergy Security is the formula\u2019s third element.\u00a0 And I would like to take this opportunity, Secretary, to thank you particularly, and also our French colleague, Catherine, and (inaudible), for organizing important meetings which boosted support for Ukraine\u2019s energy sector during the darkest months of winter.\u00a0 And I also take this opportunity to thank everyone who contributed to these efforts to help Ukraine with transformers, generators, and other equipment to survive winter.\nThe release of prisoners and deportees is the fourth component of the formula.\u00a0 Modern Russia is characterized by inhuman prison conditions, the unlawful deprivation of civil liberties, kidnapping, and forced deportation of children.\u00a0 We demand the immediate release of all Ukrainian political prisoners, war prisoners, and people who have been wrongfully detained, as well as the repatriation of those who have been deported both from Russian territory and from the temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories.\nThe fifth point of the formula is the implementation of the UN Charter and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have to dwell too much on that; we all understand what this point is about.\nThe formula\u2019s sixth point is the withdrawal of Russian troops and the cessation of hostilities.\u00a0 I want to be clear:\u00a0 Russia has to withdraw from every square meter of Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 There should be no misinterpretation of what the word \u201cwithdrawal\u201d implies.\nThe formula\u2019s seventh point is the restoration of justice.\u00a0 Let me stop here and give you a couple of details.\u00a0 The aggressor must pay for all damages caused to Ukraine.\u00a0 It is critical to establish an international compensation mechanism for Russia\u2019s payment of reparations.\u00a0 However, not all losses are recoverable.\u00a0 Nobody will be able to bring the victims of Russia\u2019s barbaric invasion back to life.\u00a0 Aggression is accompanied by heinous crimes, as evidenced by the murders in Bucha and Irpin, as well as the Russian torture chambers in Kherson and Izium.\u00a0 The exact number of civilian Ukrainians killed in Mariupol is unknown, but it is believed to be in the tens of thousands.\nThe responsibility for this lies not only with the Russian Federation\u2019s political and military leadership, but also with the ordinary executors.\u00a0 The memory of the innocent victims demands that all those responsible for these atrocities face just punishment.\u00a0 By issuing an arrest warrant for Putin, international justice has already given a proper assessment of his crimes.\u00a0 A special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine\u2019s effective work should further restore faith in justice.\nThe formulas eighth point is ecological security.\u00a0 And again, I think the damage \u2013 the damage inflicted on Ukraine\u2019s environment is uncomprehensible, and we have to focus our efforts on bringing responsible to account.\nThe ninth point of the formula is the prevention of war escalation and the repetition of aggression.\nAnd finally, the tenth point, the formula\u2019s tenth point, is confirmation of the end of the war.\nThese are very simple 10 points; they all make sense.\u00a0 And they have to be implemented, and we have to be united in ensuring that this formula is taken as the basis for the settlement.\u00a0 But the international community has always shown that it will not tolerate an insult to the principle \u2013 an insult to the principles of the UN Charter.\u00a0 And I therefore urge all countries to reaffirm their resolve and join efforts to put Ukraine\u2019s peace formula into action.\u00a0 Each country \u2013 I emphasize each country \u2013 can contribute to the cause of peace by participating in the implementation of specific points on \u2013 of this peace formula.\nThank you very much for your attention.\u00a0 And thank you for giving us this opportunity to highlight the peace formula by Ukraine.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Dmytro, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Thank you for walking us through it.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s very important, and it also underscores a couple of things.\nOne, I think we all have to be very much aware and beware of what may seem to be well-intentioned efforts, for example, to call for cease fires, which would potentially have the effect of freezing in place the conflict, allowing Russia to consolidate the gains that it\u2019s made, and simply use the time to rest and refit and then re-attack.\u00a0 And so what seems to be appealing on the surface \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t want the guns to be silent \u2013 can also be a very cynical trap that we have to be very, very careful of.\nAnd of course, I think it\u2019s safe to say, Dmytro, that no one wants peace more than the Ukrainian people because they\u2019re the ones who are suffering directly from its absence and from this aggression.\u00a0 But it has to be just and it has to be durable; otherwise, it\u2019s ultimately for naught.\nI\u2019d like to take the opportunity to just go around and hear from colleagues.\u00a0 Catherine, I know you have \u2013 you have another obligation.\u00a0 So I want to turn to you first and just get any reflections that you may have.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, colleagues, excellencies.\u00a0 Let me switch to French, if I may.\n(Via interpreter) First of all, I would like to thank the Secretary of State of organizing this meeting on the margins of the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 Thank you, Antony, and also applaud Dmytro\u2019s participation.\u00a0 And I would like to reiterate our full support to Ukraine for its freedom, its sovereignty, for its territorial integrity, for its security.\u00a0 Ukraine is also fighting for us and for our own security.\u00a0 Your resistance, your courage make us proud.\u00a0 To our Ukrainian friends, you know that you can count on France\u2019s support and that of the European Union.\nFor more than one year, Russian is waging a war of aggression, an illegal war, non-provoked, unjustified, unjustifiable.\u00a0 It is also conducting a war against the principle and values that we all share, against the rules to which we are all attached, first among which the Charter of the United Nations, international human rights and laws, and international law in general.\u00a0 We are not talking about Western values; we are talking about the common rules around the world.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also about respect for human dignity, everything that underscores the universal human rights.\nDmytro mentioned the meeting that we organized in Paris on December 13th.\u00a0 I would like to make reference to what we\u2019re able to do together, Dmytro, during the meeting of the Human Rights Council, which was organized in Geneva on February 27th.\u00a0 And there, we were able to organize an event that brought together more than 50 countries to condemn the Russian crimes, which are representative of war crimes and clearly war crimes against mankind.\u00a0 We all saw these images, these horrible images of civilians executed, massacred, violated, children deported.\u00a0 So at the Security Council in September, we were all together \u2013 I said it again at the Human Rights Council, I said it again at the G20 and at other opportunities; I\u2019m saying it again, once again:\u00a0 There will no \u2013 be no durable peace without justice.\u00a0 Justice must prevail.\u00a0 This is why the issuance by the International Criminal Court of two arrest warrants against Mr. Putin and Mr. Belova[1]\u00a0represents a major step in the collective fight that we\u2019re conducting against impunity.\u00a0 And I would like to call the party states to the Statutes of Rome to respect their international obligations in this respect.\nI also call upon the European Council to work now to strengthen the protection of children in Ukraine.\u00a0 We must do everything we can, starting by documenting human rights violations committed by the Russian troops against these children, including forced transfers and deportations.\u00a0 So to refuse Russia\u2019s victory, that does not mean that we want the victory of the West against the East or the North against the South.\u00a0 It is important to break these misrepresentations.\u00a0 These are lies.\u00a0 It is simply refusing that force should prevail over law.\u00a0 It\u2019s refusing the denial of the most fundamental laws and rules of international law, those which allow us to live in peace and stability.\u00a0 So we will not allow Russia to win; the stakes are much too high.\u00a0 Let\u2019s be united and let\u2019s move again together.\n(Inaudible) in France, as you know, so thank you for giving me the floor early.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Merci beaucoup.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci beaucoup \u2013 merci,\u00a0Catherine.\u00a0 Thank you, Catherine, very much.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to turn now to Jan, Jan Lipavsky for \u2013 from the Czech Republic.\u00a0 Jan, over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LIPAVSKY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Tony.\u00a0 Dear Dmytro, dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019m pleased that we have a chance to discuss this key issue right at the beginning of the summit.\u00a0 The Russian war against Ukraine has already taken too many lives and destroyed too many homes of innocent people.\u00a0 We all are desperately looking for peace.\u00a0 We all but one man wish to see the end of this war.\u00a0 The man is Vladimir Putin, and the International Criminal Court has finally charged him with war crimes and issued an arrest warrant against him.\nI\u2019ve heard a lot of comments suggesting that he will never appear before the ICC or special tribunal for prosecution of crimes of aggression, the establishment of which Czechia strongly advocates.\u00a0 I have also heard many voices suggesting that Ukraine will not have enough strength and capabilities to fully restore its territorial integrity; that it\u2019s not possible or that it\u2019s too risky and too dangerous to try to liberate Crimea; that Vladimir Putin will not give up the peninsula, that he will not give up Ukraine, which he so arrogantly claims he\u2019s entitled to; that the U.S., the European Union, and the West cannot sustain the long-term military and financial support of Ukraine because of our economic burdens.\u00a0 Many say that Ukraine is too weak and Russia too strong, that Ukrainians must negotiate and must compromise and give up some \u2013 some of its territory.\nThat is exactly what happened to Czechoslovakia prior to the Second World War.\u00a0 Many European leaders believed at that time that ceding of significant parts of my country in the autumn of 1938 to Hitler would bring peace.\u00a0 It was peace for our time, some of them said.\u00a0 And that is exactly what Vladimir Putin wants, force us and Ukraine to give in and accept his so-called peace proposals in order to prepare Russia for even bigger war.\u00a0 It is vital to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.\u00a0 It is not an option; it is a necessity.\nUkraine is by no means weak, because of Ukraine\u2019s citizens are strong.\u00a0 We saw this in the very first days of the Russian aggression, and we have been witnessing it every single day since.\u00a0 They are fighting not just for their territory and their homes, but for values we all share.\u00a0 Ukrainians are dying for freedom of speech, for democracy, for the simple principle that borders shall not be changed by force.\u00a0 We need to support the brave Ukrainians and make sure that they will have all the means to restore the territorial integrity of their country, including Crimea.\u00a0 We need to make sure that war crimes committed by Russian troops under the order of Putin do not go unpunished.\u00a0 Only then can peace be fair and lasting.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Jan, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 Can we go now to Eli Cohen from Israel?\u00a0 Eli, over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COHEN:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, Tony, how are you?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good to see you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COHEN:\u00a0\u00a0Israel is a democratic country facing security challenges.\u00a0 We feel affinity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people as they fight for their independence and sovereignty.\u00a0 We know how it feels to fight for our homeland and identity.\u00a0 Israel \u2013 and actually, the lessons of the 20th century are clear.\u00a0 The international community should raise a voice loud, clear, and (inaudible).\u00a0 Early on, Israel has made a firm commitment to supporting Ukraine and upholding its territorial integrity.\u00a0 Despite the Russian annexation of Ukrainian territories, Israel has taken a (inaudible) by refusing to recognize this action.\u00a0 In addition, Israel (inaudible) action to promoting peace in Ukraine by supporting the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for comprehensive and lasting resolution to the conflict.\nThrough these actions, Israel has shown solidarity with Ukraine and made a commitment to promoting international peace and security.\u00a0 If we can be of any help in facilitating a peaceful resolution to the conflict, ending the tragedy and human suffering, Israel will be at the forefront of such (inaudible).\u00a0 The war within Ukraine is a clear challenge to the world\u2019s stability and order as we know it.\u00a0 We will not ignore the dangers.\u00a0 Iran\u2019s (inaudible) involvement in the war within Ukraine must be a wake-up call to all.\u00a0 Iran\u2019s IRGC is responsible for the use of advanced UAVs against civilian targets in Ukraine.\u00a0 Such transfers are a violation of Iran\u2019s obligations and go against the values and spirit of democracies around the world.\nIn this aspect, the international community must implement coordinated pressure to stop the Iranian activity.\u00a0 On my recent visit to Kyiv, I have personally witnessed the vast devastation the war brought upon Ukraine and the suffering of the people.\u00a0 In my meeting with President Zelenskyy and my friend Foreign Minister Kuleba, I emphasized that Israel strongly supports the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u00a0 On my visit, we have officially resumed the permanent presence of the Israeli embassy in Kyiv.\u00a0 This is a clear message of solidarity.\nI was actually honored to be a first, the first foreign minister from our region to visit Ukraine and to show Israel\u2019s support.\u00a0 Israel will continue to offer its assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0 We will continue our vast program of capacity building, focused on area of expertise in rebuilding resilience, and post-trauma and medical and para-medical assistance in the area of rehabilitation.\u00a0 The challenges of Ukraine, its people and leadership today are (inaudible).\u00a0 The challenges for the day after will depend on our concerted efforts.\nWe have (inaudible) for humanitarian and other aid.\u00a0 We are (inaudible) working closely with our friends in Ukraine.\u00a0 Israel (inaudible) experience will not (inaudible) taking into consideration other results.\u00a0 We will extend \u2013 and this is our government and its decision \u2013 extend our support hand to Ukraine.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Eli, thank you very much.\u00a0 Let\u2019s go now to the foreign minister of Italy, Antonio.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0 Hi, my friend.\u00a0 Thank you for organizing this debate on democracy.\u00a0 Dmytro, hi.\nI think it\u2019s very important to be very clear on this.\u00a0\u00a0Now the competition is between democracy and the technocrats.\u00a0\u00a0For this, it\u2019s important to work all together in defense of our values \u2013 democracy, human rights \u2013 but also we need to have a strategy not only in Ukraine, but also for stopping Russia.\u00a0\u00a0We need to work hard also in the Western Balkans.\u00a0\u00a0Italy is strongly engaged, of course, for supporting Ukraine at military level and for \u2013 in support to the population, but we are working hard in the Western Balkans for stopping Russia.\nWe need more Europe.\u00a0 We need more Italy in this region because the danger is to leave the Western Balkans in Russian hands.\u00a0 It\u2019s very, very important.\nWe need to do the same also in Africa.\u00a0 We need to be more present as democratic countries.\u00a0 We need to work hard for supporting growth, organize joint adventures for working together in favor of peace and democracy, because the competition is at the global level.\u00a0 The Russian are working everywhere.\u00a0 Wagner is present not only in Ukraine; it\u2019s present everywhere.\nFor supporting Ukraine, we need to be present also everywhere, because the competition is global.\u00a0 On Ukraine, of course, Italy is strongly engaged.\u00a0 The Prime Minister Meloni has been in Kyiv talking with President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 I want to thank also for the kind words of the Ukrainian Government with the Italians.\nAlso, three days ago, from Italy started the big mission for supporting civilian population, also with a football Italian organization.\u00a0\u00a0They are working hard also in favor of the young children without family in many Ukrainian region.\u00a0 For this, we are working not only in military sector, also in civil sector, because I think we need to help Ukraine \u2013 the Ukrainians, also, living a difficult moment this \u2013 during this season.\nWe need to help the Ukrainian soldiers \u2013 they are in Italy \u2013 but we need also to help all the Ukrainians in this difficult moment for achieving victory.\u00a0 I am optimistic on this, but in the same time we need to work for the peace.\u00a0 Peace is not the defeat of Ukraine; it\u2019s the victory of Ukraine.\u00a0 Peace is the respect of the international groups, and we are working on this because\u00a0 working in defense of Ukraine, we are working in defense of our values, in defense of democracy, in defense of human rights against the technocrats.\nThis is very important.\u00a0 Italy is strongly engaged.\u00a0 The Italian Government is strongly engaged on this in Ukraine, in the Western Balkans, in Africa, in South America.\u00a0 So thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Grazie, Tonio.\u00a0 Good to be with you.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nCan we go now to our colleague from Liberia, Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah?\nI think the picture may be frozen.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if we can get our colleague.\u00a0 I tell you what \u2013 why don\u2019t we come back and let\u2019s come back to him, and maybe we can go to our colleague from Malawi, Nancy Tembo, if you\u2019re there.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TEMBO:\u00a0Can you hear me?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Thank you, Nancy.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TEMBO:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, for convening this timely meeting.\u00a0 The meeting is indeed important since lasting peace is what the people of Ukraine would like to have in their land.\nThe Ukrainian people have, for over a year, experienced untold suffering, including death of loved ones, loss of livelihoods, displacement, and destruction of vital infrastructure.\u00a0 The war has also generated ripple negative effects on the global economy, more especially on developing economies such as ours.\nIn addition, the conflict has exposed the failure of the United Nations Security Council in safeguarding principles of the UN Charter when it\u2019s being violated by one of its own permanent members.\u00a0 On its flipside, the war has displayed the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people, who have put up with strong resistance against a superpower.\u00a0 They have shown us that everything is possible if there is a strong will and unity of purpose.\nSince the conflict began, the UN General Assembly in New York as well as the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva has passed several resolutions calling for an immediate withdrawal of Russia from Ukraine.\u00a0 Malawi has supported each and every resolution because it believes and respects the UN Charter, which promotes the sovereignty and equality of all states.\u00a0 These resolutions, while exerting political and diplomatic pressure on Russia to withdraw, have not really resulted in true cessation of hostilities on the ground.\u00a0 The atrocities and the negative impact of the war on Ukraine and the world economy continue.\nNow is indeed the time to move a step further by coming up with more concrete actions that would assure comprehensive, just, and lasting peace for the people of Ukraine.\u00a0 We believe that the two warring parties should be brought to a negotiating table for genuine dialogue aimed at ceasefire, and we mean \u201cgenuine\u201d \u2013 not just a break from the war but genuine dialogue.\u00a0 In addition, the United Nations Security Council should also live up to its expectations and mandate of safeguarding the principles of the UN Charter.\nAs a country, Malawi will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine in multilateral fora until there is positive change in Ukraine.\u00a0 I am confident that with such collaborative efforts by the international community, a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine is possible.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Nancy, thank you very much for joining us today.\u00a0 I appreciate it very much.\u00a0 And it looks like we have our friend from Liberia back online.\u00a0 Dee-Maxwell, back over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER KEMAYAH:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Sorry, I\u2019m in Lusaka, Zambia for the Democracy Summit.\u00a0 Our profoundest gratitude to the honorable President Biden and his cohost for organizing this Democratic Summit.\nHaving said that, I have the pleasure and duty to convey special greetings and warm felicitations from His Excellency Dr. George Manneh Weah, president of the Republic of Liberia, and in my own name, and congratulate His Excellency Mr. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine, and the government and people and the gallant men and women of Ukraine in arms for successfully holding out, protecting, and defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their great country in the wake of Russia\u2019s condemnable, unprovoked, and unjustified brutal invasion of Ukraine, as well as the illegal annexation of the parts of Ukraine since February 24, 2022.\nLet me extend my profound thanks and appreciation to the Honorable Antony J. Blinken, United States Secretary of State, for inviting (inaudible) participate in this important virtual discussion with the theme a just and lasting peace in Ukraine with His Excellency President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.\u00a0 We heartily commend President Zelenskyy, represented by the foreign minister of Ukraine, for the excellent presentation of Ukraine\u2019s 10-point peace plan.\nPermit me to reaffirm that Liberia strongly detests and condemns the Russian Federation in the strongest terms for its unprovoked attack on the peace-loving people of Ukraine and the illegal annexation of some regions of Ukraine, as well as Russia\u2019s repeated rhetoric and threat regarding its placement of nuclear weapons in Belarus and its potential use of said nuclear weapons in its unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.\nThe Republic of Liberia was founded by brave women and women of courage in pursuit of liberty, justice, and freedom for all.\u00a0 As a reasonable \u2013 as a responsible member of the community of nations, Liberia remains unwavering and strongly committed to the promotion and sustenance of the core values and principles of liberty, justice, human rights, freedom, respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, democracy, and humanity in general.\nAnywhere they are threatened around the world, Liberia has and continues to firmly cooperate with other nations in support of global peace, security, and international rule-based order.\u00a0 Respect for, supporting, and defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Liberia and any other nation, including Ukraine, is pursuant to one of the cardinal pillars of Liberia\u2019s foreign policy objectives and in line with the charter and principles of the United Nations and other relevant international treaties and protocols aimed at ensuring global peace and security and promoting the rights of all nations to self-determination.\nIn that premise, Liberia reaffirms its unreserved commitment, support, and calls for the urgent restoration of just, lasting, and comprehensive peace to Ukraine, and hereby endorses to the fullest the 10-point peace plan in its entirety as excellently presented by His Excellency President Zelenskyy of Ukraine through the foreign minister of Ukraine.\nIn conclusion, I wish to again thank His Excellency President Zelenskyy for the exemplary leadership and bravery he continues to demonstrate in leading his great country and the resilient people of Ukraine in the path of defending their independence, sovereignty, their integrity, and fundamental rights to liberty, freedom, justice, self-determination, democracy, and humanity in general.\u00a0 I wish us a fruitful deliberation as we continue to build strong global collaborative partnerships and step up the necessary imperative momentum in providing Ukraine with the most needed security, economic, logistical, and humanitarian assistance while strengthening and deepening the compelling endeavors of the international coalition and the defenders of the core values and fundamental principles of independence, human rights, defenders of democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and humanity to continue to hold the Russian Federation fully accountable for the gross violation and flagrant disregard for the charter and principles of the United Nations Charter and humanity in general.\nLiberia has co-sponsored, supported, and voted for every resolution related to this unprovoked aggression by Russia in Ukraine.\u00a0 And Liberia, under the astute leadership of His Excellency President Weah, and under my watch as minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Liberia, we will continue to provide unconditional support for the people of Ukraine.\nI thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mr. Minister, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 I greatly appreciate your intervention.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSantiago, I see you there.\u00a0 Any reflections?\nFOREIGN MINISTER CAFIERO:\u00a0 Yes, hello, Tony.\u00a0 Hello, Dmytro.\u00a0 Well, hello, everyone.\u00a0 I switch to Spanish.\n(Via interpreter) Once again, we are meeting here to deal with the serious situation in Ukraine to reach a peace and to get peace in Ukraine and the region, because this is imperative, and we have to mobilize all of us.\u00a0 And this is why I want to thank this meeting and the opportunity for me to take the floor, because Latin America, from Argentina, we express our firm position.\nTo start, we have to highlight that peaceful will not be possible if the cease \u2013 if the \u2013 if we don\u2019t get a ceasefire.\u00a0 Argentina condemns and we always condemned the invasion of Russia into Ukraine, and we reaffirm our commitment with the independence, unity of Ukraine.\nWe want peace in Ukraine that is a peace that can \u2013 that is \u2013 that can last, and in respect of the international law.\u00a0 We will reach this if we really respect the principles of United Nations, because we have to have a peaceful world, and we signed this in 1945; and respect of international law and the sovereignty of the states, and territorial integrity, and the solution in a peaceful manner; and respect of human rights.\nArgentina, during 2022 and the first time in the \u2013 in our history, we were the chair of the Human Rights Commission, and we were able to achieve during this time a task that was really highlighted by all the members of that commission.\u00a0 During this time, we expressed our concern about the attacks of \u2013 to human rights.\u00a0 This war started one year ago, and we have to insist that the human rights have to be respected, but we see the attacks on human rights and the infrastructure.\u00a0 We are concerned about violation of human rights, of international law, examples that were submitted into the 52nd meeting of the United Nations.\u00a0 These have to be classified as crimes of war, and we have to underline that we respect human rights and international law, and this is not optional.\u00a0 All these crimes have to be investigated, and responsible have to pay a price.\nWe need this to include the criminal sanctions and the non-repetition of this crime.\u00a0 Therefore, the humanitarian aid is fundamental for the survival of those that are most vulnerable.\u00a0 We really want to \u2013 free access to these areas that are so vulnerable.\u00a0 We will continue to lessen the suffering of the Ukrainian people.\nWe in Argentina and our White Helmets have really participated in these activities with the Ukrainian community.\u00a0 We also had two missions in the evacuation of Argentine and Latin American people that were in Poland and Ukraine.\u00a0 We know that dialogue and diplomacy is the only way out to avoid any suffering.\nThis war is a catastrophe for Ukraine, for its people, for Europe in general \u2013 not only for them, but the consequences will be dire for the whole world, and even if we are far away, but they are really suffering the energy cuts.\nAnd I want to remember what Pope Francis said:\u00a0 Please do not forget the Ukrainian people, because they suffer the crimes of the war.\u00a0 And we have to participate.\u00a0 Please, a ceasefire, an end to the conflict and to really reach a lasting peace and just peace, not only for Ukraine but for the world as a whole.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Santiago.\u00a0 And we now have a video from our friend from Japan, Foreign Minister Hayashi, who couldn\u2019t be with us live today but asked to be recorded so he could participate. \u00a0So let\u2019s go to Foreign Minister Hayashi.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0Distinguished participants, first, I would like to express my appreciation to Secretary of State Blinken for his initiative in organizing today\u2019s discussion.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine is an outrageous act that shakes the very foundation of the international order, which the international community has built up over a long period of dedicated efforts and sacrifices.\u00a0 This aggression is a serious violation of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and other principles of international law, including the UN Charter, and poses a clear challenge to the international order based on the rule of law.\nUnilateral attempts to change the status quo by force, such as Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, can never be tolerated anywhere in the world.\u00a0 From this point of view, Japan has consistently and strongly condemned Russia, imposed strict sanctions against the country, and provided global support for Ukraine.\u00a0 In order to bring Russia\u2019s aggression to an end as soon as possible, the international community should enhance its coordination more than ever and lay the united voice that unilateral change of the status quo by force is unacceptable.\nAt the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in February, which I attended, a resolution calling for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine was adopted with the support of the overwhelming majority of all member-states.\u00a0 The international community hopes that peace will come to Ukraine as soon as possible.\u00a0 But it must be not a mere ceasefire, but a just peace based on the principles of the UN Charter.\nWe should not allow the world to revert to the jungle, where brute force and coercion would prevail.\u00a0 We should protect the free and open international order based on the rule of law in which all nations, large or small, can make decisions freely under international law.\u00a0 From this perspective, during Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s recent visit to Ukraine, he conveyed to President Zelenskyy Japan\u2019s high regard for the peace formula that President Zelenskyy has been advocating as a path to a just peace.\nIn the G7 Pluses, where Japan hosts the presidency this year, I chaired a G7 foreign ministers meeting in February, and G7 foreign ministers underlined their commitment to upholding the international order based on the rule of law, and committed to actively working with Ukraine for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.\nIn order to stop Russia\u2019s aggression as soon as possible, Japan, as the G7 presidency, we maintain the unity of the G7 and other likeminded countries, and promote strict sanctions against Russia and robust support for Ukraine.\u00a0 At the upcoming G7 foreign ministers meeting in Karuizawa, Nagano, and G7 Hiroshima Summit, we would like to send a strong message to the world that G7 will never tolerate unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force anywhere in the world, or accept Russia\u2019s nuclear threats, let alone its use of nuclear weapons.\u00a0 The G7 is determined to uphold the international order based on the rule of law.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, thanks very much to our friend Foreign Minister Hayashi for joining us with these pre-recorded remarks.\u00a0 And thanks to everyone for joining us today.\u00a0 And Dmytro, thank you very, very much for being here, for sharing and going through the peace plan that President Zelenskyy has put forward.\nAll of us are committed to peace, but I believe also all of us are committed to making sure that that peace is a just and lasting one that respects Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u00a0 And as you heard today, Ukraine is proposing 10 common-sense principles that could serve as a roadmap to peace.\u00a0 This war could, of course, end tomorrow if President Putin so chose, by withdrawing Russia\u2019s forces from Ukraine.\u00a0 But meanwhile, we have a plan put forward many weeks ago now by Ukraine.\u00a0 I really commend the plan to each and every one of you and would ask you to consider the 10 principles and, of course, to stand with Ukraine on the path to a just and durable peace.\nWith that, we\u2019re adjourned for today with my thanks, and we\u2019ll be looking forward to seeing many of you in the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone, for joining today.\n\n\n\n[1]\u00a0Ms. Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url":

Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State", "audience": "FREEDOM ONLINE COALITION EVENT ATLANTIC COUNCIL", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "March 27, 2023", "content": "\n\nGood afternoon. It\u2019s good to be with you. Thank you, Rose, for your introduction and for all of the work that the Freedom Online Coalition is doing.\nIt is fitting to be here at the Atlantic Council for this event, because your mission sums up our purpose perfectly: \u201cshaping the global future together.\u201d\nThat is our fundamental charge in the field of technology and democracy\u2014how we use modern innovations to forge a better future.\nThat\u2019s what the DFR Lab strives to achieve through your research and advocacy. That\u2019s what the Freedom Online Coalition, its members, observers, and Advisory Network seek to accomplish through our work. Thank you for your partnership.\nMore than five decades ago\u2014seems like a long time ago, but really, very short\u2014the internet found its origins in the form of the first online message ever sent\u2014all of two letters in length, delivered from a professor at UCLA to colleagues at Stanford.\nIt was part of a project conceived in university labs and facilitated by government. It was an effort meant to test the outer limits of rapidly evolving technologies and tap into the transformative power of swiftly growing computer networks.\nWhat these pioneers intended, at the time, was actually to devise a system that could allow people to communicate in the event of a nuclear attack or another catastrophic event.\nYet what they created changed everything. How we live and work. How we participate in our economy and our politics. How we organize movements. How we consume media, read books, order groceries, pay bills, run businesses, conduct research, learn, write, and do nearly anything we can think of.\nChange didn\u2019t happen overnight, of course, and that change came with both promise and peril.\nThis was a remarkable feat of scientific discovery, and it upended life as we know it, for better and sometimes worse. Over the years, as we went from search engines to social media, we started to face complicated questions, as leaders, as parents and grandparents, as members of the global community.\nQuestions about how the internet can best be utilized; how it should be governed; who might misuse it; how it impacts our children\u2019s mental and emotional health; who could access it and how we can ensure that access is equitable, benefitting people in big cities, rural areas, and everywhere in between.\nBig picture questions arose about these tectonic shifts\u2014what they would mean for our values and our systems of government. Whether it\u2019s the internet as we understand it today or artificial intelligence revolutionizing our world tomorrow, will digital tools create more democracy or less? Will they be deployed to maximize human rights or limit them? Will they be used to enlarge the circle of freedom or constrain and contract it?\nFor the United States, the Freedom Online Coalition, and likeminded partners, the answers should point in a clear direction: at a basic level, the internet should be open and secure for everyone. It should be a force for free enterprise and free expression.\nIt should be a vast forum that increases connectivity; that expands people\u2019s ability to exercise their rights; that facilitates unfettered access to knowledge and unprecedented opportunities for billions.\nMeeting that standard, however, is not simple. Change that happens this fast in society and reaches this far into our lives rarely yields a straightforward response, especially when there are those who seek to manipulate technology for nefarious ends.\nThe fact is, where all of us may strive to ensure technology delivers for our citizens, autocratic regimes are finding another means of repression.\nWhere democracies seek to tap into the power of the internet to lift individuals up to their highest potential, authoritarian governments seek to deploy these technologies to divide and disenfranchise; to censor and suppress; to limit freedoms, foment fear, and violate human dignity.\nThey view the internet not as a network of empowerment, but as an avenue of control. From Cuba and Venezuela to Iran, Russia, the PRC, and beyond, they see new ways to crush dissent through internet shutdowns, virtual blackouts, restricted networks, blocked websites, and more.\nHere in the United States, alongside many of you, we have acted to sustain connections to internet-based services and the free flow of information across the globe, so no one is cut off from each other or the outside world, or cut off from the truth.\nYet even with these steps, none of us are perfect.\nEvery day\u2014almost everywhere we look\u2014democracies grapple with how to harness data for positive ends while preserving privacy; how to bring out the best in modern innovations without amplifying their worst possibilities; how to protect the most vulnerable online while defending the liberties we hold dear.\nIt isn\u2019t an easy task\u2014and in many respects, as I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s only getting harder.\nThe growth of surveillance capabilities is forcing us to constantly reevaluate how to strike the balance between using technologies for public safety and preserving personal liberties.\nThe advent of AI is arriving with a level of speed and sophistication we haven\u2019t witnessed before. It will not be five decades before we know the impact of AI. That impact is happening now.\nWho creates it, who controls it, who manipulates it will help define the next phase of the intersection between technology and democracy. By the time we realize AI\u2019s massive reach and potential, the internet\u2019s influence might really pale in comparison.\nThe digital sphere is evolving at a pace we can\u2019t fully fathom and in ways at least I can\u2019t completely imagine. Frankly, we have to accept the fact that the FOC\u2019s absolutely vital work can feel like a continuous game of catchup. We have to acknowledge that the guidelines we adopt today might seem outdated as soon as tomorrow.\nNow, let me be perfectly clear: I am not saying we should throw our hands in the air and give up. To the contrary: I\u2019m suggesting that this is a massive challenge we have to confront and a generational charge we have to embrace.\nWe have to set standards that meet this moment\u2014and that lay the foundation for whatever comes next. We have to address what we see in front of us\u2014and equip ourselves with the building blocks to tackle what we cannot predict.\nTo put a spin on a famous phrase: with the great power of these digital tools comes great responsibility to use that power for good.\nThat duty falls on all our shoulders, and the stakes could not be higher for internet freedom, for our common prosperity, for global progress.\nBecause expanded connectivity\u2014getting the two billion unconnected people online\u2014can drive economic growth; raise standards of living; create jobs; and fuel innovative solutions for everything from combating climate change to reducing food insecurity to improving public health to promoting good governance and sustainable development.\nSo we need to double-down on what we stand for: an affirmative, cohesive, values-driven, rights-respecting vision for democracy in the digital era.\nWe need to reinforce rules of the road for cyberspace that mirror and match the ideals of the rules-based international order.\nWe need to be ready to adapt our legal and policy approaches for emerging technologies.\nWe need the FOC, alongside partners in civil society, industry, and elsewhere, to remain an essential vehicle for keeping the digital sphere open, secure, interoperable, and reliable.\nThe United States believes in this cause as a central plank of our democracy and of our diplomacy.\nThat\u2019s why Secretary Blinken established our Department\u2019s Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy\u2014and made digital freedom one of its core priorities.\nThat\u2019s why the Biden-Harris Administration spearheaded and signed onto the principles in the Declaration for the Future of the Internet, alongside 61 countries ready to advance a positive vision for digital technologies.\nThat\u2019s why we released core principles for tech platform accountability last fall, and why the President called on Congress to take bipartisan action in January.\nThat\u2019s why we are committed to using our turn as FOC Chair as a platform to advance a series of key goals.\nFirst, we will deepen efforts to protect fundamental freedoms, including human rights defenders online and offline\u2014many of whom speak out at grave risk to their own lives and to their families\u2019 safety. We will do so by countering disruptions to internet access, combating internet shutdowns, and ensuring everyone\u2019s ability to keep using technology to advance the reach of freedom.\nSecond, we will focus on building resilience against the rise of digital authoritarianism, the proliferation of commercial spyware, and the misuse of technology, which we know has disproportionate and chilling impacts on journalists, activists, women, and LGBTQI+ individuals.\nTo that end, just a few hours ago, President Biden issued an Executive Order that, for the first time, will prohibit our government\u2019s use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to our national security\u2014or that\u2019s been misused by foreign actors to enable human rights abuses overseas.\nOn top of that step, as part of this week\u2019s Summit for Democracy, the members of the FOC and other partners will lay out a set of Guiding Principles on Government Use of Surveillance Technologies.\nThese principles describe responsible practices for the use of surveillance tech. They reflect democratic values and the rule of law; adhere to international obligations; strive to address the disparate effect on certain communities; and minimize the data collected.\nOur third objective as FOC Chair focuses on artificial intelligence. and the way emerging technologies respect human rights.\nAs some try to apply AI to help automate censorship of content and suppression of free expression, FOC members must build a consensus around policies to limit these abuses.\nFinally, we will strengthen our efforts on digital inclusion. On closing the gender gap online. On expanding digital literacy and skill building. On promoting access to safe online spaces and robust civic participation for all, particularly women and girls, LGBTQI+ persons, those with disabilities, and more.\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: the FOC\u2019s work is essential, and its impact will boil down to what we do, as a coalition, to advance a simple but powerful idea\u2014preserving and promoting the value of openness.\nThe internet, the web, the online universe is at its best when it is open for creativity and collaboration. Open for innovation and ideas. Open for communication and community, debate and discourse, disagreement and diplomacy.\nThe same is true for democracy\u2014a system of governance, a social contract, and a societal structure that is strongest when defined by open spaces to vote, deliberate, gather, demonstrate, organize, and advocate.\nThis openness could not be more important. Because when the digital world is transparent. when democracy is done right\u2014that\u2019s when everyone has a stake in our collective success.\nThat\u2019s what makes everyone strive for a society that is free and fair, in our politics and in cyberspace.\nThat\u2019s what will give everyone reason to keep tapping into the positive potential of technology to forge a future of endless possibility and boundless prosperity for all.\nLet\u2019s keep shaping that future, together.\nSo, good luck with all your remaining work. There\u2019s lots ahead. And thank you so much for all that you do.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinken-with-colombian-foreign-minister-alvaro-leyva-at-the-u-s-colombia-high-level-dialogue/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Blinken With Colombian Foreign Minister \u00c1lvaro Leyva at the U.S.-Colombia High-Level Dialogue\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

I would like to welcome all of you, especially our guests from Colombia. Bienvenidos a todos. This is the 10th year we mark the \u2013 this High-Level Dialogue, and we are honored to host this year. The High-Level Dialogues present remarkable opportunities to engage at a deeper level on our shared interests. The dialogue continues to speak to the strength of the bonds between our two countries. We are especially honored today by the presence of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who will formally open the dialogue.\nMr. Secretary, welcome.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good morning, everyone. Wonderful to see you all here. And to our friends from Colombia, bienvenido. I just am particularly pleased to do this because I also have a little history with this. In fact, I\u2019ve taken part in these dialogues going back to 2015 and 2016 when I was deputy secretary of state. So as Brian said, this has been an ongoing and, I believe, very important process between our two countries.\nA very special welcome, \u00c1lvaro, to you. Wonderful to have you here for what is indeed the 10th dialogue between \u2013 High-Level Dialogue between our countries.\nI had the opportunity to lead our delegation to the last dialogue, in Bogot\u00e1, in 2021, and it\u2019s a testament to the strength of the relationship that this exchange, as I said, has continued, and indeed has expanded, across administrations in both of our nations.\nThe dialogue \u2013 like a two-centuries-old friendship \u2013 is built on a shared foundation of two vibrant democracies committed to ensuring that our people can reach their full potential.\nWe recognize that when it comes to tackling the global challenges that are affecting the lives of Colombians and Americans alike \u2013 from the existential threat posed by climate change to the unprecedented movement of people across our hemisphere \u2013 we\u2019re simply better off when we\u2019re tackling these challenges together. And the ripple effects of our cooperation on these and other issues extend far beyond our two countries. They extend to the hemisphere; indeed they extend to the world.\nAcross the upcoming dialogue, we will focus on concrete steps to strengthen our cooperation and work to deliver tangible results for our people. So let me just take a few minutes to highlight some of the areas where we are going to work to do that.\nWe\u2019ll continue working to help Colombia reach its ambitious climate goals, from providing ongoing technical assistance on wind and solar projects to strengthening protection of the Amazon.\nWe\u2019ll expand pathways for farmers, for textile producers, and other small- and medium-sized businesses in rural areas to get their products to global markets, and reap the benefits of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement.\nOur dialogue will also focus, of course, on improving civilian security. For decades, we have worked to strengthen cooperation on security and law enforcement, and that will continue.\nAt the same time, we recognize that to sustainably reduce violence, we have to tackle the root causes of insecurity \u2013 like corruption, like impunity \u2013 impunity for crimes \u2013 human rights abuses, and the lack of economic opportunity.\nThat\u2019s why we continue to partner on bolstering the rule of law and expanding access to justice. And it\u2019s also why USAID is investing $60 million over five years to expand opportunities for Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities.\nEnsuring equitable development is a central focus of the Ethnic Chapter of the 2016 Peace Accord. It recognizes that there can be no lasting peace without justice and equality for the country\u2019s underserved communities. Back in October, I joined Vice President Marquez at the extraordinary Fragmentos Museum; I had the honor of signing the United States on as the chapter\u2019s first international accompanier.\nAmbassador Murillo \u2013 who is here today \u2013 was with us in Bogot\u00e1 on that historic day. He has dedicated much of his life to giving voice to these communities, including the Ethnic Chapter.\nIn the time since we signed on as an accompanier, the U.S. embassy in Colombia, led by our Charg\u00e9 Michael[1] Palmieri, who is with us here today as well, has dedicated a full team supporting the Ethnic Chapter\u2019s implementation, building on our longstanding partnerships with both Colombia\u2019s Government and with civil society. And let me just give one example of those relationships.\nA few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to join our First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, in honoring International Women of Courage at the White House. The awardees included Josefina Klinger, a remarkable Afro-Colombia leader who rallied her community around transforming the national park where they live into an ecotourism destination, preserving the environment, providing a sustainable livelihood to local families.\nFor years, we have been a proud supporter of her organization, including when she was threatened by drug trafficking organizations for the work that she was doing.\nCountering these illicit groups and the flow of illegal drugs is a key part of our ongoing discussions on security, including here at the High-Level Dialogue. We\u2019re bringing a holistic approach to this challenge.\nThat means looking at ways to further reduce demand by investing in substance abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery for those who are struggling with addiction in our countries \u2013 because this is fundamentally a public health problem.\nAnd it means discussing ways to reduce supply \u2013 from strengthening interdiction by land and sea, to providing vulnerable communities with alternative ways to earn a living.\nThe dialogue also gives us an opportunity to deepen our joint efforts to address unprecedented migration across our hemisphere. Indeed, we are all experiencing unprecedented migration around the world. There are more people on the move, forcibly deplaced from their homes around the world \u2013 more than 100 million \u2013 than at any time since we\u2019ve been recording these numbers. Colombia was a crucial partner in shaping the Los Angeles Declaration, which has put its principles into practice in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. More than 1.5 million Venezuelans have been granted Temporary Protective Status in Colombia, allowing them to work, to send their kids to school, to access public health services.\nHere again, I had a chance to meet last time I was in Bogot\u00e1 with some Venezuelan families \u2013 this is back in October at the integrata centers \u2013 and heard first-hand how TPS has allowed them to become productive members of their new communities. Colombia is showing the way that migration, when it\u2019s managed safely, humanely, and as a region, can actually increase stability and can be an opportunity, not a burden, for communities.\nThe United States has been a steadfast partner in these efforts, providing more than $900 million in humanitarian, economic, development, and health assistance to Colombia, to help Colombia address the consequences of the Venezuela crisis.\nNext month, we will host our first-ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver, Colorado. The mayor of Bogot\u00e1, my host at the integrata center, will be there, along with the mayors of Cartagena, Barranquilla, dozens of other cities across the hemisphere, including in the United States. This summit will allow them to share best practices in tackling many of the issues that we discuss here.\nI think one of the things we know is that there needs to be and there is an integrated response across national governments, but these challenges also have answers in work \u2013 at a subnational level, between and among municipalities, between municipalities and the federal government, states, et cetera. Again, it\u2019s a reminder that important as this dialogue between our national governments is, there are U.S.-Colombian dialogues at every level of our societies \u2013 between our governments, businesses, civil society, and directly between our citizens.\nAnd I\u2019m convinced, based on the experience that we\u2019ve had over many years, that these dialogues are one of the most important ways to actually benefit our people, to benefit our communities, to benefit the region that we share.\nSo with that, thank you all for being here, thank you for your participation, for all the hard work that\u2019s gone into today, for all the hard work that will continue today and in the days that follow.\nAnd with that, \u00c1lvaro, the floor is yours. (Applause.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER LEYVA: (Via interpreter) Mr. Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken, it is a great honor for me to be here with you. I\u2019d first like to extend greetings from President Petro, and to, of course, President Biden. We are allies. And this is not new; we\u2019ve been for a long time. We are actually on the tenth High-Level Dialogue, and I have to say it\u2019s impressive. Look at the delegation we\u2019re bringing to you. Behind each and every one of these people there\u2019s a wise person, and I\u2019m not exaggerating. People who have great reputation on the moral and intellectual levels, and they have devoted their careers to the seven points that once again bring us here, which are the social and economic opportunities; public diplomacy; the environment and climate change; energy, mining, and infrastructure; democracy, good governance, and human rights; security, counternarcotics, and rural development; and migration.\nThese are issues that in the eighth and ninth dialogues were there, but they didn\u2019t have the significance that they have today. Today there\u2019s a geopolitical dimension; new things are happening every day; new visions are crystallizing on each one of these topics. And so today\u2019s conference goes beyond expectations. We are allies; we truly are, because we acknowledge that we have a new role in this world. Just to give you an example, we used to be a nation known for cocaine, but now we are one of the biggest sponges when it comes to observing solutions for seeking ways of putting an end to the disappearance of humankind. We\u2019re saving the planet, and so our relationship is thus modified. Because there\u2019s a new head of state, he has a discourse, but it\u2019s not surprising \u2013 there will never be a surprise coming from my administration, in our relationships, and certainly not with \u2013 in our relationships with our longtime allies, such as the United States.\nThis brings me to manifest something that is very important: migration. Migration is a political issue for many countries \u2013 for us, for the United States, for Mexico. That\u2019s why the President has managed to convince Mexico of the importance of celebrating as soon as possible a Latin American conference on migration.\nBangladesh had never been through Colombia. Afghanistan had never gone through Colombia. China had never gone through Colombia. But they\u2019re coming through Colombia too on their way north, and they\u2019re coming back. We not only have the migrants coming from Venezuela, which of course has its own circumstances, but we\u2019re seeing a phenomenon that touches the whole planet. So I wanted to tell you that, just as Mr. Petro said, we are going to celebrate that conference on migration as soon as possible.\nThe conference on drug trafficking \u2013 that stopped being a Colombian topic. There is a multinational organization that is impacting the globe. We saw that in Ecuador. In one single day, 11 attacks that left people dead. Talking to people \u2013 Lula, right after he took charge, he said, \u201cPresident Petro, Brazil \u2013 in Brazil the multinational drug enterprise is creating problems for us. We have to attack them with intelligence.\u201d So how best to do this? By using the knowledge that Colombia has and creating and celebrating a conference on migration that involves the whole continent to discuss drug trafficking, and we will not only comply with what was said in Havana, but also we will analyze demand because we\u2019re all in the same boat here. I think it\u2019s of the utmost importance to highlight the call that President Petro has placed upon all of us.\nIn terms of fighting greenhouse emissions, something completely new, we are going to hold \u2013 and I think Canada has already said yes \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a conference on the power interconnection grid from Patagonia, just so we can bring to the North electricity coming from renewal \u2013 clean energy methods. This is just to say that this High-Level Dialogue goes beyond business as usual, and we are going to need the U.S. to be present, to be by our side in each and every one of these topics, because we are the same people, the same continent, the same security, the same issues \u2013 perhaps a little bigger now up north, of course, given the global responsibility that the U.S. has in its role in the world. But each one of the people that you see here is an ally, and they can bring solutions \u2013 definitive solutions to the problems that are afflicting the world.\nI am very thankful for your presence. Please take into consideration this new vision that President Petro is bringing. He is trying his best to deal with continental circumstances, to deal with the problems afflicting humanity, and of course to deal with problems that are also happening in the U.S. We\u2019re all in the same boat, and we are guided by the same goal.\nThank you for being here today. (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Thank you, Foreign Minister Leyva. Thank you, Secretary Blinken. And with that powerful introduction, I have the honor to declare the 10th High-Level Dialogue open. I expect great things, and I am sure that you will deliver for both of our peoples.\nHave a great day. (Applause.)\n\nFrancisco \u2191\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-opening-remarks-before-the-house-committee-on-appropriations-subcommittee-on-state-foreign-operations-and-related-programs-on-the-fy24-department-of-state-budget-request/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Chairman Diaz-Balart, Chairwoman Granger, Ranking Member Lee, Ranking Member DeLauro, all the members of the committee,\u00a0thank you for the opportunity today to speak with you about the FY24 budget for the State Department and USAID. \u00a0But also, thank you day-in, day-out for the work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 This is critical for us.\u00a0 We appreciate deeply the work of this committee, and I really look forward to the year ahead as we work together to try to make sure, together, that we have the strongest possible tools to advance America\u2019s interests around the world.\nAnd second, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Lee, thank you for \u2013 both of you \u2013 for your strong and positive words about the State Department \u2013 the people of the State Department.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u00a0 I am so deeply honored for this period of time to be leading them and serving with them.\u00a0 And I deeply appreciate the appreciation you\u2019ve expressed for the work that they do, day-in, day-out.\u00a0 So thank you for that.\nAnd I could not agree more \u2013 we are at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over, and there is an intense competition underway right now to shape what comes next.\u00a0 The United States has a positive vision for the future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, that is prosperous.\nThis budget will help us advance that vision and deliver on the issues that matter to the American people, by preparing us to take on two major sets of challenges that are distinct but also interconnected and overlapping.\nThe first set is posed by our strategic competitors \u2013 the immediate, acute threat posed by Russia\u2019s autocracy and aggression, most destructively through its brutal aggression against Ukraine, and of course, the long-term challenge that is posed by the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nThe second set of challenges is posed by shared global tests that we have to meet, including the climate crisis, migration, food and energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly affect the lives of our fellow citizens, as well as their livelihoods, and people around the world.\nWith this committee\u2019s leadership and support, including through the FY23 Omnibus, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical position than we were a few years ago to take on these challenges.\u00a0 We have drawn enormous power from investments that we\u2019ve made here at home in our economic strength and technological edge, including through the Infrastructure Investment Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has never been stronger, and I think that\u2019s in part because we have reinvested in them, working to re-engage them, rejuvenate them, re-energize them.\nWe\u2019re expanding our presence in critical regions, like the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And we\u2019re leading unprecedented coalitions to confront aggression and address humanitarian crises around the world.\nThe FY24 budget request for the State Department and USAID meets this moment.\u00a0 The budget will sustain our security, our economic and energy and humanitarian support for Ukraine, so that we ensure that President Putin\u2019s war remains a strategic failure.\nThe budget will also strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC.\u00a0 President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 That\u2019s why this proposal asks for an 18 percent increase in our budget for that region for FY \u2013 over FY23.\u00a0 The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory proposals \u2013 I suspect we\u2019ll come back to those \u2013 for new, innovative investments to outcompete China, including by enhancing our presence in the region, ensuring that what we and our fellow democracies have to offer \u2013 including things like maritime security, disease surveillance, energy infrastructure, digital technology \u2013 is more attractive than the alternative being proposed.\nThe budget will help us push back on advancing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening democracies around the world including through supporting independent media, countering corruption, defending free and fair elections.\u00a0 And it will allow us to pay our contributions to international organizations because we do need to be at the table wherever and whenever new international rules, standards, norms are being decided that affect the livelihoods of our people.\u00a0 Wherever they\u2019re being debated and decided, we need to be there.\nThe budget will also allow us to continue leading the world in addressing these global challenges, from food and energy insecurity to climate and health crises.\u00a0 Just on that last point: we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which I believe is one the greatest achievements in our foreign policy over the last couple of decades.\u00a0 And to Ranking Member Lee, to you and others, for your strong support and leadership on this, I think it\u2019s been a great tribute and credit to our country.\u00a0 It\u2019s something I hear, as I travel, for example, throughout Africa.\u00a0 It saved 25 million lives.\u00a0 This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/AIDS while advancing health security more broadly through a new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I look forward to working with Congress to establish this year.\nThe budget will advance our efforts to modernize our department, including by expanding our training float, updating our technology, carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, including to make our overseas missions more accessible.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful for the progress that we\u2019ve already made together, including Congress\u2019s support in updating the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and the Accountability Review Board, to give us the flexibility to open new missions and to better manage the risks that our people face around the world.\nWe know there\u2019s more to do, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with Congress, working with this committee, to accelerate modernization efforts so that the department can better attract, retain, and support our first-rate workforce that you referred to.\u00a0 We\u2019re in a competition there, too, for talent, and I want to make sure we have a department that attracts that workforce and keeps them.\nFinally, the budget will further what is a personal priority for me that\u2019s been referenced today already, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan allies.\u00a0 Keeping our promises to those who stood by us and served with us remains an unwavering priority for me.\u00a0 The budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.\nWhen I took on this role, one of the things that I was dead serious about was working to restore Congress\u2019s place as an equal partner in our foreign policymaking.\u00a0 I really am serious and committed to that.\u00a0 I, Mr. Chairman, deeply appreciate the conversations we\u2019ve had and the work that I hope we can do together.\nSo with that, I welcome questions, comments.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

much.\u00a0 Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, very good to be with you.\u00a0 Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, to all the committee members here today, thank you for this opportunity to speak with you about our proposed FY24 budget for the State Department and USAID.\nAnd I think as you\u2019ve both laid out in different ways, we are meeting at an inflection point.\u00a0 The post-Cold War era is over, and there is an intense competition underway to shape, to determine what comes next.\nWe, the United States, have a positive vision for the future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, that is prosperous.\u00a0\u00a0 And it\u2019s our belief that the budget that we put forward will help advance that vision and deliver on issues that actually matter to the American people, particularly by preparing us to effectively meet two broad sets of challenges.\nThe first is the challenge posed by our strategic competitors \u2013 the immediate, acute threat posed by Russia\u2019s autocracy and aggression, most destructively, of course, through its brutal aggression against Ukraine, and the long-term challenge from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nThe second set of challenges is really posed by shared global tests, including the climate crisis, migration, food and energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly impact the lives and livelihoods of Americans and people around the world.\nWith this committee\u2019s leadership and support, including through the FY23 Omnibus, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical position than we were two years ago, hence our ability to deal with these challenges I think has been enhanced.\nWe have drawn enormous power from investments that we\u2019ve made in our own economic strength and technological edge at home, including through the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has never been stronger.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve been building on it, not only strengthening existing alliances and partnerships, but building new coalitions of countries and other institutions that are fit for purpose.\u00a0 We\u2019re expanding our presence in critical regions, like the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We\u2019re leading the unprecedented coalitions to confront aggression and address humanitarian challenges around the world.\nThe \u201924 budget request for the State Department and USAID meets this moment head on.\nThis budget will sustain our security, economic, energy, and humanitarian support for Ukraine to ensure that President Putin\u2019s war remains a strategic failure.\nIt will strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC.\u00a0 President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is why this proposal asks for an 18 percent increase in our budget for that region over FY23.\u00a0 The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory proposals \u2013 and we\u2019re happy to talk about why we proceeded this way \u2013 for new innovative investments to outcompete China, including by enhancing our presence in the region, and ensuring that what we and our fellow democracies are able to offer, including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean energy infrastructure, digital technology, is more attractive than any alternative.\nThe budget will help us push back on advancing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening democracies around the world, including through supporting independent media, countering corruption, defending free and fair elections.\u00a0 And it will allow us to pay our contributions to international organizations, because we need to be at the table wherever and whenever new international rules that affect the livelihoods of our people are being debated and being decided.\nThe budget will allow us to continue leading the world to addressing these global challenges, from food and energy insecurity to climate and health crises.\u00a0 And just on that last point, as you all know, we\u2019re celebrating now the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which I think is one of the greatest achievements in our foreign policy over the last decades.\u00a0 It\u2019s helped us save 25 million lives around the world.\u00a0 This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/AIDS, while advancing health security more broadly through a new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I look forward to working with Congress to establish this year.\nThe budget will advance our efforts to modernize the State Department, including by expanding our training float, updating our technology, carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, including to make our overseas missions more accessible.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful for the progress we\u2019ve already made together, including Congress\u2019s support in updating the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and Accountability Review Board to give us some of the flexibility that we need to open new missions and better manage the risks that we face.\u00a0 We know there\u2019s more to do, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with Congress to accelerate these modernization efforts so that the department can better attract, better retain, and support a first-rate workforce as they advance our interests in what is a very complex and fast-moving world.\nFinally, the budget will further a personal priority for me, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan allies.\u00a0 Keeping our promises to those who served alongside the U.S. remains an unwavering priority.\u00a0 This budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.\nWhen I took on this role, I committed to doing my part to try to restore Congress\u2019s place as an equal partner in our foreign policymaking.\u00a0 I\u2019m determined to continue to do that and very much appreciate the work that we\u2019ve been able to do with this committee over the last couple of years and look forward to the work ahead.\nAnd with that, I welcome any questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

everybody.\u00a0 And welcome back to those of us that were on the road with us last week.\nThe Secretary will make some very brief remarks and take a couple of questions before he has to head back upstairs for some engagements.\u00a0 Assistant Secretary Barclay and Ambassador Van Schaack, though, will hang back downstairs to answer some more Q&A once the Secretary departs.\nSecretary, the floor is yours.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Vedant, thank you.\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\nLet me just start with some very good news this morning, and that is the release of Jeffrey Woodke after more than six years in captivity.\u00a0 I want to thank the Government of Niger, where I was just last week, for its important assistance in bringing him home.\u00a0 I also want to thank our team, starting with Special Envoy Roger Carstens, all of those who have been working at the department to bring him home, tireless efforts, and I\u2019m very pleased that we are now seeing that come to fruition today.\nAs you know, I have no higher priority or focus than bringing home any unjustly detained American, wherever that is in the world.\u00a0 We won\u2019t rest until they\u2019re all home and, like Jeffrey, reunited with their families.\nThis morning, I\u2019ll be launching the 2022 Human Rights Report.\u00a0 But just before I turn to that, I want to speak to what\u2019s happening right now in Moscow.\nToday, and throughout this week, President Xi is meeting with President Putin in Russia.\u00a0 We expect that China may use this visit to reiterate calls for a ceasefire under its peace proposal.\nThe United States welcomes any initiative that advances a just and durable peace.\u00a0 China\u2019s proposal includes elements that we have long supported, including ensuring nuclear safety, resolving the humanitarian crisis, protecting civilians.\nAnd indeed, the first element calls for upholding sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all countries.\nThe fundamental element of any plan for ending the war in Ukraine and producing a just and durable peace must be upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nAny plan that does not prioritize this critical principle is a stalling tactic at best or is merely seeking to facilitate an unjust outcome.\u00a0 That is not constructive diplomacy.\nCalling for a ceasefire that does not include the removal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory would effectively be supporting the ratification of Russian conquest.\u00a0 It would recognize Russia\u2019s attempts to seize a sovereign neighbor\u2019s territory by force.\u00a0 It would enable Russia to further entrench positions in Ukraine.\u00a0 And a ceasefire now, without a durable solution, would allow President Putin to rest and refit his troops and then restart the war at a time more advantageous to Russia.\nThe world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia \u2013 supported by China or any other country \u2013 to freeze the war on its own terms.\u00a0 Such a move would violate the UN Charter and delay \u2013 defy, excuse me \u2013 the will of the 141 countries who have condemned Russia\u2019s war in the United Nations General Assembly.\nOne party to this conflict \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 has already put forward a just peace formula.\u00a0 If China is committed to supporting an end to the war based on the principles of the UN Charter as called for in point one of its plan, it can engage with President Zelenskyy and Ukraine on this basis and use its influence to compel Moscow to pull back its forces.\nRussia\u2019s purported annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, including vast areas it doesn\u2019t even control, and its ongoing, brutal attacks on civilians make clear that President Putin currently has no interest in such a peace.\nThat President Xi is traveling to Russia days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Putin suggests that China feels no responsibility to hold the Kremlin accountable for the atrocities committed in Ukraine, and instead of even condemning them, it would rather provide diplomatic cover for Russia to continue to commit those very crimes.\nNow, every year, I come to this podium for the launch of the Human Rights Report.\u00a0 I do so because the report embodies the importance of human rights for American diplomacy and for our vision of an open, free, prosperous, and secure world.\nHuman rights are universal.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t defined by any one country, philosophy, or region.\u00a0 They apply to everyone, everywhere.\nThis report makes a factual, objective, and rigorous accounting of human rights conditions around the world, looking at nearly 200 countries and territories.\u00a0 And, importantly, it applies the same standards to everyone: our allies and partners, and countries with which we have differences.\nThe goal of this report is not to lecture or to shame.\u00a0 Rather, it is to provide a resource for those individuals working around the world to safeguard and uphold human dignity when it\u2019s under threat in so many ways.\u00a0 And while this report looks outward to countries around the world, we know the United States faces its own set of challenges on human rights.\nOur willingness to confront our challenges openly, to acknowledge our own shortcomings \u2013 not to sweep them under the rug or pretend they don\u2019t exist \u2013 that is what distinguishes us and other democracies.\nThe report makes clear that, in 2022, in countries across every region, we continued to see a backsliding in human rights conditions \u2013 the closing of civic space, disrespect for fundamental human dignity.\nThe report details the appalling and ongoing abuses committed by the regime in Iran against its own people.\u00a0 In the wake of the tragic death of Mahsa Amini, authorities have killed hundreds of peaceful protestors, including dozens of children, and have arbitrarily detained thousands.\nIranian forces are using torture and gender-based violence against arrested protesters.\u00a0 Journalists and lawyers are harassed and pre-emptively detained.\u00a0 Sham trials and hasty executions are used to further intimidate the people of Iran.\nThe international community has come together to condemn and confront Iran\u2019s brutal crackdown, and we\u2019ll continue to act in support of the right of the Iranian people to speak out for their fundamental freedoms.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban relentlessly discriminates against and represses women and girls, so far issuing 80 decrees and \u2013 that restrict women\u2019s freedom of movement and their right to education and work.\u00a0 The Taliban\u2019s December edict barring female employees of non-governmental organizations from the workplace imperils the tens of millions of Afghans who depend on humanitarian assistance for their very survival.\nHuman rights have further eroded in Burma, where the military regime brutalizes the population.\u00a0 Thousands of activists have been killed by the authorities \u2013 including four pro-democracy leaders executed last summer.\nThe PRC continues its abuses, including genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs, repression of Tibetans, crackdown on basic rights in Hong Kong, and targeting of individuals on the mainland for exercising fundamental freedoms.\nIn Cuba, courts have issued draconian jail sentences to hundreds of people for protesting for their rights.\u00a0 And in Nicaragua, the authoritarian government continues to detain political prisoners and hold them in appalling prison conditions.\nThe 2022 Human Rights Report is also a reminder of the extraordinary courage of so many \u2013 activists, journalists, lawyers, government officials, regular citizens \u2013 who stand up to these abuses.\u00a0 Many do so at great personal risk of retaliation, harassment, detention, torture, even death.\nIn February, we celebrated ten Global Human Rights Defender awardees \u2013 individuals from around the world who are promoting and defending fundamental freedoms, from combatting slavery, to advocating for families of those forcibly disappeared, to demanding better wages and working conditions for low-income laborers, to representing political prisoners on death row.\u00a0 This report honors them.\nI\u2019m also proud of my colleagues here at the State Department \u2013 in Washington and at every post around the world \u2013 for not only reporting and documenting human rights abuses but also drawing on the power and purpose of American diplomacy to advance human dignity.\nNow, as you know, I recently traveled to Ethiopia, where I had a very productive discussion with Prime Minister Abiy and his team.\u00a0 I also met with Getachew Reda, the TPLF signatory to the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, who was just selected to be the leader of its interim administration.\u00a0 I commended both sides for reaching that agreement and the significant progress made in its implementation.\nWith this agreement in place, the fighting has stopped, humanitarian assistance is flowing, services are being restored, human rights[i] in northern Ethiopia are significantly down, Eritrean forces are leaving, the Ethiopian Government is taking the first steps toward transitional justice.\nBut, as I discussed with both sides during my visit, to build a durable peace, there must be acknowledgment of the atrocities committed by all parties, as well as accountability together with reconciliation.\nThe conflict in northern Ethiopia was devastating.\u00a0 Men, women, and children were killed.\u00a0 Women and girls were subject to horrific forms of sexual violence.\u00a0 Thousands were forcibly displaced from their homes.\u00a0 Entire communities were specifically targeted based on their ethnicity.\nMany of these actions were not random or a mere byproduct of war.\u00a0 They were calculated and deliberate.\nAfter the department\u2019s careful review of the law and the facts, I\u2019ve determined that members of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, Eritrean Defense Forces, Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front forces, and Amhara forces committed war crimes during the conflict in northern Ethiopia.\nMembers of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, the Eritrean Defense Forces, and Amhara forces also committed crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and persecution.\nMembers of the Amhara forces committed the crime against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer and committed ethnic cleansing through their treatment of Tigrayans in western Tigray.\nWe welcome the commitment that the parties to the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement have made to acknowledge the atrocities committed and their devastating consequences.\nThe Government of Ethiopia is taking the first steps by publicly releasing a detailed green paper of transitional justice options based upon best practices and building upon the experiences of other states emerging from periods of mass violence.\u00a0 It has invited experts from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to join the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to deploy a team of human rights monitors to conflict-affected areas to ensure that such acts have truly ceased.\nThe government is also holding public consultations about transitional justice, which, as I discussed with the prime minister, should be inclusive of all stakeholders and provide victims a voice.\u00a0 The process is benefiting from the advice of experts in the field, including members of my team who participated in a workshop on transitional justice with other international specialists just last week.\nFinally, and crucially, we urge the Government of Ethiopia and the Government of Eritrea, as well as the TPLF, to hold those responsible for these atrocities accountable.\nThese steps \u2013 acknowledgement, accountability, reconciliation \u2013 are key to breaking the cycle of ethnic and political violence that has gripped Ethiopia and prevented it from reaching its unlimited potential for so long.\nThe United States will partner with Ethiopia as it implements a credible transitional justice process for the benefit of all victims and affected communities.\u00a0 We will stand with Ethiopia as it honestly faces the abuses in its past, provides accountability for the harms committed against its citizens, and moves toward a future of lasting peace.\nWith that, happy to take a couple of questions before turning it over to my colleagues.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Matt, go ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and welcome back.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I\u2019ve got about 17 questions, but for the sake of \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Hold on, let me get my pen out.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But \u2013 yeah, but for the sake of both you and my colleagues, I\u2019ll narrow it down to just one.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And that has to do with the Ethiopia \u2013 and the decision you just made.\u00a0 As you noted, you were just there.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t you make this determination either while you were there or before you went?\u00a0 Were your conversations while you were there instructive in \u2013 did the \u2013 in making this?\nAnd then the other thing is \u2013 on this \u2013 you seem to suggest that you think that Ethiopian courts can take care \u2013 can deal with this.\u00a0 That is not so much the case as it relates to Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 And I \u2013 so I\u2019m just wondering why it is that you think that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Matt.\u00a0 Well, look, I\u2019m not \u2013 obviously not going to get into the details of private discussions that I had, but two things.\u00a0 First, this determination is the product of a lot of very deliberate, detailed work, and we are, when we make these determinations, very focused on doing that work, making sure that we have the facts, that we apply them to the law, and all of that takes time and focus.\nIt seemed appropriate to release the determination that we made as we\u2019re putting out the Human Rights Report.\u00a0 And beyond that, I\u2019d say that in terms of what happens next in Ethiopia, including what process they establish to provide for justice, for accountability, we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been determined.\u00a0 What has been determined and what I could see from my meetings and conversations last week is a commitment on all sides to engage in this process of transitional justice; an acknowledgement of the atrocities that have been committed \u2013 again, by all sides \u2013 in the course of this conflict in northern Ethiopia; and, I believe, a commitment to genuinely get to a better place that has to include accountability, that has to include, I think, reconciliation if we\u2019re going to have a truly durable peace.\nThat\u2019s what I heard on the trip, and again, I think the situation that we\u2019re seeing now in Ethiopia is vastly different than situations in other parts of the world in that, over the last four months, the steps that all sides have taken to implement the cessation of hostilities agreement has literally saved lives and changed lives for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t erase what happened over the last two years, which is why it is so important that we get this transitional justice process moving and that there is accountability as well as reconciliation.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Afghanistan?\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s go to Missy in the back.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Please, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Afghan situation also is very bad.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Any message for our new year?\u00a0 We celebrated our new year.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Nazira, I\u2019m going to call the questions.\u00a0 Missy, (inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Please \u2013 you guys don\u2019t give me opportunity.\u00a0 Any comment about Afghan women?\u00a0 And what\u2019s your message for our new year?\u00a0 We celebrated, but Afghan women crying.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, we \u2014\nQUESTION: \u00a0I know you don\u2019t give me a chance.\u00a0 Sorry, I have a lot of pain.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019ll say very simply \u2013 no, no, I\u2019m happy to address that.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say very simply that we deplore the edicts that the Taliban have promulgated repeatedly that fundamentally repress the rights of Afghan women and girls.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen this now time and again: denying them education, denying them the ability to work, denying them the ability to participate in the provision of humanitarian assistance that benefits all Afghans.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s safe to say from conversations with countries around the world that to the extent the Taliban is looking for more normal relations with countries around the world, that will not happen in so long as they continue to advance these repressive edicts against women and girls.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Missy, go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, thanks so much for coming to talk to us about the report.\u00a0 What would your response be to those that would say despite the content of the \u2013 contents of the report and despite all of the work that goes into it, that the issues that are flagged don\u2019t \u2013 are not sufficiently influencing policymaking, especially when it comes to countries where it is harder for the United States to have those tough discussions on human rights, like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Israel?\u00a0 What\u2019s your response to that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, we have those tough discussions across the board with friends, adversaries, competitors alike.\u00a0 So that \u2013 and the report itself makes that very clear.\u00a0 But in the day-in, day-out, it\u2019s the same thing.\u00a0 So we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not pulling our punches with anyone as \u2013 we call things as we see them.\u00a0 Sometimes we do it more publicly; sometimes we do it more privately.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to determine in each instance how we hopefully can be most effective in advancing human rights and advancing human dignity.\nSo I think it\u2019s safe to say, without getting into details, that we raise these concerns with everyone \u2013 again, friends, adversaries, competitors.\nAt the same time, as we\u2019re working in different ways with different countries, we have a multiplicity of interests that we\u2019re working on, and we always try to determine how we can most effectively advance them.\u00a0 Human rights is a central interest of ours; it\u2019s not the only one.\u00a0 And my responsibility is to make sure that we\u2019re doing our best to advance all of our interests however we can.\u00a0 But as this report makes clear \u2013 and it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s a very public report and that it applies the same standards to countries around the world, whatever their relationship with us \u2013 I think demonstrates the seriousness with which we take this issue.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave it in the very capable hands of my colleagues.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\n"}, {"url":

Those aggressions violate international law and the United Nations Charter, without which there cannot be an international community.\nThe United States, I would like to say it and recall it, as everybody knows is one of our major partners in terms of cooperation for development as well as in terms of cooperation for security and our security and defense.\u00a0\u00a0We have U.S. interventions in civil cooperation via the USAID efforts, that everybody here knows, as well as multifaceted efforts in priority sectors of our country.\u00a0\u00a0We also have United States action as part of our MCC national compact, which also works in priority sectors such as agriculture, irrigation, rural roads in order to create conditions for growth.\nWe have just signed recently in Washington a regional compact as part of the MCC with B\u00e9nin in order to reduce the cost of the corridor, which is a vital corridor for our country through which transit practically all of our exports and imports.\u00a0\u00a0So this cost reduction, this reduction of these timelines, is the essential goal of this compact that will allow us to have greater competitivity for economy.\nThe overall volume \u2013 of course, we also have military cooperation, which is very important the United States intervene in the training and the generation of the special forces battalion.\u00a0\u00a0The United States is presently equipping these battalions and general equipping of our armed forces, for our army and our air force and intelligence, as you know.\u00a0\u00a0And also this contribution for the United States allows our forces to be more effective and allows our country to be resilient against the aggression it faces.\nAll of these interventions by your country, the total volume today exceeds 1,000 billion CFA francs. It is a lot. This makes your country one of the main partners, both in development and in matters of defense and security. We also want to take this opportunity to thank you. And we know that this important commitment will be even more important in the future, in view of the conclusions of the last U.S.- Africa summit, where commitments were made by your country towards Africa and in line with the Agenda 2063 of the African Union. Therefore aligned with our priorities, once again, and knowing Ambassador Johnnie Carson, whom we have known here, we know very well that these commitments will be kept.\nIn conclusion, we must tell you that we owe a lot to the cooperation between Niger and the United States, to your commitment by our side, that explains the resilience of our country, of this system, of this democratic state in this chaotic environment. We owe it to our partnership, with you, we also owe it to our own commitment and our determination to defend our values and our system, and we also owe it to other partners such as France and other European countries. We want, in conclusion, to demonstrate by our existence, by our resilience, our model, that a stable democratic state is the only lasting response to the terrorist aggression of which our region is the target today. We want to demonstrate this, and the other alternatives -we are convinced- will be a failure compared to the path we have followed. This is the introduction I wanted to give you, in any case welcome to Niger, welcome Mr. Secretary of State. Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0Hello.\u00a0 Greetings.\u00a0\u00a0Assalamu alaikum.\u00a0 It is wonderful for me to be back in Niger.\u00a0 As the minister said, as it happens, I\u2019m the first American Secretary of State to be here in that capacity, but I was here in my previous job as deputy of secretary of state in 2015, and I\u2019m so appreciative of the incredibly warm welcome\u00a0that we\u2019ve had today.\nWe have \u2013 Niger and the United States \u2013 a deep but also growing bond.\u00a0 We have a genuine and responsive partnership that allows us \u2013 and increasingly \u2013 to deliver for our people on our shared priorities.\u00a0 I saw already back in 2015 the strength of that partnership, and I\u2019m honored to return today to see it move forward in very significant ways.\nAs President Bazoum has said, Niger is a young democracy in a challenging part of the world, but it remains true to the democratic values that we share.\u00a0 And Niger has been quick to defend democratic values under threat in neighboring countries.\nNiger\u2019s leaders have distinguished themselves in the face of other pressing challenges, from violent extremism to the climate crisis.\u00a0 In each case, Niger has prioritized inclusion, community engagement, pragmatic solutions.\u00a0 The United States is committed to the close partnership we\u2019ve forged together and to make it even closer.\nWe deeply appreciated the very thoughtful, the deeply experienced views that President Bazoum brought on questions of peace, security, and governance at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last December.\u00a0 And in many ways, that conversation was the starting point for the discussions that we\u2019ve had here today in Niamey.\nToday, I announced nearly $150 million in new humanitarian assistance to help meet needs in West and Central Africa and the Sahel created by regional instability.\u00a0 That assistance will support the provision of shelter, essential healthcare, emergency food, safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene services, and will also support vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers evacuated to Niger.\u00a0 And I have to say, the generosity of Niger \u2013 of its people \u2013 to so many refugees, so many displaced persons, is remarkable.\nWe are also supporting investments in the long-term security of Niger, investments that, you\u2019ve heard the minister refer to, help make Niger\u2019s law enforcement more effective in combating terrorism, strengthening border security, enhancing counternarcotics capacity, stemming trafficking, helping to investigate, prosecute, and ultimately reduce terrorism, violent extremism.\nWe\u2019re committed to continuing to invest in the resilience of democracies to a wide range of threats and challenges, from corruption to disinformation.\u00a0 And we continue to support a free and independent press, as we have done in Niger for decades.\u00a0 In the coming months, we\u2019re going to actually welcome another cohort of Nigerien media professionals to the United States, an opportunity to meet fellow journalists and practitioners, to exchange lessons learned and participate in training and other professional development opportunities.\nWe\u2019re also supporting President Bazoum\u2019s remarkable disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, and reconciliation program.\u00a0 I saw this for myself firsthand earlier today.\u00a0 Over the past couple of decades, what we\u2019ve learned is that to effectively counter violent extremism we have to find ways to pave alternative pathways that give former combatants an opportunity to build a real future for themselves.\u00a0 When I had a chance to meet earlier today with young people who\u2019ve completed this program, I heard about their experiences, their ideas for preventing the spread of violent extremism.\u00a0 And again, I think this program can and should be a model for many others.\nToday, the president, foreign minister, and I also talked about another threat to peace and prosperity, and that is the global food crisis.\u00a0 Now, this has been something that has been long in the making.\u00a0 A combination of climate change, of COVID, of various conflicts has created an almost perfect storm.\nNow over the past year, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine has just added fuel to an already burning fire, driving up food and fertilizer prices for Nigeriens, for many others, putting millions at risk of going hungry.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been supporting immediate interventions to help those facing acute food insecurity.\u00a0 Just since the aggression by Russia against Ukraine a year ago, we\u2019ve contributed an additional $13.5 billion to address food insecurity around the world, but most of that has gone to Africa.\u00a0 We\u2019re by far the largest donor to the World Food Program as well, and other international mechanisms that are helping to deal with food insecurity.\nWe\u2019re also supporting something called the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has brought Ukrainian grain to countries across Africa and lowered the prices worldwide.\u00a0 Now keep in mind, this initiative never should have been necessary in the first place, but one of the results of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was to block Ukrainian ports and prevent Ukraine from exporting grain and other food products to the world, which it\u2019s done for years.\u00a0 Thanks to very good work done by the United Nations, by T\u00fcrkiye, an agreement was reached to create this corridor to allow Ukraine\u2019s grain to reach world markets.\u00a0 Over 4 million metric tons of wheat have gone directly to developing countries as a result of this initiative.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of 8 billion loaves of bread.\u00a0 And so millions of people around the world \u2013 and especially here in Africa \u2013 rely on this initiative to help deal with food insecurity.\u00a0 It\u2019s imperative that it continue and it\u2019s imperative that Russia allow it to continue.\nBeyond emergency aid though \u2013 and this is maybe just as important, if not more important \u2013\u00a0 we are working together to make long-term investments in African food production capacity and resilience, because ultimately the goal that we all share is for African countries to be able to produce on their own the food that their people need, and for that matter be able to export it not just in the region that they happen to be in on the continent, but even to other places in the world.\nOne way that we\u2019re doing that here in Niger is through the Millennium Challenge Corporation\u2019s compacts that you\u2019ve heard the minister discuss.\u00a0 They simultaneously address a couple of the really big constraints to economic growth: lack of access to water and institutional barriers to trade.\nOne of the compacts for $442 million is strengthening irrigation infrastructure, climate-resilient production, and market access for agricultural products.\u00a0 And it\u2019s having a major impact in a country where four out of five people are employed in the agriculture sector.\nBy the end of April, we will have established 300 kilometers of roads, built vast irrigation networks, improved more than 1,000 kilometers of livestock corridors, provided literacy training to more than 5,000 people.\u00a0 In 2021, just a couple of years ago, a project that was funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation using satellite technology discovered five aquifers containing over 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.\u00a0 That has the potential to benefit millions of people here in Niger.\nWe\u2019re also supporting Niger\u2019s regional integration and its broader economic development.\u00a0 At the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last year, I joined President Bazoum and the president of Benin, President Talon, in signing another MCC compact that will bring the two countries together to have a regional transportation program that will facilitate trade between the two of them and facilitate the export beyond those countries of food products.\u00a0 It will make it faster and safer to transport and export goods from Niger along rehabilitated roads and across borders. Ultimately, it will connect Niger to bigger markets and even greater opportunities.\nIn all of our meetings, President Bazoum raised the importance of education, because he knows that the single most important contributor to the future of any country is its human resources and giving them the ability to reach their full potential.\u00a0 And that starts with education.\nUnder President Bazoum, Niger has prioritized building and improving girls\u2019 schools to ensure that they can get a good education and acquire the skills they need to participate fully in the economy.\u00a0 USAID is assisting this mission, including with programs to increase girls\u2019 primary school enrollment, provide career training opportunities, deliver distance education for girls who can\u2019t go to school because they live in a high insecurity area.\u00a0 We\u2019re a major contributor, the United States, to the Global Partnership for Education, which has identified Niger as a priority country and is providing nearly $200 million to strengthen the formal education system here.\nThere are so many other ways in which we are working together to deepen this partnership.\u00a0 And we began a discussion, a long discussion with our \u2013 between our teams.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to continue it shortly over dinner, because there\u2019s so much to talk about.\u00a0 But in all of this, I come back to the fact that Niger is really an extraordinary model at a time of great challenge \u2013 a model of resilience, a model of democracy, a model of cooperation.\u00a0 It\u2019s one that we deeply value and deeply respect.\nMODERATOR: \u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to the Secretary of State for those introductory words. We will now give the floor to the representatives of the media. We have a list, and it is not very long, I assure you. First we have Mr. Michael Crowley, New York Times. Go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Minister.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, we\u2019ve seen growing activity in the region by the Russian Wagner Group as countries turn to Russia to address their security concerns, given that the U.S. and also French efforts in recent years have not succeeded in quelling terrorist and extremist threats to these countries.\u00a0 I understand that you believe that working with the Wagner Group is bound to end badly for these countries, but I just wonder if you can talk about what specifically the U.S. and its allies can offer these countries that Russia cannot.\nAnd Mr. Minister, related to that, why do you think so many countries in this region have been turning to the Wagner Group for assistance?\u00a0 And what lessons do you draw from their experiences so far?\nIf I may just add a brief question for you, Mr. Secretary, on Ukraine.\u00a0 Poland\u2019s government said today that Poland will be sending fighter jets to Ukraine.\u00a0 Can we have your reaction to that, please?\u00a0 And does that change at all the Biden administration\u2019s thinking about potentially providing fighter jets of our own?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Michael.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 And actually, I\u2019ll just take the last question first, and then go to the broader question.\nWith regard to the decision by Poland to provide jets to Ukraine \u2013 look, these are sovereign decisions for countries to make, what they will provide to Ukraine to help it defend itself against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 And we, of course, are working closely with dozens of countries on these questions, but different countries are doing different things in response to what they have and what the perceived needs are.\u00a0 Our focus has been on doing everything we can to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, what it can use, and what it particularly needs in this moment, dealing both with the offensive that we\u2019re seeing from Russia across the eastern front, but also in preparation for its own actions in the weeks and months to come as it seeks to take back more of the territory that Russia has seized from it.\nSo we\u2019ve done this throughout in close consultation with the Ukrainians and with our partners.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said many times before, I think it\u2019s a mistake to get focused on any particular weapon system at any given time.\u00a0 We know that there are basic things that Ukraine needs, whether it\u2019s air defenses, whether it\u2019s artillery, whether it\u2019s ammunition, whether it\u2019s armored vehicles and the like.\u00a0 Secretary Austin, as you know, led a very, very successful process in bringing together dozens of countries to help find and coordinate that assistance.\u00a0 And at the same time, as I\u2019ve, again, said before, what\u2019s very important to us and our focus is not only making sure that the Ukrainians have the right weapon system, but again, they can use it \u2013 so depending on the system, that might require significant training \u2013 that they have the ability to maintain it \u2013 again, depending on the system, that can be more or less complicated \u2013 and that it fits into a comprehensive plan.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying that\u2019s been our approach all along, it remains our approach, and individual partner countries will, again, make their own decisions about what they can provide, when they can provide it, and how they provide it.\nWhen it comes to Wagner and the security question more broadly, first, what is I think the most effective way \u2013 and this is something where, again, Niger has really been in the lead \u2013 we know that dealing with insecurity, yes, requires taking steps on the security side of the equation, military side of the equation.\u00a0 That\u2019s necessary, but it\u2019s not sufficient.\u00a0 And the focus that we\u2019re bringing to bear, that Niger is bringing to bear, that other countries are bringing to bear that care about insecurity here because of the potential that it has to spread even well beyond the region and beyond the continent, is a comprehensive approach \u2013 one that\u2019s focused not just on the security steps that we\u2019re taking, but on good governance, on development, on creating opportunity, on being responsive to the needs of the people.\u00a0 And I think that is exactly the difference-maker \u2013 not at all what Wagner or any other groups of its like have to offer.\nAnd I think what we\u2019ve seen already, it\u2019s not just we know this is going to end badly; we\u2019ve already seen it end badly in a number of places.\u00a0 Where Wagner has been present, bad things have inevitably followed.\u00a0 The \u2013 it has not proven to be an effective response to insecurity, and at the same time we\u2019ve seen countries that find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, less independent as a result of an association with Wagner.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also seen Wagner engage in the exploitation of a country\u2019s resources, bring corruption with it, bring violence with it \u2013 overall worsening security, not improving it \u2013 and engaging in human rights abuses at the same time.\nSo this is not a recipe for success that I think anyone should be looking to.\u00a0 But yes, it is incumbent upon us to demonstrate through this much more comprehensive approach that we\u2019re taking to insecurity that we can actually deliver results.\u00a0 That was a big part of our conversation with President Bazoum earlier today, which, again, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue over dinner.\u00a0 But I think you\u2019re going to see very, very concrete results.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is this:\u00a0 I mentioned the disarmament and demobilization and reintegration program here.\u00a0 That, too, should be a model that\u2019s integrated in what we\u2019re doing regionally, because you can see the results.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU: \u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Well thank you, so I would like to complete the response of the Secretary of State. For us, the principle is that this war is up to us to wage, it is not up to our partners to wage war in our place. This is the misunderstanding among some. Therefore, it\u2019s up to our countries, it\u2019s up to us to fight, the goal is that our partners should only complement our efforts. That\u2019s our doctrine, that\u2019s what the doctrine should be, that\u2019s the misunderstanding that there was.\nIt\u2019s that others, the reactions that we sometimes see today on social media, is that it is said that our partners have failed in certain countries, to defeat the enemy \u2013 but that is a misunderstanding. The war is ours to fight. Therefore, we never had the illusion in our country of believing or of making the population believe that this war must be waged and carried out by our partners, in our place. That\u2019s the first principle.\nThe second principle is that, as the Secretary of State was saying earlier, we had a discussion about it, that this war is not being waged only with weapons. We do it holistically. We must first have resolved, or resolve at the same time, the problems of governance, the problems of national cohesion which have not been resolved elsewhere. Terrorists take advantage of flaws in terms of cohesion, social cohesion, national cohesion, that\u2019s why we have the tools to carry out this permanent negotiation between the communities, to effectively prevent a collapse at that level, to prevent an inter-community confrontation, and reduce it to the bare minimum. So this political fight we are carrying out at the same time as the war, it is a part of the war. It is one of the aspects of this war.\nThirdly, it goes without saying that we must not give up development while we are at war. This is why we say that the stabilization and recovery actions that we carry out in these areas affected by the war are also part of the conditions for success. So those are the three elements, as we see them, that condition success or failure.\nAs far as Wagner itself is concerned, with ECOWAS, the first press release we issued after the first rumors of Wagner settling in our sub-region, was to condemn that. It\u2019s been a long time since the West African space has known this, since \u201cExecutive Outcomes\u201d in Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was a South African mercenary company at the time, and obviously we consider that these kinds of elements, this type of heterogeneous force, mercenaries, we cannot accept in our AU space. There is an ECOWAS communiqu\u00e9 in this regard\nAnd what is the outcome today? It is that we find that Wagner is only present in failed or soon to be failed states. Let\u2019s take examples, I won\u2019t cite any, just look around you. Second, the outcome is more than catastrophic. I don\u2019t think there has been any progress in the successes of those countries, where Wagner is present. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a challenge for us. We are now fighting to demonstrate first that our vision, the way we wage this war is the right one, secondly that our democratic institutions can defeat terrorism. In fact, that there are no other alternatives, quite simply, in this fight to defeat terrorism, other than this model for a state. So here are some of the issues which we face, and I believe that the immediate future will prove us right. This is the answer I can give to your question. Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Thank you Minister of State.\u00a0\u00a0Moussa Kama, RFI.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Good evening Your Excellency, my question goes to the two ministers please. An answer in French would really please us, Mr. Secretary of State of the United States. My first question is on security. You have done a lot for Niger, the Nigerien army recognizes this; when will the United States be ready to finance military operations on our borders against the jihadists? My second question is on foreign policy. What will the United States do to bring democracy to our neighbors in Burkina Faso and Mali\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0What are you ready to do? Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0First of all, we have, and the Minister mentioned it, a partnership on security issues which requires significant funding insofar as together we train our colleagues in Niger, we bring important equipment precisely so that they can carry out the necessary operations, we coordinate all of that with others, and all that is a financial contribution because\u2026 all of it costs money. So there is genuine support that has lasted for years and we are strengthening it.\nBut I insist on the point that the minister brought up so well, that while doing this, this holistic approach is for us, for both our countries, the key to success. And there too, there is a very, very significant investment as mentioned for example, the Millennium Challenge Corporation projects. The Minister mentioned the total of our investments in these projects which are also very important to prevent people from falling into extremism and terrorism, and those amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.\nWe are talking with President Bazoum and the minister about the issues, the challenges that we see in the region, including the democratic backsliding, the military coups, which so far have not led to a renewal of a democratic constitutional process in these countries. We discuss it together, and I won\u2019t say more this evening, but I think that we must indeed all be very clear about the need of neighboring countries to restore their constitutional and democratic course.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0 I\u00a0think that what the Secretary of State said is enough, and earlier I told you about the volume of funding through USAID, through the MCC and through equipment, the training of our armed forces, through the intelligence they give us. For all of this I gave a figure, I said no less than 1000 billion CFA francs. I think that\u2026and in addition there are other types of interventions in the multilateral framework which we cannot evaluate here but which are enormous. We have seen for example the commitments of the World Bank. Today in Niger we are the second country after Nigeria in Africa, today, when it comes to World Bank commitments. All of this is a form of support from our partners also through this unprecedented multilateral effort, which was unimaginable a few years ago.\nTherefore, it\u2019s not limited to direct investment in terms of financing our operations, I think we\u2019re waging war, it\u2019s up to us to do so, I want to stress this, and that\u2019s important. The support of our partners, we need it on the strict military level as well as on the civil level \u2013 but not that they fight the war instead of us. This is extremely important. So if there is a misunderstanding in this respect we are not going to get out of it. So I think, and we welcome this commitment by the United States at our side and we think that this model, the bet we have made on democracy, on the stability of democratic institutions, to defeat terrorism, this bet will pay off. We are going to win this bet against the authoritarian model and the criminal model, the criminal groups, that we see elsewhere, it is not a model for us. It is a failure from the point of view of the fight against terrorism, in terms of security sensu stricto, and it is also a failure in terms of development prospects quite simply. Because, today, I don\u2019t think those behind Wagner have any other proposals in terms of development aid, in terms of civil aid, they don\u2019t have any other proposals than that. So here it is, time will tell who is right. We are certain that we are right. This is the answer I can give you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Thank you\u00a0 Minister of State. The penultimate question, William Mauldin from the Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 I wanted to follow up first of all on the RFE question, Mr. Foreign Minister, specifically about Burkina Faso, if you could help some of those \u2013 some of us who aren\u2019t from the region understand what\u2019s going on there in terms of that country and the Wagner Group.\u00a0 And do you think the U.S. should remain active in Burkina Faso despite the military coups?\u00a0 Maybe Mr. Secretary wants to answer that too.\nBut specifically for you, Secretary Blinken, I wanted to ask a little bit if you could \u2013 I mean, you were here, if I understand, as deputy secretary of state before.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sure there were efforts for humanitarian aid and other types of assistance back then in the economic and humanitarian space.\u00a0 What types of programs are working, or paint us a picture?\u00a0 Some of the programs you mentioned today with the Millennium Corporation, how, specifically, do you see that helping this country avoiding \u2013 falling into some of the pitfalls of extremism, hunger, and migrant crises that we\u2019ve seen before?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:\u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0As far as Burkina Faso is concerned, I simply note that there have been two successive coups. With ECOWAS we have a mediator who has an agreement at the moment with the military authorities for a way back to a normal constitutional life, for elections, within 24 months. So for the moment we are within the framework of this plan.\nSecondly, we note that the security situation has further deteriorated and we are very concerned about this continued deterioration of the security situation. As for the presence of Wagner in Burkina, we are not yet\u2026 we think, the information that we have does not allow us to say that Wagner is still in Burkina Faso. Our wish is that this country maintains the trajectory with ECOWAS. Secondly, that it does not continue this trajectory towards this organization which we qualify as criminal, mercenary, which ECOWAS has already condemned. We don\u2019t want this trajectory, in which they seem to be going, to come to a conclusion. We believe that, we want them to pull themselves together to reintegrate into the community and that we can, with them, move towards the end of the transition process and cooperate, fight together, against terrorism. This is our view but obviously it does not depend only on us. It depends on them too. But this is our wish.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, just to come back to something I said \u2013 and forgive me for repeating myself, but it does go directly to your question, and I think it\u2019s important.\u00a0 So we have these big projects, including Millennium Challenge Corporation projects that people hear about, and we talk about the very large sums of money that are involved in these projects.\u00a0 But what I\u2019ve seen, and the difference that I\u2019ve seen between when I was last here in 2015 and now, is the concrete results that this \u2013 these projects that we\u2019re doing together are actually delivering and concrete results that are having a direct impact on improving people\u2019s lives, creating opportunity, and creating a strong future.\nI mentioned this just a few minutes ago in my opening statement: by the end of April, we will have rehabilitated through the Millennium Challenge Corporation projects and other things that we\u2019re doing 300 kilometers of Nigerien roads.\u00a0 We will have built a vast irrigation network, which for, again, a country that is 70 or 80 percent in the agricultural sector, may be the most important foundational thing.\u00a0 We will have improved more than 1,000 kilometers of livestock corridors, just to cite a few things.\u00a0 But what does that translate into?\u00a0 It translates into people having much greater opportunity to actually cultivate the land that they enjoy, to bring their products to market in ways that they couldn\u2019t before, and as a \u2013 in the same time, create many new jobs.\nBeyond that, through AID and other partners, we\u2019re doing things like providing literacy training to thousands of people.\u00a0 That, again, enables them to participate much more effectively in the economy.\u00a0 I mentioned, too, this remarkable discovery \u2013 again, an MCC-funded project \u2013 of the five aquifers: 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.\u00a0 The impact that that\u2019s going to have as that water is actually brought to use on the agricultural system here on productivity and on sustainability I think will be dramatic.\u00a0 And again, that translates into livelihoods for people.\u00a0 It translates into opportunity.\u00a0 It translates for everyone into lower food prices, reducing food insecurity, and that\u2019s (inaudible).\u00a0 The bottom line is this:\u00a0 Through everything that we\u2019re doing as partners here, it\u2019s less about the program, whatever it\u2019s called; the amount of money, as great as it is.\u00a0 It\u2019s about the fact that it is actually producing concrete results, concrete opportunities, concrete development which is foundational to Niger\u2019s strength and resilience as a democracy.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0The last question is for\u00a0Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Niger, Madam Nadia Maman.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via\u00a0Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0Good evening, my question is for Mr. Blinken. At present, given the evolution of the war in Ukraine, and the impact of this war on the world, does the United States intend to keep going as is or play the card of diplomacy?\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So with regard to Ukraine and to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, let me just say a couple of things.\u00a0 First of all, no one wanted this war.\u00a0 No one wanted this aggression.\u00a0 Maybe the only person who wanted it was Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 We worked very hard when we saw the storm clouds rising.\u00a0 We had information about what the Russians were planning to do.\u00a0 We tried to prevent it with diplomacy.\u00a0 And I spent months, as did my colleagues, engaging with Russia to see if we could head off its aggression.\nI think what we learned in the process is that the reason for this aggression is because Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine shouldn\u2019t exist as an independent country.\u00a0 In his mind, it\u2019s part of Russia, and so he tried to seize it back.\u00a0 I know that there are dozens of countries in Africa in particular who, having been on the receiving end of imperialism, can appreciate why it was so important to stand against it and to make sure that a country, a big country like Russia, couldn\u2019t simply try to erase another country by force \u2013 change its borders, eliminate its independence.\nThe minister said it very eloquently at the very start of this press conference.\u00a0 This is bigger than Ukraine.\u00a0 It really is about the principles that are at the heart of the international system that, after two world wars, countries came together and said we need, if we\u2019re not going to have another world war, territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty.\u00a0 And if we allow those principles to be violated anywhere, they\u2019re in danger everywhere, because the message to a would-be aggressor \u2013 if Russia can get away with what it did, what it\u2019s doing in Ukraine, the message to another would-be aggressor, maybe in Africa, maybe in the Middle East, maybe somewhere else is if they can get away with it, so can I.\u00a0 And that leads to a world of conflict.\u00a0 It leads to a world of violence.\u00a0 It leads to a world where countries that have imperial designs on others will carry the day.\nSo that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so important, I think, why so many countries around the world have stood against the Russian aggression.\u00a0 Just a few weeks ago, 143 countries at the United Nations \u2013 three-quarters of the countries in the world \u2013 stood up and voted in opposition to Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 At the same time, as we\u2019ve already talked about, we\u2019ve seen the terrible consequences that this aggression has had not just for people in Ukraine, but for people around the world because of the impact it\u2019s had, for example, on food insecurity.\u00a0 And we talked about this earlier.\u00a0 Ukraine was one of the biggest exporters of wheat and grain to the world, including to Africa.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s invasion stopped that and was blocking Ukraine from exporting its wheat and grain, including to Africa.\u00a0 Fortunately, we were able to get an agreement to allow Ukrainian grain and wheat to get out of Ukraine.\u00a0 And when I was in Ethiopia just yesterday, I saw the large bags of wheat and grain from Ukraine in Ethiopia.\nNow, the people who, more than anyone else, want this war to be over as soon as possible, are the Ukrainian people who are on the receiving end every day of bombs, of violence, of destruction.\u00a0 And like many other countries around the world, we would like to see the same thing, but there has to be a just and durable peace \u2013 just in the sense that it reflects the principles of the United Nations Charter, because if it\u2019s a peace that allows Russia to keep all the territory it seized by force, that\u2019s not justice; and durable in the sense that no one wants to see Russia repeat this a year or two or three years later.\nSo with those principles in mind, every day we are looking for ways to see if we can bring the war to an end.\u00a0 I see no evidence that right now Russia is interested in a diplomatic resolution, a negotiation that would end this war.\u00a0 And so the quickest way to end it is to continue to support Ukraine so that it is strong on the battlefield \u2013 and the battlefield is its own country \u2013 so that hopefully, at some point, Mr. Putin recognizes the reality that this has to stop, that he\u2019s not going to succeed, and he\u2019s prepared for diplomacy and for negotiation.\u00a0 When that day comes, we\u2019ll be the first to engage to try to end things.\u00a0 But as I said, in this moment, at least, I don\u2019t see any evidence of that.\nMODERATOR: \u00a0\u00a0(Via Interpreter.)\u00a0\u00a0We are at the end of this exercise, so your Excellencies, Mr. Minister of State, Mr. Secretary of State, thank you for answering questions from journalists.\u00a0Thank you so much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-at-a-disarmament-demobilization-reintegration-and-reconciliation-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "U.S. Logistics Center Warehouse", "location": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia", "date": "March 15, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had an enduring partnership when it comes to humanitarian assistance with Ethiopia, going back decades.\u00a0 And it\u2019s enduring because we\u2019ve had periods of famine, conflict, displacement, and yet throughout we have found ways, working with extraordinary partners like World Vision, like Catholic Relief Services, to make sure we were working with our partners to provide assistance.\nJust in the last couple of years, even with the conflict in Tigray in Ethiopia, we have provided about $3 billion worth of humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 And it\u2019s been very important to us that we do everything we can to make sure the people who are caught up in any of these human tragedies get the assistance that they need.\u00a0 And indeed, today I can share that we\u2019re going to be providing an addition $331 million in assistance through this joint emergency operations program to try to reach more people in Ethiopia who are in need of food security, and we think we\u2019ll reach another 13 million or so people being affected by drought in particular.\nBesides being enduring, what\u2019s so important is that it\u2019s intended for everyone in Ethiopia \u2013 not any particular group, region.\u00a0 We\u2019re active through our partners with the government in nine of the 11 regions in Ethiopia, trying to make sure that whoever\u2019s in need is getting assistance.\nAnd finally, as you\u2019ve seen a little bit of today, of course it starts with food, the most basic necessity, but it\u2019s broader than that.\u00a0 It includes everything from hygiene kits to sanitation to medicine to water.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to continue to do that day-in, day-out.\nBut a few other things that are so important.\u00a0 One is, as I said, we can\u2019t do this without a strong partnership with the government; we can\u2019t do it without strong partnerships with, as I said, remarkable implementing partners like Catholic Relief Services, like World Vision.\u00a0 And I\u2019m especially proud of the work that USAID \u2013 the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2013 is doing in country after country, including here in Ethiopia.\u00a0 As I like to say, USAID is where the rubber meets the road, where we\u2019re making a tangible difference in people\u2019s lives.\nAs a result of the cessation of hostilities agreement in Tigray, we now have humanitarian assistance flowing in very important ways.\u00a0 And that\u2019s reaching people who were not being reached before, and making a big difference.\nFinally, one footnote.\u00a0 You noticed that some of the food products here are from the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 And I would simply note that that just underscores the importance of making sure that the arrangements that have been put into place \u2013 necessitated, unfortunately, by the Russian aggression against Ukraine \u2013 the Black Sea corridor, making sure that grain could get out of Ukraine and able to reach faraway places in the world, that that continues.\u00a0 It\u2019s vital that that continues, it\u2019s vital that as it comes up for renewal that it be renewed.\u00a0 And we can see the impact if that doesn\u2019t happen, because it literally means that what you\u2019re seeing right here won\u2019t get here, won\u2019t get to many other places.\u00a0 It\u2019ll also have an impact on prices for people around the world.\nBut the most important thing is day-in, day-out, we\u2019re committed to this partnership with Ethiopia, doing our part in making sure that people have what they need.\u00a0 I\u2019m also very proud that the United States is the largest contributor by far to the World Food Program.\u00a0 Grateful for the work that WFP does every day.\u00a0 We provide about 50 percent of the World Food Program\u2019s budget.\nThe very last thing is this:\u00a0 As vital, as necessary, as urgent as this assistance is, we\u2019re equally committed to working closely with our partners in Ethiopia to help them develop and strengthen their own productive capacity.\u00a0 That ultimately is the most important thing that we can do.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m convinced, we\u2019re convinced, that in Ethiopia and many other partner countries in Africa, it\u2019s that long-term productive capacity that can be resilient to things like droughts, like climate change, like disease, that can take advantage of the extraordinary natural resources and expertise that already resides in these countries, that that is fundamentally the most important answer, so that we don\u2019t have to deal on an emergency basis with a lack of food or the impact of some kind of crisis.\nSo as we\u2019re working in this partnership to provide emergency support, we\u2019re equally focused on making sure that we\u2019re working together to provide the kinds of investments that will allow Ethiopia to fully realize the potential of its own productive capacity.\nMr. Minister.\nFINANCE MINISTER SHIDE:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Your Excellency Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Your Excellency Ambassador Tracey Jacobson, Mr. Sean Jones, USAID mission director for Ethiopia, dignitaries from Ethiopian Government (inaudible), on behalf of the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, it is an honor for me to warmly welcome Secretary Blinken and his team to Ethiopia.\u00a0 We are delighted to have the opportunity to further consult on our bilateral missions and particularly the economic cooperation between our two countries.\nToday there has been extensive discussion between the prime minister and with you, and a consensus has been reached to further enhance our strategic partnerships.\nAs you are well aware, the diplomatic relationship between Ethiopia and the U.S. dates back to over a century, and over the past several decades we have made considerable progress in elevating that partnership, which has become more strategic and vital for the goals and development of Ethiopia, and more broadly for the Horn of Africa, and particularly Ethiopia and United States partnerships is very strategic and important for our two-way mutually beneficial relationship, and also for the regional stability.\nThe United States is Ethiopia\u2019s largest humanitarian and development donor.\u00a0 I fully agree what you have said.\u00a0 Ethiopia has been receiving U.S. support in wide-ranging areas such as agriculture, trade, investment, climate and food security and health to state a few, Your Excellency.\nToday on the occasion of the launch of this USAID\u2019s new five-year Joint Emergency Operation Program, in the presence of Your Excellency, we\u2019d like to share our deep gratitude to the United States Government and the American people for their continued commitment in supporting our country\u2019s address urgent humanitarian challenges which have affected the most vulnerable.\u00a0 I acknowledge and sincerely appreciate that in 2022 alone, the U.S. provided more than 1.7 billion to respond to humanitarian needs driven by the crisis in northern Ethiopia and the civil drought in pastural areas in southern and southeast Ethiopia.\u00a0 Recently we have also received an additional 271 million to scale up the humanitarian assistance to drought and the country\u2019s affected communities.\nI fully welcome your initiative today to support it further.\u00a0 Excellency, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly highlight our recent achievement and key challenges.\u00a0 As most of you know very well, the last two years have been a challenging period for our country due to internal as well as global factors.\u00a0 Ethiopia, like the rest of the Horn of Africa, is confronted by multiple challenges.\u00a0 Our rains have failed for the five consecutive seasons in pastoral areas \u2013 the current drought being the most extreme in 40 years.\nMoreover, first, we had the problem with desert locusts, then COVID, and now the global food shortage has affected the lives \u2013 livelihoods and the economy.\u00a0 There are presently over 20 million people in need of humanitarian assistance while the conflict reconstruction needs are significant.\u00a0 This is on top of sustaining and deepening our economic reform agenda.\u00a0 This \u2013 all of the challenging environment has been exacerbated by the significant drop in external development assistance.\u00a0 With your visit, we do fully believe that the development potential will be fully unlocked.\nAs Ethiopia emerges from the divisive conflict of the last two years, we are getting up efforts for recovery and for communities and the economy from (inaudible) effect of the conflict and other successive shocks.\u00a0 The signing of the peace agreement on November 2, 2022 paved the way for a critical and inclusive recovery as well as for strengthening social cooperation among all Ethiopians.\u00a0 Since its signing, we have expedited the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict and the fully implemented restoration of basic services, utilities, banking, and other essential government services.\u00a0 We have progressed well on the resettlement and demobilization of ex-combatants and have established the National Rehabilitation Commission to implement the integration program for the nearly 250,000 ex-combatants.\u00a0 Here, I want to stress the criticality of timely reintegration of ex-combatants, which in turn we contribute to the peace consolidation.\u00a0 We are also working on establishing of the interim regional government in Tigray until elections have been held.\nWe have begun implementing immediate recovery interventions primarily using our own resources and by support of the World Bank.\u00a0 But we cannot do this alone as the financing need for the post-conflict reconstruction is substantial.\u00a0 Conservatively estimated close to $20 billion is needed over the coming five years.\u00a0 We need the support of our partners to meet this significant need to ensure that (inaudible) any development (inaudible) are passed, decades are not reversed, and the well-being of our cooperation is important.\nLet me underscore Ethiopia\u2019s determination to address underlying causes and drivers of fragilities through an inclusive national dialogue for which is essential to adequately address the grievances and the aspirations in our society and attain sustainable peace and democracy.\u00a0 The recently established National Dialogue Commission is working towards that objective.\u00a0 Mechanisms for transitional justice are also being set up to ensure justice and accountability to end perpetual acts of violence and advert impunity.\nWith regard to our reform agenda, Ethiopia remains committed to pursuing transformative economy reform to correct prevailing macro-economic imbalances, to remove obstacles to private sector development, and enhance productivity and job creation.\u00a0 Despite the headwinds of historic proportions, we preserve it with implementation of our key reforms, including financial market revitalization, telecom sector revitalization, subsidy for enhancing agricultural productivity, and debt management.\u00a0 We know that much more needs to be done, and we are ready to take bold actions on the most transformative reforms.\nWe are also working to address greening our economy.\u00a0 We are applying various strategies, including expanding renewable energy generation through diverse sources, as well as green legacy initiatives led by the prime minister, to cite a few examples.\u00a0 And we are already producing a lot of food in the country which is going to be vital for the future and currently.\nExcellency, wide humanitarian assistance is essential to save lives and address the short-term needs.\u00a0 Broader and long-term development, as you have mentioned, focuses critical for building our resilience and advancing our development aspirations and fostering inclusive and sustainable growth, and overall tackling the root cause of Ethiopia\u2019s vulnerabilities.\u00a0 Those conditions are key to sustain and consolidate development gains of recent years and to sustain peace and stability in the country.\nAs I conclude my remarks, let me reiterate my appreciation to the U.S. Government for their commitment to support Ethiopia during this challenging time, and I look forward to discussing and exchanging views on resuming and strengthening our longstanding partnership in trade, investment, full-fledge development assistance, and the cooperation (inaudible) shared goals, understanding, and mutual interest.\u00a0 U.S. Secretary, we count on U.S. to leverage broader support to Ethiopia from all our bilateral (inaudible) development partners as we forge ahead with recovery, development, and sustaining and deepening our reform agenda.\u00a0 I thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone.\n"}, {"url":

Blinken at a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Addis Ababa University", "location": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia", "date": "March 15, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good evening, everyone.\u00a0 It is great to be back in Africa, but also to make my first appearance to Ethiopia as Secretary of State.\nI\u2019m here in Ethiopia \u2013 and then on to Niger \u2013 to reaffirm the pledge that President Biden made at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit late last year.\u00a0 As he put it, the United States is \u201call in on Africa, and all in with Africa.\u201d\u00a0 That means the United States is committed to deep, responsive, and genuine partnerships on the continent, because we believe we can only solve shared challenges \u2013 and deliver on the fundamental aspirations of our people \u2013 if we work together.\nOne way we\u2019re doing that is making good on the commitment that we\u2019ve made to help partners in Africa deal with the huge challenge of food insecurity.\u00a0 Last year, 140 million people in Africa suffered from acute food insecurity \u2013 a crisis exacerbated by COVID-19, by climate change, by conflict.\u00a0 This led to shortfalls in commodities, fertilizer, and fuel, all of which spiked prices and created supply chain disruptions.\u00a0 To meet that challenge, the United States has invested $13.5 billion last year to reduce acute and chronic hunger worldwide, largely in Africa.\nAt the same time, together with African countries, we\u2019re supporting immediate interventions like the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has brought Ukrainian grain to countries across Africa as well as lowering prices around the world.\nOver 4 million metric tons of wheat have gone directly to developing countries as a result of that initiative \u2013 that is the equivalent of 8 billion loaves of bread.\u00a0 Millions rely on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u00a0 It cannot be allowed to lapse.\nBut we\u2019ve also heard loudly and clearly from African partners that emergency aid cannot be the only solution.\u00a0 So we\u2019re investing in sustainable, long-term African food production \u2013 working with our African partners on innovative solutions that will ensure that Africa not only meets needs on the continent but can become a supplier for the rest of the world.\nToday, American and African scientists are collaborating to devise climate-resilient, nutritious crops.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on international efforts to significantly increase yields in Africa, including by mapping and improving the quality of topsoil.\u00a0 We\u2019re employing satellite photography technology to discover new water resources \u2013 as we recently did in Niger, where five new aquifers have been found, containing over 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.\u00a0 And we\u2019re harnessing public sector financing tools to unlock private sector investment that will expand infrastructure, agribusiness, and trade.\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to meet with AU Chairman Faki to discuss the partnership between the United States and the African Union.\u00a0 We\u2019ll talk about how the United States can help the AU realize its Agenda 2063 to build an integrated, prosperous, and peaceful Africa.\u00a0 And how the United States can best support the AU\u2019s regional economic integration goals as the African Continental Free Trade Area gets up and running.\u00a0 And this is something that\u2019s going to make a huge difference as African economies become increasingly integrated, that will increase trade and investment among them, but it will also attract even more investment and trade outside of Africa.\u00a0 We have had to date in Africa the abnormal situation where African countries are doing more trade and investment with countries outside of the continent than they do among themselves.\u00a0 When the free trade area gets up and running, that will change and I think it will be a very powerful tool for economic growth.\u00a0 I\u2019ll also convey our continued support for African representation in multilateral institutions, to include the United Nations Security Council and the G20.\nAfrican-led solutions are increasingly making the difference on the challenges of the 21st century.\u00a0 One of the most powerful testaments to the importance of African leadership has been the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement to end the conflict and suffering in northern Ethiopia.\nThe conflict was absolutely devastating.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands killed.\u00a0 Widespread sexual violence against women.\u00a0 Millions forced to flee their homes.\u00a0 Many left in need of food and shelter, medicine.\u00a0 Hospitals, schools, and businesses were shelled and destroyed.\nThe Cessation of Hostilities Agreement is a major achievement and step forward, saving lives and changing lives.\u00a0 The guns are silent.\nAs the fighting has stopped, human rights violations declined.\u00a0 Humanitarian assistance is flowing, finally reaching nearly all communities in need, services are being restored in the Tigray Region, the TPLF is disarming, Eritrean and other non-federal forces are departing.\u00a0 The dedicated diplomacy of the mediators from the African Union, from Kenya, from South Africa, supported by the United States, was essential to securing this agreement.\u00a0 And the AU monitoring mechanism is a key to its full implementation.\nPrime Minister Abiy and the Ethiopian federal government and Tigrayan regional leaders should be commended for reaching this agreement and the significant progress in delivering on their commitments.\u00a0 These efforts have created the foundation to rebuild the communities that have suffered so in Tigray, Amhara, and the Afar regions.\u00a0 They need the help and support.\nI strongly urged the inclusion as well of women in decision-making roles as the agreement is implemented \u2013 especially in light of gender-based violence that was perpetrated during the conflict.\nToday, I first met with Prime Minister Abiy, and then with the signatories to the agreement \u2013 the heads of delegation of the Government of Ethiopia and the TPLF \u2013 to underscore our support for peace as well as the dividends it can yield.\u00a0 And those dividends are important.\u00a0 People need to see that peace brings concrete dividends in their lives.\u00a0 That starts, of course, with the cessation of violence, but we want to build positive things on top of that.\nWe welcome the commitments that the parties have made to acknowledging the atrocities committed and their devastating consequences.\u00a0 For our part, the United States acknowledges the human rights violations and repression committed during the past three decades \u2013 actions which sowed the seeds of future conflict.\u00a0 We and others were insufficiently vocal about those abuses in the past.\nRecognizing the atrocities committed by all parties is an essential step to achieving a sustainable peace.\u00a0 We urge Ethiopians to follow through on their commitments to each other to implement an inclusive and comprehensive transitional justice process that includes both reconciliation and accountability.\u00a0 Overcoming poisonous grievances and ethnic divisions is the only way to break the cycle of political and ethnic violence in the north, in Oromia, or anywhere else.\u00a0 As a partner in that effort, the United States is providing both technical and financial support.\nBuilding lasting peace is being made more complicated by the acute economic challenges that Ethiopia faces resulting from the conflict, resulting from drought, resulting from food insecurity.\nAs I conveyed to Prime Minister Abiy, the United States \u2013 as Ethiopia\u2019s largest bilateral donor, providing over $3 billion in humanitarian assistance since 2020 \u2013 we will continue to be there for Ethiopians.\nWe\u2019ll keep partnering on food security.\u00a0 Today I announced an additional $331 million in emergency food and humanitarian assistance that will reach millions of people, millions of Ethiopians affected by conflict, affected by drought.\nWe\u2019ll keep working together on public health, building on our many years of partnership to combat HIV/AIDS, and continue to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that we\u2019re all prepared for future pandemics.\nWe\u2019ll continue to support Ethiopia\u2019s economic development, investing hundreds of millions in health, economic growth, education, democracy, and food security every year.\nAnd we\u2019ll continue to support migrants and refugees, and victims of human rights abuse.\nIn all (inaudible), our mission is to build a strong partnership between the United States and Ethiopia that ensures we can meet the aspirations of (inaudible).\nSo I look forward to an important week of engagement with our partners on the continent, including the engagements that we had today, building on a stretch of high-level visits from the administration since the Africa Leaders Summit: Treasury Secretary Yellen, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, First Lady Dr. Biden, and soon Vice President Harris, as she visits Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia later this month.\nSo with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Daphne Psaledakis with Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 There\u2019s been reports of continued atrocities since the November ceasefire.\u00a0 Eritrean troops still remain in border areas, and Fano Amhara militia still remain in western Tigray.\u00a0 Are you concerned that (inaudible)?\u00a0 It\u2019s not working.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I got you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Are you concerned that reported continued rapes and the presence of these troops could impede an effective implementation of the deal?\u00a0 And what do you need to see from Ethiopia in terms of addressing accusations of atrocities during the conflict to reinstate AGOA trade benefits?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 As I said, what we\u2019ve seen since the agreement was reached (inaudible) has been very significant progress on all the necessary lines of effort and necessary commitments, and by and large the guns are silent, humanitarian assistance is flowing, services are being restored.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the TPLF disarm its heavy weapons.\u00a0 And we are seeing external forces moving out of Tigray, to include the Eritreans.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s not complete.\u00a0 It\u2019s a process.\u00a0 But we continue to see significant movement in the right direction to fulfilling the commitments that were made in the agreement.\nAs to human rights concerns and abuses, I just had an opportunity to meet with human rights advocates and experts a short while ago here in Addis, and these are people who are themselves present or their organizations are present in Tigray, and this includes the United Nations.\u00a0 And what they reported to me is a very significant drop in human rights violations and abuses in Tigray.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also heard that from other sources.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve been eliminated, and indeed, we are \u2013 we strongly urge all parties to the conflict to do everything possible to ensure that they cease entirely.\u00a0 But again, we\u2019ve seen what was described to me by independent experts as a very significant diminution in human rights violations.\nWith regard to our own engagement and assistance as the work continues, as this process of implementing the agreement continues, to include making sure that there are no ongoing, proceeding violations of human rights, to include making sure that the transitional justice process is stood up and moving forward in an inclusive and credible way, then our own ability to continue to move forward on our engagement with Ethiopia \u2013 to include economic engagement \u2013 will also move forward.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s next go to Million Beyene with The Addis Standard.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Recently (inaudible) and that is the State Department has shelved a (inaudible) designating violent human rights violations in Tigray as genocide, and why is that shelved?\u00a0 And is there any (inaudible)?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nAnd (inaudible) campaign to (inaudible)?\u00a0 And will they discuss (inaudible) principles?\u00a0 I mean for the human rights and protect the UN investigation, the UN investigator\u2019s office (inaudible).\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 Let me make sure I got your question correct (inaudible).\u00a0 I think I did.\nFirst, let me be clear that the United States, first of all, has regularly spoken out about human rights violations and abuses committed against civilians and has called for accountability for those responsible.\u00a0 A year ago I addressed this myself when I said that all parties to the conflict had committed atrocities.\u00a0 Significantly, the signatories to the cessation of hostilities agreement acknowledged the atrocities committed and the devastating impact that they\u2019ve had.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re very focused on making sure that that\u2019s stopped and ceases.\nThe reports that we have including just today from experts in the field show a very significant drop in human rights violations in Tigray.\u00a0 That\u2019s significant and important, but obviously we want to see it get to \u2013 as in anyplace else \u2013 get to zero and that all parties remain committed to not engaging in any kind of abuse.\nGoing forward, what\u2019s very important is something else I mentioned: the commitment that exists to a process of transitional justice, and that includes both reconciliation and accountability.\u00a0 And what I heard today from everyone I spoke to was a commitment to that process.\u00a0 So we will be watching that as it moves forward, and this is something, again, that\u2019s vital not just for us or for any other country.\u00a0 It\u2019s first and foremost vital to all Ethiopians, because having that kind of transitional justice, building reconciliation, though, and building accountability, is the only way, in our judgment, to make sure that the peace that\u2019s been achieved in Tigray is sustained.\u00a0 Getting at grievances, getting to justice, bringing people together \u2013 that is the way to make sure that peace lasts and that people can move on with their lives and the country can really move forward.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s next go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if I can get your reaction \u2013 these are sort of two broader questions \u2013 wondering if I can get your reaction to the U.S.-Russia drone collision.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering what you make of Russia\u2019s motives here, their statements about the U.S. being directly involved in combat operations and the Russians potentially wanting to retrieve the debris.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a risk here that this widens the war further.\nAnd second, just on the recent Iran-Saudi agreement that was brokered in part by China, do you view this as a sign of China sort of striding more confidently onto the diplomatic world stage sort of post-COVID isolation?\u00a0 Is that \u2013 especially combined with their Ukraine peace proposal and the foreign minister\u2019s recent comments about U.S. containment, is this a worry?\u00a0 Is this sort of new posture a worry for the U.S.?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, with regard to the drone, the incident is being investigated and we\u2019ll look to that investigation to draw any conclusions about what the intent might be \u2013 might have been, what the actions were.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019ll be in close coordination with allies and partners at the conclusion of the investigation.\u00a0 I can\u2019t speak at this point to the motive or to intent.\u00a0 But what I can say very clearly is this was a reckless and unsafe action.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll let the investigation proceed.\nWith regard to the agreement reached between Saudi Arabia and Iran with China\u2019s involvement, from our perspective, anything that can help reduce tensions, avoid conflict, and curb in any way dangerous or destabilizing actions by Iran is a good thing.\u00a0 And as you know, in this particular case, the Saudis and the Iranians have been talking for some time going back a couple of years, including in Baghdad and in Oman.\u00a0 And to the extent that China facilitated conclusion of this agreement to restore diplomatic relations, that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s valuable that countries, where they can, take action, take responsibility for advancing security, for advancing peaceful relations.\u00a0 And if this agreement actually bears out, and particularly if Iran follows through on the commitments that it\u2019s apparently made, again, that would be positive.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Bilal Abdulmalik, Ethiopian Press Agency.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Many Ethiopians believe that U.S. decision to revoke Ethiopia\u2019s privilege for AGOA is a politically motivated one.\u00a0 And after such progress, the U.S. still hasn\u2019t shown an interest to reverse the decision (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So as you know, the United States suspended Ethiopia from the AGOA trade preference program effective January last year, 2022, due to gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u00a0 And we did this as required by law.\u00a0 It\u2019s in law and we follow the law.\u00a0 Ethiopia has clear benchmarks for a pathway toward reinstatement.\u00a0 The administration will continue to work closely with the government to achieve that objective, which we share.\u00a0 And as I noted earlier, with the cessation of hostilities agreement, and particularly with its implementation, that\u2019s extremely important in moving down that path, and my hope and expectation is that will continue.\nJust for your information, the AGOA program itself is actually administered by the U.S. Trade Representative, and what they do is they have an annual review that brings together other parts of our government, looking at the eligibility requirements.\u00a0 But there will be that process.\u00a0 We\u2019ll participate.\u00a0 We actually hosted a ministerial meeting of AGOA during the Africa Leaders Summit in December, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to planning AGOA (inaudible) next year.\nBut the bottom line is certainly we share the aspiration of Ethiopia returning to AGOA.\u00a0 And as it continues to implement the cessation of hostilities agreement, it will \u2013 it\u2019s clearly moving in the right direction.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Please take a seat.\u00a0 And it is a special honor for me to be able to say, welcome to the White House.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And welcome especially to the 2023 International Women of Courage Awards Ceremony to all of you participating here in person and tuning in from around the world.\nFor 17 years now, U.S. secretaries of state have recognized International Women of Courage who are leading the charge for progress around the world.\u00a0 This year, for the first time, we honor the awardees here\u00a0at the White House \u2013 and that really is a reflection of just how highly President Biden, the First Lady, and this administration prioritize gender equality and human rights.\nDr. Biden, thank you for bringing us here today.\u00a0 But thank you more than that for everything that you\u2019re doing every single day to be such a remarkable role model to so many women around the world, and for your incredibly tireless efforts to lift up the voices of brave women everywhere around the world.\nMRS BIDEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So we\u2019re joined today by ambassadors from across the globe, who are essential partners in all of our efforts to make sure that women and girls can reach their full potential.\nWe have senior leaders from across the United States Government here: Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, our champion, our voice, at the United Nations.\u00a0 Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks.\u00a0 Under Secretary of State Uzra Zeya, our advocate for human rights.\u00a0 Jen Klein, Kat Fotovat, who are leaders of our global gender policy.\u00a0 And of course White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, also such a powerful voice for our country and for this administration around the world.\u00a0 And I also want to point out our team from the Bureau for Educational and Cultural Affairs.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with so many of you every single day in the work that you\u2019re doing.\nWe\u2019re also joined by members of the State Department\u2019s Locally Employed Staff.\u00a0 They\u2019re literally the lifeblood of our missions in every country in the world.\u00a0 To be here today, some of them have traveled from more than a dozen countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, and the Middle East.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you today as well.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd in the audience we have several previous winners of the International Women of Courage Award, who are continuing their inspiring work.\u00a0 And the First Lady and I had an opportunity to greet them, to be able to say in person what we were not able to do the last couple of years, which is:\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0and thank you for the incredible work that you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd, of course, last but not least, our guests of honor, this year\u2019s International Women of Courage.\u00a0 Welcome to all of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWhen Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice launched this initiative in 2007, she did so to honor women creating brighter futures \u2013 for themselves, for their communities, and for generations to come.\nSince then, this award has recognized more than 180 women from over 80 countries around the world.\nAnd that includes this year\u2019s honorees: 11 truly extraordinary people.\nAs you\u2019ll hear, these women are reporting on Russian atrocities in Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019re fighting for equal opportunities for women and girls in Mongolia.\u00a0 They\u2019re defending democracy in the Central African Republic.\u00a0 They\u2019re protecting indigenous land in Costa Rica.\u00a0 They\u2019re advocating for the rights of refugees, people with disabilities, the LGBTQI+ community.\nBecause of their work, and even as they do it every single day, they are faced with extraordinary challenges that, as you learn about them, read about them, are humbling.\u00a0 They, their loved ones in many cases, have endured harassment.\u00a0 They\u2019ve endured violence.\u00a0 Some have been imprisoned.\u00a0 Others have been subject of misinformation and online attacks day in, day out.\u00a0 And yet each and every one has refused to be intimidated.\nIn every region, there are other women doing this work who we can\u2019t name individually \u2013 in some cases because the attention would put them at even greater risk.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve found a new way to honor them.\nThis year, we\u2019re launching a group award, named after a pioneer and champion of equality, the great Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.\u00a0 We have \u2013 (applause) \u2013 we have several members of the Albright family here today to help us celebrate.\u00a0 I like to think I\u2019m an extended member of that family.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 For me, as I\u2019ve told our friends, I hear Madeleine Albright\u2019s voice in my head on a regular basis; the clarity with which she spoke and what she said continues to resonate and continues to inspire me in the work that I and my team are doing.\u00a0 But you honor us with your presence today.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\nAround the world, women \u2013 in all of their diversity \u2013 are often the ones on the front lines of change.\u00a0 And yet, at the same time, they face still greater obstacles to their political participation; they experience gender-based violence and human rights abuses; they hold less economic and social power.\u00a0 We are committed to changing that.\nDefending the rights of women and girls is rooted in our democratic values of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.\u00a0 And when we advance equality and defend the rights of women, we improve life for everyone.\u00a0 When peace is forged with the participation and the leadership of women, it\u2019s more likely to last.\u00a0 We know this from experience.\u00a0 Closing the gender gap in the global workforce would add $28 trillion to the global economy.\u00a0 And as Secretary Albright once said, we simply cannot build the future that we want without the contribution of women.\nThat\u2019s why President Biden has made gender equality and women\u2019s rights a priority of our foreign policy.\u00a0 Some of you know we recently launched the first-ever, cross-government Strategy on Women\u2019s Global Economic Security, to try to help reduce the enduring wage gap, to improve access to well-paying jobs, to dismantle barriers to women\u2019s economic participation.\u00a0 In December, the United States also updated our strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based violence globally, including new efforts to expand access to programs for historically marginalized communities.\nWe\u2019re also learning from \u2013 and teaming up with \u2013 governments, civil society, the private sector in other countries to work toward gender equality together, including, of course, the women that we\u2019re honoring today.\u00a0 One of those women \u2013 Hadeel Abdel Aziz \u2013 noted that, when it comes to advancing this struggle, success is \u201cnot about one big act\u201d \u2013 \u201cnot about one big act of heroism, but \u2026 one hundred small battles.\u201d\nTo our honorees, the United States is proud to be by your side, as you and others wage those hundred small battles, day in, day out.\u00a0 And we will be there and be there with you for the long haul.\nThat includes, of course, the First Lady of the United States, Dr. Jill Biden.\u00a0 The First Lady.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The First Lady delivered remarks.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights at the U.S. Department of State Uzra Zeya.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUNDER SECRETARY ZEYA:\u00a0 It takes courage to seek justice when the powerful stand against you.\nLaws can protect the innocent or persecute the oppressed.\u00a0 And when the rule of law becomes a tool of tyranny, or when the structures in place simply fail to live up to the promise of equality, fairness, and humanity, we appeal to a higher ideal: justice.\nThe women we honor today have worked tirelessly to ensure that their nations\u2019 legal systems protect all people, no matter their gender, beliefs, or background.\u00a0 And when those systems cannot \u2013 or will not \u2013 protect every citizen, they have fought to transform them.\u00a0 They have broken barriers, risen to new heights, and inspired other young women to follow their lead.\nBecause without women\u2019s rights, perspectives, and participation, there can be no justice.\u00a0 But when we all have the opportunity to shape our laws, we create systems that truly serve us all.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nAnd now, Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken will present the awards.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs the first woman to lead the Central African Republic\u2019s Constitutional Court, Dani\u00e8le Darlan became known as the \u201cwoman of iron\u201d for her refusal to be intimidated.\u00a0 She\u2019s spent her career working to ensure the law delivers justice to all, no matter their background.\u00a0 And in the face of enormous pressure to allow the president to rewrite the constitution to give himself an illegal third term, she refused, sacrificing her career to safeguard the rule of law.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs founder and executive director of Jordan\u2019s Justice Center for Legal Aid, Hadeel Abdel Aziz provides legal services to thousands of people every year who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to a lawyer.\u00a0 She works to educate people about their rights so that they know how to protect themselves and are empowered to do so.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDuring political unrest in Kazakhstan, which resulted in deaths and credible reports of torture, longtime civil rights advocate Bakhytzhan Toregozhina used phone calls to expose human rights violations during an internet blackout.\u00a0 She then founded a coalition to document violations and provide legal and mental health support to victims of torture and abuse.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPlease join me once more in congratulating these incredible women.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDEPUTY SECRETARY HICKS:\u00a0 It takes courage to seek peace when you are the target of violence.\nWhen wars are waged, when authoritarians seek to consolidate power, when conflict uproots and displaces families, women and girls shoulder many of the costs and consequences.\nThose who wish to harm and turn their violence on women and girls often do so because women and girls serve as a society\u2019s source of strength and a beacon of hope.\nIt\u2019s because when women use their voices to speak out against authoritarianism, their leadership can create lasting democratic change.\nWhen women use their voices to stand up for what\u2019s right against overwhelming odds, their voices can reverberate around the world.\nAnd when women have a seat at the table, they hold the power to lead their communities toward peace and prosperity.\nAnd that\u2019s the truth.\nStudies show that when women participate in peace negotiations, these talks are more likely to come to a just settlement and result in lasting stability.\nPeace is possible when we support the women working to make it a reality \u2013 by stopping conflicts before they begin, by addressing the root causes of discrimination and violence, and by working to end wars that have already begun and mitigating their harm.\nSo today, we salute several women leaders who are exhibiting extraordinary courage to seek peace when they themselves are the targets of violence; women who are using their strength to pursue gender equity and equality in the face of extreme cruelty and hate; women who are fighting for dignity and freedom for not just themselves but for others.\nIn our awardees, we see that our capacity for understanding and healing is stronger than the forces that try to tear us apart \u2013 and we are reminded that women belong everywhere the decisions are made.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nOn behalf of Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken, I\u2019m honored to present awards to the following women.\nIn Mongolia, Brigadier General Bolor Ganbold is the first female staff officer in her country to be assigned to a United Nations peacekeeping operation \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and the first female general to serve in the Mongolian armed forces.\u00a0 Brigadier Ganbold has served in peacekeeping missions around the world, and she has advocated for gender equality in peacekeeping forces and her country\u2019s military, so that women and girls can be properly protected during and after conflicts.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn Costa Rica, Doris R\u00edos has dedicated her life to fighting for indigenous women\u2019s rights to life and dignity and for the reclamation of indigenous lands.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 In the face of threats of violence and attacks against her and her family, she has created a seat at the table for indigenous women to make the world more peaceful and just.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn Argentina, Alba Rueda is a transgender woman who was kicked out of classrooms, barred for sitting for exams, refused job opportunities, subjected to violence, and rejected by her family.\u00a0 But in the face of these challenges, she worked to end violence and discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community in Argentina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAfter women were barred from schools in Afghanistan, Zakira Hekmat secretly finished high school and won a scholarship to study in T\u00fcrkiye, eventually becoming a doctor.\u00a0 After seeing the difficulty refugees faced, she founded the Afghan Refugee Solidarity Association to advocate for the rights of all refugees and women.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt is my privilege and honor \u2013 to honor each of you for your important contributions to human rights and for making the world a more peaceful place.\nCongratulations, and thank you for your courage.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome White House Press Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS JEAN-PIERRE:\u00a0 It takes courage to speak when those in power want to stay \u2013 want you to stay silent.\nIn a world where lies and distortion are easy to sell, one of the most powerful weapons that we have is the truth.\nBecause corruption thrives in darkness, dictators and authoritarians seek to control criticism and define the stories that we tell.\u00a0 They threaten journalists and those who speak out, so they can control knowledge and hide their crimes \u2013 selling their people false stories of peace and success.\nBut when we illuminate the shadows, we can expose the damage they create \u2013 lighting a path forward for those trapped in the dark with the knowledge and the strength to rise and demand change.\nThis group of journalists, broadcasters, and war correspondents spread truth, courage, and empower other women and girls to use their voices for democracy, freedom, and justice.\n(A video was played.)\nAnd once again, Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken will present the awards.\nThrough her independent YouTube news channel, Roha TV, veteran Ethiopian journalist Meaza Mohammed shares stories of those who are often silenced.\u00a0 Despite three arrests in under one year, she continued to raise her voice, advocating for survivors of gender-based violence and urging accountability for crimes committed against them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWhile helping evacuate women and children from areas affected by war, Ukrainian military veteran Yuliia Paievska secretly documented Russian forces-committed atrocities during the 2022 siege of Mariupol.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 She smuggled a memory card to the Associated Press in a tampon, and was forced to destroy another with her teeth before being captured by Russian forces and tortured for information.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Since her release, she has continued to raise her voice for her people, pushing for peace and independence for Ukraine.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs a broadcaster journalist, Ras Adiba Radzi became a household name.\u00a0 After a car accident and brutal assault permanently paralyzed her from the waist down, she used her platform to advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities \u2013 (applause) \u2013 first as a reporter, and now as a senator in Malaysia\u2019s parliament and the first female chair of the national Malaysian news agency, Bernama.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWhile Polish journalist Bianka Zalewska was combating Russian misinformation in 2014, her car was shot, causing accident that broke her spine.\u00a0 Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, and in the face of intimidation and death threats, she continues her work documenting war crimes, lifting up stories of refugees, and training other journalists to effectively counter misinformation.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPlease join me in a round of applause for all of our awardees.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD:\u00a0 Hello, everyone.\u00a0 It really is a privilege to present this new award \u2013 one that honors our first female Secretary of State, the late Madeleine Albright.\nSecretary Albright showed so many women, including myself, how to lead with moral clarity and with courage.\nHer legacy lives on in those still fighting for gender equality and universal human rights.\nIt is fitting that this award recognizes not just one woman, but the bravery, the fortitude, and collaboration of a whole movement.\nIt speaks to the outsized impact of Secretary Albright\u2019s example and life of service.\nWhen the Albright family \u2013 who is here with us today \u2013 learned about this award, they asked that another trailblazing leader \u2013 one who knew Secretary Albright well \u2013 be part of this ceremony: Secretary Condoleezza Rice.\nSecretary Rice created the International Women of Courage award in 2007, and though she couldn\u2019t join us today, she wanted to take part in this very special ceremony.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nAnd I wish they could be here to hear your applause.\nI\u2019m proud to present the Madeleine K. Albright Honorary Group International Women of Courage Award.\nThis inaugural award goes to women and girls in Iran, who \u2013 in the wake of the brutal killing of Mahsa Amini \u2013 have inspired us all.\nAll Mahsa wanted was to live a normal and happy life.\u00a0 She dreamed of starting a family after finishing her studies.\nBut these hopes and dreams were crushed.\u00a0 They were crushed by the tyranny of Iran\u2019s so-called \u201cmorality police.\u201d\nThe Iranian Government probably thought this would just be another footnote in a long record of violence and discrimination against women.\nBut this time \u2013 this time it was different.\nThe Iranian people \u2013 led by women \u2013 took to the streets in peaceful protest.\nThey followed in the footsteps of brave women before them, who sacrificed so much in the name of freedom.\u00a0 Through neighborhoods and classrooms, out of apartment buildings and car windows, the protesters chanted throughout Iran and around the world, creating a global chorus demanding gender equality and human rights.\nBut for all the hope this movement represents, we must never forget how the Iranian regime has responded.\nThey have tortured peaceful protesters.\u00a0 They have arrested tens of thousands of people.\u00a0 They have badly injured and killed Iranians in bloody crackdowns.\nThe international community must continue to condemn the regime\u2019s repression and violence.\nAnd we must back up our words with action.\nThat\u2019s why the United States led a successful effort to remove Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women.\nAnd it\u2019s why we are working to hold those complicit in these abuses accountable.\nTo all the women and girls across Iran \u2013 know this:\u00a0 We will continue to stand with you in your fight for women, for life, and for freedom.\nSo everyone, please join me in recognizing the courageous women and girls in Iran.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you.\nI now have the honor of introducing another courageous woman who has been an unwavering champion for vulnerable populations in Malaysia.\nWhen a car accident and a brutal assault paralyzed Senator Ras Adiba Radzi from the waist down, she dedicated her life to advocacy.\nTo raise awareness, Malaysians across the country saw her on TV, in parliament, and at the Paralympics.\u00a0 They heard her commentary.\u00a0 They heard her poetry.\u00a0 They heard her fierce call for justice.\nIn May 2020, she became Malaysia\u2019s representative for people with disabilities \u2013 and later that year, she was appointed the first female chair of the Malaysian National News Agency.\nSenator Ras Adiba Radzi embodies \u2013 she embodies what it means to live a life in service to others.\u00a0 Please join me in welcoming her to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS RADZI:\u00a0\u00a0Assalamu alaikum, or peace be upon you.\nI\u2019m Senator Ras Adiba Radzi, a representative of the 2023 International Women of Courage Award.\u00a0 Before I begin, I would like to thank the First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, the Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, and the U.S. Department of State for giving me the opportunity to speak today.\nI\u2019d have to say that I\u2019m thoroughly impressed by the amazing work done by my fellow finalists in their respective countries.\u00a0 Let\u2019s give them a big hand.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Among others, I am joined by women who are fighting against gender-based violence, for the rights of indigenous persons, and for the rule of law.\nHonorable guests, I was born able-bodied and became permanently paralyzed from the waist down after several incidents.\u00a0 I became a spinal-cord-injured person following a car accident in 1995, a brutal assault a year later, and finally in 2002 when I fell after climbing a ladder.\nSince then, I have committed my life to fighting for the rights of persons with disabilities in my country, Malaysia.\u00a0 I witnessed discrimination and stigma as persons with disabilities and then on my team and I fought and fought and fought.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, I have been working tirelessly to create awareness on the importance of accessibility in infrastructure, disability inclusion, job opportunities, inclusive education, housing, and upholding our rights, among others.\nI and my team then founded an association to empower persons with disabilities called OKU Sentral.\u00a0 In May 2020, the Malaysian king, His Majesty the King Al-Sultan Abdullah, appointed me as a senator in the upper house parliament of Malaysia to represent persons with disabilities.\u00a0 In November 2020, I was appointed the first female chair of the Malaysian National News Agency, BERNAMA, after 53 years of its establishment.\nDistinguished guests, in the area of sustainable development, all of us here aim to create a world which is inclusive, equitable, and sustainable, a world in which no one is left behind and opportunities be made available for all, for a secure, stable, and successful nation.\u00a0 Without the role and contribution of women, a nation will not be able to progress as it is today.\u00a0 It is vital for all parties to respect the contribution of women in all areas: economy, social, politics and culture.\u00a0 Women\u2019s involvement is crucial, as they are an important asset to a country.\nSo let\u2019s, again, give a big round of applause \u2013 and actually I feel like hugging them all \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 especially to the women here and to women across the world who have excelled in their roles and contributed towards a prosperous nation worldwide. We are at a pivotal moment for women\u2019s rights.\u00a0 For us, receiving this International Women of Courage Award is very, very much significant for our people in each of our countries.\u00a0 This will be an integral part of spreading awareness and will celebrate the activism and transformative power of women and girls.\nHonorable guests, this opportunity is indeed an honor for me to share my views and experience, especially concerning the protection and social participation of persons with disabilities in Malaysia with everyone here today. Despite the increasing awareness around persons with disabilities, there is no denial that there\u2019s discrimination in this polarized world, exists to the detriment of our disabled friends.\u00a0 It exists because of a prevailing mindset, a stereotypical way of looking at the disabled.\u00a0 What the community needs to understand and to accept is that persons with disabilities are entitled to the full range of civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights, as stated in various human rights instruments, the same as everyone else.\nOn that note, and as we speak, the Malaysian Government is in the midst of amending the Persons with Disabilities Act 2008 to have an Anti-Discrimination Act for Persons with Disabilities like the United Kingdom\u2019s and the Americans with Disability Act 1990 or ADA.\nEsteemed guests, raising awareness of basic human rights and the right to be free of discrimination among women, children, and persons with disabilities is the fundamental aspect in which we must continue to work on.\u00a0 Without such awareness, it is extremely difficult to bring about justice and change.\u00a0 The increasing number of hate crimes, racist remarks, and instances of ableist behavior shows that we must act quickly to protect the most vulnerable communities.\nHence, I would like to take this opportunity to call on the 195 governments of the day in the world to ensure that the marginalized and vulnerable groups \u2013 women, children, including persons with disabilities \u2013 are not left out and rise to the clarion call of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda: leave no one behind.\nBefore I end my speech, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the late Judith Heumann, a leader in the disability community, advocating for persons with disabilities and has been the mother of the disability rights movement since the \u201970s.\u00a0 We will miss her terribly.\u00a0 But myself and the rest of us, I promise you, will continue to be her voice.\u00a0 As she puts it, we are leaders of inclusiveness and community, of love, equity, and justice.\nHonorable guests, me standing here today \u2013 in my standing wheelchair \u2013 means a whole lot, especially for my countrymen, Malaysia.\u00a0 So I\u2019d like to say in Malay\u00a0sejuta doa mencapai bintang, which means a million prayers has now reached the skies.\nTerima kasih\u00a0or thank you for this honor, and from the bottom of my heart,\u00a0assalamu alaikum.\u00a0\u00a0(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Please welcome Acting Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women\u2019s Issues at the U.S. Department of State Kat Fotovat.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR FOTOVAT:\u00a0\u00a0What an honor it is to close out such a historic day, such a historic event.\u00a0 Happy International Women\u2019s Day to all those around the world and to our amazing Women of Courage we honor today.\u00a0 What an incredible ceremony.\nI must say, I am rendered nearly speechless by the senator\u2019s remarks.\u00a0 Your resilience, determination, and grit in the fact of extreme adversity and your resolve to continue to fight for women\u2019s rights as human rights, to achieve a better future for us, is both humbling and energizing.\nI couldn\u2019t also help but think of my dear friend and personal hero Judy Heumann, whose funeral I attended just this morning.\u00a0 Judy was a leader of the international disability rights movement who said, \u201cI simply refused to accept what I was told about who I could be.\u00a0 And I was willing to make a fuss about it.\u201d\u00a0 Through your work, senator, and the work of all of our awardees, Judy\u2019s legacy of defending the rights and communities facing discrimination will live on.\u00a0 You and all of our International Women of Courage awardees are truly inspirational for your courage and, as Judy noted, to make a fuss about it.\nI\u2019m so honored to be here at the White House today to join First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Secretary Blinken, and the other distinguished speakers who joined us to pay tribute to the recipients of the Secretary of State 2023 International Women of Courage Awards.\u00a0 The IWOC Award is truly a centerpiece and guiding force behind my office\u2019s work to lead the Department of State\u2019s efforts to promote the rights and empowerment of women and girls worldwide, and it is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and assistance.\nToday, our awardees join a truly incredible group of more than 180 women from more than 80 countries who have received the International Women of Courage Award since 2007\u00a0in recognition of the exceptional courage, strength, and leadership all of you have shown, advocating for peace, justice, human rights, and gender equity and equality, often at great personal risk and sacrifice.\u00a0 I hope this award will elevate your advocacy work and bring greater international attention to the issues that you are fighting for.\nEvery day, as my colleagues and I carry out our mission, working with our partners to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, advance women\u2019s economic security, and promote the women, peace, and security agenda across the globe, we draw inspiration from fearless women\u2019s rights champions like the courageous women who are \u2013 we are gathered here to honor today, and also from their advocates, defenders, their family members, government allies, civil society leaders, and journalists who are also in this room today championing gender equity and equality, not just in words but in action.\nToday, on International Women\u2019s Day, the U.S. Government reaffirms our commitment to the safety and full participation of women and girls in decision-making at all levels and as foundational to peace, stability, and economic growth of all nations.\nI\u2019d also like to quote Secretary Albright, who said, \u201cIt took me a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nTo our 2023 Courage Awards, thank you again for using your voices and being the voice for those who can\u2019t use theirs.\u00a0 Let us all commit to using our voices to amplify those facing oppression, crisis, and in conflict in places like Iran, Ukraine, and Afghanistan, and all over the world.\nCongratulations\u00a0to our awardees, and thank you for all you have done to give women and girls everywhere a fighting chance.\u00a0 We stand with you and for you.\u00a0 And thank you, everyone here today, joining us to celebrate these truly amazing and courageous women.\u00a0 Happy International Women\u2019s Day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

you to the business end of the Raisina Dialogue after yesterday\u2019s inauguration.\u00a0 For us at ORF and at the Raisina Dialogue, this is a very special day.\u00a0 Many years ago, 2017 if I recall, we toyed with the idea of bringing the admirals from Quad together.\u00a0 I can see the Pacific Command table here, and the Pacific Command was instrumental partner in trying to cajole others to join in to having and discussing the possibilities of Quad being an actor, being a player, being a contributor to the world at whole.\u00a0 Let me tell you, all capitals are very shy, and everyone was asking us at that time should we probably involve another country, someone else, so that it doesn\u2019t look like Quad, that doesn\u2019t feel like Quad, we can try and dilute it a little.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0from\u00a0that\u00a0time many years ago to today when we have the Quad Squad sitting here, we have come a long way.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0we are thrilled and thank you all of you very \u2013 for joining us, and it\u2019s a fantastic day for Raisina.\u00a0 So let me start with Minister Wong.\u00a0 Minister Wong, you\u2019ve just stepped out of a meeting.\u00a0 You had a formal meeting this morning\u00a0of\u00a0\u2013 with your colleagues.\u00a0 Let me ask you: How does this group add to your agenda?\u00a0 You are now writing Australian foreign policy future.\u00a0 How does this meeting help in your individual agenda in Australia?\u00a0 And\u00a0certainly\u00a0since you are focused on the Pacific and ASEAN, how can Quad be a complementary actor, a supportive actor, perhaps even a contributor to your own assessment and ambitions in that region?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0Well, can I start with a complementarity point because I think that answers the first part of your question?\u00a0 I mean, the complementarity of this configuration with the architecture of the region, some of which you referenced, I think is demonstrated from Australia\u2019s perspective by our geography and by our interests.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nSo\u00a0in terms of our geography, we are the smallest economy here.\u00a0 We\u2019re the most \u2013\u00a0southern most\u00a0economy here.\u00a0 We are bounded on one side by the Indian Ocean and the other side by the Pacific, as it,\u00a0Asia \u2013\u00a0ASEAN in particular, to\u00a0our north the countries of ASEAN.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0for us, our interests lie in a world which is being reshaped and a region which is being reshaped in working through this and the architecture of the region to ensure a region which I describe as stable, peaceful, secure, and respectful of sovereignty.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0our geography and our interests lead to complementarity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I also believe that there is a tangible complementarity in the sense that there are things that we engage with Pacific Island nations on, things with which we engage with the ASEAN \u2013 countries of the ASEAN region on, issues on which we engage in this grouping, and they are all aligned with our interests in economic development, in prosperity, in stability, and in the protection of sovereignty.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Since you\u2019re also in the very first year of your \u2013 of the new role that you\u2019ve assumed, and to the Indian audience that\u2019s hearing you, what is Australia\u2019s assessment of India\u2019s role in the region, in your life?\u00a0 And by inference, perhaps also where are we headed in the bilateral?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0I mean, India is \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0And can I request you to bring the mike closer to you?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0Right.\u00a0 I could answer the question in power terms and in influence terms.\u00a0 I could talk about the extent to which India is a critical power, a great power in the region, that there is no reshaping of the Indo-Pacific with the attributes that Australia would seek without India.\u00a0 I\u2019d also make the point \u2013 and I think we\u2019ve seen that in not only in how Jai engages with the world and his narrative around it, but also Prime Minister Modi.\u00a0 India is a civilizational power \u2013 brings a different perspective to some of the challenges of these times.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m going to come back to you, Minister Wong, but let me now turn to Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 One of the big conversations in India and other parts of the Indo-Pacific certainly is around how distracted is America with the conflict in Europe and how committed is it to continuing to engage in this region.\u00a0 Is Quad an interim consultative group even as the real action unfolds with your old allies and in the old world?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think the very fact not only of our presence here today but our presence and engagement day-in, day-out, including through the Quad and the work that we\u2019re doing not only during the meetings that we have but in between, is powerful evidence of the fact that, as you might say, we can run and chew gum at the same time.\u00a0 And for us the future is so much in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our engagement throughout the region,\u00a0both through the Quad and in other ways,\u00a0is as comprehensive and as deep as any time I can remember.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I think what we talked about yesterday\u00a0in the course of\u00a0the G20 was also illustrative of this, because even as we\u2019re rightly focused on what is happening in Ukraine as a result of the Russian aggression, not just because it matters to Ukrainians and to Ukraine and to Europe, but because it matters to the entire world.\u00a0 The principles that underlie the entire international system that are necessary for trying to keep peace, the stability that grew out of two world wars are being challenged, being aggressed along with Ukraine.\u00a0 And part of the reason that countries way beyond Europe are also so focused on this and are working to support Ukraine and deal with the challenge is because they know it could have an effect here.\u00a0 If we allow with impunity Russia to do what it\u2019s doing in Ukraine, then that\u2019s a message to\u00a0wouldbe\u00a0aggressors everywhere that they may be able to get away with it too.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut having said that, you saw\u00a0yesterday\u00a0and you see today in this meeting of the Quad an equally intense focus on the issues that are having an impact on the lives of\u00a0all of\u00a0our fellow citizens where the Quad is a force, I believe, for good, positive, affirmative action.\u00a0 What\u2019s in so many ways important about it is this: first, we start with the proposition that virtually none of the challenges that our people are facing and that people around the world are facing can be effectively dealt with by any one country acting alone, whether it\u2019s the United States, whether it\u2019s India, whether it\u2019s Japan, whether it\u2019s Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd given that basic premise, it makes sense for us to start by finding likeminded groups of countries with which to tackle these challenges.\u00a0 And the great power of the Quad is you have four likeminded countries united in their basic values, united in their basic interests, bringing different strengths, different experiences, different comparative weights to tackling these problems.\u00a0 And not only tackling for\u00a0ourselves, but\u00a0actually creating\u00a0a\u00a0global commons\u00a0good, particularly for other countries in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years\u00a0in particular is\u00a0translated that into very practical projects, very practical \u2013 in a sense \u2013 offerings, so that we\u2019re creating for other countries in the region a positive choice and a positive partner.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that \u2013 obviously we did this on vaccines under \u2013 during COVID.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing it on infrastructure for some time.\u00a0 We are now engaged very much in working together to help countries deal with humanitarian situations, disasters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd of course, we\u2019re working on things that are\u00a0really critical\u00a0in ways that may not be so obvious to countries throughout the region, which is what\u2019s called maritime domain awareness: giving countries the capacity, the tools, to have a full picture of everything that\u2019s happening in their maritime space, which is affecting the lives of many of their citizens; for example, illegal fishing.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0I think not only are we not distracted; on the contrary, we\u2019re more deeply engaged than ever, and the Quad is one of the most critical vehicles for that engagement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Secretary, our bilateral relationships, India-U.S. bilateral relationships, have taken a step forward with this latest critical and emerging technologies agreement, a lot of excitement, a lot of coverage.\u00a0 Can the Quad elevate itself to collaborate on critical defense technologies, or is that going to be the \u2013 preserved for AUKUS and for the old partners?\u00a0 Does Quad have a vision for also working together on building the defense for future?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019d say two things.\u00a0 First, of course this is not a military grouping.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that kind of alliance.\u00a0 But one of the things that we are doing through the Quad is trying to bring together not only governments but academia and other experts to look at where we might\u00a0collaborate together\u00a0on new technology, on innovation, and whether that has benefits in other areas remains to be seen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut clearly, our four countries\u00a0in particular are\u00a0very well-placed to increase in a variety of ways our collaboration on emerging technology and on innovation, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll also do through the Quad.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Minister Hayashi, is Quad relevant for Japan\u2019s maritime security concerns?\u00a0 How is it important for what\u2019s unfolding in East China Sea?\u00a0 Do you think it is a feel-good talk shop consultative group, or do you think it has the potential to be able to put together something that will be of use to you when things get rough?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Thank you, thank you.\u00a0 Like Tony said, this Quad is not for security issues nor military issues, but practical cooperation like everybody said.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0since your question is about might and security, this is not directly for the security, but through\u00a0those cooperation\u00a0and including four\u00a0of\u00a0us, and then the\u00a0(inaudible) Blue Pacific areas like Pacific Island countries and ASEAN\u00a0and also\u00a0South Asia.\u00a0\u00a0This understanding and mutual understanding and cooperation, then the \u2013 there will make some combined will to cherish the same value\u00a0like\u00a0democracy, freedom, and that will eventually help to have more security assurance environment for all of us.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Okay, it\u2019s not a security actor.\u00a0 The other important area that\u00a0Japan\u00a0is focused on is connectivity, and it is investing in infrastructure across the region.\u00a0 Do you think Quad can have an agenda for connectivity and infrastructure?\u00a0 Do you think it could be an actor and contribute to that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Yes, through our bilateral ODAs\u00a0and also\u00a0through some international institutions,\u00a0we\u2019ve\u00a0been already in many decades doing some infrastructure\u00a0and also\u00a0economic cooperation in these areas.\u00a0 But on the top of that this Quad is not only bilateral like Japan and some countries, but this is\u00a0a\u00a0Quad\u00a0as a whole will\u00a0be coordinating all those efforts of four countries so that we can do much better than just one plus one plus one is four.\u00a0 One plus one plus one plus one is four, but\u00a0the\u00a0one plus one plus one plus one could be six, seven or eight by coordinating and listening.\u00a0 We have now eight ears to listen to all those needs of the\u00a0countries, and\u00a0communicate and coordinating in the Quad like we did in this morning.\u00a0 We can listen\u00a0more\u00a0and we can do more.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Eight ears, but you also have four tongues, and we\u00a0have to\u00a0be watchful there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut let me ask you the last final question for this round to you, Minister Hayashi.\u00a0 The China factor.\u00a0 Many of us have a very strong economic relationship \u2013 Japan certainly does \u2013 with China.\u00a0 China disapproves of the Quad, and in some sense, you\u00a0have to\u00a0navigate that as well.\u00a0 How does Japan do that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0like we said, like I said, this not a military but this is just practical\u00a0cooperation\u00a0and we don\u2019t\u00a0trying\u00a0to exclude anybody.\u00a0 This is an open architecture.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0one thing we would like to say is to just abide by the law, of international law, international institutions.\u00a0 And\u00a0as long as\u00a0even China\u00a0abide\u00a0by the rule of the international norm\u00a0and also\u00a0act like \u2013 act under the international institutions, standards, and laws, then this is not conflicting issues between China and the Quad.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Let me turn to you, Minister Jaishankar, and perhaps you can enlighten us.\u00a0 Why was Quad in some ways dead on arrival 10 to 15 years ago when the first avatar was being discussed, debated, even considered, to today India hosting the Quad panel discussion at Raisina Dialogue?\u00a0 What changed, why did it change, and how does this really reflect how you assess the importance of the region and the group in the region?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS\u00a0MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Well, Samir, I don\u2019t think it was dead on arrival.\u00a0 It was dead a few months after arrival, and there\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s important to understand why, because by some coincidence I happen to be associated with different phases of the Quad.\u00a0 I take the Quad back to Boxing Day 2004 when the Indian Ocean tsunami happened.\u00a0 It so happened at that time I was the country coordinator for our external coordination and response.\u00a0 Then in 2006 when Prime Minister Abe came to India, he\u00a0before coming had this idea that the Quad could be an effective way of dealing with the challenges.\u00a0 There was\u00a0actually a\u00a0Quad meeting \u2013 if my memory serves me right \u2013 in Manila in 2007, and then, as you say, it didn\u2019t work out.\u00a0 If you ask\u00a0me\u00a0why didn\u2019t it work out as opposed to what happened 10 years later \u2013 because it was revived 10 years later, 2017, at the level of\u00a0under secretaries, vice ministers; I was foreign secretary then \u2013 \u201917 it was revived, then \u201919 it became a foreign\u00a0ministers\u00a0level.\u00a0 And when the Biden administration came in in \u201921, it became a summit level.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0what\u2019s the difference between \u201917, \u201919, \u201921, as opposed to 2007?\u00a0 One, I think there was greater strategic clarity on the part of all the countries concerned.\u00a0 Two, our own inter-state relations changed during this period.\u00a0 If I were to look at India\u2019s ties with the U.S., it became much deeper; with Japan\u00a0also\u00a0it grew; and I think the real big change has been in the last decade with Australia.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0in a way, Quad is working in 2023 partly, as I said, because we have greater strategic clarity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI also think we have leaderships with a greater sense of purpose who are less encumbered by baggage.\u00a0 But to me, a big difference is\u00a0actually our\u00a0inter-state relationship, which has today become so much more confident and so much deeper.\u00a0 So, in fact, the one point I would differ with Minister Hayashi \u2013 actually, I hope one day it will be 1,111, the one-one-one-one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 When you walked in, all of you seemed quite at ease, and there was a bit of a relaxed feel, vibe to it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 There\u2019s always a relaxed feel when we meet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0what did you discuss inside the room?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 A lot of things, but if my colleagues would indulge me, we\u00a0actually today\u00a0captured some of our discussions in the form of a statement.\u00a0 I think that statement would have been put out or will be put out.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0if you ask me what were the new things which came out today, we agreed on a counterterrorism working group; we agreed on cooperating more closely with the Indian Ocean Rim Association; we agreed that there would be a \u2013 we had earlier worked out a HADR Quad initiative, so the standard operating procedures for that, which I think the military people would obviously see as a prerequisite for their cooperation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI think we coordinated on the UN to make sure that the processes of the UN are respected and the workings of the UN sort of stay true to its spirit.\u00a0 I was personally happy that there was a stronger expression of support from all of us collectively to the reform of the UN, to the fact that there would be intergovernmental negotiations on the reform.\u00a0 I also see that on \u2013 when it comes to sustainable development goals, which all of us are committed to, we believe that they should be pursued comprehensively, not cherrypicked for political convenience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe will be doing our maritime security working group very shortly in Washington, and we discussed \u2013 among other things, one of the outcomes we agreed on was that the listings of terrorists \u2013 the counterterrorism side listings \u2013 should not be politicized.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0these were some of the outcomes.\u00a0 So, I mean, there were a lot of things which I can\u2019t tell you, so \u2013 but this is the public side of what we can tell you.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0I thought collectively I should be putting it out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 And how do you respond to this common refrain that most politicians seem to indulge in from the Quad countries that this is not against anyone, we are not a security grouping, we are not a military grouping.\u00a0 Why are we apologetic?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t think \u2013 look, we are not apologetic.\u00a0 I do believe \u2013 because I keep reminding people of 2004, because to me, if your origins are in common good, there\u2019s a lot \u2013 there\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0innate virtue in your existence, okay?\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0we do stand for something.\u00a0 What I would not like to be defined as is standing against something or somebody, because that diminishes me.\u00a0 That makes it out as though some other people are the center of the world and I\u2019m only there to be for them or against them.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think \u2013 actually, I think I\u2019m the center of the world, but that\u2019s a different matter.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Okay, so I\u2019m going to turn to \u2013 as is custom here, I\u2019m going to turn to our young fellows.\u00a0 We have 48 young fellows from 33 countries who are spending two weeks with us, and typically we go to a couple of them for every session to hear their thoughts, their questions for all of you.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0I\u2019ll turn to \u2013 first to Teesta and then to\u00a0Kirtbir.\u00a0 Teesta, introduce yourself very briefly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good morning, ministers.\u00a0 My name is Teesta Prakash and I\u2019m from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra, and my question to you is:\u00a0 How do we build a regional consensus in the Indo-Pacific given the four Quad countries sit on the periphery of the Indo-Pacific?\u00a0 How do we then include Southeast Asia?\u00a0 How do we bring the Pacific Islands with us to really sort of create a regional narrative for what is a second \u2013 not a security, perhaps, but an economic architecture?\u00a0 How do we bring the region along with the four Quad countries?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 And can I just add to that \u2013 because all of you have also invoked the term \u2013 look, all of you have started speaking like each other, and that worries me.\u00a0 All of you\u00a0say\u00a0\u201cASEAN centrality.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 It\u00a0actually makes\u00a0me happy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 You\u00a0say\u00a0\u201cASEAN centrality,\u201d and we keep thinking what\u00a0does that really mean.\u00a0 Does it mean that beautiful flower arrangement in the middle of the room when four of you are sitting?\u00a0 What does it really mean?\u00a0 So \u2013 sorry, the second question,\u00a0Kirtbir.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Let me go to the second question and then I\u2019ll come to you.\u00a0 Can we take a second question?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks, Samir and panelists.\u00a0 I\u2019m\u00a0Kirtbir\u00a0Chahal.\u00a0 I work for the British Government.\u00a0 Similar question to narrative, but how do you think the Quad can reconcile their strategic interests in and their competing visions for the Indo-Pacific?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd given the Quad are already discussing supply chain resilience and economic resilience more broadly, are Quad members likely to increase market access for each other to further strengthen that economic cooperation and truly move in the same direction?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 So now we will turn to the panelists.\u00a0 First one was to you, ma\u2019am, so over to you, Minister Wong.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0 Well, I might \u2013 I think the nub of the first question goes really to complementarity.\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to not be provoked by the flower arrangement analogy just for the moment.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But it goes to complementarity, and I think if we can start where \u2013 perhaps where Jai started, which is think about what we are for, not what we are against.\u00a0 What are we for?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI think\u00a0where we are very likeminded is we have a view about the attributes of the region we inhabit, and that region \u2013 and people will use different words; some say open and inclusive; some might say stable, secure, free of \u2013 where sovereignty is respected \u2013 but the point is we do have a view about that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe see the Quad, I would say, as a bit of a lighthouse.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0 That was for you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0 But we conceive it as enabling choices, and I think it enables choices in two ways.\u00a0 It enables choices by these countries working for a region with the attributes that enable choices, and it also enables choices by virtue of the practical work that we seek to do together; sometimes through all four in the work streams that Jai described; sometimes collaboration, whether it\u2019s in the Pacific, where Australia and Japan or Australia and India might work together in a particular country \u2013 this project is a good one for you to do, this is a project we\u2019ll do, this is what we\u2019ve done, but that sort of practical cooperation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I don\u2019t feel the dissonance that I know some commentators feel and that is underpinning a couple of the questions as between the different architectures, because as an Australian, the region in which we live demands the engagement at multiple levels in multiple contexts.\u00a0 We have \u2013 we are the first dialogue partner of ASEAN, so our commitment to ASEAN centrality is historic and real, but it is also geographic.\u00a0 And we do not see our engagement with our friends and partners up here on the stage as doing anything other than enhancing that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, ASEAN centrality.\u00a0 India also has its own neighbors who it\u00a0has to\u00a0take into account\u00a0\u2013 their views, their conditions.\u00a0 Is there a time to \u2013 just taking this question forward, are we creating enough mechanisms to engage with these countries?\u00a0 We are four big countries in the region, in the periphery, as Teesta mentioned, so what is the mechanism to reach out, to take them along, to sometimes respond to anxieties?\u00a0 You are going to create ripples.\u00a0 And perhaps also the second question of\u00a0Kirtbir\u00a0on connectivity and congruence within the Quad.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, let me start with coming back to the first question and just adding to what Penny said I think very eloquently.\u00a0 Our proposition is not to say to countries in the region, \u201cYou have to choose.\u201d\u00a0 Our proposition is to offer a choice, to offer an affirmative alternative.\u00a0 And the more we\u2019re able to do that \u2013 and do that in practical ways \u2013 I think the more cohesion you\u2019re going to see throughout the region.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve already discussed in\u00a0a number of\u00a0very practical areas that\u00a0actually answer\u00a0the needs of countries in different parts of the region, that\u2019s exactly what the Quad is doing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSecond, to Penny\u2019s point \u2013 and I think this is very important \u2013 we really look at this as variable geometry, which is to say there are different collections of countries \u2013 some in formal alliances, some in looser partnerships, some working together on a bilateral basis, some in slightly larger groupings \u2013 and the idea really is to make sure that we\u2019re fit for purpose for any\u00a0particular challenge.\u00a0 And so it may be that the Quad can focus on certain things where the\u00a0particular attributes\u00a0of our countries brought together make sense.\u00a0 There are other places where different groupings of countries, whether in existing alliances or new partnerships that we form, make the most sense because it addresses the\u00a0particular interests\u00a0or\u00a0particular attributes\u00a0that those countries can bring to the table.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I think you\u00a0have to\u00a0think of it that way.\u00a0 This is not a rigid thing, and that\u2019s I think the mindset that the four of us have, although now maybe it\u2019s the five of us.\u00a0 I think, Samir, you\u2019re now an honorary member.\u00a0 Maybe \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 sort of the fifth Beatle, as it were.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re taking.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd the other thing I think it\u2019s important to understand is this is an ongoing conversation, and one of the strengths that we have is \u2013 and we just had a meeting over breakfast, but it\u2019s just picking up the conversation that\u2019s happening virtually all the time in some fashion among the four of us or among some subset of the four of us.\u00a0 And that also gives it great power because there\u2019s tremendous continuity, and what we\u2019re working on most now is translating the vision that we brought to this into very concrete, practical things that address very concrete, practical needs of countries throughout the region.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Would you guys have a WhatsApp group?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Okay, I\u2019m sorry, that was not a question.\u00a0 Minister Hayashi, your responses to ASEAN and \u2014\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 It all has been said.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to add anything on those comments already made, but is this a group or what?\u00a0 This is a kind of \u2013 not a band like the Beatles, the member is\u00a0fixed\u00a0and they always play together in 10 years, but this is more like a, more kind of soft group, so that even within the Beatles, Paul McCartney can release the album by solo.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And \u2013 so yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo those are the things that could be a band, but everybody is really one harmonization with (inaudible) 50th anniversary for ASEAN.\u00a0 So that information we can share with four of us here so that any idea relating to that could be \u2013 I can absorb from those three friends here.\u00a0 So those are the situation we are facing, and it\u2019s very nice to talk over these issues surrounding the area, because we have a trust between four of us and a trust for \u2013 like I said at the beginning \u2013 the same values and same values such as democracy, freedom, and everything.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0without worrying about those big conditions, we can\u00a0really freely\u00a0talk within this and communicate.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the only things that I would like to add.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Dr. Jaishankar?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Which part, the Beatles part, or the \u2013 (laughter).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0 Go ahead.\u00a0 I mean, you always come up with interesting inputs, but the two questions that were posed: ASEAN in our context, perhaps India\u2019s own neighbors; and, of course, the whole challenge of offering choices, as Secretary Blinken mentioned.\u00a0 Are we in \u2013 are we able to give countries more agency by offering more choices?\u00a0 Or are we still sending them to the same shop?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 No, I think we do offer more choices.\u00a0 We do collectively offer something different.\u00a0 My own sense over this\u00a0last \u2013 especially after 2017, when I look at individual countries in Southeast Asia, or I\u2019ve just come back from\u00a0actually the\u00a0Pacific Islands \u2013 that countries are interested.\u00a0 Many of them by the way are themselves looking at Indo-Pacific as a changing theater, what \u2013 how should they define their interests, advance their interests.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0my sense is that the interest in the Quad, the enthusiasm for it, the willingness to work with it are growing.\u00a0 But at the end of the day, the Quad is the Quad.\u00a0 The Beatles didn\u2019t take \u2013 they did keep Pete Best out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0the serious point is that when we look at what can we do \u2013 and I\u2019m, again, using maritime security as the easiest example \u2013 that there was a time after 2004 when we all worked together.\u00a0 We understood the value of what today we call the LEMOA, that \u2013 the moment we get logistics access to each other that somewhere our ability to operate\u00a0actually multiplies.\u00a0 And in the initial years, it was difficult.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0when we talk about the changing world, among the changes is we ourselves have changed.\u00a0 Our attitude towards the world has changed.\u00a0 Our understanding and comfort levels with each other has also changed.\u00a0 I do remember a period when, even in our own system \u2013 and I would say frankly in each one of our systems \u2013 because it was something we hadn\u2019t done before, there was that hesitation.\u00a0 And what we are discovering, I mean, really with almost every Quad meeting \u2013 we have this kind of rolling conversation, and it\u2019s not a WhatsApp group.\u00a0 We have this rolling conversation, and people keep throwing up ideas.\u00a0 Some work; some don\u2019t; some are realized more practically, more quickly.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a kind of \u2013 I would say a very easy, practical arrangement that this has come about.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo\u00a0I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m very uncomfortable with sharp definitions: you do this, you don\u2019t do this, you are for this, you are against this.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s four countries who have decided that by working together that they would naturally advance each other \u2013 our own national interests but also do much good for the world.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0my final question to the panelists as we conclude, you started off responding to the tsunami, a major humanitarian actor at that time.\u00a0 Today, we are facing two or three big crises at this\u00a0particular moment: food, debt, climate.\u00a0 Is Quad doing enough?\u00a0 What should it be doing better?\u00a0 Let me start with Secretary Blinken and then come down the panel and close with you, Dr. Jaishankar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say\u00a0on\u00a0one level we\u2019re never doing enough because the demand is extraordinary.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re living in a time where there is a greater multiplicity of challenges than at any time at least that I\u2019ve been engaged in these issues over 30 years \u2013 more complicated, more interconnected.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0the demand is huge and maybe the demand exceeds even the supply that we can bring.\u00a0 But precisely to the point that Jai was just making, one of the things that we\u2019re, I think, getting pretty good at is adapting quickly and looking quickly at what are the challenges that we really\u00a0have to\u00a0engage and seeing how we can make the Quad a useful vehicle for doing that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn each of the areas you described, we are\u00a0actually working\u00a0together,\u00a0taking action, certainly exchanging ideas; and as I said, in many cases trying to turn to those into concrete initiatives.\u00a0 But the demand is\u00a0great\u00a0and we\u00a0have to\u00a0respond to it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s interesting right now in this very moment, you have Quad countries that are also chairing in this moment the G7, the G20, APEC; and that too gives us an ability to amplify \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0To coordinate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 and as we\u2019re working and coordinating among each other, that also has the benefit of strengthening and making more cohesive the agendas of these other groups.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Minister Hayashi.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, like Tony said, demand is always more than we can supply, I think, as a Quad.\u00a0 But like in case of Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, right after \u2013 that was 24th of February, but in March, we had a summit video conference on Ukraine issues and concurred that we cannot accept this to destroy the international norm such as never change the status quo by force.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0like those case shows that we can always communicate and confirm that we \u2013 from \u2013 we are on the same page for those issues, and then that makes\u00a0more smooth\u00a0carrying out of the \u2013 every\u00a0measures\u00a0we can take.\u00a0 So that\u2019s still working in that way too.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Minister Wong.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFOREIGN MINISTER WONG:\u00a0\u00a0I think one of the greatest strengths of this grouping is by virtue of what we do together, it enhances our capacity for collaboration.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0you \u2013 we could \u2013 obviously there are existing work streams; they are\u00a0practical\u00a0and they are real.\u00a0 As both Tony and Yogi have said, we could always do more in that the need in a world that is increasingly disordered, as your conference explicates, is always greater.\u00a0 But this group does have a capacity to collaborate quite flexibly in addition to what we might have announced and what we\u2019ll try and deliver on.\u00a0 And I think for me as a foreign minister in the smallest of the Quad members, that is extremely useful.\u00a0 It \u2013 and it is a real strength in this collaboration.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Jaishankar, final words.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0\u00a0Look, I obviously concur with my colleagues, and I think the more we do with each other, then more possibilities\u00a0open up.\u00a0 To me right now, there are three big issues that the world needs to address and the Quad needs to address \u2013 and Quad can address, can make a difference: one, more reliable and resilient supply chains; two, the whole \u2013 the digital challenge \u2013 trust and transparency when it comes to technologies, how do we deliver more secure digital existence; and third, connectivity.\u00a0 And I do see these as three big issues which in different ways the Quad needs to do together\u00a0and also\u00a0do with other countries, and I do expect that to be a greater part of our agenda.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMR SARAN:\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0thank you very much for this very frank, friendly conversation this morning.\u00a0 I think that might be the good attribute for Quad: frank, friendly, and flexible.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s what Minister Wong said \u2013 flexible.\u00a0 So frank, friendly, flexible, and fun could be the takeaways from this wonderful conversation.\u00a0 Please join me in applauding the esteemed guests for their contributions.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Leela Palace", "location": "New Delhi, India", "date": "March 2, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good evening, everyone, and apologies for doing this so late.\u00a0 I hope I\u2019m not disrupting people\u2019s dinner plans.\nWe just finished a marathon day at the G20.\u00a0 We came together to focus on solving some of the most consequential problems affecting people of our nations and the world.\u00a0 And let me begin by thanking our host, India, for setting out an ambitious agenda for this meeting, and for its presidency of the G20.\nWe met here in Delhi roughly one year after President Putin launched his war of aggression on Ukraine, and one week after 141 countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly for a resolution that expressed the support for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, in accordance with the United Nations charter and its principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and deplores the human rights and humanitarian consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 Not a single G20 member voted with Russia to oppose that resolution.\nThe chair\u2019s statement by India today reaffirmed the declaration issued by the G20 leaders last year in Bali, which \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cstrongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 Russia and China were the only two countries that made clear that they would not sign on to that text.\u00a0 Eighteen members of the G20 also reaffirmed that it is \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cessential to uphold international law and the multilateral system. \u00a0This includes defending all of the purposes and principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nations and adhering to international humanitarian law,\u201d end quote.\nEvery G20 member \u2013 and virtually every country, period \u2013 continues to bear the cost of Russia\u2019s war of aggression, a war that President Putin could end tomorrow, if he chose to do so.\u00a0 The United States didn\u2019t want this war.\u00a0 We worked hard to prevent it.\u00a0 Like most countries, we want to focus on the fundamental challenges affecting the daily lives of our people. So even as we stand with Ukraine while it defends itself, as any nation would do in that position, we\u2019re also determined to keep working with other countries to deliver solutions to these shared challenges.\nAnd that is exactly what we did today at the G20.\u00a0 These challenges include the unprecedented food security crisis around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to do two things at once \u2013 get food to the hungry now, but also help countries build up their agricultural productivity and resilience so that they\u2019re less vulnerable to future shocks.\u00a0 The United States is leading on both fronts.\u00a0 In addition to funding more than half of the World Food Program\u2019s entire budget, we\u2019ve contributed $13.5 billion to fight hunger over the last year alone, and we\u2019ve committed more than $11 billion over the next five years to boost countries\u2019 resilience and nutrition.\nAfrican countries in particular have told us time and again that, more than aid, what they want is help building the sustainable capacity to feed their own people, and we\u2019re teaming up to do just that.\u00a0 Now the unprecedented levels of food insecurity have been driven primarily by climate, by COVID, and by conflicts, but the crisis has been worsened intentionally by President Putin, who\u2019s weaponized the hunger of people across the globe.\nThanks in large part to UN Secretary-General Guterres and T\u00fcrkiye, the Black Sea Grain Initiative loosened Russia\u2019s stranglehold on Ukraine\u2019s ports, allowing more than 22 million metric tons of grain and other food \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of eight billion loaves of bread \u2013 to leave Ukraine\u2019s ports through global markets.\u00a0 And that\u2019s lowered the price of food for people everywhere.\nToday, Russia is again slow walking the export of food from Ukraine.\u00a0 And with the Black Sea Initiative set to expire on March 18th, Russia has refused to commit to renewing it.\u00a0 The message that countries sent at today\u2019s meeting is clear \u2013 extend the Black Sea Grain Initiative and strengthen it and do that without delay.\nWe also discussed ways to counter the proliferation and trafficking of illicit synthetic drugs, like fentanyl and methamphetamine.\u00a0 In the United States alone, fentanyl killed more than 70,000 people last year.\u00a0 It\u2019s the number-one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49.\u00a0 No country can tackle this problem alone.\u00a0 Disrupting supply chains of precursors, preventing the diversion of legal chemicals to illegal uses, dismantling the transnational criminal groups that foster corruption and profit off of others\u2019 suffering, these are challenges that demand a coordinated global effort.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that, for the first time, G20 ministers called for a strong, international cooperation to counter illicit synthetic drugs, and it\u2019s why I proposed to my fellow ministers today at the G20 that we create a focused line of effort to bring together governments, international and regional organizations, private sectors, and others to tackle this problem.\u00a0 This is a law enforcement and security issue, but it\u2019s fundamentally a public health issue and an increasingly global one.\nToday, we also discussed other challenges, where people around the globe expect our countries to work together, like addressing the climate crisis, helping communities adapt to the inevitable changes it\u2019s causing, strengthening global health security, so that we\u2019re better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future health emergencies.\nI also had the opportunity to speak on the margins of today\u2019s meetings with counterparts from Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and, of course, India.\u00a0 And let me first commend the Indian presidency and Foreign Minister Jaishankar for securing G20 consensus on a broad set of agreements, reflected in the Chair Summary and Outcome Document.\u00a0 That\u2019s a first for G20 foreign ministers.\nNow Minister Jaishankar and I speak so frequently that we just pick up right where we left off, working to elevate our Strategic Partnership in concrete ways, supporting India\u2019s very ambitious G20 agenda, advancing the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, which President Biden and Prime Minister Modi launched at the G20 Summit in Bali last May, engaging our shared commitment to human rights and democratic values.\nTomorrow the foreign minister and I will join our counterparts from Japan and Australia for a meeting of the Quad, where key areas of focus will include protecting the free and unrestricted movement of goods and people across our seas, and boosting cooperation against \u2013 around humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the importance of which has been brought once again into sharp relief by the devastating earthquakes in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria.\nOur engagement with the Quad and the G20 are just a few of the examples of how the United States is weaving together alliances and partnerships to enhance our capacity to deliver for our citizens.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I began this trip in Central Asia, where I joined my counterparts for the C5+1 ministerial.\u00a0 The more of these partnerships that we build, strengthen, and stitch together, the more we\u2019re able to effectively tackle transnational challenges that affect our people, broaden opportunities for Americans, bolster our security, and advance our interests.\nAnd what we\u2019re seeing in Delhi, in Astana, in Tashkent, and beyond is that countries want to partner with the United States, because they see us showing up to solve shared problems, fostering inclusive economic growth, investing in our own competitiveness, and standing up for the international rules of the road that benefit all countries, including the right of every country to choose its own path, free from violence, coercion, and threats.\nLastly, I spoke briefly with Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Lavrov on the margins of our G20 meeting today.\u00a0 I urged Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision, and return to implementing the New START Treaty, which places verifiable limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation.\u00a0 Mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s also what people around the world expect from us, as nuclear powers.\u00a0 I told the foreign minister that, no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship, the United States will always be ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did, even at the height of the Cold War.\nI also raised the wrongful detention of Paul Whelan, as I have on many previous occasions.\u00a0 The United States has put forward a serious proposal.\u00a0 Moscow should accept it.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined to bring Paul and every other American citizen who is unjustly detained around the world home.\u00a0 We won\u2019t rest until we do.\nFinally, I told the foreign minister what I and so many others said last week at the United Nations, and what so many G20 foreign ministers said today: end this war of aggression; engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace.\u00a0 President Zelenskyy has put forward a 10-point plan for a just and durable peace.\u00a0 The United States stand ready to support Ukraine through diplomacy to end the war on this basis.\u00a0 President Putin, however, has demonstrated zero interest in engaging, saying there\u2019s nothing to even talk about unless and until Ukraine accepts \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d while doubling down on his brutalization of Ukraine.\nIndependent of what Russia does, we showed here in Delhi what we will do: deliver results on the problems most affecting our peoples\u2019 lives.\u00a0 Our hosts are committed to doing this over the course of their G20 presidency.\u00a0 For that, and for their leadership and hospitality, I\u2019d like to close by expressing my gratitude to India.\nAnd with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll first go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 There\u2019s been rising concerns in recent years about democratic backsliding and human rights issues in India, including the rights of religious minorities, and recently with a move against the news organization the BBC.\u00a0 Did you raise U.S. concerns about these issues with your Indian counterpart today, and are you concerned at all that the situation might worsen heading into next year\u2019s federal election in India?\nAnd secondly, Reuters has reported that the U.S. is speaking with allies about potential sanctions for China if it sends lethal aid to Russia for use in Ukraine, as you\u2019ve warned about in the past.\u00a0 Can you comment at all on those discussions and more broadly about your conversations with counterparts today relating to China\u2019s relationship with Moscow?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, on India, we\u2019re the world\u2019s two biggest democracies.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to an enduring project, both of us \u2013 in our case, as our founders put it, striving to form a more perfect union.\u00a0 That\u2019s part of our national ethos.\u00a0 It\u2019s a project for both of us, India and the United States, in different but also complementary ways.\nSo we have to work together to show that our democracies can actually deliver on our peoples\u2019 needs, and we have to continue to hold ourselves to our core values, including respect for universal human rights, like freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, which makes our democracy stronger.\u00a0 So we regularly engage with our Indian counterparts to encourage the Indian Government to uphold its own commitments to protect human rights, just as we look to ourselves to do the same thing.\u00a0 And in most conversations that I have with my counterpart, Foreign Minister Jaishankar, this is an issue that we discussed, again, as we did today.\nWith regard to China and its support for Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, as we\u2019ve said from the start \u2013 and as President Biden made very clear to President Xi going back to the very beginning of the Russian aggression \u2013 were China to engage in material, lethal support for Russia\u2019s aggression or were to engage in the systematic evasion of sanctions to help Russia, that would be a serious problem for our countries.\nWhen I saw Senior Foreign Policy Official Wang Yi in the margins of the Munich meetings just a week or so ago, I raised with him our very real concern that based on information we have, China is considering supplying lethal military assistance to Russia.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not seen it do that yet, but we\u2019ve seen it considering that proposition.\u00a0 And what I shared with him again was that this would be a serious problem for us in our relationship with China, and I made clear that there would be consequences for engaging in those actions.\nSo I\u2019m not going to detail what they would be, but of course we have sanctions authorities of various kinds that would certainly be one of the things that we and others would look at.\u00a0 And I say others because this concern that China is considering providing lethal military assistance to Russia, this is a shared concern.\u00a0 And many other partners have raised this, and not just raised this with us, but \u2013 it\u2019s my understanding \u2013 have raised it directly with China, including here today in Delhi.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Let\u2019s next go to Maha Siddiqui with NDTV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, even though there\u2019s been an outcome statement and the chair summary, in two successive ministerial meetings we\u2019ve not seen consensus in the form of a joint communique.\u00a0 Do you see that as a set back in the run up to the summit in September, and were you perhaps able to communicate this to your Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov when you met him on the sidelines today?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So I think what we\u2019ve seen here, as I mentioned, is actually a first, which is an outcomes document which reflects shared agreements on a number of issues by all of the foreign ministers represented here today.\u00a0 And in the particular case of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, you have virtually everyone in the G20 signing onto what had already been stated in Bali \u2013 and the two holdouts of course were Russia and China.\u00a0 So I think we see broad consensus across the G20 to work together, to act together, and to make commitments together.\nPrime Minister Modi said today that we should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those that we can.\u00a0 And I think what we saw today is a very good reflection of what the prime minister said \u2013 that is work and agreement on a whole series of lines of effort that the G20 will take to address the issues of greatest concern to people around the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s been the focus of the United States.\nWe want to make sure that, even as we and dozens of countries around the world are standing up for the basic principles at the heart of the UN Charter that are being trampled on by Russia and its aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re at the same time also working every single day to address the concerns of people around the world on the issues that are really affecting their lives \u2013 whether it is food insecurity, whether it\u2019s climate change, whether it\u2019s creating economic opportunity, building global health resilience, et cetera.\u00a0 All of those things we\u2019ve advanced on yet again here at the G20, and my full expectation is that, when the leaders get together, you\u2019ll see further very concrete outcomes that reflect that consensus.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Simon Lewis, Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Just to follow up a little bit on what you just discussed on the G20 today, Prime Minister Modi also mentioned in his comments today that multilateralism is in crisis and talked about the architecture of global governance having failed.\u00a0 I wonder if you agreed with that assessment.\u00a0 And since the G20 failed once again to reach a consensus, putting a slightly finer point on it, can this forum still function with Russia as a member?\u00a0 And just to add on your conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I wondered why was it that you felt that this was the moment to raise those issues with the foreign minister.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, [Simon].\u00a0 First, I\u2019d say that of course Prime Minister Modi is right that there are real challenges to the multilateral system, and those challenges in many ways are coming directly from Russia, which has been violating the very principles that lie at the heart of that system and that the system was designed to uphold.\u00a0 And so that is a challenge.\u00a0 And we see that playing out as well, for example, with the United Nations Security Council, where we have two countries in particular that tend to block the attempted actions of the council to address some of the most urgent global concerns.\nOn the other hand, what we\u2019ve seen, I think, speaking very powerfully and eloquently, is the multilateral system in a variety of ways.\u00a0 Three quarters of it coming together at the UN General Assembly to condemn Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine and to insist on a just and durable peace \u2013 that\u2019s the multilateral system.\u00a0 And we see it here today at the G20 thanks to India\u2019s leadership.\u00a0 As I said just a moment ago, even as we\u2019re focused on making sure that Russia can\u2019t succeed in its aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re equally focused on engaging and solving problems that affect people around the world and that they expect us to be focused on, and we\u2019re doing that through the G20.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that through other multilateral organizations, everything from the G7 and numerous other organizations, including other organizations that are within the UN system.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working together on food security, on energy security, on climate, on global health.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019re delivering results.\nSo all of this is to say that, yes, of course, there are real challenges.\u00a0 The prime minister\u2019s right.\u00a0 But I think we\u2019ve demonstrated, including here today in Delhi, that we can find workarounds.\u00a0 And those workarounds, when we have an outlier, can be found in the outcomes document that hopefully has been distributed to everyone.\u00a0 And again, it demonstrates real consensus and real commitment to work together to tackle issues that are affecting people in their daily lives.\u00a0 And as I said a moment ago, I\u2019m also convinced that when the leaders get together to finalize some of these commitments, you\u2019ll see very strong results.\u00a0 And again, from the perspective of the United States, this is exactly what our people expect of us and what the world expects of us.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Suhasini Haidar,\u00a0The Hindu.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, I want you to just follow up on two of your answers already.\u00a0 You just said that you expect strong results when the leader summit happens at the G20.\u00a0 Just how do you see that happening?\u00a0 How do you see the road ahead for the G20 process given that now the document actually names Russia and China as holding up the consensus as well as not agreeing to the previous G20 statement that they had signed on to?\u00a0 They say, of course, that they have their reasons for doing that, but do you really think a joint statement can be forged in the next few months?\u00a0 Do you think the G20 process itself is in peril?\nAnd if I could do a follow-up on Iain\u2019s question about the restrictions on a number of agencies, including NGOs, I wanted to ask specifically about restrictions on American agencies, apart from climate change NGOs as well as human rights NGOs \u2013 specifically about funding restrictions placed on American agencies earlier like the Ford Foundation but now like the National Endowment for Democracy, the Center for Disease Control, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and others.\u00a0 Is that something that you raised with your Indian counterparts?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So two things.\u00a0 First, you\u2019re \u2013 just to make sure that I understand, you\u2019re referring to restrictions that India would place \u2013 would have placed on these organizations.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken up these questions in the past and we have discussed the importance of NGOs and civil society being able to function effectively and freely wherever they are in our own country and here in India.\u00a0 So to the extent that issues have come up related to NGOs, we\u2019ve discussed them directly with our Indian counterparts.\nAs to projecting to the leaders\u2019 summit, first of all, I don\u2019t want to spoil the show.\u00a0 We\u2019ll let the leaders do their work and show the results.\u00a0 But whether that\u2019s reflected in a joint statement, whether it\u2019s reflected in a chair statement that shows that the overwhelming majority of the G20 countries agreed to work together on a course of action, honestly I don\u2019t think that makes a big difference.\u00a0 If there are going to be an outlier country or two, when you have 18 of the 20 agreed on what needs to be done and committed to working together to do it, again, that is effective multilateralism in action \u2013 effective in actually addressing the world\u2019s concerns.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s what you saw today, and I am absolutely convinced that you\u2019ll see that when the leaders get together one way or another\u2026\nMR

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Hyatt Regency Hotel", "location": "Tashkent, Uzbekistan", "date": "March 1, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Good to see you all.\u00a0 So this is my first visit to Uzbekistan, and let me express first of all my gratitude to the president, to the acting foreign minister, and to all the people I\u2019ve had an opportunity to meet with over the course of this day for what\u2019s been an extraordinarily warm welcome.\nThe partnership between our countries dates back to Uzbekistan\u2019s independence.\u00a0 It\u2019s grown much closer in recent years.\u00a0 Across all of my engagements here, what I come away with is a mutual and enthusiastic commitment to strengthening that partnership even further.\nThat starts with deepening our ties with Uzbekistan\u2019s young people.\u00a0 Over the past five years, the United States has invested $25 million in English-language education, teaming up with the government to train 15,000 Uzbekistani English teachers, providing English-language textbooks to some 10,000 schools.\u00a0 And I had an opportunity to witness some of the work that we\u2019re doing today sitting in on a class with some really extraordinary young people who are only three or four months into English-language education and already sounded incredibly fluent.\nThis is about more than just learning a language.\u00a0 It\u2019s about empowering rising generations of Uzbeks to use their new skills to compete for jobs in markets that demand English proficiency, enabling connections with English speakers across the region and the world, opening doors to exchange programs in the United States, which can create new opportunities for people in both of our countries.\nAnother way that we\u2019re expanding opportunity is by supporting the full implementation of President Mirziyoyev\u2019s reform agenda.\u00a0 The progress that Uzbekistan has made on labor rights shows just how transformative that agenda can be.\u00a0 For 11 years, more than 300 companies banned Uzbek cotton from their products due to the use of child and forced labor.\u00a0 In partnership with national and international labor groups and human rights organizations, the government worked to eradicate this pervasive practice, not only passing a new labor code, but ensuring that it was enforced.\u00a0 Last year, the International Labor Organization determined that Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton sector was free of child and forced labor.\u00a0 This is a historic achievement and it\u2019s a model for countries around the world facing similar challenges.\nIt\u2019s already making a tangible difference in the lives of Uzbek workers, farmers, businesses.\u00a0 Wages are up.\u00a0 Private investment is increasing.\u00a0 People of all ages, including children, are no longer being forced to pick cotton in abusive conditions.\u00a0 We look forward to working with the government to promote similar efforts in other sectors, as well as to fully implement the president\u2019s reform agenda.\u00a0 That includes delivering on commitments to defend religious freedom and press freedom and strengthen protections for vulnerable populations \u2013 issues that I discussed today with the president.\nI also underscored the importance of Uzbekistan fully and transparently investigating allegations of human rights violations committed by law enforcement officers during the July 2020 \u2013 2022 unrest and holding accountable those responsible.\nIn addition to strengthening the U.S.-Uzbekistan relationship, we\u2019re also working together to deepen regional integration.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Saidov and I just came, as you know, from the C5+1 meeting in Astana, where I announced a new commitment to work with Congress to provide an additional $25 million to catalyze economic growth in Central Asia.\u00a0 That brings our total investment in the region since our meeting on the margins of the UN General Assembly last September to more than $66 million.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on diversifying trade routes, fostering greater private investment, providing job training.\nAnd let me emphasize that so much of the work that we\u2019re doing in these \u2013 in these programs and with the investments we\u2019re making from our government really serve as a catalyst for increasing private sector investment.\u00a0 I think the opportunities that the private sector is already engaged in are significant and everything I\u2019m seeing suggests that there is growing enthusiasm, interest, focus on investing here and investing in other countries in Central Asia.\nIt\u2019s also how we provide the support that matters.\u00a0 The United States is making these and other investments in Central Asia openly, transparently, in a way that empowers people across the region to shape their own future, and that meets high labor, human rights, environmental standards.\u00a0 That\u2019s how investment should work.\nWe\u2019ll have a chance to build on these efforts next month in Samarkand when the United States sends a high-level delegation from across our government to a meeting of the U.S.-Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework.\nSo the bottom line is this.\u00a0 A more connected, a more cooperative Central Asia will be better able to determine its own future and deliver for its people\u2019s needs.\u00a0 The United States is committed to supporting that vision.\u00a0 One of the things that we\u2019ve learned over many, many years is that the investments that we make in these partnerships benefit our partners, but they also benefit us, creating potentially new markets for our own products, our own investments, creating new opportunities to partner with countries in meeting global challenges where Central Asia can make a real difference, and just developing new friendships that benefit our country across so many different aspects of our society in many different ways.\nAnd that\u2019s fundamentally why I\u2019ve come here, and I want to emphasize that this is not just a matter of one visit; it\u2019s the work that we\u2019re doing day in, day out, including through our embassies, through our engagement with the private sector, through engagements with civil society and other groups.\u00a0 And we\u2019re in it for the long haul.\nIn our meetings today, I also had a chance to thank the government for its generous aid to the people of Afghanistan, from electricity to emergency humanitarian assistance, especially to women and girls.\u00a0 And we applaud Uzbekistan for repatriating more than 400 family members of terrorist foreign fighters from Syria and Iraq whose reintegration the United States will continue to support.\nFinally, this visit to the region comes against the backdrop of the one-year anniversary of Putin\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 This continues to be a cause for hardship for people around the world, including here in Central Asia.\u00a0 The second- and third-order consequences of this aggression continue to be felt.\u00a0 Indeed, few regions have been more acutely affected than Central Asia, including Uzbekistan, where people continue to shoulder increased food and energy prices.\u00a0 As always, this is hitting the most vulnerable the hardest.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the United States has provided more than $16 million in emergency food aid to this region since President Putin launched his aggression against Ukraine.\nThis hardship makes Uzbekistan\u2019s generosity even more remarkable.\u00a0 The government, the people of Uzbekistan have stepped up to provide food and medical assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0 They continue to host tens of thousands of Russian citizens who fled their country after President Putin launched his war.\nRussia\u2019s invasion has also fostered deep concern across the region.\u00a0 After all, if a powerful country is willing to try to erase the borders of a sovereign neighbor by force, what\u2019s to stop it from doing the same to others?\u00a0 Countries across Central Asia understand this.\u00a0 So does the United States, and so do partners and allies around the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve been committed and remain committed to standing for the sovereignty, the territorial integrity, the independence not only of Ukraine, but for countries across Central Asia and, indeed, around the world.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll go to our first question from Ed Wong of\u00a0The New York Times.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Hey, Ed.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 He\u2019ll survive without the microphone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to follow up on your comments on the Ukraine war.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mm-hmm.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 First, you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re somewhat skeptical of Moscow\u2019s talk of possible negotiations, and you say that the main aim of the U.S. Government right now and European allies is to help Ukraine on the battlefield, yet many of the non-aligned or neutral countries that you\u2019re meeting with this week here and also at the G20 say that they would like to see peace talks open sometime soon, and I expect that pressure will increase.\u00a0 How do you address that?\u00a0 And some have even favorably looked at China\u2019s talking points on that, and I know you\u2019re skeptical of that.\nSecond, at the G20, Russia and China will both be sending their foreign ministers.\u00a0 Do you plan to talk to them one on one or talk to them in a group setting, and what do you plan to say to them about the Ukraine war?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Second \u2013 second part of the question first.\u00a0 No plans to see either at the G20, although I suspect that we\u2019ll certainly be in group sessions of one kind or another together.\nSo the first thing to say is this:\u00a0 No one wants peace more urgently than the people of Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019re the victims every single day of Russia\u2019s aggression, and if they could have peace yesterday, they\u2019d take it and so would we and so would countries around the world who are suffering, as I said, from the second- and third-order effects of Putin\u2019s aggression.\nNow, we all know the simple truth that the war could end tomorrow \u2013 it could end today \u2013 if President Putin so decided.\u00a0 He started it; he can stop it.\u00a0 It\u2019s, on one level, as simple as that.\u00a0 And we should never lose sight of that fact.\u00a0 No one should lose sight of the fact that we have an aggressor and we have a victim, and to have any kind of equivalence between the two, including suggesting who is more committed to peace, I think, is profoundly wrong.\nSecond, if Russia, President Putin, were genuinely prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy necessary to end the aggression, of course we\u2019d be the first to work on that and to engage.\u00a0 But there is zero evidence of that.\u00a0 To the contrary, the evidence is all in the other direction.\u00a0 Just listen to President Putin\u2019s own words.\u00a0 To cite just one example, he said recently, and publicly, that unless and until Ukraine recognizes what he called \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d there\u2019s nothing to even talk about.\u00a0 In other words, unless and until Ukraine accepts the fact that Russia has seized their territory and gets to keep it, they won\u2019t even talk.\u00a0 That\u2019s obviously a nonstarter and it should be a nonstarter not just for Ukraine or for us, but for countries around the world.\u00a0 And I think that certainly resonates here in this region, where every single Central Asian country feels very strongly about their territorial integrity, their sovereignty, their independence \u2013 all of which, of course, were very, very hard-won.\nSo the real \u2013 the real question is whether Russia will get to a point where it is genuinely prepared to end its aggression and to do so in a way that is consistent with the United Nations Charter and these very principles.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I think what you \u2013 what you hear around the world, and you saw reflected in the resolution that was passed at the UN General Assembly by 141 countries, is the strong desire for peace, but for a just and durable peace, just in that it\u2019s consistent with the principles of the UN Charter in terms of territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence, and durable, as I\u2019ve said before, so that we don\u2019t leave things in a place where Russia gets to simply repeat this exercise a year or two years or three years later \u2013 it rests, it rearms, and it reattacks.\u00a0 So I think that\u2019s what we need to be focused on.\nIn terms of the proposal that China put forth, as I\u2019ve said and as others in the government have said, look, there are some positive elements there, including things that China itself has said several times in the past \u2013 very similar to elements that are in Ukraine\u2019s own proposal that President Zelenskyy put out some time ago.\u00a0 But if China was genuinely serious about this, the very first principle it put out \u2013 sovereignty \u2013 it would have been spending all of the last year working in support of the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s full sovereignty.\u00a0 And of course it\u2019s been doing the opposite in terms of its own efforts to advance Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war, blocking and tackling for Russia in international organizations, and, as we\u2019ve made clear recently, now contemplating the provision of lethal military assistance to Russia for its aggression against Ukraine.\nSo China can\u2019t have it both ways.\u00a0 It can\u2019t be putting itself out as a force for peace in public while it, one way or another, continues to fuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to Davlat Umarov from Gazeta.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Gazeta\u2019s website.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, during your visit in \u2013 oh, I\u2019m really sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, during your visit in Kazakhstan you mentioned that U.S. is trying to demonstrate its commitments to Central Asian countries as a steadfast partner.\u00a0 You announced even today about additional $25 million to the initiative and also as well as licensing the companies that are working with sanctioned Russian companies.\u00a0 In that regard, I\u2019d like to ask:\u00a0 What are the expectations of the United States from countries of the region, and in particular from Uzbekistan, to be ensured in their commitment as reliable partners, keeping in mind the ongoing war in Ukraine and close ties of the region with Russia and China?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Well, first, what we have been trying to demonstrate throughout this visit, but again, more than that, every single day in our engagement with countries throughout the region \u2013 and by the way, the meeting that we had in Kazakhstan of the C5+1, I think that\u2019s the fourth meeting that I\u2019ve participated in with my colleagues \u2013 but every single day we\u2019re engaged to build the strongest possible partnerships with all of the Central Asian countries.\u00a0 And it starts with our enduring support for their sovereignty, for their independence, for their territorial integrity, and our determination that each be able to determine their own futures consistent with those principles.\nWhat I think we also know very well is that Central Asia is in a complicated part of the world with longstanding relationships with different countries based on history, based on geography, and that\u2019s something that we well understand.\u00a0 But I think we also see each of these countries looking to multiply and deepen their relationships and partnerships with other countries around the world.\u00a0 And in that, the United States wants to be a steadfast partner and a partner that works with them to create new opportunities for people in this region and new opportunities for us to work together.\nNow, as I said earlier, we\u2019re also very well aware of the consequences that the Russian aggression against Ukraine has had for people in Central Asia, and I\u2019d say two things about that.\u00a0 First, the immediate consequences have been, in one way or another, a rise in energy and in food prices, and then, more generally, inflation.\nNow, there\u2019s a simple reason for that.\u00a0 Putin has tried to weaponize energy in his effort to subjugate Ukraine, and in weaponizing energy and trying to hold it back, deny it from different places \u2013 that has contributed to rising prices.\u00a0 We\u2019ve worked very hard to make sure that there was enough energy on world markets to keep prices down.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come directly to the assistance of the \u2013 of countries that were directly targeted by Putin using the energy weapon, but these effects, again, have been felt here in Central Asia as well, and we\u2019re working to mitigate them.\nFood \u2013 Putin also weaponized food.\u00a0 He blocked the breadbasket of the world, Ukraine, from exporting a lot of its grain and food products.\u00a0 And it was only because of the very good work by the United Nations and T\u00fcrkiye that we were able to establish this Black Sea grain corridor that allowed food once again to \u2013 grain and other products to come out of Ukraine and to reach world markets.\u00a0 The majority of that is going to countries in the developing world and in the Global South, but even countries that aren\u2019t directly receiving it are benefiting from the fact that with more Ukrainian food products on the market, the more prices are held in check and are lower.\nSecond part of the equation is this: sanctions, export controls that are being imposed by dozens of countries \u2013 not just the United States \u2013 on Russia.\u00a0 And again, to step back \u2013 it\u2019s not as if we woke up one day and said, oh, let\u2019s impose sanctions and export controls on Russia.\u00a0 The reason for those sanctions and export controls is because of the Russian aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 And countries came together both to support Ukraine in defending itself from the Russian aggression, but also to try to impose costs and pressure on Russia to get it to change its conduct, to stop the aggression, and to make it more difficult for Russia to continue that aggression.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what this is all about.\nBut we\u2019re looking at this very closely.\u00a0 We appreciate the work that countries have done to help prevent the evasion of sanctions, because Russia is looking for ways to nonetheless acquire products and otherwise engage in sanctioned activity.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working closely with governments throughout the region, helping them understand exactly what the sanctions require and, as necessary, looking to see what we can do to mitigate the negative effects that they\u2019re feeling.\u00a0 And this includes, in some cases, issuing licenses for trade where that makes sense, and we\u2019ve been engaged in that \u2013 in that process as well.\nFinally \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry for going on so long, but it\u2019s important \u2013 a big part of the work that we\u2019re doing here is to help the region diversify trade relationships, to build new partnerships and relationships with other countries, including with the United States, so they\u2019re not dependent on any one country or any one source for trade and investment, and at the same time to increase trade and investment within Central Asia itself.\u00a0 There\u2019s a very strong potential market here, and the more connectivity we have among the countries of Central Asia, the more collaboration we have, the stronger that market\u2019s going to be, the more investment it\u2019s going to attract from outside of Central Asia.\nSo we\u2019re working on all of that.\u00a0 And as I noted yesterday and again today, we\u2019ve made some significant new investments to try to do that \u2013 to increase and strengthen the climate, the environment for private sector investment, to strengthen connectivity among these countries, and to help them diversify their trade and investment relationships.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Next we\u2019ll go to Barbara Usher with the BBC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I wanted to follow up on that, what you\u2019ve just been talking about, with a different angle.\u00a0 You say that you\u2019re not asking Central Asian countries to choose between the U.S. and Russia or between the U.S. and China, but you are asking them to divert trade routes away from Russia and China.\u00a0 So isn\u2019t this a new version of the Great Game, which has historical resonance here, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware?\nAnd if I might add briefly, you spoke quite positively about the reforms of the president.\u00a0 Did you also perhaps advise him against trying to change the constitution so that he can extend his term?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Barbara.\u00a0 I think what many countries have recognized, both in Central Asia and beyond, for a variety of reasons in recent years, is that there is tremendous benefit in having a multiplicity of partners when it comes to \u2013 when it comes to trade, when it comes to investment, when it comes to supply chains of one kind or another.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen what disruptions in any one partnership and connection can do, and those disruptions might come from anything from conflict to COVID to climate change.\nSo this experience, I think, is causing countries to look very hard at where they may have dependencies, and it\u2019s in their interest, I think, to find ways to diversify, multiply, expand their relationships, their partnerships, including when it comes to trade and investment.\u00a0 And of course that doesn\u2019t \u2013 that doesn\u2019t need to be something that\u2019s zero-sum.\u00a0 These things can be additive, and countries will benefit tremendously from the increased investment that they\u2019re getting, the increased opportunity that that\u2019s creating.\nSo that\u2019s the recognition that we\u2019re seeing and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to support, to help, and to be a strong partner in helping to achieve.\u00a0 And it really runs the spectrum of things that we\u2019re engaged in with countries here.\u00a0 I mentioned a little while ago the work we\u2019re doing here in Uzbekistan on English-language training.\u00a0 It so happens that at this moment in history \u2013 it was different before; I\u2019m sure at some point in the future it\u2019ll be different \u2013 but right now English happens to be the primary currency for international engagement, whether that\u2019s for businesses, whether that\u2019s for governments and diplomacy, whether that\u2019s for people-to-people connections, whether that\u2019s for the internet.\nAnd so it\u2019s a profound advantage for countries and in some ways even a necessity to build up the proficiency, especially among young people, in the English language, and that\u2019s going to make people much more able to be competitive in a global economic environment, a global world in which, as I said, English is right now the main connective tissue.\u00a0 So that\u2019s just one way in which we\u2019re helping to put countries in a position where they can very effectively diversify their contacts, their connections, their work with other countries.\nWhen it comes to the reform agenda that the president has put forward here, we talked about that at some length today during our meeting.\u00a0 We applauded the steps that had been taken.\u00a0 I noted as well the importance not only of having the strong vision but of fully implementing it, and of course that remains an important work in progress.\u00a0 We talked about the importance of media freedom, having a strong space for civil society, and we did discuss briefly as well the constitutional reform process.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Nikita Makarenko.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Blinken, we feel an enormous pressure from Russian propaganda here, and it really shapes minds of our people, so we, our local media, try to struggle with it.\u00a0 Is there any plans the United States going to help us in this struggle?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, thank you.\u00a0 Well, I think it only underscores the importance of having a strong, vibrant, and well-resourced local media.\u00a0 And one of the things that we discussed today, including with the president, was the importance of that, the need for that in part to be able to deal with misinformation coming from Russia or from any other source.\u00a0 So we have programs, as you know, to support independent media but also in our own engagements with other governments urging them to do what\u2019s necessary to create the right environment in which media can grow, can flourish, and can bring a diversity of voices and a diversity of views to the public.\nAnd with that information, let people make up their minds about what\u2019s right and wrong, what\u2019s good policy and what\u2019s bad policy, what\u2019s an appropriate direction or not.\u00a0 But it\u2019s certainly true that Russia has built up a very strong and long-enduring propaganda and misinformation system that is felt here and is felt in other parts of the world.\u00a0 And the best answer to that, of course, is the strongest possible environment for genuinely free, independent, open media to bring the facts to people and let them make up their minds.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0One more question.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-an-english-language-learning-event/",

Welcome to Kazakhstan.\nBefore noon, during the first half of the day, we had a very productive series of meetings with the U.S. delegation, and the State Secretary also held a meeting with the president of our country, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in the course of friendly and constructive talks.\u00a0 They discussed salient issues of bilateral and multilateral agenda, as well as prospects of the Kazakhstan-American cooperation.\u00a0 I am glad to note that cooperation with the United States is developing in the spirit of an enhanced strategic partnership.\u00a0 This is confirmed by the revival of political dialogue, trade, economic, and investment cooperation.\nMutual trade turnover between Kazakhstan and the United States exceeded 3 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, and this figure is 37.2 percent higher compared to the results of the previous year.\u00a0 Export is growing because the U.S. is one of the largest investors in Kazakhstan\u2019s economy since 1993.\u00a0 The total inflow of foreign direct investments from the U.S. to Kazakhstan exceeded 62 billion U.S. dollars, and in the first three quarters of 2022 the volume of American investments increased by 58.8 percent compared to the corresponding period of 2021.\u00a0 About 590 enterprises with the participation of the American capital function are present in Kazakhstan, and more U.S. companies are showing they\u2019re interested in the Kazakh market.\nWe have just finished the C5+1 ministerial meeting of the foreign ministers of the Central Asian countries and the U.S., and the participation of my colleagues from the Central Asian states clearly shows our joint political efforts to strengthen regional ties in a complex international situation.\u00a0 Kazakhstan highly appreciates the commitment of the United States to strengthen cooperation with the Central Asian region.\u00a0 Our country continues a balanced multilateral foreign policy, in accordance with its diplomatic priorities and Central Asia, and the United States remain our major partners.\nFor us, as the host country, this makes the C5+1 format a \u2013 relevant to mechanism of regional cooperation.\u00a0 The C5+1 mechanism has established itself as an effective regional diplomatic platform for promoting economic cooperation, security, as well as sustainable development in Central Asia.\u00a0 During the event, a wide range of issues were discussed, including cooperation on food security, combating terrorism, energy, environment, as well as other pressing issues.\nReturning to the topic of bilateral cooperation, I would like to note that the Secretary of State firmly supports the political and economic reforms initiated by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev aimed at ensuring the democratization and the rule of law.\u00a0 I would like to thank the American side for its intent to further consolidate our bilateral relations.\nThank you for your attention.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to give the floor to the State Secretary of the U.S., Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Mukhtar, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for today.\u00a0 Thank you for \u2013 as you very aptly described today, a very good day both bilaterally as well as with our C5+1 colleagues.\u00a0 And it\u2019s always good to be with you, and it\u2019s particularly good to be here in Kazakhstan.\u00a0 When we hosted your delegation in Washington last May, well, the weather was just a little bit milder than it is today.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s fair to say that the temperature outside is more than made up for by the warmth that you and President Tokayev have shown us on this trip.\u00a0 And I especially want to thank the president for his terrific hospitality, for the generosity of his time, and for the very good conversation that we had.\nI\u2019m here to underscore that the strong partnership, and in particular the enhanced strategic partnership between the United States and Kazakhstan, is moving forward strongly.\u00a0 Ever since being the first nation to recognize Kazakhstan in December of 1991, the United States has been firmly committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of Kazakhstan \u2013 and countries across the region.\u00a0 In our discussions today, I reaffirmed the United States\u2019 unwavering support for Kazakhstan, like all nations, to freely determine its future, especially as we mark one year since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a failed attempt to deny its people that very freedom.\nWe applaud Kazakhstan for continuing to host more than 200,000 Russian citizens who fled their country after President Putin launched his war.\u00a0 And I want to thank the people of Kazakhstan for generously providing food, clothing, medicine, other humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, including setting up those yurts of invincibility in Kyiv and Bucha, where Ukrainians can find warmth and respite from the war.\nI also reiterated that the United States strongly endorses the reform agenda that President Tokayev announced last March.\u00a0 We look forward to seeing the additional concrete steps Kazakhstan will take to realize that agenda, expanding public participation in the political process, increasing government accountability, curbing corruption, introducing presidential term limits, protecting human rights.\u00a0 Those reforms are an important reason why foreign investors, including from the United States, are increasingly turning to Kazakhstan.\u00a0 American businesses were among the first to invest here, injecting more than $50 billion into the Kazakh economy going back to 1991.\nWe are eager to bolster our economic cooperation, not only to strengthen the development and opportunity within Kazakhstan but also to strengthen linkages across Central Asia, promoting the diversification of energy and export, among other investments that will benefit Kazakhstan\u2019s people in very tangible ways.\u00a0 Kazakhstan also continues to be a valued partner on key global issues: reducing the spread of nuclear weapons by dismantling Soviet-era missiles; contributing to vital peacekeeping operations from Lebanon to Mali; exploring the galaxy through space cooperation; repatriating and rehabilitating more than 600 foreign terrorist fighters and their families.\nWe\u2019re grateful to Kazakhstan for its leadership in Central Asia and for hosting the C5+1 Ministerial today \u2013 this is the fourth one that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to participate in as Secretary \u2013 demonstrating our commitment to be a reliable partner to all countries in the region.\u00a0 We discussed with our fellow ministers from Kazakhstan, from Kyrgyzstan, from Tajikistan, from Turkmenistan, from Uzbekistan concrete ways to continue to advance our shared economic, energy, environmental, and security goals.\u00a0 The C5+1 is an increasingly important platform.\u00a0 Central Asian governments are strongest when they work together to address common challenges and to shape their own future.\u00a0 The United States aspires to be steadfast partners in those efforts.\nWe\u2019re working to do our part to try deliver solutions to the shared challenges that are affecting our people, from developing clean energy to contributing \u2013 excuse me \u2013 to combatting diseases like COVID, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis.\u00a0 Back in September, with food and gas prices surging due to Russia\u2019s war of aggression in Ukraine, the U.S. committed $16.5 billion toward food and security here in this region.\u00a0 We also set up the Economic Resilience Initiative for Central Asia \u2013 $25 million to expand regional trade routes, establish new export markets, attract and leverage greater private sector investment, providing people with practical skills for the modern job market.\nToday, I\u2019m announcing an additional $25 million for that initiative, a total of $50 million to build up the regional economy, and especially to make sure that people have the skills they need to succeed in this global economy.\u00a0 To further empower and connect the people of Central Asia, we\u2019re launching an effort to increase English language proficiency for more than 1,000 young professionals in government and across civil society.\nSo we\u2019ve had a very productive day of conversations and new initiatives that we hope will build on those discussions to the benefit of our partners in Central Asia.\u00a0 We sat around the table behind you with our colleagues from the C5+1, and I have a notebook filled with very good, concrete ideas about how we can further deepen our collaboration and address, in practical ways, the challenges that we\u2019re facing.\nI mentioned space exploration a few moments ago, so let me just close by noting that seven astronauts are currently orbiting above us in the International Space Station.\u00a0 They hail from different countries, they speak different languages, but many of these astronauts journeyed to the stars together from Kazakhstan, and they will land here in Kazakhstan when they return to earth.\u00a0 To me, that\u2019s a wonderful symbol of how this country can be a launching pad for our collective progress on earth, through the partnership between the United States and Kazakhstan, across Central Asia, around the globe.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much, dear colleagues.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s high time for you to pose your questions.\u00a0 Please raise your hands, introduce yourselves, and name a person that you would like to address your question to.\u00a0 Please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good evening.\u00a0 My name is Zhanna Alpysbayeva.\u00a0 I am from Atameken Business Channel.\u00a0 I have the following question:\u00a0 The West declared about the need related to bypassing the sanctions.\u00a0 In your opinion, what\u2019s the importance of secondary sovereign sanctions for Kazakhstan, and in which case those sanctions can be imposed here as well?\u00a0\u00a0 Because \u2013 because of these sanctions imposed on Russia, the economies of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan are suffering as well.\u00a0 What are the compensations for our countries?\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Whom you are addressing your question to?\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) To the Secretary of State.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, let me start by saying this:\u00a0 The sanctions that dozens of countries around the world are imposing on Russia, as well as the export controls, didn\u2019t just materialize out of thin air.\u00a0 Countries came together to impose them because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, its aggression against not only Ukraine but against the very principles at the heart of the international system and the United Nations Charter: territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty \u2013 principles that matter deeply to countries in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan.\nAnd so in response to what Russia did, countries around the world, including the United States have been supporting Ukraine in its efforts to defend itself against the Russian aggression, but also to try to put what pressure we can on Russia, to impose costs on Russia so that it stops the aggression, pulls its troops out, and restores Ukraine\u2019s full sovereignty.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is about.\u00a0 So it\u2019s important to put it in that context.\nWe are watching compliance with sanctions very closely, and we\u2019re having an ongoing discussion with a number of countries, including our C5 partners, on the economic spillover effect, because we\u2019re very conscious that this Russian aggression has had real consequences \u2013 not just for Ukraine and not only for the principles I mentioned, but in very concrete ways for countries around the world, including here in Central Asia.\u00a0 We\u2019re issuing licenses that make sense, we\u2019re sharing information with our partners, and we\u2019re supporting the C5 countries in their efforts to diversify their own trade relationships.\nSo for example, licenses have been granted for companies or entities in countries that are engaged with sanctioned Russian companies so that they have time to wind down those activities and cut their ties with Russia.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 We understand that sometimes you need time to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t harm your business.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do our part to strengthen the region and improve the lives of people living in Central Asia, ourselves in concrete ways \u2013 I mentioned a few of them with some of the initiatives that we\u2019ve engaged in.\u00a0 As I said, I announced $25 million through the Economic Resilience Initiative for Central Asia, expanding regional trade routes, so that gives new opportunities, new places for countries to engage and to trade, new export markets so that they\u2019re not reliant just on one country, and then attracting private sector investment.\u00a0 And today, as I mentioned, I\u2019m announcing an additional $25 million to that effort, bringing the total to $50 million.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying we\u2019re very conscious of the spillover consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing everything we can to minimize them, to mitigate them, and create new opportunities, different opportunities for partners here in Central Asia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) If you don\u2019t mind, I would like to add and say that the Government of Kazakhstan and the leadership of the United States established the mechanism of regular consultations on this matter in order to avoid the negative consequences for the economy of Kazakhstan and in order to prevent a possible secondary sanctions.\u00a0 We have national coordinators appointed on both sides, and they are in touch with each other, and we are really thankful to the American side for informing us about possible cases of the imposition of secondary sanctions as early as possible.\nTherefore, I would like to say that for the time being, there is no single Kazakh company or there is not a single Kazakh sector that has been imposed secondary sanctions.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 Who wants to pose our next question?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Vivian Salama from\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 Thank you so much, Foreign Minister, for having us.\u00a0 You actually just answered my first question, so I\u2019m going to mix it up a little bit.\u00a0 Are you concerned at all about how deeply entrenched your economy is with Russia, that it would take too long for, say, new allies, new partners like the U.S. and Europe to be able to sort of fill that void moving forward?\nAnd Mr. Secretary, you also just answered my first question, but I do have a second one for you regarding the potential Chinese lethal aid assistance to Russia.\u00a0 There have been a number of public statements from you and your \u2013 a number of members of President Biden\u2019s cabinet expressing concern about China\u2019s deliberations.\u00a0 Can you elaborate a bit on what the U.S. and its allies are doing to persuade Beijing away from such a move, and what consequences it could face if it delivers on any such aid?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to say that indeed Kazakhstan has very historic ties with both \u2013 with Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 Our economies interconnected for long, long time, and that\u2019s why definitely all this situation is quite heavy for us, for our economy, and we trying to avoid any negative effects from the sanctions.\u00a0 You can understand that Kazakhstan is a member of Eurasian Economic Union, and we don\u2019t have any custom borders between Kazakhstan, Russia, and other members of this union.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why definitely it\u2019s sometimes very difficult to manage how we can provide this free trade by products and services between our borders.\u00a0 But at the same time, we trying to evade any possibilities \u2013 to avoid any possibilities for evasion of sanctions by Russian or even by any foreign companies.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Vivian, as you know, this is something that I raised directly with China\u2019s senior foreign policy official, Wang Yi, when I saw him on the margins of the Munich Security Conference last week.\u00a0 And the backdrop here, of course, goes back to even before Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 Just a few weeks before that, you\u2019ll remember that President Xi and President Putin had a summit meeting in which they talked about a partnership with no limits.\u00a0 And that, of course, in the context of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was a real concern, including the concern that such a partnership might lead China to materially support Russia in its aggression, including with lethal military support and/or with efforts to systematically evade the sanctions that were being imposed on Russia for the aggression against Ukraine.\nAnd as I\u2019ve mentioned going back to, I think, the first conversation between President Biden and President Xi after the Russian aggression, President Biden raised this concern and made very clear to President Xi that were Russia to engage in lethal material support for Russia in the aggression against Ukraine or the systematic evasion of sanctions, this would be a serious problem in our relationship.\nSo we\u2019ve been watching it very carefully from day one.\u00a0 And the reason that I raised this not only with Wang Yi last week but also publicly, along with other colleagues in the administration, is because of concern we have based on information that we have that China is considering moving beyond the nonlethal support that some of its companies have been providing to actually lethal material support for Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine.\nAnd what I can share with you is that we did very clearly warn China about the implications and consequences of going through with providing such support.\u00a0 We will not hesitate, for example, to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions or otherwise engage in supporting the Russian war effort.\nBeyond that, what I heard very clearly from countries around the world that I\u2019ve been engaged with over the past 10 days, since these concerns have first been raised and shared with many countries, is that this is not only something that would be a serious problem for China and its relationship with us, but a serious problem with its relationship with countries around the world.\nAnd let me just add this:\u00a0 China can\u2019t have it both ways when it comes to the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 It can\u2019t be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand while actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has started with the other hand.\nSo I hope that China will take what we said very seriously \u2013 but not only what we said, what many other countries around the world are saying \u2013 and refrain from any further consideration of materially supporting Russia in the war effort.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 Next question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) My name is Yerbolatov.\u00a0 I have a question to be posed to the Secretary of State.\u00a0 So you said \u2013 you know that we are celebrating the one year anniversary of the war of Russia against Ukraine.\u00a0 And if we take into account the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation, is there a threat to peace and security in Central Asia in this regard, taking into account the aggression of Russia against Ukraine?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 The concern that we have is not simply the aggression against Ukraine itself and the horrific things that are being done to its people, but, as I said before, the assault on the very principles that are at the heart of the international system, the heart of the United Nations Charter, that we believe are necessary to keep peace, security, stability around the world, including here \u2013 the principles of territorial integrity, of sovereignty, of independence.\nAnd a big part of the reason why it was so important for countries to stand up against the Russian aggression is not only to help Ukraine defend itself but also to defend those principles.\u00a0 Because if we allow them to be violated with impunity, then that does open up the prospect that Russia itself will continue \u2013 will consider further aggression against other countries if it sets its sight on them, or other countries will learn the wrong lesson and would-be aggressors in every part of the world will say, \u201cWell, if Russia can get away with this, then we can too.\u201d\u00a0 And that\u2019s a recipe for a world of conflict, a world of instability, a world that I don\u2019t think any of us want to live in.\nSo that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so important for so many countries to stand up and say, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t accept this.\u201d\u00a0 I can\u2019t speak to any specific ideas, plans that Russia may have anywhere else.\u00a0 I think its focus is very much on Ukraine.\u00a0 But I can say that had we failed to stand up in support of the principles that Russia was violating by invading Ukraine, that would have created I think a greater prospect that Russian aggression would point in other directions.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 Due to the lack of time, we have one final question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I was going to ask a question that was quite similar to my colleague\u2019s, if I \u2013 Mr. Secretary, if I could ask little bit more, the idea that you had of \u2013 you said repeatedly here that territorial integrity, independent sovereignty of all the Central Asian nations.\u00a0 Do you see that being at risk at all?\u00a0 I know you just mentioned that you don\u2019t see anything specific from Russia, but what are the types of the things that the U.S. could provide, or the security guarantees, if you want to put it that way, diplomatic support?\u00a0 What can the U.S. do to ensure that those values are held?\nAnd if I could ask the foreign minister a bit of the same thing.\u00a0 You mentioned historic ties both with Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 To what extent do you feel any threat, any risk from what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, not just on the economic front but also the security front?\u00a0 Thanks very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Shaun, thank you very much.\u00a0 One of the things that we\u2019re working on in very practical ways is to demonstrate that the United States is a steadfast partner for countries in Central Asia.\u00a0 Our support for their independence, for their sovereignty, for their territorial integrity is real, but it\u2019s particularly manifested in two ways.\u00a0 One, it\u2019s manifested in helping them in different ways develop the strongest possible capacities for their own security, their growing economic prosperity, and the strength and resilience of their societies.\u00a0 That\u2019s the best way to make sure that going forward these countries can determine their own futures consistent with those principles.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing that on a bilateral basis, and we\u2019re doing that, as you mentioned, in the C5+1.\nOne of the things that we\u2019ve seen in Ukraine is that its own resilience to the Russian aggression of course starts with the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people, the extraordinary efforts of its military.\u00a0 But I think it goes beyond that.\u00a0 I think what we\u2019re seeing as well is a resilient society that\u2019s resilient also because it has stronger and stronger institutions, not only within government \u2013 those are usually important \u2013 but also beyond it, including a vibrant free press, including a strong civil society.\u00a0 Each of those things is part of Ukraine\u2019s success story in dealing with Russia\u2019s aggression and in creating a country that\u2019s resilient to the aggression, that can deal with it, and that will bounce back from it.\nAnd so it\u2019s a long way of saying that our partnerships here, the work we\u2019re doing here is also to help our friends in Central Asia build these kinds of strong, resilient societies with strong institutions, with ever greater capacity for their people, with more and more investment coming in from the United States and from other countries, with greater connections among them because these governments ultimately are going to be even stronger when they\u2019re working together to meet common challenges.\u00a0 And I think that creates the kind of region where their ability to uphold their own territorial integrity, their own sovereignty, their own independence will be that much stronger.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 I just mention that definitely Kazakhstan doesn\u2019t allow to use its territory for evasion sanctions, but it doesn\u2019t mean that for today we have or feel any threats or risks from Russian Federation.\nAs I answered to the first question, Kazakhstan is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, Collective Security Treaty Organization, Commonwealth of Independent States, with other states and countries surrounding Russia.\u00a0 So our relationship we consider as an alliance in the framework of all these multilateral structures.\nAnd for bilateral cooperation, relationship, we have solid legal base that \u2013 which is more important that we have the completed delimitation process, the state border between Kazakhstan and Russia, and as you know is the longest land border in the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s over \u2013 more than 7,500 kilometers.\u00a0 Now we are in the process of demarcation.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost 70 percent of this border completed.\u00a0 We have regular consultations between the government and federal states on the different issues.\u00a0 And as you know, Kazakhstan will continue its multi-vector foreign policy.\u00a0 It means that we are trying to keep the system of the check and balances and to develop the mutually beneficial cooperation, relationship with all the countries of the world.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Dear colleagues, our press conference is over.\u00a0Thank you for your attention.\n"},

Mr.\u00a0 Secretary-General, fellow council members:\nOne year and one week ago \u2013 on February 17th, 2022 \u2013 I warned this council that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine.\nI said that Russia would manufacture a pretext, and then use missiles, tanks, soldiers, cyber attacks to strike pre-identified targets, including Kyiv, with the aim of toppling Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government.\nRussia\u2019s representative \u2013 the same representative who will speak today \u2013 called these, and I quote, \u201cgroundless accusations.\u201d\nSeven days later, on February 24th, 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\nDue to fierce resistance by Ukraine\u2019s defenders, President Putin failed in his primary objective to conquer Ukraine, end its existence as an independent country, and absorb it into Russia.\nThen, he dusted off his Crimea playbook from 2014: He called snap referenda in four occupied parts of Ukraine, deported Ukrainians, bussed in Russians, held sham votes at gunpoint, and then manipulated the results to claim near unanimous support for joining the Russian Federation.\nWhen President Putin couldn\u2019t break the Ukrainian military, he intensified efforts to break Ukrainians\u2019 spirit.\u00a0 Over the last year, Russia has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian men, women, and children; uprooted more than 13 million people from their homes; destroyed more than half of the country\u2019s energy grid; bombed more than 700 hospitals, 2,600 schools; and abducted at least 6,000 Ukrainian children \u2013 some as young as four months old \u2013 and relocated them to Russia.\nAnd yet, the spirit of the Ukrainians remains unbroken; if anything, it\u2019s stronger than ever.\nWhen Ukraine launched a counteroffensive that retook large swaths of its territory, President Putin conscripted an additional 300,000 men \u2013 throwing more and more of Russia\u2019s young people into a meat grinder of his own making.\u00a0 And he unleashed the Wagner Group \u2013 mercenaries who have committed atrocities from Africa to the Middle East, and now, in Ukraine.\nOf course, that\u2019s not the whole story of the last year.\nThere is also the story of Ukraine\u2019s people.\u00a0 Vastly outnumbered, they have fought bravely to defend their nation, their freedom, the right to determine their own future.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve demonstrated inspiring unity in helping one another endure Moscow\u2019s relentless assault.\nTeachers and community members give classes in bunkers to children. \u00a0City workers improvise patches to restore heat and power and water to residents.\u00a0 Neighbors set up soup kitchens to feed the hungry.\nThere\u2019s also the story of how the international community has come together.\nThe vast majority of member-states have voted multiple times to condemn Russia\u2019s violations of the UN Charter and reject its illegal attempt to seize Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 Yesterday, 141 countries voted in the General Assembly for a resolution that reaffirms the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, denounces Russia\u2019s atrocities, expresses support for a just and comprehensive peace, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nWhen President Putin tried to weaponize hunger \u2013 exploiting the worst global food crisis since the creation of the UN \u2013 the international community responded swiftly.\nSince the United States chaired a Food Security meeting last May, more than 100 countries have signed onto a set of concrete commitments to alleviate hunger.\u00a0 Thanks in large part to the Secretary-General Guterres and T\u00fcrkiye, the Black Sea Grain Initiative loosened Russia\u2019s stranglehold on Ukraine\u2019s ports and brought down the cost of grain for the world.\u00a0 Now, as Moscow again tries to throttle its output, we have to ensure that that initiative is extended and expanded.\nWhen President Putin tried to weaponize energy, we redirected natural gas supplies from across the world, so that countries Russia targeted could keep their people warm in the winter.\u00a0 And Europe took extraordinary steps to end its dependence on Russian energy.\nNo country has endured greater hardship from Russia\u2019s war than Ukraine, but almost every country has felt the pain.\u00a0 And yet, nations around the world continue to stand with Ukraine.\u00a0 Because we all recognize that if we abandon Ukraine, we abandon the UN Charter itself, and the principles and rules that make all countries safer and more secure.\nNo seizing land by force.\nNo erasing another country\u2019s borders.\nNo targeting civilians in war.\nNo wars of aggression.\nIf we do not defend these basic principles, we invite a world in which might makes right, the strong dominate the weak.\u00a0 That\u2019s the world this body was created to end.\u00a0 And members of this council have a unique responsibility to make sure that we do not return to it.\u00a0 We can do that in three ways.\nFirst, we must push for a just and durable peace.\nNow I expect that many countries will call for peace today.\nNo one wants peace more than the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 And the United States has long made clear \u2013 even before this war \u2013 that we\u2019re prepared to engage in any meaningful diplomatic effort to stop Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nBut history teaches us that it\u2019s the nature of peace that matters.\nFor peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence.\nFor peace to be durable, it must ensure that Russia can\u2019t simply rest, rearm, and relaunch the war in a few months or a few years.\nAny peace that legitimizes Russia\u2019s seizure of land by force will weaken the charter and send a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they can invade countries and get away with it.\nPresident Zelenskyy has put forward a ten-point plan for a just and durable peace.\u00a0 President Putin, by contrast, has made clear that there is nothing to talk about until Ukraine accepts, and I quote, \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d while doubling down on his brutal tactics.\nMembers of this council have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that any peace is just and durable.\nCouncil members should not be fooled by calls for a temporary or unconditional ceasefire.\u00a0 Russia will use any pause in fighting to consolidate control over the territory it\u2019s illegally seized and replenish its forces for further attacks.\u00a0 That\u2019s what happened when Russia\u2019s first assault on Ukraine froze in 2015.\u00a0 Look at what followed.\nAnd members of this council should not fall into the false equivalency of calling on both sides to stop fighting, or calling on other nations to stop supporting Ukraine in the name of peace.\nNo member of this council should call for peace while supporting Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and on the UN Charter.\nIn this war, there is an aggressor and there is a victim.\nRussia fights for conquest.\u00a0 Ukraine fights for its freedom.\nIf Russia stops fighting and leaves Ukraine, the war ends.\u00a0 If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.\nThe fact remains: \u00a0One man \u2013 Vladimir Putin \u2013 started this war; one man can end it.\nSecond, even as we work to end Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, members of this council must continue to address other challenges to international peace and security.\nWe hear the concerns of countries who worry that standing with Ukraine and holding Russia accountable is diverting focus and resources from others in need.\nTo those countries, I would say, simply, look at our actions.\nAnd when you hear Russia and its defenders accuse the countries who support Ukraine of ignoring the rest of the world \u2013 I say look at Moscow\u2019s actions.\nCompare the numbers.\u00a0 In addition to the $13.5 billion in food aid that the United States contributed to fight hunger over the last year, we also fund more than 40 percent of the World Food Program\u2019s budget.\u00a0 Russia contributes less than 1 percent of that budget.\nThat\u2019s not an outlier.\u00a0 Based on the latest UN figures, the United States donates over nine times as much as Russia to UN peacekeeping.\u00a0 We donate 390 times as much as Russia to UNICEF.\u00a0 We give nearly a thousand times as much as Russia to the UN Refugee Agency.\nThird, we must reaffirm our commitment to upholding what the UN Charter calls, and I quote, \u201cthe dignity and worth of the human person.\u201d\nWe must continue to compile evidence of Russia\u2019s ongoing and widespread atrocities, including executions; torture; rape and sexual violence; the deportation of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to Russia.\nWe must continue to document Russia\u2019s war crimes and crimes against humanity, and share this evidence with investigators and prosecutors, so that one day, the perpetrators can be held accountable.\nDay after day of Russia\u2019s atrocities, it\u2019s easy to become numb to the horror, to lose our ability to feel shock and outrage.\u00a0 But we can never let the crimes Russia is committing become our new normal.\nBucha is not normal.\u00a0 Mariupol is not normal.\u00a0 Irpin is not normal.\u00a0 Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal.\u00a0 Stealing Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to people in Russia is not normal.\nWe must not let President Putin\u2019s callous indifference to human life become our own.\nWe must force ourselves to remember that behind every atrocity in this wretched war, in conflicts around the world, is a human being.\nI recently visited an exhibit of artwork made by Ukrainian children affected by the war.\nOne painting I saw was made by a ten-year-old girl named Veronika.\u00a0 Last April, Russian forces shelled her home in Vuhledar, killing her whole family.\u00a0 When first responders dug her from the rubble, a piece of shrapnel was lodged in her skull.\u00a0 Her left thumb had been ripped off.\u00a0 Doctors saved her life, but the attack left her right hand mostly paralyzed, and she can\u2019t see out of her left eye.\nIn her painting, Veronika drew herself in a bright pink and orange dress, holding a bouquet of flowers.\u00a0 A building stands next to her.\u00a0 When asked who lived there, she said it was a place where all the people she knew who had been killed in the war could be safe.\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u2026\u201d That\u2019s how the UN Charter begins.\nFellow members of this council: \u00a0Now is the time to meet that promise.\u00a0 There are so many people in Ukraine who want the same thing as that little girl, Veronika: a world where they can live in peace, in their own country, and keep the people they love safe.\nWe have the power, we have the responsibility to create that world, today and for generations to come.\u00a0 We cannot \u2013 we will not \u2013 let one country destroy it.\nThank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-virtual-osce-permanent-council-meeting/",

Now, I understand, George, that you may be one of the more popular people in Greece as well, and that\u2019s a good thing.\nLet me just say to the archbishop, thank you for gracing us with your presence today.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for that and grateful for your words as well.\u00a0 And to the mayor, thank you Mr. Mayor for being here, the governor.\u00a0 Mayor, members of the embassy family, the Athens community, thank you all for joining us today.\nSo we have come together to celebrate our relationship and mark our continued commitment to our ally and friend, Greece.\u00a0 And we do that here in a space that evokes the deeply rooted values that we share, the democratic values we share, what Prime Minister Mitsotakis has called a miracle that all free peoples cherish but that binds Greek and Americans in a special way.\nI was thinking earlier to something that I\u2019ve heard President Biden say on many, many occasions.\u00a0 He said that what makes America different and unique is that we\u2019re not founded on any particular race, religion, ethnicity.\u00a0 We\u2019re founded on an idea.\u00a0 And it so happens that idea is a Greek idea.\u00a0 That\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing in binding our people together.\nAnd over the decades here in Greece, the extraordinary people serving at this embassy have played a central role in strengthening the ties between our countries and advancing the many shared priorities that we have.\u00a0 This expanded and modernized U.S. presence is a concrete \u2013 or maybe I should say marble \u2013 investment in our bilateral relationship.\u00a0 And while the renovations will draw to a close, the work of strengthening the alliance between us will continue year after year.\nNow, we\u2019re about to cut the ribbon on the north wing.\u00a0 One of the great things about this job is something I\u2019ve never gotten to do before, which is to get a large pair of scissors and cut a ribbon.\u00a0 So I will happily take part in that now.\u00a0 George, will you join us?\u00a0 And also can we have Deputy Director Dykhouse join us as well?\nTo everyone, thank you for being here today, but especially thank you for being here every day in your respective ways to make this partnership one for the ages, as it already is.\u00a0 Thank you.\n(The ribbon was cut.)\n(Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-greek-foreign-minister-nikos-dendias-at-a-joint-press-availability/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Minister, for the second time today I\u2019d like to welcome you to Athens.\nLadies and gentlemen, we have just inaugurated with the \u2013 my U.S. counterpart the Fourth Strategic Dialogue between Greece and the U.S.\u00a0 We also held a constructive discussion on the overall framework of our bilateral relations.\nStrategic Dialogue concerns seven key areas.\u00a0 It is a tangible piece of evidence of the dynamics in \u2013 of our relations with the U.S., strategic relations.\u00a0 We have reached the highest point, and with certain prospects.\u00a0 A solid base of our \u2013 a solid foundation of our bilateral relations are our shared values and principles:\u00a0 freedom, democracy, human rights, our focus on the international law and the principles of the UN Charter, as well as the dynamic presence of the Greek diaspora in the U.S.\u00a0 Greece \u2013 the U.S. Ambassador to Athens Mr. Tsunis is such a bright example of the successes of the Greek diaspora.\nDear Tony, dear Secretary of State, today\u2019s visit of yours comes after the visit of the Greek prime minister to Washington in May 2022.\u00a0 The rising dynamics of the \u2013 our strategic bilateral relations has been sealed by the two defense agreements between our countries, and I had the honor of signing both such agreements.\u00a0 The signing proves that in a constantly changing political environment, Greece is acknowledged as a pillar of stability and security.\nUs and the U.S. have fought shoulder to shoulder in major historic challenges of the 20th century:\u00a0 the first world \u2013 World War I, World War II, and in Korea, when totalitarian regimes attempted to impose their will through threat of using force and through the use of force.\u00a0 Unfortunately, today, in the 21st century, we are witnessing similar behaviors.\u00a0 Such an example is the Russian invasion or aggression on Ukraine.\nI repeat on every occasion that the Greek foreign policy is based on the full implementation of laws, international law, and the International Law of the Sea.\u00a0 It relies on respect for the principles of the UN Charter, protection of human rights, and a condemnation of threat or use of violence.\nFrom the very first moment we offered our help to Ukraine, we aligned ourselves with the decisions and sanctions against Russia in the context of our memberships in the EU and the UN.\u00a0 The Greek Parliament ratified very quickly the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO, two countries which are also our partners in the European Union.\nToday we had the opportunity to discuss developments in the broader area as well.\u00a0 We agreed on the need, the necessity, to keep the Euro-Atlantic course of Western Balkans alive.\u00a0 I informed my dear Tony about my visits to the Western Balkans, the efforts made by Greece to avoid a new crisis in our region.\u00a0 I also informed him about developments in the Aegean and Southeastern Mediterranean.\nOur neighboring country, T\u00fcrkiye and Syria, were mercilessly hit by the recent earthquakes.\u00a0 I had the chance to witness the magnitude of this unprecedented disaster during my visit to (inaudible) in last week, accompanied by my friend, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.\u00a0 It was the first visit of a European minister of foreign affairs in the affected areas.\nAnd yesterday I had the opportunity to inform the Foreign Affairs Council in the EU, in Brussels, requesting help for the earthquake victims.\u00a0 Greece was the first country to send special rescue sources \u2013 forces to T\u00fcrkiye, and the Greek society has been assembling tons of humanitarian material to be offered to the Turkish and Syrian peoples.\nWe also agreed with the Turkish Foreign Minister that we don\u2019t need to wait for disasters in order to \u2013 smoothing out our relations.\nToday we\u2019ve had the opportunity to discuss with Tony Blinken about our collaboration within the international organizations, and the multilateral programs such as the 3+1 co-partnership and the prospect of strengthening it further.\nAnother issue that we discussed was that of energy, specifically the steps that need to be taken in order to gain independence of the Russian fossil fuels.\u00a0 I stressed the role that Greece may play as an energy hub from south to north.\u00a0 The floating LNG storage facilities in Alexandroupolis and Revithoussa, the Greece-Bulgarian Pipeline are only a few of the schemes that are going to strengthen this role.\nWe also welcome the U.S. support of the electric Interconnection between Greece and Egypt.\u00a0 This Interconnection will allow the transportation, the transmission of clean energy to the EU.\nWe also discussed about collaborations in the areas of renewable energy sources and investments.\u00a0 The U.S. is our greatest partner outside the EU in trade, investment, and tourism.\nToday \u2013 concluding, rather, I would like to say that today is yet another important day for Greek-American relations.\u00a0 Dear Tony, I\u2019d like to thank you warmly and wish you a nice day in the birthplace of democracy.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, Nikos, my friend, thank you so very much.\nAs you can all hear, I left my voice in Washington.\u00a0 But I will probably leave my heart in Athens.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard not to.\nWe do meet at a time when the partnership between our two countries has never been closer and never been more consequential.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a reflection of the high priority that President Biden and Prime Minister Mitsotakis put on this relationship, this partnership.\nBefore coming here I was in T\u00fcrkiye, as Nikos was recently.\u00a0 Everywhere I went, among all the people I met, to include some American first responders, search and rescue teams, Turkish military families, our locally employed Turkish staff at our embassies and consulates, I saw the immense, heartbreaking toll of this earthquake throughout T\u00fcrkiye in the southeast and as well, of course, in Syria.\u00a0 I had a chance, like the foreign minister, to be with our colleague from T\u00fcrkiye, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, and fly over the affected area.\nSo I really want to thank you, Nikos, and the Greek people for the immediate and significant assistance that you\u2019ve been providing to people in need in T\u00fcrkiye in this moment of need.\nLater today I\u2019ll have an opportunity to express my appreciation to some of the Greek first responders who came to the aid of the Turkish people.\u00a0 Their contributions are a strong demonstration of who Greeks are:\u00a0 compassionate, effective, committed to helping others.\u00a0 And it\u2019s resonating around the world.\u00a0 This is an ethos.\u00a0 This is their (inaudible).\nLast spring we were together when we celebrated the historic visit of Prime Minister Mitsotakis to Washington.\u00a0 Standing before a joint session of our Congress in the United States Capitol, the heart of our democracy, Prime Minister Mitsotakis spoke about our countries\u2019 shared history, how the ancient Greeks inspired America\u2019s founders, who, in turn, were an example for Greeks when they fought for and won their own independence decades later.\u00a0 And he spoke about how our values resonate to this day between us, how we are two democracies that are dedicated to trying to be on the right side of history, standing with allies and partners, defending democracy in our countries and around the world.\nOne of the things that President Biden likes to constantly remind us of is that in the United States we were founded not on the basis of an ethnic group or religious group or racial group; we were founded on the basis of an idea.\u00a0 And as it happens, it\u2019s a Greek idea.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to think of a more powerful bond between peoples than the bond that exists between us.\nOver the past year, Greece has demonstrated its commitment to the principles at the heart of our relationship, including as Russia seeks to destroy Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, its independence, and democracy through its brutal war of aggression.\u00a0 Now, no one wanted this war, no one likes this war.\u00a0 Everyone wants it to end as quickly as possible.\u00a0 But so long as it isn\u2019t, so long as Russia\u2019s aggression continues, it\u2019s vital that together we stand up for the basic principles that are the victims of this aggression, along with the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Because if we don\u2019t, if we allow this to go forward with impunity, then we will open a Pandora\u2019s box around the world where might makes right and would-be aggressors say, \u201cWell, if they can get away with it, we can get away with it, too.\u201d\u00a0 And that is not a future that any of us want.\nOne year after President Putin attacked Ukraine, it\u2019s clear that his war has been a strategic failure in every way.\u00a0 That\u2019s because of the courage of the Ukrainian people, but it\u2019s also because of the strength and unity of allies and partners around the world who have come to support Ukraine and help it in its defense.\nSince President Putin\u2019s invasion, Greece has been a strong, outspoken voice in supporting Ukraine.\u00a0 As a matter of fundamental principle, you\u2019ve opened your doors to 20,000 Ukrainians who have been displaced from their homes.\u00a0 You were one of the first EU countries to send humanitarian support and vital security assistance.\u00a0 You\u2019ve helped reinforce NATO and strengthen the Alliance\u2019s eastern flank, including by facilitating shipments through the Port of Alexandroupolis, whose strategic importance has grown dramatically.\nEarlier this morning, as Nikos said, we launched the Fourth Strategic Dialogue between our countries, during which we discussed the progress that\u2019s been made under our Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement, the backbone of our security cooperation.\u00a0 Just over a year ago, the two of us signed an amendment to that pact.\u00a0 And since then, our troops have been training more closely in more places than ever.\u00a0 And that\u2019s strengthening our joint preparedness, our \u2013 and security, and it offers to advance peace and stability across the continent.\nWe\u2019re also working together, as you heard, on a clean energy transition, where there is enormous appetite among American companies to invest in Greece\u2019s very significant move toward renewables.\u00a0 And Greece\u2019s surging tech sector is also a major source of our investment and a key focus of our efforts to expand economic cooperation between our countries.\nWe\u2019re also working together to strengthen energy security across the region, and you heard Nikos talk about that.\u00a0 We\u2019re both taking steps to help Southeast Europe countries reduce their dependence on Russian gas, diversify energy sources, and deepen integration into the continent\u2019s broader energy market.\u00a0 That\u2019s both an economic and a security imperative.\u00a0 The United States welcomes the leadership role that Greece is playing, including through the newly constructed Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria, which is putting Bulgaria on a path to import nearly 100 percent of its domestic gas needs through Azerbaijan and through the United States.\nWe\u2019re working together as well across an incredibly broad array of issues, as you heard Nikos say:\u00a0 security and defense, trade and investment, energy and the environment, education and culture, law enforcement and counterterrorism, humanitarian challenges, disaster relief, \u00a0through the Strategic Dialogue \u2013 reflecting, again, the breadth of this relationship.\nBut I think, when it comes down to it, the heart of the relationship is what it has always been, and that is the ties between our people.\u00a0 Our people have been linked by a shared history, by common ideas, by common ideals, and the unique bond about being the world\u2019s oldest and strongest democracies.\nSo Nikos, I am grateful to you and grateful to Prime Minister Mitsotakis, who was so generous in his hospitality and conversation last night, for the opportunity to be here to celebrate a friendship but especially to strengthen our partnership for years to come.\u00a0 We both believe that that is profoundly beneficial to our people.\u00a0 And ultimately, the challenge for both of our countries is, in this era, to continue to demonstrate that democracies can deliver for their people.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to try to help our fellow citizens in any way that we can.\u00a0 Governments are here to try to make a difference in helping meet their needs and aspirations.\u00a0 That\u2019s also profoundly what unites us.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR: (Via interpreter) We are going to take four questions in total, two from the U.S. journalist team and two from the Greek journalists.\u00a0 We will \u2013 are going to start \u2013 we will take the first one from a Greek journalist.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 A question for both ministers regarding Libya.\u00a0 The situation in the country remains unchanged.\u00a0 There are forces, military forces and diplomatic forces, that take action there to the detriment of any effort \u2013 of any stabilizing efforts in the country and is to the detriment of the elections there.\nGreece (inaudible) the Turkish-Libyan agreement, which is illegal, according to the International Law of the Sea, because it divides the West and the East Mediterranean.\u00a0 So do you see any developments in the forthcoming period, and in what direction would such developments be?\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR: (Via interpreter) Whom is this question for, Mr. Tzanetakos?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Both ministers.\u00a0 This is for both ministers.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So let me take this off, thank you.\nAs I said earlier, first I just came from T\u00fcrkiye before being in Greece, and I think we\u2019re reminded in this moment of what brings us together as human beings, and that ultimately is much greater than any of our differences.\u00a0 And that is our common humanity and the desire that people have in both countries to help each other in a time of need.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a very powerful thing that\u2019s resonating very powerfully in T\u00fcrkiye, and I heard that from Turkish officials as well as from the Turkish people that I met.\nLook, that doesn\u2019t resolve differences that are longstanding, but I think it\u2019s a reminder of all the positive, that ultimately we\u2019re human beings before we\u2019re anything else.\u00a0 And my hope would be that at an appropriate time that would create an even stronger foundation for both countries moving forward to resolve the differences that exist between them.\nNow, it\u2019s not exactly a secret that both Greece and T\u00fcrkiye are heading into an election period, and that\u2019s usually a pretty complicated time to engage in these kinds of issues.\u00a0 But for the United States it\u2019s really quite basic:\u00a0 Greece and T\u00fcrkiye are partners, are Allies, are friends.\u00a0 And we continue to engage with them, to work together, including through NATO, to maintain peace and security in the region, to resolve any differences diplomatically, and of course to avoid any threats or provocative rhetoric that will only raise tensions.\u00a0 And that can be more difficult in an election period, but it\u2019s certainly our hope and expectation of both.\nAnd then I would just say this in conclusion.\u00a0 If you\u2019re \u2013 if you look at the region as a whole and you look at what Greece is already doing \u2013 for example, to be becoming an energy hub for the region, to connect through the Eastern Mediterranean to connect Africa to Europe, to bring countries together through cooperation \u2013 that\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing, as is the innovation Greece is doing, for example, on climate.\nBut at some point, were the differences to be resolved, I think that opens an era of incredible opportunity even greater than we\u2019re seeing today for the people of Greece, also for the people of T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 So that\u2019s certainly our hope, but meanwhile it\u2019s important that our friends, partners, and Allies manage their differences diplomatically, peacefully.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll support those efforts in any way we can.\nFOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) If understood well, you would like some comment on Libya.\u00a0 Well, listen, our position \u2013 I think the position of the U.S. as well, but Mr. Blinken is here to say otherwise \u2013 is that this Turkish-Libyan MOU adds no value.\u00a0 On the contrary, it\u2019s totally illegal, therefore unsubstantiated, unfounded.\nNow, as regards the efforts made on many sides, including the U.S., in order to find a mechanism to lead the country to elections, well, Greece in this respect is ready to offer in any way possible.\u00a0 This is our general position.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I apologize; I misunderstood your question, and I\u2019m sorry about that.\u00a0 And let me just simply add that I agree with my friend Nikos on this.\u00a0 And when it comes to Libya and its trajectory forward, I think it\u2019s important to get to elections as quickly as reasonably possible to have a government that has the legitimacy of having been selected by the people.\nThe UN special envoy is working in that direction, and building on the work that\u2019s actually been done already to try to bring the parties together to decide on an appropriate path forward for elections.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that we support, and we think offers the best prospects for moving Libya forward, and I think we\u2019re in full agreement on that with our partners here in Greece.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next go to the question from Courtney McBride of Bloomberg News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you both.\u00a0 A question for each of you.\nMr. Minister, Greece has provided military equipment to Ukraine while receiving some updated equipment to replenish its own stocks.\u00a0 What more does Greece envision providing, particularly in the areas of greatest need:\u00a0 artillery, ammunition, and air defense?\u00a0 And how can you seize this opportunity to improve relations with T\u00fcrkiye?\u00a0 I know that you\u2019ve provided and continue to provide assistance there.\u00a0 Are there concrete steps that each country could take to help pave the way to smoother relations?\nAnd to Mr. Secretary, what plans are there to expand U.S. investment and presence in Greece?\u00a0 I know you\u2019ve talked about the port that has helped to facilitate some assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) If I understood fully, you asked me two things:\u00a0 first regarding weapon systems that Greece could offer to further help Ukraine; and the second question has to do with the improvement of the Greek-Turkish relations.\nWell, regarding the strengthening of the Ukraine from Greece, I have to tell you the Greek foreign policy.\u00a0 This is an easy choice because our foreign policy is about supporting the rules of international law.\u00a0 In the case of Russian invasion to Ukraine there is \u2013 it\u2019s a case of black and white.\u00a0 There is an aggressor and the victim.\u00a0 So the Greek foreign policy is on the side of victim, the one who is subject to this aggression, and banishment of all rule of \u2013 rules of law.\u00a0 So we will do everything in our power to help the country that suffered this attack.\nAs regards the Greek-Turkish relations, please allow me to tell you that we do not in any way combine the assistance that we\u2019re delivering, we will be delivering to the Syrian and Turkish people, with an overall foreign policy.\u00a0 It is our obligation towards our fellow people who are suffering to help them, and I will \u2013 we will continue doing so.\nNow, if through this contact between the two peoples the climate of our relations is improved, this we\u2019ll happily to call ramifications.\u00a0 We all know that.\u00a0 But again, let me reiterate Greece is not looking for any \u2013 is not asking for anything, for anything in exchange for this assistance and help is delivering to the Turkish and Syrian peoples.\u00a0 It is our obligation to do so.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I had a chance a little bit earlier as we were starting the Strategic Dialogue to talk about some of the recent investments that we\u2019ve already made here in Greece, including well over $100 million when it comes to ports.\u00a0 But I think what\u2019s as compelling, at least to me, are the tremendous opportunities to work together, including through significant U.S. investment from the private sector in things like energy security, climate change technology.\nGreece is a remarkable hub itself of innovation.\u00a0 I think, from our soundings and from talking to Ambassador Tsunis, there is tremendous interest on the part of American companies that\u2019s already manifested itself in these kinds of partnerships here in Greece.\u00a0 And this is something that we talk about through the Strategic Dialogue.\u00a0 From the perspective of governments, the question for us is always:\u00a0 What, if anything, can we do to create the most favorable climate possible for those investments to go forward?\u00a0 How can we enhance bilateral investment and trade opportunities?\u00a0 And that\u2019s part of the Strategic Dialogue work that\u2019s going on today.\nIn addition \u2013 and I think it\u2019s related, and we\u2019ll talk about this a little bit later this afternoon \u2013 we continue to work to strengthen our cultural and educational ties.\u00a0 The more that we create these connections, the more we bring our people together around common interests, common pursuits, I think that also brings with it the kinds of connections that will lead as well to more trade, more investment between us.\nSo we see a tremendous amount of upside in Greece.\u00a0 You see here an economy that has grown at about six percent, which is quite remarkable; that has more than weathered the deep economic difficulties of years past and offers, I think, tremendous potential for greater investment, trade between our two countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that\u2019s very much a focus of our efforts here and through the Strategic Dialogue.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Ms. Tasouli from OPEN Channel.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, welcome to Athens.\u00a0 You mentioned before that you had the opportunity to talk to people of Greece and people of T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 My question is:\u00a0 Do you believe that the earthquake diplomacy and that the claims of T\u00fcrkiye that they are willing to start the dialogue again between the two countries, is that something that you ask for?\u00a0 And do you estimate that T\u00fcrkiye sooner or later will embrace its old rhetoric by threatening Greece and by reminding that casus belli is still on the table from them?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And because I more or less inadvertently answered that question before, since I misunderstood the first question, I don\u2019t want to repeat\u00a0 myself except to say, look, as a close friend, partner, ally to both countries, it\u2019s profoundly in our interest and I believe in the interest of both Greece and T\u00fcrkiye to find ways to resolve longstanding differences, to do it through dialogue, through diplomacy, to do it peacefully, and in the meantime, to not take any unilateral actions or use any charged rhetoric that would only make things more difficult and more challenging.\nAs I noted, both countries are heading to an election period.\u00a0 That certainly creates sometimes incentives to engage in rhetoric that can create more problems than it solves, but that\u2019s also politics.\u00a0 We understand that.\nI can\u2019t really speak to what either of our partners will do going forward, but I do believe strongly that there is an interest and an intent in both countries to find ways to resolve longstanding differences, to find ways to make the \u2013 this part of the world that they share an area of cooperation, not of conflict.\u00a0 And I have no doubt in my own mind that that would be profoundly to the benefit of people in Greece and in T\u00fcrkiye, but I say that recognizing the challenges of overcoming differences.\u00a0 They\u2019re real.\u00a0 But as a friend, an allied partner to both, certainly we hope that that\u2019s the path that our friends will pursue in the future.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Final question.\u00a0 John Hudson of The Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, thank you so much for hosting us in your beautiful and sunny capital.\nWestern unity has remained strong behind Ukraine, but what is the appetite in Europe and Greece for supporting a war that becomes protracted, extends for another year, and is measured in meters, not kilometers, on the battlefield?\u00a0 At what point will Greece and other parts of Southern Europe push hard for negotiations?\nMr. Secretary, U.S. Ambassador Nides said Israel can and should do whatever it needs to deal with Iran\u2019s nuclear program and, quote, \u201cWe\u2019ve got their back,\u201d statements that appeared to many as giving Israel a public green light to attack Iran.\u00a0 Is this now U.S. policy?\u00a0 And given the likelihood that open hostilities with Iran would drag in the United States, can Washington afford to back another conflict in a separate theater?\nAnd on Ukraine, can you say who in the U.S. Government or at what level communicated to Russia that President Biden was traveling to Kyiv?\u00a0 Was the President ever in harm\u2019s way?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your question.\n(Via interpreter) \u00a0Thank you for your question.\u00a0 When Russia attacked Ukraine, I believe one of the key working assumptions on the part of the \u2013 of Russia was that Europe would not remain united, that the European Union would be divided either because of the energy blackmail or due to the different approaches to the Ukrainian issue.\u00a0 And I think that this working assumption was proved to totally inaccurate.\u00a0 On the contrary, the European Union obtained a new uniting narrative, and the support \u2013 the EU support to the Ukraine has been ongoing and has been stepped up.\u00a0 And moreover, all sanctions have been unanimously voted by the EU against Russia.\nSo what I would like to say is that the European Union is an area that takes pride in its values, principles, beliefs in human rights, and will firmly continue to support Ukraine.\u00a0 I said earlier that for us in Greece, things are quite simple.\u00a0 It is a matter of international law.\u00a0 Our foreign policy is based on international law.\u00a0 If we took a different stance, in fact we would be shooting against the narrative that we are in support of.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 John, the second part of your question first with regard to notifying Russia of the President\u2019s travels.\u00a0 Yes, we did in order, of course, to deconflict and to avoid any potential for accidents or danger.\u00a0 Beyond that I can\u2019t comment.\nWith regard to Ambassador Nides, I haven\u2019t seen the full comments that my friend Tom made.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure they were notable, as they usually are.\u00a0 From what I\u2019ve heard, because I just got a brief description before, he reiterated what we have consistently said.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to Israel\u2019s security.\u00a0 We are committed together to the proposition that Iran never acquire a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 That\u2019s not exactly news.\u00a0 The President\u2019s been very clear that every option is on the table to do that.\u00a0 And we\u2019re also working to deepen our cooperation and coordination with Israel, as well as with other countries to deal with the multiplicity of challenges that Iran poses, including advances in its nuclear program.\nAt the same time, we\u2019ve also been clear that the Iran nuclear deal, the so-called JCPOA, is not now on the table.\u00a0 We spent many months to seeing if we could revive it and return to mutual compliance.\u00a0 There was a proposal put forward by the European Union some months ago that was endorsed by everyone \u2013 China, Russia, as well as the United States \u2013 and Iran would not go forward with that.\nIn the meantime, of course, we\u2019ve seen the provision by Iran of drones to Russia to enable its aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the renewed repression throughout the streets of Iran against its own citizens simply for trying to speak their minds.\u00a0 And we see Iran also engaging, for example, in plots to assassinate those who oppose the regime in third countries, including in the United States.\nWe continue to believe that, with regard to the nuclear program, the most effective, sustainable way to deal with the challenges it poses is through diplomacy.\u00a0 But in the \u2013 in this moment, those efforts are on the back burner because Iran is simply not engaged in a meaningful way.\u00a0 But the door is always open to diplomacy going forward, but a lot depends on what Iran says and does, and whether or not it engages.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Does Israel have a green light to attack Iran?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Countries will make sovereign decisions for their own security.\u00a0 And of course, that\u2019s no different when it comes to Israel or any country.\u00a0 We can\u2019t make those decisions for them.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-greek-foreign-minister-nikos-dendias-before-their-meeting-and-the-u-s-greece-strategic-dialogue-kick-off/", "title":

Blinken And Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias Before Their Meeting and the U.S.-Greece Strategic Dialogue Kick-Off\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs", "location": "Athens, Greece", "date": "February 21, 2023", "content": "\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:\u00a0Dear Secretary of State, it is with great pleasure that I welcome you in Athens. \u00a0It has been almost a year-and-a-half since our Third Strategic Dialogue in Washington.\u00a0 In the meantime, we have seen war returning to Europe with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 We have also witnessed a revisionist rhetoric in defiance of international law emanating from a number of international actors.\nThe fact is that, in the middle of all this, the strong Greek-U.S. cooperation has been enhanced even further.\u00a0 That speaks volumes for our relation.\u00a0 The strengthening of this cooperation promotes our mutual interest, as well as regional peace, stability, and prosperity.\u00a0 It is also based on shared values and on our respect for international law.\nThe Fourth Strategic Dialogue is a culmination of a series of working group meetings and initiatives of our experts from various ministries.\u00a0 There has been progress in all the Strategic Dialogue subjects:\u00a0 defense and security; law enforcement and counterterrorism; humanitarian challenges; trade, investment; energy and environment; and last, but certainly not least, people-to-people contacts.\nMoreover, we will be conducting open and in-depth discussions on regional political issues.\u00a0 This Strategic Dialogue is an excellent symbol of the strategic relationship between our two countries.\u00a0 It also shows the continuing interest of the United States in our wider region.\u00a0 Our cooperation on defense and security has been going back for decades, but there are plenty of things to show since the last Strategic Dialogue.\nThe planned inclusion of Alexandroupolis in the MDCA allowed it to play a crucial role when it was most needed. \u00a0We are looking forward to speeding up our electric interconnections with the two neighboring continents, Asia to Israel, and Africa to Egypt.\u00a0 At the same time, tourist flows have regained their pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0 The Strategic Dialogue is an excellent demonstration of the strategic relationship between our two countries.\nI know that you have brought with you a group of remarkable high officials from Washington, who will shortly be meeting with our team.\u00a0 Being aware of the dedication that everybody involved has shown in preparing this Fourth Strategic Dialogue, I am certain that it will be a success.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, Nikos, my friend, thank you so much, and forgive me because my voice is struggling a little bit.\u00a0 But it is wonderful for me and for us to be back in Athens, and I am especially excited to be joining you, to be joining our teams, to kick off this Fourth U.S.-Greece Strategic Dialogue.\nThe dialogue is, in fact, a reflection of the partnership that our citizens have had for more than 200 years.\u00a0 And indeed, the delegation today that you referenced demonstrates the depth of our relationship.\u00a0 We have representatives here from the State Department, Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, Commerce, USAID.\nToday\u2019s discussion builds off of the last Strategic Dialogue that we held in 2021, which I remember very well.\u00a0 And among other important steps, as you noted, we amended the Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement between our countries, strengthening our preparedness and shared security by allowing our troops to train together in new ways and in more places.\u00a0 And as you mentioned, one of the new sites supports military transport around the Port of Alexandroupoli, which has become, indeed, a key strategic hub, including bringing in defensive weaponry, trucks, artillery for U.S. military units that are operating in Eastern and Northern Europe, as well as NATO Allies.\nThe United States worked to upgrade the port has created jobs in\u00a0both of our countries.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made similar investments in other parts of Greece, including $123 million in infrastructure improvements in the Souda Bay and Larissa.\nThis port has been vital to reinforcing NATO\u2019s eastern flank since President Putin launched his brutal war of aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 The United States is grateful for Greece\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine since the invasion, including by opening its doors to 20,000 displaced Ukrainians.\u00a0 Greece has also helped lead the humanitarian response to the recent tragic earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye, from where I came.\u00a0 Greece rapidly deployed dozens of firefighters, doctors, search and rescue personnel, and provided crucial humanitarian support, including 80 tons of medicines, blankets, food, and other supplies.\nNikos, I think you were the first foreign minister from Europe to travel to T\u00fcrkiye, visiting just six days after the disaster.\u00a0 And I took the same helicopter ride that you did with the Turkish foreign minister, our colleague Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu.\u00a0 We saw, as you did, the incredible devastation of this earthquake, and we had a chance \u2013 both of us \u2013 to be briefed on the rescue and relief efforts.\nI recall you, Nikos, pledging Greece\u2019s support.\u00a0 And importantly, both foreign ministers \u2013 both of you \u2013 pledged to increase bilateral cooperation, saying, and I quote, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t wait for another earthquake to improve our relations.\u201d\u00a0 The United States, in turn, pledges to do whatever it can to seize this historic opportunity to strengthen relations between two critical allies in a pivotal region at a key moment for NATO and the world.\nIn the Strategic Dialogue that we\u2019re about to embark on today, we\u2019ll have an opportunity to talk about our shared work on other regional priorities, including promoting clean energy and strengthening energy security.\u00a0 Greece\u2019s energy transition has been a model for the region.\u00a0 In 2012, coal-powered plants provided 50 percent of Greece\u2019s electricity needs.\u00a0 Here we are a decade later, and renewable sources like wind, like solar, like hydro, are powering half of Greece\u2019s electricity needs, eliminating 17.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide every year.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of taking 3 million cars off the roads.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a powerful record of progress and success.\nAnd of course, Greece is also helping NATO strengthen their energy security by helping diversity their sources and reducing dependence on Russian gas, also deepening their integration into Europe\u2019s broader energy market.\u00a0 Bulgaria, for example, used to depend on Russia for up to 90 percent of its natural gas. The newly constructed Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria, that gas pipeline is allowing Bulgaria to transition away from that source.\u00a0 In the next year, Bulgaria will import nearly 100 percent of its domestic gas needs from Azerbaijan and the United States as a result of this Interconnector.\nWe\u2019ll also talk about ways to strengthen our people-to-people ties.\u00a0 Over 1 billion Americans live, visit Greece every single year.\u00a0 Millions more, of course, have Greek heritage, including our own president, or Joe Bidenopoulos, as he likes to call himself.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Every day our people study with, learn from, each other.\u00a0 They innovate.\u00a0 They run businesses together.\u00a0 They watch each other\u2019s movies.\u00a0 They listen to each other\u2019s music.\u00a0 They enjoy each other\u2019s food.\nLast November we took our educational cooperation to new heights by launching the Pharos Summit, an initiative dedicated to increasing collaboration between our universities and our exchange programs between our students.\u00a0 We had a record delegation of 30 U.S. universities come to Greece to build partnerships with their Greek public university counterparts, and our governments agreed to grow the number of Fulbright students from 70,000 in 2022 to 100,000 this year.\nAt the summit, Prime Minister Mitsotakis remarked that Greece is an appealing destination for cultural exchange because this vibrant, dynamic country is a workshop of constant change.\u00a0 It\u2019s a wonderful way to describe Greece and, I think, our own country, because the same can be said for us, and the same can be said for our friendship.\nOurs is a relationship that is always evolving, innovating, ultimately leading the way to a better future for us both.\u00a0 So I\u2019m confident that today\u2019s Strategic Dialogue will further all of these efforts and help us better deliver for the Greek and American people and for the world, because, after all, that\u2019s our responsibility.\nAnd with that, we\u2019ve got lots to discuss, so let\u2019s get started.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-greek-prime-minister-kyriakos-mitsotakis-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Distinguished members of the press, today (inaudible) together with my distinguished friend, the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Antony Blinken, in Ankara.\u00a0 Following the earthquake disaster, we received a lot of messages of condolence and support from the U.S.A.\u00a0 President Biden personally called our president and expressed his feelings of solidarity and indicated that they are ready to provide all kinds of support.\u00a0 My distinguished counterpart and my distinguished friend Tony called me twice before the visit and extended his feelings of solidarity.\u00a0 And in addition to the request that\u00a0T\u00fcrkiye made, he asked whether we needed anything additional.\u00a0 I would like to thank him.\nYesterday, we paid a visit to the earthquake disaster zone, and we conducted our visit in that area.\u00a0 Many U.S. institutions and enterprises are actually providing humanitarian assistance activities in this area, and many individuals and many institutions in the U.S.A. \u2013 some companies, and my distinguished friend met with some of them, as well as NGOs \u2013 are providing assistance and are organizing assistance campaigns.\u00a0 And we are grateful for this support, both to the U.S. administration as well as to the people of United States of America.\u00a0 We would like to thank them for the solidarity and support they have extended in these dire days.\nDistinguished members of the press, we have an extensive agenda with U.S.A, and we met in Washington with my distinguished counterpart a month ago for the Strategic Mechanism meeting.\u00a0 And we agreed that we should have meetings twice on an annual basis, and we would like to conduct the second meeting in the second half of this year, but the \u2013 the preparations are ongoing.\u00a0 Our common aim is actually to increase the opportunities existing in our relations, as well as turning these into concrete gains, and also effectively manage the problems and the issues raising.\u00a0 And, of course, this is the main philosophy behind the Strategic Mechanism.\nEconomy and trade is actually one of the pioneering items of the positive agenda.\u00a0 Last year, the trade volume reached $32 billion, and we would like to continue working to reach the $100 billion target.\u00a0 The mutual investments are increasing.\nMilitary relations are an important dimension of our strategic partnership, but of course, due to unilateral sanctions, the cooperation in the field of defense industry is facing difficulties.\u00a0 And we need to overcome these difficulties, and the sanctions, we expect them to be lifted in the earliest opportunity.\nWe also reviewed the (inaudible) status quo pertaining to our F-16 request and we discussed this with our colleagues.\u00a0 The U.S. administration strongly supports our request.\u00a0 We are thankful for this support, and the official notification, if it\u2019s done to the Congress in the earliest opportunity and the ratification process is completed at the earliest opportunity possible, is going to be benefiting for both side.\u00a0 Of course, there could be difficulties arising in the U.S. Congress, but the delays or the obstruction by certain circles in this process should not be allowed, and the U.S. Congress should not be obstructing, rather undertaking a role of support.\nOf course, meeting this request is important in terms of our bilateral relations, but it\u2019s also important in terms of the NATO defense capabilities.\u00a0 And, of course, in the dialogue with the U.S. Congress, the U.S. administration have clearly underlined this fact.\nOf course, fighting against terrorism \u2013 counterterrorism \u2013 is amongst the items of our joint agenda.\u00a0 We have certain expectations pertaining to the support rendered to PKK/YPG and the ending of the existence (inaudible), and we have once again underlined our expectations and the U.S. side is aware of this.\nThere are certain issues of consular matters which we undertook during the meeting today with our colleagues, especially the visa application processes.\u00a0 There are serious delays.\u00a0 There was some acceleration at one point, but there is now a waiting period up to six months, and we extended our request for the acceleration.\nAnd, of course, in relation to security threats, we do believe that we should have a coordination and cooperation with respect to such declarations and warnings on security.\nDuring our meetings we discussed also the international and regional issues.\u00a0 In addition to bilateral matters, we talked about the Southern Caucasus.\u00a0 In the recent periods, both me and my distinguished friend Tony have contacted both the Azerbaijan as well as the Armenian side.\u00a0 Our aim is to have a stable peace and stability in Southern Caucasus, and we will continue to strive to this end.\nIn relation to the expansion of NATO, which was another matter that we discussed, we underlined once again our expectations from the two candidate members to NATO.\u00a0 In the coming period, the permanent \u2013 the Standing Committee meeting is going to take place, which is going to take place in Brussels in NATO, and our colleagues will discuss which steps have been taken and which steps have not been taken.\u00a0 Together with our colleagues from NATO and also participating countries, this will give us an opportunity to transparently identify this issue.\nWe also discussed the Israel and Palestine issue.\u00a0 We\u2019re worried about some of the steps that have been taken, especially the illegal settlements, and also the steps that have been taken needs to be finalized.\u00a0 The declarations of the United States sides we do believe are very positive.\nWe also discussed the issue of Syria, and we discussed the issue of assistance that is going to be provided to Syrian people following the earthquake.\u00a0 And we also had an opportunity to bilaterally discuss these issues.\nI would like to thank for this very open, frank, and productive meeting to my distinguished counterpart, and I would also like to thank them for siding with us and supporting us during these difficult times.\u00a0 And thank you for your visit, my distinguished friend.\u00a0 The floor is yours.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mevlut, my friend, thank you very, very much.\u00a0\u00a0This has been an important opportunity to visit our Turkish allies and friends in a moment of real need, and to bring a clear message from President Biden and from the American people:\u00a0 The United States is here to support you in your time of need, and we will be by your side for as long as it takes to recover and to rebuild.\nYesterday, as my first stop on this trip, I visited Incirlik Air Base, which, as you know, is the hub of the United States efforts to support the disaster response.\u00a0 With the foreign minister, with Mevlut, I had the opportunity to fly over Hatay Province to look at some of the devastation firsthand.\u00a0 And as I said yesterday, it\u2019s hard to put into words: countless buildings, communities, streets, damaged or fully destroyed.\nI met with a number of the responders: U.S. military officials; our team from the U.S. Agency for International Development; members of the incredible American Disaster Assistance Response Team; search and rescue teams from Los Angeles on one coast to Fairfax County, Virginia on the other, where I live; our White Helmet partners in Syria.\u00a0 All of them have seen the staggering toll of this catastrophe \u2013 all of them are committed to being there for our friends in this moment.\nWe began our own assistance to the rescue and relief efforts within hours of the first quake, when President Biden directed the heads of our federal agencies to rapidly mobilize to assist the Government of\u00a0T\u00fcrkiye\u00a0and our humanitarian response partners in Syria.\nWe have sent hundreds of U.S. Government personnel to the region \u2013 including the disaster assistance response and search and rescue teams, and also emergency managers, paramedics, hazardous materials technicians, and engineers.\nWe\u2019ve sent approximately 1.8 million pounds of relief supplies for survivors \u2013 shelter, kitchen sets, blankets, hygiene kits, and more \u2013 and more is on the way.\nWe\u2019re continuing to announce additional assistance, new funding to support these efforts.\u00a0 Yesterday I announced an additional $100 million from the United States on top of the $85 million we\u2019ve already provided.\u00a0 The American people \u2013 communities and businesses, as Mevlut said \u2013 have seen the heartbreaking images and they have been standing up, too.\u00a0 We have nearly $80 million in donations from the private sector in the United States, individuals.\u00a0 When I visited the Turkish embassy in Washington, I almost couldn\u2019t get in the front door because boxes were piled high throughout the driveway to the embassy.\nNow,\u00a0T\u00fcrkiye\u00a0faces a long road ahead to support those rendered homeless, and to rebuild.\u00a0 The UN secretary-general has put out a very important, urgent appeal for $1 billion for long-term assistance, and we\u2019re committed to providing support.\nJust as allies and partners show up for each other in our darkest hours, we also stand side by side in confronting common security challenges.\u00a0 And that\u2019s certainly been true in our response to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nT\u00fcrkiye\u2019s clear voice in support of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity has been critical.\nIts diplomatic leadership \u2013 the foreign minister\u2019s personal role in brokering the UN Black Sea Grain Initiative \u2013 has been critical, and critical to making sure that food and food products could get to people in need around the world, including many people in low-income countries.\nIts continued implementation of the Montreux Convention deterred naval escalation in the Black Sea and helped protect Ukraine\u2019s coastline.\nT\u00fcrkiye\u2019s humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine \u2013 providing initial safe haven for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian onslaught, supplying hundreds of generators for cities amid blackouts as Russia continues to attack the electricity grid \u2013 that has saved lives in Ukraine.\nAnd its position as a key energy transit hub has bolstered energy security, bringing alternative natural gas supplies \u2013 international LNG, as well as Caspian Sea gas \u2013 to Europe.\nThe United States greatly values T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s contributions as a longstanding and active member of the NATO Alliance, and we\u2019ll keep working together to strengthen and grow our Alliance \u2013 including through the accession of Sweden and Finland, which will help deliver even stronger and more capable assets to the Alliance.\nT\u00fcrkiye\u00a0and the United States are also partnering to fight global terrorism and to advance peace in the Balkans and the Caucasus and other global hotspots.\u00a0 We very much appreciate the positive steps that\u00a0T\u00fcrkiye is taking to improve relations with Greece, with Armenia, with Israel \u2013 whose citizens, by the way, have been working side by side with their colleagues from T\u00fcrkiye in response to the earthquake.\u00a0\u00a0And we\u2019re committed to maintaining our very close defense cooperation, including by ensuring that\u00a0T\u00fcrkiye\u00a0remains a highly capable air power contributor within the NATO Alliance.\nWe\u2019re focused on expanding the robust trade, investment, and economic cooperation between our countries.\u00a0 As Mevlut said, we had a very good year last year.\u00a0 Trade exceeded a record $30 billion.\u00a0 We\u2019re eager to build on that foundation, to pursue new opportunities, particularly in the renewables sector.\u00a0 T\u00fcrkiye has invested over $16 billion in renewables over the last five years, and is pursuing ambitious goals to increase capacity over the next five years.\u00a0 We look forward to setting up a Climate and Energy Dialogue to accelerate these efforts, while also creating jobs and inclusive economic growth for both of our countries.\nBeyond these shared interests, United States and T\u00fcrkiye have a relationship that is built on shared values \u2013 values of democracy, respect for basic universal freedoms, for human rights.\u00a0 And today, we had an opportunity to discuss those principles, as we always do in our conversations.\nAnd like all good friends, the United States and T\u00fcrkiye do not agree on every issue.\u00a0 But like good friends, ours is a partnership that has withstood extraordinary change and some significant challenges, and will continue to do so, particularly because we\u2019re able to speak so directly and candidly to each other.\nLater today, I\u2019ll have the privilege of visiting the Anitkabir, the resting place of the founder of the Turkish Republic.\nIn the heart of our own capital stands a monument to one of our own great independence leaders and founders, George Washington. One hundred and seventy years ago, when the Washington Monument was being constructed, Sultan Abdul Mejid sent a marble plaque to be placed on the obelisk.\u00a0 And the words on that stone were inscribed by the same calligrapher whose work graces the Hagia Sophia.\u00a0 His message can still be made out, 170 years later:\u00a0 \u201cIn support of eternal friendship.\u201d\nToday, that commitment not only endures, but continues to grow and to flourish, as I\u2019m convinced it will for generations.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Ecem Toplar from Bengu Turk TV.\u00a0 This is going to be question to both ministers.\u00a0 Minister Cavusoglu (inaudible) that the U.S. administration supports, but this process in the Congress is not clear.\u00a0 When do you expect the official notification to \u2013 done?\u00a0 And is there any expectation that there will be an obstruction?\u00a0 Because we know that certain senators have written to President Biden.\u00a0 And in addition to this, for\u00a0T\u00fcrkiye there is 1 billion payment that has been made for F-35.\u00a0 What is the last situation and the status quo on this payment?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 With regard to the F-16s, the Biden administration strongly supports the package to both upgrade the existing F-16s and to provide new ones to T\u00fcrkiye, because as a NATO Ally and partner, it is in our national interest and the security interest of the Alliance that T\u00fcrkiye continue to be able to operate at the higher standards of NATO to make sure that we have full interoperability.\nOn this particular matter, I can\u2019t offer you an assessment or get into the process until after we formally notify our Congress, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on and we\u2019ve made very clear to Congress our strong support for the F-16 modernization.\u00a0 We have longstanding defense and security ties, and as the President has said \u2013 as President Biden has said \u2013 Turkish NATO interoperability remains a priority for us.\nFOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 As I mentioned during my remarks, we clearly stated our expectations pertaining to the F-16.\u00a0 There is will on the U.S. administration side, and we are aware of certain letters that have been written by some circles and some senators.\u00a0 On one hand, we are working on this in terms of delegations, technical delegations, and if the U.S. administration has a firm stance and if we work together, we believe that we can overcome this resistance that might exist.\nThese two independent issues, especially pertaining to two states becoming full member to NATO to be the precondition of the purchase of F-16 \u2013 these are not related issues.\u00a0 They are different negotiations.\u00a0 For both sides there is an MOU that has been signed \u2013 a trilateral MOU \u2013 so it will not be correct to put this as a precondition, or, of course, it will not be possible for us to purchase F-16 with certain conditions.\u00a0 Our hands should not be tied, so we should have a common stance as the administration of T\u00fcrkiye and the administration of U.S.\u00a0 This is critical.\nOn the issue of the F-35, we were a partner to the F-35, and because of the CAATSA sanctions, T\u00fcrkiye was taken out of this partnership.\u00a0 This was a unilateral decision.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t our decision.\u00a0 There is a payment that we have made, $1.4 billion, and if T\u00fcrkiye is not in the program, of course, expecting that this money is to be paid back to us is only natural.\u00a0 And negotiations are continuing on this.\u00a0 On 18th of January when we met with my counterpart in Washington, D.C., the experts also discussed the issue of F-35 on the same day.\u00a0 And, of course, it will be beneficial to reach a conclusion to this ASAP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Reuters, Humeyra Pamuk. (Via interpreter) Thank you.\u00a0 Reuters, Humeyra Pamuk.\u00a0 Minister, the relations between T\u00fcrkiye and U.S. have been continuing in a negative way, and there are differences of opinions \u2013 the F-16s, Sweden and Finland.\u00a0 Also, on the issue of earthquake, you have indicated that there is strong solidarity.\u00a0 Do you believe that this tragedy that we experienced will be an occasion for a new page in the relations between the two countries?\nAnd NATO countries and U.S. are expecting T\u00fcrkiye to ratify the membership application of both Sweden and Finland before the Vilnius summit.\u00a0 Will T\u00fcrkiye be able to meet this requirement?\n(In English) Ties between your two countries have been in a bad place.\u00a0 You yourself described T\u00fcrkiye in your confirmation hearing two years ago as a so-called ally.\u00a0 But I wonder if the experience of the earthquake has created an opportunity for a reset between the two countries.\nAnd a follow-up to my colleague\u2019s question on the F-16:\u00a0 You just said you can\u2019t assess a timeline for the formal notification.\u00a0 What exactly is the United States waiting for?\u00a0 Are you waiting for T\u00fcrkiye to approve the Nordic expansion?\u00a0 And what will you do to convince the U.S. Congress to be on board?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 Of course, the solidarity that has been extended during difficult times always have a positive effect on relations, and it contributes to those relations.\u00a0 We might have differences of opinions with the United States of America, and these issues are clear, but the positive agenda and focusing on the positive agenda \u2013 and there is also a will to develop our relations further.\nTherefore, during the meeting in Rome, President Biden and President Erdogan discussed the establishment of the Strategic Mechanism.\u00a0 The aim behind this, as I have mentioned \u2013 the philosophy behind this \u2013 is to focus on the positive agenda and develop relations on a bilateral basis in different platforms and increase cooperation in regional and global issues.\nThe second aim is actually to discuss the existing problems and discuss how these problems could be resolved and take steps accordingly.\u00a0 In this direction, both at expert level and at the ministerial level, we met twice, and I do believe that such meetings have been very beneficial.\u00a0 When the foreign minister of Greece visited our country, as I said during the press meeting, for developing relations or for resolving existing problems, we should not wait for a disaster to take place and we should take sincere and concrete steps in this direction.\nThe membership of Sweden and Finland, if you follow the declarations on our side \u2013 and I do know that the U.S. is following this closely \u2013 we have a trilateral memorandum of understanding between these three countries, and it\u2019s very clear as to what steps needed to be taken by which side.\u00a0 Relatively, our problems with Finland are less, so the calendar that you have shared with respect to the NATO Summit in Vilnius \u2013 these are tied in relation to the steps that are to be taken by Sweden.\u00a0\nThere have been some positive messages, there have been legislative amendments and constitutional amendments undertaken by the Swedish side, but unfortunately, the PKK supporters and also in relation to financing of terrorism and (inaudible) for terrorism, as well as the terrorist propaganda \u2013 all activities are continuing.\u00a0 And these are taking place in the center of Stockholm in front of the city building, and they are trying to eliminate Sweden\u2019s membership to NATO.\u00a0 But, of course, it\u2019s up to Sweden to take relevant measures to eliminate such activities.\u00a0\nWe saw the sincere efforts of the prime minister, and he also had an opportunity to see the stance of all political parties in our parliament.\u00a0 This is just \u2013 it isn\u2019t just a matter of the government\u2019s position.\u00a0 So the faster and the better the Swedish side takes steps, if they take steps that will convince our parliament and our people, then we will take the relevant steps as well.\nOf course, on the issue of Finland, we have indicated that there could be a different methodology followed.\u00a0 This was a message that our president shared with the secretary general of NATO last week.\u00a0 Here we are especially waiting for the Swedish side to take concrete steps, and everybody should support Sweden to take these concrete steps.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Humeyra, thank you.\u00a0 I don\u2019t share the premise of the question about the nature of our or status of our relationship.\u00a0 As I laid out in my opening statement, T\u00fcrkiye and the United States are working closely together across multiple fronts, whether it\u2019s in our own bilateral relationship, whether it\u2019s in the region, Europe more broadly, or for that matter around the world.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a partnership that we greatly value.\nWith regard to the F-16s, I can\u2019t give you a timeline on formal notification.\u00a0 What I can tell you is I have already been actively engaged in speaking to Congress about the administration\u2019s strong support for the F-16 package, the upgrade, modernization package.\u00a0 And I have shared, again, our view that this is very important for ongoing NATO interoperability and in the national security interest of the United States.\nThe matter of Finland and Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO is not a bilateral issue.\u00a0 Of course, as you know well, we strongly support their admission as quickly as possible.\u00a0 Both are members already of NATO\u2019s Partnership for Peace, NATO\u2019s Enhanced Opportunity Partnership.\u00a0 Their militaries work seamlessly with the rest of the Alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019re confident that NATO will formally welcome them in soon, and when that happens, it will enhance the security of every NATO member, including the United States, including T\u00fcrkiye.\nFinland and Sweden have already taken concrete steps to fulfill the commitments that they made under the trilateral memorandum of agreement that they signed with T\u00fcrkiye on the margins of the NATO Summit in Madrid.\u00a0 We welcome and appreciate those steps.\u00a0 I think they\u2019re quite significant.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much. Emre Karaca from Haber (inaudible).\u00a0 My question is to Secretary of State Blinken, and I would also like to ask Minister Cavusoglu to comment on my question.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to be focusing on Syria.\u00a0 In relation to border security and the PKK/YPG presence in Syria, there are certain worries, and there have been some agreements rendered with the United States of America, and T\u00fcrkiye has indicated that expectations have not been met.\u00a0 Likewise, in relation to cooperation of U.S.A with PKK/YPG, there are some worries as well.\u00a0 Was this issue raised during your deliberations?\u00a0 And what is the U.S. side going to take in terms of steps to overcome the reservations of T\u00fcrkiye?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 Yes, we did discuss this, and as we\u2019ve said in the past and as I reiterated today, we very much recognize T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s legitimate security concerns about its southern border \u2013 just, as I believe, T\u00fcrkiye recognizes our legitimate and, indeed, shared security concerns about Daesh and the possibility of its re-emergence.\u00a0 We will continue to work closely together to address both of those concerns.\u00a0\nIn the immediate moment, of course, we\u2019re both very much focused on humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria, who, like the people of T\u00fcrkiye, have suffered terribly from the earthquake, and we\u2019re working together to maximize the support that can get to them.\u00a0 As you know, there has been only one official border crossing recognized under a UN Security Council resolution for purposes of the UN providing assistance.\u00a0 That\u2019s deeply unfortunate because, as a result of repeated Russian efforts over the years, the number of crossings has been reduced from four to one.\u00a0\nWe now have information that the Assad regime will allow access through two other border crossings.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see what actually materializes in practice, but everything else aside, it is vitally important that all of us do everything we possibly can to maximize support to the people of Syria, just as we\u2019re maximizing support to the people of T\u00fcrkiye to deal with the horrific effects of the earthquake.\nBy the way, the United States over the last decade or so since the outbreak of the war in Syria has been the leading humanitarian provider to people in Syria \u2013 $15 billion.\u00a0 We do that through NGO partners.\u00a0 It\u2019s vitally important that they be able to do their work freely, safely, securely.\u00a0 This is about the most basic needs of people who are in distress, and I hope we can all work together to meet those needs.\nFOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 You asked me to comment on this question as well.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s Daesh or any other terrorist organization, we believe that cooperating with one terrorist organization to fight with another terrorist organization is a fatal mistake.\u00a0 This is something that we repeatedly indicate.\u00a0 Therefore, the allegation that PKK/YPG is fighting against Daesh \u2013 we have always proven that this allegation is not correct.\u00a0 We as strong NATO Allies should be fighting all terrorist organizations, whatever the ideology, whatever the aim, whatever the target might be.\u00a0 We need to fight against them together.\u00a0 If there is political will, we also have the capacity to fight together as T\u00fcrkiye and the U.S.A.\nThere are two threats for NATO today.\u00a0 The first threat is Russian Federation, and the second threat is terrorism.\u00a0 Therefore, as NATO Allies, if we cannot fight on our own and we have to cooperate with a terrorist organization like PKK/YPG, which is an enemy to our state, that is not correct.\u00a0\nIn the relation to Syria, there have been some agreements with the American side.\u00a0 One is the Manbij roadmap, and this other one is the joint declaration that was undertaken in Ankara.\u00a0 In relation to this joint declaration, especially within the 30-kilometer deadline of our border, this was going to be an area that is cleansed of terrorist activity, and they would be sent to the south.\u00a0 But as I have said during our meeting in Washington, D.C., we did not see a concrete step.\u00a0 Therefore, we believe that we should fight against any type of terrorism altogether, and we should implement the agreements that we have stricken.\nThis is an earthquake and it is a civil issue, a humanitarian issue.\u00a0 This is also the U.S. administration position.\u00a0 So assisting the civilians that have been affected by the earthquake in Syria is our task and duty.\u00a0 Some international organizations and some countries, when they\u2019re providing humanitarian assistance to us, they asked us to deliver some part of this assistance to Syria, and this is how United Nations is delivering humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 It\u2019s our humanitarian obligation to deliver this.\u00a0\nThe Cilvegozu/Bab al-Hawa border gate \u2013 in addition to this, currently there is another border gate in Kilis which is open, and these border gates, we have indicated they are to be used for the United Nations site.\u00a0 The United Nations approved of this decision, although it\u2019s not in the Security Council decision because it\u2019s a humanitarian situation, and some trucks passed through this border gate to deliver humanitarian assistance to the Afrin zone.\u00a0\nSo humanitarian issues are separated from political issues.\u00a0 Our cooperation on humanitarian assistance shall continue, and (inaudible) thank you for the cooperation rendered.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Michael Crowley with\u00a0The New York Times.\u00a0 A question for each of you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, you\u2019ve been saying in recent days that China will face serious consequences if it supplies lethal aid to Russia to aid its war in Ukraine.\u00a0 What might that entail?\u00a0 Are you suggesting there could be U.S. sanctions?\u00a0 And do you believe that other nations would also take steps to punish such an action by China?\nSeparately, I wonder if you could comment on a report that the IAEA has found nuclear material enriched to 84 percent in Iran.\u00a0 Do you believe this is true?\u00a0 And if so, what steps might the U.S. take in response?\nMr. Minister, U.S. officials have been frustrated to see a boom in trade between T\u00fcrkiye and Russia in recent months, specifically including reportedly technology items that are subject to export bans and could be aiding Russia\u2019s war machine.\u00a0 Did you discuss this subject with the Secretary today?\u00a0 And what is your response to these complaints?\u00a0 Thank you both.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Michael, thank you.\u00a0 With regard to China and Russia, as I said the other day and as other colleagues in the administration have said, we are concerned that China is considering supporting Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine with lethal assistance.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching very, very closely.\u00a0 As I also said, and as President Biden said going back many months, when the aggression first took place and he spoke to President Xi Jinping \u2013 he told him at that point that there would be real consequences in our own relationship were China to provide lethal assistance to Russia in this aggression against Ukraine or in a systematic way aid in the evasion of sanctions.\u00a0 And, as I said, we have a real concern that China is considering doing just that.\nI\u2019m not going to lay out what the consequences would be.\u00a0 I shared these concerns directly with the senior Chinese foreign policy official, Wang Yi, when I saw him at the Munich Security Conference just the other day.\u00a0 But I think China understands what\u2019s at risk were it to proceed with providing material support of that kind to Russia.\u00a0 I also know from conversations with many other countries, including in Munich, that many other countries would take very seriously the provision of such support by China to Russia, and this would be a real problem for China in its relationships with many other countries, not just the United States.\u00a0 So we hope and expect that they will forebear for \u2013 from going down that road.\nWith regard to the reports of Iranian enrichment, yes, I\u2019ve seen those reports.\u00a0 We are in close contact with the IAEA, as well as with our partners \u2013 the E3 partners \u2013 in Europe.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to get more information, and when we do, I\u2019ll have more to say.\u00a0 But, of course, this would be a very serious matter.\nFOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:\u00a0(Via interpreter) In the pre-war period, as well as after the war was initiated, T\u00fcrkiye has exhibited a very clear and principled approach.\u00a0 On one hand, we are condemning the war, and as my counterpart has indicated, we are strongly supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u00a0 We are also condemning and not recognizing the results of the illegal referendum and the annexation of territory.\u00a0 Also, in international platforms we take common and joint decisions.\u00a0\nIn the end, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s position is very clear, and we are rigidly implementing the Montreux Convention.\u00a0 We are even surpassing that and we are activating diplomatic channels discussing this with the Russian Federation as well as with our NATO Allies.\u00a0 And we do not bypass the convention at all; we have not allowed any war or military vessel to trespass through our straits.\nBut on the other hand, T\u00fcrkiye is not taking part in the sanctions.\u00a0 We do not take part in the unilateral sanctions.\u00a0 We do abide by the United Nations decisions, clearly, and during our meeting we also discussed how we can cooperate in these areas in relation to the financing of terrorism, et cetera.\u00a0 So when we are fighting against terrorism, we need to actually fight against all aspects of terrorism, including its ideology.\nOn the other hand, for the sanctions imposed by U.S. and the EU, we have indicated from the very beginning that we\u2019re not going to allow any bypassing of these sanctions through our country, and we do not allow this to take place.\u00a0 The deputy treasury secretary came to T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 Our colleagues sat down and discussed this.\u00a0 We are also receiving information from EU, and when necessary we assess this in our cabinet meeting.\u00a0 There was some information that we received from the U.S. side, and we did not believe they were correct or they were exaggerated, but yet again we took certain measures.\u00a0 So the products coming from EU not to be re-exported through our country \u2013 we are taking all relevant measures.\nYou need to act with a principled approach.\u00a0 Our bilateral trade volume with the Russian Federation increased, but more than 60 percent of this is actually gas and energy that we purchase from the Russian Federation.\u00a0 And unfortunately, because of the war, the gas prices tripled, so the trade gap increased.\u00a0 In our export \u2013 our export also increased in relation to some food products and other products, but it is not like electronic products or technological products that would be used in the defense industry, and it\u2019s not correct that we export such products to the Russian Federation.\nTo our American colleagues as well as to our colleagues from EU, we indicated that if they have any information or any documentation, they should share this with us.\u00a0 And if there is any violation whatsoever, we will take the relevant measure because our stance is very clear.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Hotel Bayerischer Hof ", "location": "Munich, Germany", "date": "February 18, 2023", "content": "\n\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Good afternoon everyone.\u00a0 Please join me in welcoming three foreign ministers to talk about visions for Ukraine, the most important vision of which is peace.\u00a0 Annalena Baerbock \u2013 (applause) \u2013 Antony Blinken \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and of course, Mr. Kuleba \u2013 (applause) \u2013 wonderful to have you.\nWhen we\u2019re thinking about Ukraine, I think all of us want to think about a future Ukraine that is at peace, but how do we get there \u2013 and most importantly once we do get there \u2013 how do we ensure that Ukraine remains at peace because Russian aggression may return.\u00a0 So I\u2019d like to start with you, Minister Baerbock, and ask you:\u00a0 How do you see the end of the war?\u00a0 What is \u2013 what are the steps that you think need to be achieved?\u00a0 And do you see this as potentially a negotiated solution at the end of the day, or will it \u2013 can it only be achieved through military victory by the Ukrainians?\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 Well, in the end, there must be peace, and it has to be just and endurable, a peace.\u00a0 And there\u2019s one easy way that this war will end and that we have peace again, and this is Russia stops bombing and just \u2013 Russia withdraws its troop.\u00a0 And we can do this tomorrow.\u00a0 If Russia decides to withdraw their own troops tomorrow, then we do have peace again, not only in Ukraine but peace around the whole world, because we see the negative effects.\nAnd I think we have to be aware of three points on the path if Russia doesn\u2019t take this decision.\u00a0 Russia \u2013 and we debated it within the last two days here also in Munich \u2013 is counting on that at some point we are too exhausted, and we as an international community \u2013 and would give in \u2013 and meaning that saying stop the fighting and stop the military support from other countries in the world.\u00a0 But what would that mean?\u00a0 Would that mean peace?\u00a0 No, because part of Ukraine, which is now still under the control of Russian would remain under the control of Russian.\u00a0 And those who are saying, \u201cJust stop the hostilities right now and this is automatically peace,\u201d this peace would mean that we would give those people of Ukraine towards Russia.\u00a0 And this would also mean that this is the end of the international order and the end of international law.\nBecause this is my second point \u2013 and I think the chancellor and also President Macron made that clear yesterday as well \u2013 if at this moment we would say Russia should just take part of Ukraine, then Russia would have won with a method that one aggressor can just conquer another country, and then it would be the end of the culture of the United Nation.\u00a0 And my third point I would like to make, because also in Germany, I think always around the world, people ask, \u201cBut if you wouldn\u2019t have delivered weapons in the beginning, maybe there wouldn\u2019t be so much fighting.\u201d\nI think we have to ask the question the opposite way around:\u00a0 If we wouldn\u2019t have decided on the 27th of February in German parliament \u2013 or on the 24th around the world \u2013 to support Ukraine, there wouldn\u2019t be 13 million refugees in Ukraine or outside of Ukraine \u2013 one million in Germany.\u00a0 The total population of Ukraine is 42 million people.\u00a0 If we wouldn\u2019t have supported Ukraine since February 27th, then we would have seen Bucha, Mariupol, everywhere in the whole country.\nSo those of the people asking around the world:\u00a0 So what were the effects from the sanctions?\u00a0 What were the effects from the international support?\u00a0 The effect was that unfortunately we could not bring back peace to Ukraine because Russia still wants to destroy Ukraine, but we could save millions of people\u2019s life, and that was worth every day.\u00a0 And we will save these life and protect these civilians every single day as long as Russia attacks Ukraine.\n(Applause.)\nThank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 I want to bring you in, Mr. Blinken.\u00a0 Is \u2013 when we talk about peace, are we talking about Russia returning to February lines or are we talking about post-2014?\u00a0 Because Crimea is an issue that Ukrainians care a lot about.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to comment on this, Minister Kuleba.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first let me say how wonderful it is to be here in Munich again, but especially wonderful to be surrounded by my two good friends and colleagues.\u00a0 Germany has been absolutely extraordinary in its leadership over the last year: the third largest donor to Ukraine in total, taking steps that I think few of us in this room would have imagined possible before the Russian aggression, and that\u2019s due to the leadership of the chancellor and it\u2019s due to the leadership of my friend Annalena Baerbock, who has been extraordinary from day one.\u00a0 We have been shoulder-to-shoulder from day one.\u00a0 And of course, Dmytro Kuleba has been the voice and the face in many ways of Ukraine around the world, not just with us but literally around the world, building support on every continent.\u00a0 And his own personal courage and the way he does his work on behalf of his country is extraordinary, so I thought it was important to acknowledge that as well as all of you.\nLook, simply put, fundamentally these are decisions for our Ukrainian friends to make.\u00a0 This is their country, their future, their decision.\u00a0 I am, as usual, in violent agreement with everything that Annalena said.\u00a0 And I think we have to be wary of two things.\u00a0 First, we have to be very wary of this somehow false equivalence \u2013 and never lose sight of the fact that there is an aggressor and there is a victim.\u00a0 And we \u2013 the world should not in any way expect of Ukraine things on parallel with what we need to expect of Russia.\u00a0 As Annalena said, if Russia withdraws its troops today, the war is over.\u00a0 Of course, if Ukraine stops fighting today, Ukraine is over.\u00a0 And it\u2019s as simple and basic as that.\nWhere this goes \u2013 as Annalena said, we will support the decisions of our Ukrainian friends about the future of their country.\u00a0 But I think we all have a profound stake in, as Annalena said, a just and durable peace.\u00a0 And what do we mean by that?\u00a0 Just in that any peace has to be consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 It is fundamentally against the interests of every other country around the world to wind up with a result that somehow vindicates the seizure by force of territory, that validates that.\u00a0 Because if we do that, we will open a Pandora\u2019s box around the world, and every would-be aggressor will conclude that:\u00a0 If Russia got away with it, we can get away with it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s interests because it\u2019s a recipe for a world of conflict.\nWhat does durable mean?\u00a0 Durable means that wherever this lands, we have to do everything in our power to make sure that Russia won\u2019t simply repeat the exercise a year, five years later.\u00a0 And among other things, that means making sure that Ukraine has the capacity to deter aggression and, if necessary, to effectively defend against it.\u00a0 So even as we\u2019re doing everything we can to provide Ukraine with the assistance it needs now to deal with the Russian aggression, we have to be thinking \u2013 and we are \u2013 about what the post-war future looks like to ensure that we have security and stability for Ukrainians and security and stability in Europe.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 I\u2019d like to come back to \u2013 I\u2019m told my mic wasn\u2019t working, so I hope everyone can hear me now.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to come back to the durable peace.\u00a0 But Minister Kuleba, what does victory look like for you, and how far are we from victory?\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 It\u2019s the third time I\u2019m invited to answer this question since 7:13.\n(Laughter.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Well, you\u2019ll be very well rehearsed then.\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 So I don\u2019t want to bore those who had \u2013 who heard my previous answers, but for us there is a short notion of victory, and that\u2019s full restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, and there is a long victory which includes compensations for the damage inflicted, accountability for perpetrators of crimes, and most importantly Russia must change.\u00a0 Because I have no doubts that, as we will become members of the EU, of NATO, this is going to happen, but in the end, the only durable peace in the Euro-Atlantic space will become possible after Russia poses no threat to the Euro-Atlantic space.\u00a0 And for that to achieve \u2013 to achieve that, we need to \u2013 we need Russia to change.\nThere is a long road to this result, but if we keep it as our ultimate objective, if we base our policy and decisions on the premise that this is our goal \u2013 durable security in the Euro-Atlantic region with Ukraine being fully part of the Euro-Atlantic region \u2013 then it will end up \u2013 it will end when Russia will not be able to pose threat.\u00a0 And everything between now and then \u2013 I don\u2019t want to sound too tough, but will be a war, one way or another.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 That brings me to the issue of security guarantees, and I\u2019m going to jump between the future and the present.\u00a0 But I think that President Zelenskyy has been talking to some allies about security guarantees from NATO, not just for the end of the war but even from now, because it is important for the morale of troops and also for the morale of a population that\u2019s fighting.\u00a0 Do you think that that\u2019s a possibility, some kind of security guarantees postwar but that are communicated and agreed by the time you\u2019re all in Vilnius?\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 Well, the biggest security guarantee has been made already, and this was giving Ukraine but also to Moldova the candidate status for the European Union.\u00a0 Because the European Union is our life insurance in Europe.\u00a0 And we do not have only in NATO a solidarity clause \u2013 we do have that also in the European Union.\u00a0 And underneath this decision \u2013 I mean, every step we are taking within this process \u2013 this is a process which secures the security of Ukraine also for the future.\u00a0 And as everybody know, NATO has an \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy.\u00a0 This was true in the past; it\u2019s still true.\u00a0 And what we are doing now also with the military support is helping Ukraine immediately every day, but we have short-term, mid-term, and long-term perspective.\nAnd this is also nothing new in February 2023, but we have decided and started this process in March, April, May last year, and then at the Bucharest Summit together at NATO where we underlined that the support for self-defense is required now \u2013 what we can deliver now \u2013 but for example IRIS-T systems.\u00a0 The next ones, they are coming in the next months, but also in the next years.\u00a0 So every weapon delivery support is already looked at.\u00a0 Also, it\u2019s the standards we are having ourself, so I think this guarantee has been given already last year.\u00a0 And this is because we always see the glass half empty, and I mean, for Ukraine it\u2019s more than half empty.\u00a0 It\u2019s totally destroyed because so many people have been killed.\nBut we should never forget what we have achieved together within the last year.\u00a0 Not only we are more united than ever \u2013 at the OSCE meeting we have been attending, both of us, there was this question:\u00a0 Is the OSCE dead?\u00a0 No, not at all.\u00a0 We are also within the OSCE more united than ever.\u00a0 Countries from Central Asia like Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan are saying:\u00a0 We want to work closer with you.\u00a0 We are sending as the European Union now mission to Armenia, because Armenia is saying:\u00a0 We trust in you for our further peace.\u00a0 So I think we should never forget this because we need still some breath probably for the next months, and we don\u2019t know how long we need it.\u00a0 But we always have to remember for what it\u2019s worth, for peace in Ukraine but for peace on the whole European continent.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, how about these security guarantees?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We have demonstrated right now an enduring commitment to Ukraine\u2019s security.\u00a0 We\u2019ve demonstrated that through really unprecedented assistance being provided to Ukraine so that it has in its hands the tools that it needs to defend itself every single day.\u00a0 And as Annalena suggested, this is an enduring commitment because, first, many of the things that we\u2019re providing now will also be very beneficial to Ukraine\u2019s long-term defense and its deterrent capacity.\u00a0 And at the same time, we\u2019re thinking and talking very actively about what we can do, not just in the immediate but over time, to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position going forward, again, so that we can prevent a repeat of this Russian aggression or, if God forbid, that were to happen again, that Ukraine would be in a very strong position to deal with it.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Minister?\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 Well, technically speaking, of course, the best security guarantees between now and NATO membership: sanctions, weapons, and money.\u00a0 But I think the most important security guarantee that partners can give to Ukraine is to firmly and unconditionally believe in the victory of Ukraine.\u00a0 If this is the founding principle of policymaking, everything else will follow.\u00a0 And people here share \u2013 with whom I\u2019m sharing this stage, I know they believe in it.\u00a0 And I know I don\u2019t have to preach to them, I don\u2019t have to convince, because I know that their policy, the decisions they will be making in Berlin, in Washington, in their respective institutions will be based on the assumption that Ukraine must win.\u00a0 So if you agree with this conceptually, if this is the starting point of your consideration, of your decision making, everything else becomes technical.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 But do you have any doubt about that commitment today?\u00a0 You don\u2019t have any doubt?\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 No, not among the people present at this stage.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Do you want to tell me who?\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We are working with them.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Can I say, too, I know \u2013 and I think I can safely speak for my friend \u2013 we have no doubt at all about Ukraine\u2019s victory and success.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a simple, powerful reason for that.\u00a0 Irrespective of anything else, including the support that we\u2019re providing, the biggest single difference is that Ukrainians are fighting for their own country, for their future, for their land.\u00a0 The Russians are not.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And that will be the biggest difference maker.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 So I\u2019m going ask you a question that I\u2019m sure you have been asked before but I would still like to hear your answer, is:\u00a0 Is there any chance of Ukraine being safe in the long term if Vladimir Putin is still leading Russia?\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 If he doesn\u2019t change by 360 degrees, no.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 But everything that happened over the last year \u2013 and it\u2019s truly remarkable what\u2019s happened over the last year, not just in terms of the Ukrainian willingness and capability to fight but even in Germany \u2013 and yet he does not appear to have gotten the message at all.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 Well, I didn\u2019t say no without this half-sentence beforehand, because I believe in humans and I believe in human beings.\u00a0 And we have changed by 180 degrees, because we decided on February 27th \u2013 and this is why I\u2019m always referring to this \u2013 that we change totally our export policy with regard to weapons.\u00a0 Before, also myself, I said no, we are not living in conflict areas.\u00a0 But this is a good thing about human beings:\u00a0 If you\u2019re still a human being and if you still see the suffering \u2013 that you can say either I\u2019ve made a mistake \u2013 and I mean, if you never learned from mistakes you will never end the phase of being a baby \u2013 but also, if you recognize, well, this might have been right in the past but now the world has changed.\nAnd on the 24th of February, at least my world \u2013 I think all of our world \u2013 has changed totally.\u00a0 And then we reflected and said, \u201cIf our world has changed, our European peace order has been under attack,\u201d which I never had to realize in all my life living in Western Germany and being born there.\u00a0 So when we realized this, that we woke up in another world, we said, obviously, the policies from before won\u2019t work anymore with regard to our understanding of weapon delivery.\u00a0 This is why we changed by 180 degrees.\u00a0 And if President Putin \u2013 and this is why I said it in the beginning \u2013 it\u2019s in his hand.\u00a0 He can make his own decision.\u00a0 He can decide that he changes his course by 360 degrees tomorrow.\u00a0 The whole world would be happy again.\u00a0 Stop the bombing.\u00a0 It\u2019s in his hand.\nAnd this is why I also think that we should really differentiate \u2013 and I\u2019m really thankful to Tony, and he said that first time in Security Council in September \u2013 we always have to differentiate who is the aggressor and who is the victim.\u00a0 And if we start to blame the victim, then the aggressor wins, but we can give the aggressor the chance \u2013 and we ask him every single day of the last year:\u00a0 Please change your mind.\u00a0 So we asked him again, \u201cPlease change your mind,\u201d and if he changes his mind then we have peace again in Ukraine and in the world.\u00a0 And if he doesn\u2019t change his mind, we stand on the side of Ukraine until they have freedom, peace, and liberty again.\u00a0\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary is it \u2013 is it possible that the step-by-step approach that Ukraine\u2019s allies have taken, often for good reason \u2013 but this step-by-step approach appears as hesitancy in Moscow, and that it is interpreted in Moscow as:\u00a0 Well, help is not really forthcoming, it\u2019s not enthusiastic, and therefore I will always have a chance to either divide Ukraine\u2019s Western allies or maybe force them to pause.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure he\u2019s now thinking:\u00a0 There\u2019s an election in the U.S. in 2024; maybe I try to wait it out.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So first, just to follow up quickly on what Annalena said, I think there has to be a day of reckoning for Mr. Putin, because this has been a strategic debacle for him, going back to 2014 when he first came and seized Crimea and parts of the Donbas.\u00a0 Ever since then, what we\u2019ve seen is Putin precipitating everything he said he was trying to prevent.\u00a0 Ukraine is united.\u00a0 Back in 2014, before the Russian aggression, attitudes toward Russia in Ukraine \u2013 and Dmytro can confirm this \u2013 were largely positive.\u00a0 Desire to join NATO was probably about 25 percent.\u00a0 After the initial aggression in 2014, that of course flipped, and since the renewed aggression last year, on steroids.\nFor the foreseeable future, Ukrainians will hate their Russian neighbors because of what\u2019s done, understandably.\u00a0 And Ukraine\u2019s own unity is stronger than ever; our own unity is stronger than ever.\u00a0 Putin thought he could divide NATO; of course we\u2019ve seen exactly the opposite.\u00a0 In my 30 years of doing this, I\u2019ve never seen this Alliance more united and on the verge of welcoming in two new members.\u00a0 That, too, no one was thinking about before Putin engaged in this renewed aggression.\nBut here\u2019s the other point that\u2019s so important, and I\u2019ll come to the question.\u00a0 Look at what has happened, what Putin has done to his own country.\u00a0 We now have, by public accounts, something like 200,000 Russian casualties in Ukraine \u2013 think about that for a minute \u2013 in less than a year.\u00a0 We have more than a million Russians who have left their country because they do not want to be part of this war and the direction that the country is being taken in.\u00a0 We have 1,000 or more companies from all of our countries who used to do business in Russia who no longer do, because the reputational cost of that is far too high.\nAnd all of Russia\u2019s connectivity with so much of the world has been cut off, piece by piece, as a result of the actions that President Putin has taken.\u00a0 So to Annalena\u2019s point, one would imagine that there will be \u2013 and one would hope, on his behalf \u2013 a time of reckoning to realize that the course that he is on is a strategic failure for him in the most graphic terms possible.\u00a0 So I think we have to look at that.\nAs for what Russia is seeing and what Putin may be concluding, no, I think it\u2019s exactly the opposite \u2013 I think precisely because he thought, first of all, that they would rapidly erase Ukraine from the map in a matter of days, and of course that didn\u2019t happen because of the extraordinary courage and bravery of Ukrainians, but also because they already had in hand some of the tools that they needed to repel the aggression from Kyiv, move it to the east and the south.\nBut then everything he\u2019s seen over the last year is an extraordinary coming together of dozens of countries \u2013 and not just in Europe, beyond as well, because countries like Japan, recognize the implications that this war has for them and for their interests.\u00a0 Everyone around the world is watching.\u00a0 And he\u2019s seen us systematically, time after time, working closely with our Ukrainian colleagues, try to assess what they need, and make sure that we can get it to them.\nBut what\u2019s so important \u2013 and I think all of you know this very well \u2013 is we tend to get fixated on individual weapons systems, and that\u2019s understandable.\u00a0 One thing or another gets in the news and people start focusing on that.\u00a0 But we all know very well that it\u2019s not just the weapon systems \u2013 it\u2019s the training, because if you can\u2019t use it, it doesn\u2019t help you much.\u00a0 It\u2019s the maintenance, because if it falls apart in a week, it doesn\u2019t help you much.\u00a0 And it\u2019s making sure that all of these things are being used in a comprehensive way with an actual strategy to be successful.\u00a0 And this is exactly what we\u2019ve been working on.\u00a0 I think Vladimir Putin sees that very, very clearly.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Minister Kuleba, can you foresee a time when Ukraine is at peace, Russia has withdrawn completely, and you\u2019re having discussions, new relations with Russia that is led by Vladimir Putin?\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 Well \u2014\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 I know this is a bit much \u2014\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 Everything except Vladimir Putin is my retirement plan.\u00a0 (Laughter.) That\u2019s \u2013 I want to end the war, I want to go to the village, to the countryside, live there in peace, raise \u2013 see my children.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t have to get old for that to happen.\u00a0 I\u2019m ready to do it the moment war is over.\u00a0 As long as Putin is in power, we will be in troubles, because he is \u2013 Ukraine is his personal obsession for various reasons which will require another panel to focus simply on this one issue.\u00a0 I believe that the period between the moment when Putin is gone and the new leader emerges will be the period of opportunity for all of us, but we cannot forecast when it\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 This is \u2013 so we \u2013 really what we have to do now is just to focus on fighting, fighting on the battlefield, fighting in diplomatic arena.\nBecause yes, we see an unprecedented unity of one part of the world that stands for principles and rules this world is based on, but we also see other parts of the world.\u00a0 Some are neutral, which means effectively the support of Russia.\u00a0 Some are calling on \u2013 to seize the supply of weapons to Ukraine, which also means that Russia is going to win.\u00a0 Some are asking questions whether Ukraine will be capable to restore its territorial integrity in full, which is about casting doubts and \u2013 basically posing your question, what was it all for if in the end you don\u2019t get everything that belongs to you?\nAnd those who have this idea of going back to the 2014, so-called 2014 line, or Ukraine becoming \u2013 abandoning NATO plans, I would like to recall two things.\u00a0 First, in 2014, Ukraine, by the law, was a non-bloc country.\u00a0 We were not pursuing membership in NATO, and still Russia attacked.\u00a0 And second, we had the separation line for eight years.\u00a0 We were very constructive.\u00a0 We were painfully trying to find diplomatic solution.\u00a0 Did it help us to prevent the war?\u00a0 No, it didn\u2019t.\u00a0 So probably that means that the solution is not going back to another separation line and to changing \u2013 abandoning some of our choices.\u00a0 The way forward is to believe in your choice, to be smart enough to defend it and to make it happen.\u00a0 I have no doubts it is going to happen.\u00a0 And \u2013 but what inspires me the most is meeting and talking and working with the people who also have no doubts on this matter.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Let me, let me bring some of the audience in.\u00a0 Young man there.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m Linas Kojala, director of Eastern Europe Studies Centre in Vilnius, Lithuania, and part of Munich Young Leaders.\u00a0 Well, Ukraine is fighting a war for its existence, but Russia also poses existential threat to countries on NATO\u2019s eastern flank, the Baltic states, my country, Poland, and others.\u00a0 So before NATO summit comes to Vilnius in the next five months or so, what needs to be done to send the clear message that Ukraine is not a gray zone on the map of Europe in terms of security, and that NATO\u2019s eastern flank is capable of withstanding the threat that comes from Russia, at least before Ukraine joins NATO?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary \u2013 and perhaps if you\u2019d like to also add.\u00a0 Go ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 This actually follows on with what we were talking about earlier about Putin precipitating everything he\u2019s trying to prevent.\u00a0 One of the things that he\u2019s precipitated is a very strong movement of strength for NATO to the eastern flank.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve had to take, all of us, necessary precautions precisely because of the fear that Russia would expand its aggression beyond Ukraine.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what the Alliance has done.\u00a0 And if you look at the decisions taken at the last summits and then the deployment of additional forces, additional capacities to the eastern flank countries already, we are in the business of making sure that all of these countries can feel safe and secure.\u00a0 President Biden has been very, very clear, and he\u2019s said it repeatedly:\u00a0 We will defend every square inch of NATO territory.\u00a0 And that guarantee means something.\nGoing forward \u2013 and we\u2019ll have an opportunity in Vilnius to talk about this \u2013 one of the things that we\u2019ll be looking at is what further steps do we need to take to strengthen the eastern flank and, for that matter, in the south as well.\u00a0 One of the ironies of the situation we\u2019re in is that Vladimir Putin seems to believe erroneously that NATO has designs on Russia, that we pose a threat to Russia, that we aim to commit some kind of aggression against Russia.\u00a0 That has never been the case; it never will be the case.\u00a0 But because of his actions, NATO has been dramatically reinforced.\nAnd again, if you go back to 2014 when this first started with Ukraine, look at the trajectory NATO was on then.\u00a0 Budgets were actually going down.\u00a0 Forces from the United States were coming back.\u00a0 Equipment, tanks, planes were coming back.\u00a0 Ever since 2014, as much as I\u2019d like to think that in some part our engagement and leadership played a role, I have to give credit where credit is due.\u00a0 Vladimir Putin has done more than anyone on Earth to strengthen the NATO Alliance.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Let me take another question there.\u00a0 Yeah.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks very much.\u00a0 My name is Katarzyna Pisarska.\u00a0 I\u2019m the chair of the Warsaw Security Forum from Poland.\u00a0 And I have a question to, well, the entire panel, but particularly to Secretary Blinken and Dmytro Kuleba.\u00a0 President Biden is coming to Poland this Monday and he\u2019s expected to have a speech in front of the Polish public.\u00a0 What are your expectations from that speech, how significant?\u00a0 What should we be preparing for?\nAnd Dmytro, if you can tell me \u2013 because I\u2019m sure that Vladimir Putin is also preparing something for this week of this anniversary, something horrific \u2013 are we prepared also for a week that I think will be symbolic on the one side \u2013 we want to we want to show our full support for Ukraine, we want to show that this year has \u2013 we\u2019ve been in unity, we want to commemorate also the heroes of Ukraine \u2013 but at that time, at the same time, we know that we will probably see more attacks this week and probably vicious heinous attacks.\u00a0 So how do we prepare to that?\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 So Mr. Secretary, first you\u2019re gonna give us the scoop on the President\u2019s visit, and then perhaps both Minister Kuleba and Minister Baerbock might want to address the second question.\u00a0 Go ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I think it\u2019s safe to say that the President will make a very significant speech in Poland next week.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Other than that, I\u2019ve learned one thing: never get ahead of your boss.\u00a0 So I\u2019ll let him speak for himself.\u00a0 But in all seriousness, I think it\u2019s safe to say that as well, that he\u2019s likely to talk about the road that we\u2019ve traveled together over the last year, where we are today, and, as I said, our enduring commitment to Ukraine\u2019s success, which is all of our success.\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 I believe the speech of President Biden will be far more significant and consequential than the speech of President Putin.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Artur Gerasymov, MP, Ukrainian parliament, European Solidarity faction.\u00a0 Mr. Blinken, Ms. Baerbock, first of all, thank you very much for supporting our country.\u00a0 Believe me, Ukrainian people and Ukrainian soldiers really value that.\u00a0 Your countries, together with UK, are the biggest supporters of Ukraine right now.\u00a0 And I want to ask you the same question earlier today I asked prime minister of Great Britain:\u00a0 Which steps, from your point of view, can be done, with purpose drastically increase the speed of decision making while supporting Ukraine and while sanctioning Russia?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 Well, we can always do better and we can always be faster, and this is what we are trying.\u00a0 But on the other hand, I should \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t resignate of saying because we haven\u2019t been quick enough in the past we just give in.\u00a0 So we are improving every day, and this is why I related to the last year.\u00a0 The first months were very, very difficult because we took decisions we never took before in our lives.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t even discuss it before in our lives.\u00a0 So saying what is wrong or what is right, this was always a balancing thing.\u00a0 And I think the important thing was that we always came back to:\u00a0 We have to be united.\u00a0 And our frame is the international law, because we are defending also the international law at this moment.\nAnd this counts also to our weapons delivery.\u00a0 This is why \u2013 and this is a strength of democracy.\u00a0 We are having debates also about these kinds of steps, and then we are asking ourselves:\u00a0 So where can we learn from the past?\u00a0 And we learned many things.\u00a0 We learned, for example, that, unfortunately, even though we have all NATO standards, that NATO standards alone doesn\u2019t help \u2013 that your military has to be compatible with each other.\u00a0 So with the Howitzers, we thought we have the same Howitzers as the Dutch.\u00a0 And then we realized, yeah, we do have the same Howitzers, but unfortunately they don\u2019t function together.\u00a0 So this is like we always have to improve.\u00a0 So now with the \u2013 this decision we took right now with the tanks, we are trying \u2013 and this is also what we did here in Munich \u2013 trying to form a group of those who can support us as Germans with regard to the Leos \u2013 and it\u2019s the Leo 2 \u2013 and the best would be the A6 \u2013 and you learn many things about this question because maintenance is crucial.\u00a0 So if we don\u2019t think the chain afterwards \u2013 and this was all learning from this spring last year \u2013 then it doesn\u2019t really help.\nSo what can we do to become better \u2013 coming back to your questions \u2013 getting together the right group of countries, and this is my appeal to everybody in the room.\u00a0 I think everybody knows who does have the tanks we need now to form together a battalion, and that we set up the supply chains, that we set up the maintenance hub directly at the border, in order to help every day to save your people.\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And just very quickly, to add on, as democracies, we have processes and procedures.\u00a0 Sometimes that can be frustrating, but it\u2019s important to stick to them and to learn from them.\u00a0 And we did.\u00a0 And just as Annalena said, we learned a lot from the first months.\u00a0 One of the things that we did now some time ago is our Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin stood up in Germany the so-called Ramstein process to make sure that we were doing a better job of coordinating the supply of military equipment to Ukraine, and making sure not only that it was coordinated but that it was moving faster, that we could identify where we had challenges, but also where we could identify who had what to provide.\u00a0 And that has worked incredibly well.\nWe\u2019ve done the same thing together when it comes to trying to help Ukraine repair and replace the energy infrastructure that\u2019s being destroyed by Russia every single day.\u00a0 With Annalena\u2019s leadership, we stood up for the G7 a process to do that.\u00a0 The G7 itself, we met again this morning \u2013 it\u2019s now under the chairmanship of Japan; it was under Germany\u2019s chairmanship last year.\u00a0 We met I think a dozen times as foreign ministers last year through the G7.\u00a0 The typical meeting rate usually is about two times a year.\u00a0 So this was all a way of making sure that we were working together in real time.\u00a0 And I think that we\u2019ve done that.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Minister Kuleba, is there \u2013 what are the three things that you want speeded up right now?\u00a0 Not seven.\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 Yes, I was going to say seven.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Ammunition, artillery, and tanks.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 What is the problem with ammunition?\u00a0 Because there \u2013 it does seem that while the debate has been very focused on tanks and now jets, the real big problem right now is ammunition.\u00a0 Why are we here?\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 Because we thought that we would never have a war again on European soil.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m always coming back to this point, but I think it\u2019s not us to blame that we believed in peace.\u00a0 It is Russia to blame that he, Putin \u2013 and not Russia, every Russian \u2013 yeah, we see also the Russian suffering \u2013 that he destroyed peace in Europe.\u00a0 And therefore, we didn\u2019t have stockpiles of ammunition for a war like this because we thought that war would be over in Europe again.\u00a0 But because we cannot wish the world as we want it to be, we are building the world, we are building the future.\u00a0 This is why we are building now, new ammunition production lines, for example, in Germany.\u00a0 So we hope to fill these gaps by June, July for the Gepard ammunition.\u00a0 We still need to bridge the time in between.\nAnd as you might know, I\u2019m a fan of open words.\u00a0 There are a couple of countries in the world who do have this Gepard ammunition, and again, we are calling on them.\u00a0 Please help us to purchase time that, until we have built this new production line, we could use this ammunition, and making it even in a bigger picture.\u00a0 And I would like to thank all those countries who are in other corners of the world and said in the beginning:\u00a0 This is a European war; you haven\u2019t been there when we asked you for help.\u00a0 And this is true.\u00a0 Too often, we ignored also other conflicts of the world.\u00a0 But there are so many countries who realized if they would not take a position in this war, then it would only help \u2013 not Russia \u2013 maybe they didn\u2019t care if it helps Russia \u2013 but it would destroy the culture of the United Nation.\nAnd this where they took a side because this old saying of Desmond Tutu.\u00a0 In a case, you see justice and injustice and aggressor and the victim.\u00a0 Neutrality is not an option, because then you are standing on the side of the aggressor.\u00a0 And this is a plea we are also giving next week to the world again:\u00a0 Please take a side, a side for peace, a side for Ukraine, a side for the humanitarian international law, and these times this means also delivering ammunition so Ukraine can defend itself.\n(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, would you like to comment on the ammunition question?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, I think Annalena has covered it very well.\u00a0 But one of the things that we know is that we\u2019ve had different types of weapons systems that use different types of ammunition.\u00a0 Ukraine has had in its own inventories a lot of Soviet era weaponry that uses one type of ammunition.\u00a0 Some of the NATO systems that are being supplied to Ukraine use another type, so that\u2019s been a challenge.\u00a0 And \u2013 but exactly as Annalena said, some of the stockpiles were not accounting for this.\u00a0 And at the same time, getting these production lines moving again is not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 It takes real effort; it takes real time.\u00a0 And quite honestly, those who produce these weapons also want to know, if they\u2019re going to start a production line again, that it\u2019s not going to be turned off in six months.\u00a0 So all of these things factor into it, but I can also tell you that pretty much every single day we are scouring every corner of the earth for the appropriate ammunition for Ukraine.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 There\u2019s a gentleman down there.\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 No, no, sorry.\u00a0 In the middle.\u00a0 Yes, you who are trying to get the \u2013 now \u2013 sorry.\u00a0 Yes.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 Too many gentlemen here \u2013 so many gentlemen.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So thank you very much.\u00a0 First off, all \u2013 I wish you all, but specifically the people of Ukraine, a acceptable, respectful, and peaceful solution for your country.\u00a0 We as Afghan \u2013 I\u2019m from Afghanistan.\u00a0 We know what the Russian invasion is.\u00a0 And I wish you all the best.\u00a0 Specifically Secretary Blinken and Madam Baerbock, allow me to take you for a moment out of the subject.\u00a0 Afghanistan.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t abandon Afghanistan.\u00a0 We are in a very bad position in the moment, and this is also a big pressure on our neighboring countries and (inaudible) for the European countries, because if it is continuing like this, you will have 100,000 of refugee again on the border of Europe.\u00a0 Please find some solution acceptable for the Afghan nation.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you for that.\u00a0 Sorry, yes, now \u2013 yeah, go ahead, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Inaudible) from Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 My question to Secretary Blinken:\u00a0 Successfully and correctly you have been able to mobilize a lot of your alliances in the world to stand on this crisis in support of Ukraine.\u00a0 The Gulf country have taken a semi-neutral position, and the neutral position mean we did not support the aggression.\u00a0 We fought in the UN.\u00a0 We have issued our condemnation for the Russian invasion.\u00a0 But at the same time, they did not decide to cut the relation with Russia or China in that one.\u00a0 Did that harm the U.S. relation towards the Gulf by not standing fully on the position that you want them, and because they have taken this sort of balanced position, although they have contributed to the humanitarian side and they have condemned clearly the invasion and using the aggression?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 As Annalena said, there is no neutral position when it comes to a war of aggression.\u00a0 There is no balance.\u00a0 At the same time, different countries have responded in different ways.\u00a0 They\u2019ve contributed in different ways.\u00a0 Some have focused on humanitarian contributions.\u00a0 Those are hugely important given the suffering of the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Some have focused on economic contributions.\u00a0 That\u2019s also incredibly important given the damage that\u2019s being done to the Ukrainian economy by the Russian onslaught.\u00a0 Others have focused on security support, and of course that is vital.\u00a0 Some countries have done things that they don\u2019t advertise.\u00a0 That \u2013 but as long as the result is there, that\u2019s what matters.\u00a0 So we\u2019re constantly engaged with partners around the world who have different perspectives on this, different ways that they can help.\u00a0 And from our perspective \u2013 first of all, again, you really can\u2019t be neutral, but if there\u2019s a way to provide support in any of these areas, that\u2019s valuable and it\u2019s something that we welcome.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Very good.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s a question over there, and then we\u2019ll come closer.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Go ahead, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 My name is Lisa Yasko, a member of Ukrainian parliament, member of foreign affairs committee, Servant of the People party.\u00a0 I want to ask you \u2013 our panelists \u2013 about what would you recommend me as Ukrainian politician to tell to Ukrainian people when they ask me how long we need to go through all of this.\u00a0 I know that this is the question that really bothers us.\u00a0 I mean, in political circles we start talking about different types of weapons.\u00a0 We know what is happening.\u00a0 But still for me, as Ukrainian politician, it\u2019s very hard to keep answering that, yes, this weapon will come in two, three, five months.\u00a0 Can we give some timeline that will bring more confidence and peace to Ukrainian hearts because we understand that we\u2019re in these shoes already for one year, and we need to calculate how much energy we still have and we will have in the future?\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Minister?\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 My frank and honest answer is I don\u2019t know, because we cannot give a promise to the people of Ukraine when this war will end because we don\u2019t know, and it always comes back to the point because it lays in the hand of the Russian president.\u00a0 But what we can promise is that we are trying to do everything to give you, to give the people of Ukraine as much as help as you need.\u00a0 And you were asking so when are the next system coming.\u00a0 I was speaking about ammunition or the Gepard systems.\nWe are now training soldiers with regards to the tanks, so we can do the tanks delivery in the upcoming months together with our other partners.\u00a0 We are looking that \u2013 how we can bridge also the time with the IRIS-T because \u2013 and this is what Tony has mentioned \u2013 that we are thinking also so much about air defense to protect infrastructure, because we know that the attack on infrastructure, on electricity is on the purpose that people will freeze to death or don\u2019t have water in wintertime anymore when everything has been frozen because you don\u2019t have electricity.\u00a0 So we are talking also to partners for the IRIS-T system that we get short-range systems to protect their systems better.\nBut the frank answer is:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 And I cannot even imagine how you deal with this as a parliamentarian, as a foreign minister, as a father, or as a mother.\u00a0 When I was in Kharkiv and realized what this means, that you have in Kharkiv 45 seconds \u2013 and they told me when we heard the alarm, \u201cYou just count until 45,\u201d and then you see whether the rocket hit you or didn\u2019t hit you.\u00a0 And I had to experience it once when we both were there.\u00a0 But speaking to school children experience it every day, and this is a reason why they cannot go to school, because they cannot count the whole day to 45 \u2013 and there are no shelters.\u00a0 Then we totally understand how high the pressure is.\nAnd what I realized there is also \u2013 and this is why I think all the three of us are so frank and open here also on this panel \u2013 because I at least realized there that the war is also not over when the troops are withdrawing from the territory, because rockets in Kharkiv are coming 40 kilometers away from Russia.\u00a0 And this is why, on the second track, next to the weapons delivery, we are trying to work so hard every day to convince other partners, to convince other P5 members of the Security Council that they have a responsibility to ensure the world peace.\u00a0 This is why you are sitting at the Security Council because you have the veto right, because you\u2019re also responsible to ensure the world peace.\u00a0 And this is why we have to work so intensively together that this peace will come to Ukraine, but unfortunately we cannot say when it will be.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Let me just follow this up with \u2013 you\u2019ve talked about the P5, and obviously the P5\u2019s been completely paralyzed in this case, but China has a very important role to play.\u00a0 Have you had recent conversations, maybe even today or yesterday afternoon, with your Chinese counterpart \u2013 all three of you \u2013 about what \u2013 how China can help?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, I think it\u2019s very clear that there are things that China cannot and should not do to hinder, and by that we mean providing Russia with military equipment that can further its aggression or engaging in the systematic evasion of sanctions that are designed to put pressure on Russia to end its aggression.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something that President Biden made very clear to President Xi Jinping from almost day one.\u00a0 They had a conversation by video maybe two or three weeks into the aggression.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve made clear to our Chinese counterparts ever since that we would view any provision of military assistance or evading sanctions as a very serious problem for us and for many other countries around the world.\nSo it\u2019s something we watch very carefully.\u00a0 Of course, China continues to spread Russia\u2019s narrative in the UN and in other places.\u00a0 It advances the propaganda.\u00a0 To date, as best we can tell, it has not engaged in the systematic supply of military equipment or sanctions evasion, but it\u2019s something that we watch very, very carefully.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Minister.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 Yes, we had a meeting.\u00a0 This is a good thing.\u00a0 This is a transparence conference here.\u00a0 Here\u2019s where you \u2014\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Yeah, but we want \u2013 we also want to know whether Secretary Blinken had a meeting?\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 Well, I \u2013 we had a meeting as well \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We did.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 \u2014 a couple of meetings.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019ve had lots of meetings.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BAERBOCK:\u00a0 Well, I think why we are also all arguing so much what peace means is because of the role of China.\u00a0 Because obviously we are going next week not only to the General Assembly \u2013 we are also going to the Security Council.\u00a0 We have heard \u2013 I have heard at also in the meeting, but you can read it also in media \u2013 that China said they will present a paper for peace, which is good because we need everybody in the world to be ready to stand up for peace.\u00a0 But the question will be:\u00a0 What kind of peace will this be?\u00a0 And this is why I think all the three of us try to underline that there is a difference if you call on everybody to stop delivering weapons \u2013 and we call also on China or everybody in the world to not deliver weapons to Russia.\nBut if there\u2019s a request of saying, \u201cSo we should stop supporting Ukraine,\u201d than there\u2019s a huge difference, which Tony Blinken made in September in the Security Council, when he was saying \u2013 and if I may, I quote you again:\u00a0 If Russia stops fighting \u2013 and we hope this is the plea also from China next week when they propose their peace program \u2013 call on Russia to stop fighting, because then this war is over.\u00a0 But if Ukraine stops defending itself \u2013 and this could be another plea \u2013then Ukraine is over, and we cannot accept this because then also the (inaudible) of United Nations is over.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And I think to \u2014\n(Applause.)\nTo Annalena\u2019s point \u2013 and it\u2019s understandable to people around the world who may not follow this day-in, day-out, who are living with their own challenges \u2013 in fact, many challenges that have been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine \u2013 things like a ceasefire sound very attractive.\u00a0 Who doesn\u2019t want guns to stop firing?\u00a0 Except we have to be incredibly wary of the kind of traps that can be set.\u00a0 It may come to be that Putin decides, because things are going badly for him, that his best bet is to call for an immediate ceasefire but in effect a frozen conflict that will freeze the existing lines in place.\u00a0 He will never negotiate the territory that he seized.\u00a0 And meanwhile, he\u2019ll use the time to rest, to refit, to rearm, and to reattack.\u00a0 So we need to be very wary of allowing any kind of situation to develop.\nOne last thing.\u00a0 One of the very powerful things that Annalena has done over the last year is to constantly remind us that what is happening in Ukraine is about real lives.\u00a0 It\u2019s not an abstraction.\u00a0 And hearing from the parliamentarian is another reminder of that.\u00a0 And one of the things none of us can allow is we cannot allow this to be normalized.\u00a0 We cannot be anesthetized to what\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s easy to happen.\u00a0 We \u2013 it\u2019s relentless on our TVs, and then it becomes background noise for too many people.\u00a0 But the kind of conduct that Russian forces are engaged in in Ukraine, we can never allow that to be normalized.\u00a0 And when we have children who are being taken from their families and sent to Russia, and then adopted by Russians in a program that is deliberately designed to do that and in its own way try to erase Ukraine\u2019s future, that can\u2019t be normalized.\u00a0 So one plea for all of us is to make sure that we don\u2019t allow that to happen either.\n(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 I\u2019m going to give the last \u2013 we have run out of time.\u00a0 I\u2019m just going to give the last 20 seconds to Minister Kuleba to tell us what he wants to see in this Chinese peace plan.\nFOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it makes sense to speak about Chinese peace plan before seeing it.\u00a0 I mean, we\u2019ll understand what \u2013 where it stands.\u00a0 But whatever happens, whatever kind of plans will appear from different quarters of the world, I think we should all be focused on one thing:\u00a0 Even if we are deadly tired, we cannot allow ourselves to get tired of fighting for freedom.\n(Applause.)\nAnd then you have one plan or another or the third one \u2013 it\u2019s all secondary, because you know what you are fighting for.\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you to the panelists and also to the audience, and I\u2019m terribly sorry that I couldn\u2019t get to all your questions.\u00a0 Let\u2019s give the panel a round of applause.\n(Applause.)\n# # #\n\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, Vice Minister Mori, First Vice Minister Cho.\u00a0 It is a private to host you for our first trilateral dialogue of 2023 and our fifth under the Biden\u2011Harris administration.\nBefore diving into what we discussed this morning, I want to speak to the ongoing human and humanitarian disaster that continues to unfold in the aftermath of the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria and the gut-wrenching, heartbreaking, unfathomable destruction left in its wake.\u00a0 The death toll rises seemingly by the hour.\u00a0 Homes are decimated, transportation is unusable, recovery efforts are ongoing, and the road ahead to rebuilding houses, businesses, cities, and the economy will be slow, winding, and long.\nIn this moment the United States has joined our friends from the ROK, Japan, and around the world in sending search and rescue teams, specialized equipment, air support, tents, sanitation facilities, and anything we can to help.\u00a0 We stand in solemn solidarity with the people of both nations, and together with our partners we are committed to providing the aid necessary to those impacted by this horrific natural earthquake devastation.\nNow, to the subject of today\u2019s dialogue, a more optimistic story: the growth of our trilateral bonds.\u00a0 We are coming off a truly remarkable year in this partnership, one that featured two leader summits, regular communication, and the first trilateral defense exercises since 2017.\u00a0 Today\u2019s dialogue built on that progress.\u00a0 Our trilateral relationship remains strong and it is only getting stronger.\u00a0 Our alliances are ironclad, and our bonds of friendship are critical to enhancing the security and prosperity of our citizens, the Indo-Pacific, and the world.\nOur cooperation touches some of the globe\u2019s most urgent challenges.\u00a0 These issues stood front and center in today\u2019s discussions.\u00a0 Together, we are advancing our shared affirmative vision for an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, connected, prosperous, resilient, and secure.\u00a0 This region is home to half the world\u2019s population and two-thirds of its economy.\u00a0 It is dynamic and growing.\u00a0 It is a leading priority for us all.\nOne year ago the United States unveiled our Indo-Pacific Strategy, and in conjunction with the ROK, Japan, and regional partners, we are putting that plan into practice.\u00a0 We are collaborating with Indo-Pacific countries on food security, energy affordability, humanitarian aid, and more.\u00a0 We are deepening our coordination with ASEAN to tackle major challenges such as pandemic preparedness, digital connectivity, and climate, and we are using multilateral exercises to promote stability across the region.\nThroughout our meetings, our three governments reinforced the necessity of addressing the DPRK\u2019s destabilizing behavior and achieving complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0 The DPRK continued to threaten the ROK, Japan, and its neighbors, and the world with the launch of an unprecedented number of ballistic missiles last year.\u00a0 Standing united, our nations will deter the DPRK and urge it to give up its nuclear weapons program and abide by its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions.\u00a0\u00a0 We call for full implementation by the international community and encourage the DPRK to return to dialogue.\nOur talks also touched on the challenges posed by the People\u2019s Republic of China and the need to answer them with unity at home and abroad.\u00a0 Today\u2019s dialogue reiterated our core message.\u00a0 We will remain aligned with the ROK, Japan, other allies and partners worldwide to push back on the PRC behavior that challenges the rules-based regional and international order.\u00a0 We will continue to counter the PRC\u2019s destabilizing activities in South and East China Seas.\u00a0 We will keep working for maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 Alongside the ROK and Japan, we will find areas where collaboration with the PRC is possible and in fact vital to international security, from climate and global health to narcotics, nonproliferation, and beyond.\nMoving outside our immediate region and this region that we were discussing in the Indo\u2011Pacific, our discussions included Russia\u2019s unprovoked war in Ukraine and the ROK and Japan\u2019s steadfast support, assistance, and cooperation in seeking to end the suffering endured by the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Our countries\u2019 actions alongside partners across the globe are an unmistakable sign that we will stand firm against any attempts by any nation to change international borders by force.\u00a0 We will hold Russia accountable.\u00a0 We will stay united in defense of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and fundamental rights.\nFinally, our dialogue covered a wide range of issues that speak to the broad scope of our partnership.\u00a0 On security, the United States is firmly committed to the defense of the ROK and Japan; to enhancing our cooperation with partners like Australia, India, and New Zealand; to deepening ties between Indo-Pacific nations and NATO.\u00a0 On the broader region, we are engaged with ASEAN on law enforcement, transboundary challenges in the Mekong Subregion, renewable energy and health.\u00a0 We had productive discussions about supporting Pacific Island countries as they deal with climate change mitigation and adaptation.\u00a0 We are also coordinating with Japan and the ROK as partners in the Blue Pacific to tackle climate change; illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing; equitable access to infrastructure investment; and defense of the rules-based order.\nOn human rights, our three countries are focused on promoting gender equity across the Indo-Pacific, responding to gender-based violence, increasing women\u2019s economic participation and entrepreneurship.\u00a0 As APEC host this year, we look forward to broadening this work with Japan and the ROK and others to bolster the international economic system and showcase the centrality of the APEC region to resilient, inclusive, broadly shared prosperity.\nSo you can see by my long opening statement we covered a lot of ground today, yet there\u2019s still so much to do to uphold our interests, values, and vision which we all share.\u00a0 Together, I know we will.\nThank you.\nVICE MINISTER MORI:\u00a0\u00a0Well, it was my great pleasure to have this Japan-U.S.-ROK Vice Ministers meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Sherman and First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho.\u00a0 For the first time in four months, I would like to thank Wendy and her staff for their warm hospitality.\nA free and open international order based on the rule of law is being seriously challenged, to begin with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, which will mark one year on the 24th next week.\u00a0 At the same time, the security environment surrounding Japan has become increasingly severe.\u00a0 Against these backdrops, coordination among Japan, the U.S., and the ROK is becoming increasingly important, not only in dealing with North Korea but also in maintaining peace and stability of the region and in realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nOur leaders reaffirmed at the trilateral summit last November in Cambodia the importance of forging still closer trilateral coordination in the security field and beyond.\u00a0 Based upon our leaders\u2019 commitment, three of us had a frank and strategic discussion today and renewed our resolve to further deepen our coordination.\u00a0 On North Korea, we share the recognition that North Korea\u2019s intensified nuclear and missile activities, including ballistic missile launches with an unprecedented frequency and in unprecedented manners, pose a clear and serious challenge to the international community.\nWhile North Korea has publicly stated its intention to further enhance its nuclear and missile programs this year, concerted efforts of the international community are critical.\u00a0 Under these circumstances, we concurred on continuing close collaboration among our three countries in enhancing regional security deterrence, cooperation at the UN \u2013 including the Security Council, where Japan is now sitting as a nonpermanent member \u2013 and diplomatic engagement towards the complete denuclearization of North Korea.\nRegarding the abductions issue, I asked for continued understanding and cooperation of this issue and gained full support, again, from both U.S. and the ROK.\u00a0 I would like to once again thank both of you for your support.\nOn Ukraine, we shared our strong concern about the Russian missile and drone attacks that have resulted in civilian casualties as well as serious damage to the civil infrastructure.\u00a0 In particular, Japan is seriously considered about the threat of nuclear weapons by Russia.\u00a0 We concurred that Russia\u2019s \u2013 such threat is absolutely unacceptable and Russia should never use nuclear weapons under any circumstances.\u00a0 We also concurred that it is important to continue to strongly support Ukraine and to keep imposing severe sanctions against Russia.\u00a0 Such a situation in Ukraine will be one of the most important issues at the G7 summit in Hiroshima, which Japan will be hosting in May.\nWe also had a discussion on regional situation, including in the East and South China Seas, and shared the recognition that we must not accept any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo by force.\u00a0 We also shared the view that it is important to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 Furthermore, we discussed a wide range of challenges that the international community is facing, such as economic security.\u00a0 We agreed to further deepen our trilateral cooperation in these areas.\nBased on today\u2019s discussion, I look forward to continuing multilayered coordination among our three countries.\nAnd lastly, I would also like to express my deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the massive earthquake that occurred in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria, and emphasize our determination to provide necessary support to the affected areas.\u00a0 Japan is a country which has suffered from a number of natural disasters, including the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011.\u00a0 It\u2019s doing its utmost to provide as much support as possible to those people who were affected by this earthquake.\nSo far we have dispatched urban search and rescue team and medical team to T\u00fcrkiye and also provided T\u00fcrkiye and Syria with emergency relief goods.\u00a0 I appreciate that the U.S. and the ROK are providing support as well.\nThank you for attention.\nVICE MINISTER CHO:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 It is a great pleasure to meet Deputy Secretary Sherman and Vice Minister Mori here in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to express my gratitude to Deputy Secretary Sherman and her team for arranging today\u2019s meeting.\nBefore my remarks on trilateral cooperation, I would first like to extend my deepest condolences and heartfelt sympathy to all the affected by the devastating earthquake in both T\u00fcrkiye and Syria.\u00a0 All three of our government promptly dispatched teams to support rescue and recovery efforts and assist the victims of the earthquake, on top of the financial contribution we pledged individually.\u00a0 We sincerely hope for a swift recovery from the aftermath of this tragedy.\nOver the past year, our three countries have strengthened our trilateral partnership to an unprecedented level, firmly rooted in shared values, including freedom, democracy, human rights, and rule of law.\u00a0 Exactly three months ago, our leaders jointly announced the Phnom Penh Statement on Trilateral Partnership for the Indo-Pacific, which reaffirmed our commitment to trilateral partnership and broadened the reach of our trilateral cooperation to new terrain.\nToday, Deputy Secretary Sherman, Vice Minister Mori, and I explored ways to translate our leaders\u2019 firm resolve into concrete outcomes.\nFirst of all, we committed ourselves to respond firmly to any North Korean provocation and work toward complete denuclearization of North Korea.\u00a0 Indeed, peace without denuclearization is fake peace.\u00a0 North Korea has launched a record number of missiles last year, and is yet threatening further ICBM and military satellite launches.\nIn response to this threat, we will strengthen robust ROK-U.S. combined defense posture, and at the same time enhance our trilateral security cooperation with U.S. and Japan.\nWe will cut off the revenue supporting North Korea\u2019s WMD development.\u00a0 Last Friday, the Korean Government introduced our first autonomous sanction on North Korea\u2019s illicit cyber activities, which is one of its major revenue generators.\u00a0 We will closely cooperate with the international community for full implementation of the UN sanctions.\nWe reiterated that we are open to dialogue.\u00a0 We urge North Korea to return to denuclearization talks.\u00a0 We also expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in North Korea, and committed to stepping up effort to raise international awareness on this critical issue.\nWe also underscored our joint commitment to promoting peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 I appreciate that Deputy Secretary Sherman and Vice Minister Mori welcomed the announcement of our Indo-Pacific Strategy.\u00a0 We agreed to seek more concrete and tangible outcomes of our partnership based on the common aspect of our policies in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn this vein, we concurred on the importance of deepening our trilateral coordination on development policy.\u00a0 We will coordinate closely with ASEAN partners on a wide range of regional agenda, including climate change, digital connectivity, and public health.\u00a0 We also committed to further enhancing cooperation for the development of the Mekong region and the Pacific Islands.\nLast but not least, our three countries will closely collaborate on responding to various challenges to the security of the region and the international community.\u00a0 The infringement of other countries\u2019 territorial sovereignty can never be tolerated, against which necessary measures can be taken in accordance with international law.\nWe stand together as allies and partners.\u00a0 We strongly condemn Russia\u2019s ongoing attacks, which are killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.\u00a0 We reiterated that it is crucial for the international community to keep a united stance and stand firmly with Ukraine.\nWe committed ourselves to continued provision of assistance to Ukraine so that peace and stability can be restored as soon as possible.\u00a0 In addition, we agreed on the urgent need to address economic security challenges, supply chain disruptions, and energy crisis.\u00a0 We reaffirm our shared commitment to strengthening strategic consultation amongst three countries, including the dialogue on economic security that our leaders announced in Phnom Penh last November.\nWe also closely collaborate in international organizations, including the United Nations, to bolster the commitment of the international community to addressing global issues.\u00a0 Today\u2019s meeting were a true testament to our ever-growing partnership for the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula, the Indo-Pacific, and beyond.\u00a0 I hope to maintain close communication with both of you, Deputy Secretary Sherman and Vice Minister Mori, and look forward to seeing you again in Korea for our next meeting.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We will take one question from each delegation.\u00a0 First is Shaun Tandon from AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for doing this.\u00a0 I wanted to follow up on the remarks that you made about the PRC.\u00a0 Madam Deputy Secretary, the episode of the purported spy balloon, surveillance balloons \u2013 there have been a couple of shootdowns over the weekend.\u00a0 I was wondering if you could shed any light on that, and more broadly, whether you see a continuing threat from surveillance balloons by the PRC.\nAnd also to Vice Minister Cho and Vice Minister Mori, the United States has said that 40 countries, roughly, have experienced overflights of surveillance balloons by the PRC.\u00a0 Are your countries among them?\u00a0 Do you perceive the threat in the same way?\nAnd just briefly to everyone, in terms of dialogue with the PRC, have you had contact recently either on this specifically or more broadly?\u00a0 I know that Foreign Minister Hayashi will be going to Munich; Secretary Blinken, we\u2019re expecting him as well.\u00a0 Could you see meetings there with Wang Yi or others from China?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nDEPUTY SECRETARY SHERMAN:\u00a0 Thank you, Shaun.\u00a0 Shaun has just given us an example of how to ask three questions as one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Don\u2019t take his advice.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo, Shaun, I would say to you that John Kirby just has spent more than a half an hour answering questions on the balloons, and so I would urge you to look at the transcript for the definitive word as of this afternoon on all of this.\u00a0 In terms of the original balloon that was taken down last week, we are absolutely confident that this was a surveillance apparatus of the PRC and that it was over our territory, and we had every right to take that balloon down, as we did safely in territorial waters off of South Carolina so that we protected the American people, protected our own military sites in the way that we did so during its flyover of our country.\nAs to the takedowns over this weekend, as you will hear from John Kirby, these were three objects that gave us concern because of their altitude that they were a potential risk to civilian aircraft, and we worked with the Canadians since at least one and the second may have fallen in the Canadian part of Lake Huron \u2013 to work with Canada and NORAD to address the risk that we saw.\u00a0 The President has asked the National Security Advisor to put together an interagency team so that we can do a better assessment of where we are, what\u2019s up there, how we should respond to them; has asked us to go out to partners and allies around the world and get a better understanding of what\u2019s surrounding all of us in airspace.\u00a0 But I would send you to that transcript for really the definitive word on all of this.\nOn the issue of dialogue, as Secretary Blinken has said consistently, and as he has said to Wang Yi, as we have all said to the PRC, we are open to dialogue when it is in our interest to do so and we believe the conditions are right.\u00a0 I know there\u2019s been a report about a potential meeting in Munich, but I have nothing to announce today.\nVICE MINISTER MORI:\u00a0 Well, concerning the surveillance balloon issue, and I first talk about the original surveillance balloon which was shot down on the 4th of February, I have to say that no country is allowed to infringe on the sovereignty of another country.\u00a0 So we are aware that the U.S. Government explained that China had committed an unacceptable violation of its sovereignty and that the U.S. has responded carefully and legally in order to protect its own sovereignty and the safety of its citizens.\nI explained at the meeting today that Japan supports this position of the U.S.\u00a0 We will keep in touch and we look forward to receiving more information about the balloon issues, and we will further communicate in order to have a more profound insight on this issue.\u00a0 So right now, I do not have anything to add to this current status.\u00a0 Thank you.\nVICE MINISTER CHO:\u00a0 One briefly.\u00a0 We have already made it clear that any infringement of other countries\u2019 territorial sovereignty can never be tolerated, against which the necessary measures can be taken in accordance with international law.\u00a0 That is our clear position on this issue.\u00a0 And we also expect that there will be some opportunity for high-level dialogue with China and sit down together on this issue as well sometime in the future.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Next we\u2019ll go to Ayako Echigo with Jiji Press.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Ayako Echigo from Jiji Press.\u00a0 Thank you for this opportunity.\u00a0 I have a question for Mrs. Sherman and another for Mr. Mori and Mr. Cho.\nTo Secretary Sherman, can you describe the current level of communications your office is having with China (inaudible) of Secretary Blinken\u2019s trip, and when do you expect high-level meeting to resume?\u00a0 It\u2019s been reported that Secretary Blinken considering meeting his counterpart in Munich, and can you confirm on that?\nAnd to Mr. Mori and Mr. Cho, what is your response to China this morning accusing the U.S. of illegally flying its own balloon over China?\u00a0 Is there any support you can offer the U.S. to push back against state-level misinformation?\u00a0 Thank you.\nDEPUTY SECRETARY SHERMAN:\u00a0 So thank you very much.\u00a0 As I said in response to Shaun\u2019s question, Secretary Blinken in his conversation with Wang Yi said that because of the surveillance balloon over U.S. territory that \u2013 and the actions that we reserved the right to take, which we subsequently did \u2013 that conditions were not right for the wide-ranging dialogue that we had hoped to have with the PRC, but that we remained open to conversation, discussion, and rescheduling a trip to Beijing when conditions were appropriate.\nAs far as Munich is concerned, I have nothing to announce today.\u00a0 Obviously, there have been reports of the potential of such a meeting, but I have no announcements today.\nBefore my colleagues answer your question, let me add a fact which is very important.\u00a0 As John Kirby, the NSC spokesperson, just said, there are no U.S. Government balloons over the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2013 none, zero, period.\nVICE MINISTER MORI:\u00a0 Well, the position of the Government of Japan concerning the balloon issue in general, I have already explained.\u00a0 And regarding the Chinese accusation about U.S. balloons over the territory of China, well, I have to say that, about American activities, Wendy has the right answer.\u00a0 Thank you.\nVICE MINISTER CHO:\u00a0 Well, as you just heard from Deputy Secretary Sherman, we, as an ally of the United State, we trust what just United State officially stated on this issue.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 And lastly, we\u2019ll go to Min Seok Lee with Chosun Ilbo.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you for the opportunity.\u00a0 I\u2019m Min Seok Lee from Chosun Ilbo.\u00a0 My first question if for the Deputy Secretary Sherman and Vice Minister Mori.\u00a0 There\u2019s been a report recently published by Senate Foreign Relations Committee about Indo-Pacific Strategy.\u00a0 It says, quote, \u201cThe U.S. and Japan should consider inviting Korea to join the U.S.-Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee, EPCC, to meet in the 2+2+2 format to address specific economic security issues,\u201d unquote.\u00a0 Does the U.S. or Japanese Government consider that suggestion?\nThe report also says South Korea could be invited to Quad+ dialogues on certain issues.\u00a0 Does the U.S. or Japan consider South Korea should be invited more regularly to Quad+ to better counter Chinese threat?\u00a0 Thank you.\nVICE MINISTER CHO:\u00a0\u00a0(In Korean.)\nDEPUTY SECRETARY SHERMAN:\u00a0\u00a0So on the issue of the Indo-Pacific report that was put out by Chairman Menendez just this last week, I think you are seeing today the trilateral cooperation amongst the United States, Japan, and the ROK.\u00a0 This is happening in every domain that you can think of, and we have given you a long list in our joint statement of all of the areas and all of the ways in which we are working together.\u00a0 We are always open to new formats and to new ways that will effectively bring about concrete results.\u00a0 But what you are seeing here today is exactly what that Indo-Pacific report calls for.\u00a0 We are doing it, we will always be open to new formats, and I don\u2019t think you could find a stronger trilateral relationship than the one that we have.\nVICE MINISTER MORI:\u00a0\u00a0Well, completely agree with Wendy, and in all the issues of the international society, including the free and open Indo-Pacific, we very much would like to cooperate with ROK.\u00a0 We would like to restore and further advance sound bilateral relations based on the framework of friendly and cooperative bilateral relations that have been built since the normalization of diplomatic relations.\u00a0 I will see First Vice Minister Cho this afternoon and hope that we will have further productive conversation.\u00a0 Thank you.\nVICE MINISTER CHO:\u00a0\u00a0All right, to me.\u00a0 Let me answer your second question first, the comparison between the previous government and the Yoon Suk-yeol government on trilateral cooperation.\u00a0 First of all, the number of vice ministerial meeting has increased significantly, from three meetings in five years in the previous government to three meetings in less than one year since the inauguration of Yoon Suk-yeol government.\u00a0 Furthermore, the scope of cooperation agenda has been expanded from North Korea to encompass regional and global challenges, economic security, and traditional and non-traditional security cooperation, including cyber security and even space cooperation.\nIt clearly demonstrate the trilateral cooperation has evolved into a core cooperation mechanism dedicated to peace and prosperity in the region and beyond.\u00a0 In addition, the ROK-U.S.-Japan trilateral partnership will be a critical aspect of the \u2013 our Indo-Pacific Strategy that we announced last December.\nOn your first question on North Korea, our three leaders already agreed on strengthening our trilateral cooperation in response to North Korea\u2019s continued provocation, including the enhancing the real-time information sharing on North Korea\u2019s missile data.\u00a0 So we have discussed in details and we will continue to discuss this issue to explore the concrete ways to promote and enhance our cooperation to this end.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you. \u00a0Thank you, your Excellencies.\n\n"}, {"url":

good evening.\u00a0 You never want a speaking program to get in the way of the food, especially on a night like tonight.\u00a0 But really, what a treat to see everybody here tonight.\u00a0 Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the U.S. Department of State.\nFor those of you who I don\u2019t \u2013 who I don\u2019t know, I am Rufus Gifford.\u00a0 I am chief of Protocol of the United States, and I\u2019m just so, so thrilled to see this group here tonight to relaunch the Diplomatic Culinary Partnership.\u00a0 At the \u2013 yes.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 At the State Department, we know that the heart of diplomacy is so much more than words, meetings, and moments alone.\u00a0 It is about creating the environment that brings us together to overcome barriers and sharing a bit of the best of your culture, which create foundations for dialogue and discussion.\nThere is a reason why so much of our diplomatic work occurs around a lunch or a dinner table.\u00a0 Food serves as one of our most important tools to build bridges, create connections, and deepen relationships.\u00a0 This is a personal passion of mine.\u00a0 While serving as an ambassador overseas and again through this program, I have sought to tell a story about the U.S. in part through the richness and diversity of our culinary traditions \u2013 a richness and diversity that the chefs right here in this room represent.\u00a0 And through the culinary \u2013 Diplomatic Culinary Partnership, we will seek to do just this.\nWe are honored to be joined in this endeavor by the James Beard Foundation, America\u2019s preeminent culinary arts organization.\u00a0 Firsthand, we in the Office of Protocol and the broader State Department have seen the organization\u2019s dedication to making America\u2019s food culture more diverse and sustainable for everyone, and there is no organization that has a better finger on the pulse of American cuisine.\nThrough this initiative, we will seek to find innovative ways of embracing food, hospitality, and community as diplomatic tools to engage world leaders, further cross-cultural dialogue, and strengthen our bilateral relationships, all the while having a little bit of fun and creating a little bit of joy.\u00a0 And we\u2019re lucky to be supported by so many of you in this room.\u00a0 Thank you to our Kitchen Cabinet tonight who are here in attendance.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Also thank you to Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams and the American Master Chefs\u2019 Order for supporting this evening\u2019s festivities.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd tonight, as you can see through their amazing jackets, which I love, members of the American Culinary Corps will be on the front lines of impacting and reinvigorating the State Department\u2019s culinary diplomacies.\u00a0 So please join me in welcoming and thanking the American Culinary Corps.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a member of the American Culinary Corps and the Kitchen Cabinet, was unable to be present in this room tonight as he is on the ground in T\u00fcrkiye supporting the humanitarian efforts following the devastating earthquake.\u00a0 However, he has a few words he\u2019d like to share by video.\u00a0 Pull that up.\n(The video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR GIFFORD:\u00a0 We are so grateful for Jos\u00e9\u2019s global contributions to making the world a better place and so thrilled to have him join the Diplomatic Culinary Partnership.\u00a0 And in closing, let me thank you again all so much for being here tonight.\u00a0 We\u2019re truly thrilled to see you.\u00a0 And as one of the most prominent of American icons, as also a bit of an American food diplomat, Julia Child said, quote, \u201cPeople who love to eat are always the best people.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So thank you, and without further delay it is my honor to introduce the CEO of the James Beard Foundation, Clare Reichenbach.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS REICHENBACH:\u00a0 Thank you so much, Ambassador Gifford.\u00a0 Here\u2019s to the good people.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It is such a great honor \u2013 the best people.\u00a0 It\u2019s such a great honor for the James Beard Foundation to be embarking upon this Diplomatic Culinary Partnership with the U.S. Department of State and be launching the new American Culinary Corps today.\nOur mantra at the James Beard Foundation is Good Food for Good, and this program feels like a wonderful expression of that.\u00a0 Together we have created a remarkable group of chefs and culinary professionals who represent the rich culinary tapestry and panoply of foodways in this country.\u00a0 These individuals are industry leaders and the embodiment of the foundation\u2019s mission and values, many of whom are with us this evening donning their finely \u2013 their newly minted official blue jackets.\u00a0 And they look terribly smart, I must say.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTogether we recognize the power of food in cultivating human connection, and as a compelling expression of heritage and culture.\u00a0 A shared meal and the story behind the plate can foster real empathy, can engender cross-cultural understanding and recognition of where we have been and where we are going as a society.\u00a0 As Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s quoted, James Beard himself said, \u201cFood is our common ground.\u00a0 It is a universal experience.\u201d\u00a0 And we are so excited to harness that principle through this program in support of the State Department\u2019s important culinary diplomacy efforts, and indeed to give this network of chefs a unique opportunity to showcase their cuisine and craft on behalf of this great nation.\nSo a profound thank you to the U.S. Department of State for this inspiring opportunity.\u00a0 We are so proud and honored to work with you as we embark on this new culinary corps.\u00a0 And we thank you \u2013 we thank the incredible chefs and culinary professionals who continue to tell their story and that of their communities through food.\nAnd now it is my great privilege to introduce the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\nPARTICIPANTS:\u00a0 Good evening.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It is wonderful to have you here at the State Department, to have you here in the Ben Franklin Room, and to launch \u2013 or relaunch \u2013 what is for us a truly wonderful initiative.\nNow, I have to tell you something.\u00a0 Most evenings in this building do not begin with servings of salty caramel ice cream or fros\u00e9 sorbet.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But we\u2019re very glad that tonight does, and I do want to thank the James Beard-winning Jeni Britton for providing for us tonight.\u00a0 Jeni, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd we are here with an absolutely extraordinary group of accomplished chefs:\u00a0 Marjorie Meek-Bradley, Tanya Holland, Edward Lee, Gregory Gourdet, Karen Akunowicz, Kwame Onwuachi, Carl Dooley, others that I can\u2019t begin to name because time would not allow it.\u00a0 But let me simply say this:\u00a0 If this were a quickfire challenge, it would end with Padma Lakshmi telling me to \u201cplease pack my knives and go.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nWe are grateful to everyone who prepared the amazing food that we\u2019ve enjoyed tonight.\u00a0 A special thanks to our student chefs.\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Student chefs from the American Culinary Federation \u2013 Isaiah, Sirius, Alexis, Barbara \u2013 you represent the next generation of the culinary profession, and the diversity, creativity, and sheer talent that you bring show us that it\u2019s a bright future indeed \u2013 and a delicious one, so thank you.\nThank you also, Clare, to you, to the James Beard Foundation, our partner in the Diplomatic Culinary Program; and to Ambassador Gifford and our Protocol team, whose care and whose attention to detail are indispensable to the work that we do every day.\nAnd, of course, a very warm welcome to members of the diplomatic corps here today.\u00a0 Now, I don\u2019t know why they chose this particular event to join us \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but I\u2019m greatly appreciative of their presence here today.\nSo we are, as I mentioned, in the Ben Franklin Room.\u00a0 You can see Ben Franklin looking down on us over there, America\u2019s first diplomat.\u00a0 He was known for aphorisms like, \u201cWine is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 When it came to food, he was actually a little bit more restrained, saying things like, \u201cEat to live, not live to eat.\u201d\u00a0 But I think we can forgive him, because he lived in Philadelphia before Michael Solomonov got there.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Then it would have been \u201clive to eat,\u201d or \u201ca Federal Donut a day keeps the doctor away.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI happen to have experienced that firsthand.\u00a0 In fact, I was actually telling Michael when we visited Federal Donuts there was one terrible thing that happened.\u00a0 We came away with a wonderful box of donuts; somehow, between the time that we got back to the plane and I was ready to dig into one of the donuts \u2013 somehow in that time the donuts were no longer there.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I need a repeat visit.\nBut you all know this:\u00a0 Food has been an integral part of the American story.\u00a0 Our culinary traditions show who we are, where we came from, and what we cherish.\u00a0 Many of our most iconic chefs are beloved as much for their food as they are for their courage, enabling future generations to bring their whole selves to the kitchen.\nDiscrimination prevented James Beard from doing that in his lifetime, but today, his foundation works to ensure that chefs are judged on the food they prepare \u2013 not who they are, what they look like, who they love.\u00a0 That\u2019s a mission that so many chefs here tonight are carrying forth.\nIn the diversity of America\u2019s cuisine and our greatest chefs, we see a reflection of our identity as a nation of immigrants \u2013 a land enriched by a beautiful fusion of ideas, of traditions, and tastes.\nAs the Frenchman Brillat-Savarin put it, \u201cTell me what you eat\u2026I\u2019ll tell you who you are.\u201d\u00a0 Another great philosopher of our times, who some of you would have seen on the show Ted Lasso \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 would say that football is life.\u00a0\u00a0 Well, food is life.\nIt\u2019s also, as you heard from Ambassador Gifford, one of the oldest tools of our diplomacy.\u00a0 When we break bread with people, we learn something about each other in ways that transcend divisions of geography or language.\u00a0 In my own time as a diplomat, I have found that sitting down for a meal with my counterparts has often led to conversations, candor, exchanges that simply don\u2019t happen when you\u2019re in a conference room, a board room, in an official formal environment.\u00a0 Put another way, sometimes diplomacy gets more done effectively at the dining room table than at the conference table, and I\u2019ve witnessed that, experienced that myself.\nHere at the State Department, cultural diplomacy has long been a pillar of our work.\u00a0 We run programs to harness the power of art, music, sports, education, and \u2013 of course \u2013 cuisine, and that helps us connect with other communities and other countries.\nSo today, alongside the James Beard Foundation \u2013 and with a special thanks to the advisory group that you\u2019ve already heard reference to, the \u201cKitchen Cabinet\u201d \u2013 we are excited to be launching the next generation of the Diplomatic Culinary Partnership.\u00a0 This program is going to bring American chefs into our diplomatic events, from embassy receptions to state dinners.\u00a0 It will give foreign visitors and dignitaries a chance to learn about the history of American cuisine and quite literally get a taste of our culture.\u00a0 And it will promote American food abroad, introducing our products, our restaurants, flavorful innovations to people around the world.\nAt the heart of this initiative is the new American Culinary Corps.\u00a0 We have enlisted more than 80 of our nation\u2019s most talented chefs, reflecting the rich diversity of our nation and our food.\u00a0 Many of them already run restaurants or kitchens that serve as ambassadors for their own communities and a slice of American cuisine.\u00a0 Now, what we\u2019re asking them to do is to work on a global scale, to use their incredible gifts to act as citizen diplomats \u2013 traveling, cooking, sharing our traditions one meal at a time.\nThe Culinary Corps represent the best of the American food scene, and we are thrilled to partner with some truly extraordinary chefs.\u00a0 I think some 50 or more of our colleagues are here with us tonight at the State Department.\u00a0 Thank you, thank you, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow again, I can\u2019t single out everyone tonight, but let me just mention a few people \u2013 chefs like Christine Ha, who is breaking barriers as a blind chef, a woman of color, an advocate for other chefs with disabilities, and a mastermind behind two award-winning Vietnamese restaurants.\nSean Sherman, who is preserving and revitalizing indigenous ingredients and techniques by creating dishes like compote made with wild manzanita berries and acorns.\u00a0 Sign me up for that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nKevin Tien, executive chef at D.C.\u2019s Moon Rabbit \u2013 which he calls a love-letter to his heritage as a first generation Asian American \u2013 and a co-founder of Chefs Stopping AAPI Hate.\u00a0 I know that many members of the American Culinary Corps are involved with this program and recently hosted a benefit dinner to support families that were affected by the horrific mass shooting that we experienced in Monterey Park.\nLast month in Chicago, I had the opportunity to visit Eli\u2019s Cheesecake Company.\u00a0 Now, some of you may have experienced Eli\u2019s cheesecake in the past.\u00a0 In fact, the entire trip to Chicago was an excuse to go to Eli\u2019s.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But true to its name, Eli\u2019s makes incredible cheesecake.\u00a0 But what\u2019s even more remarkable is the team making those cheesecakes \u2013 a third of whom are refugees.\u00a0 And I got a chance to visit the production line and meet some of these remarkable people.\nSupporting the next generation of American citizens is a value that\u2019s as fundamentally American as cheesecake itself.\u00a0 And Eli\u2019s reminds us that good food is as much about what\u2019s in our hearts as what\u2019s in our stomachs.\nSo I am confident that the chefs of the American Culinary Corps will continue in that spirit as they share their skills, promote our values, and forge new bonds between our country and communities around the world.\nTo each and every one of you who\u2019s participating as one of our new ambassadors, thank you.\u00a0 To all of you here tonight, thank you for joining us.\u00a0 We have a little bit of business to take care of in the signing of this Memorandum of Understanding, and then we\u2019ll get out of the way so that people can keep drinking and eating.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 The Memorandum of Understanding being signed today formalizes the Diplomatic Culinary Partnership between the United States Department of State and the James Beard Foundation.\u00a0 This partnership will endeavor to advance public diplomacy through food and hospitality and bridge cultures through the culinary arts.\n(The Memorandum of Understanding was signed.)\n(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 This concludes today\u2019s MOU signing ceremony.\u00a0 Please continue to enjoy the reception.\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-iraqi-foreign-minister-fuad-hussein-before-their-meeting/",

", "date": "February 8, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It is as always a great pleasure to welcome the secretary general back to Washington, back to the State Department.\u00a0 Jens, so good to be with you.\nBefore I begin and with your permission, I just want to briefly update everyone on our efforts to assist T\u00fcrkiye and Syria in the aftermath of Monday\u2019s earthquakes.\u00a0 The loss of life has been truly staggering, shocking.\u00a0 We, I think along with people around the world, are mourning those who have been lost, and also our thoughts are so with those who have lost loved ones.\nSo far, we have deployed more than 150 search and rescue personnel to T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 We have U.S. helicopters that are helping to reach areas that would otherwise be difficult to access.\u00a0 In Syria, we have NGO partners that we\u2019ve funded over the years that are providing life-saving assistance to those in need.\u00a0 Across both countries, we\u2019ve deployed experienced emergency managers, hazardous materials technicians, engineers, logisticians, paramedics, planners, others, along with about 170,000 pounds of specialized tools and equipment.\nSo, that\u2019s been the initial response.\u00a0 In the days ahead, we\u2019ll have more to say about how we\u2019ll continue to support both the Turkish and Syrian people as they work to recover from this devastation.\nTurning back to today, the secretary general and I were last together in November for the NATO foreign ministers meeting.\u00a0 The members of our Alliance left that meeting in Bucharest even more unified, more resolute and more committed in our support for Ukraine; which is in large part due to the remarkable leadership that Secretary General Stoltenberg has engaged in over the last year.\u00a0 During what has been a decisive time for NATO and for the world, his strong and steady hand has helped steer our Alliance in the right direction.\nNow, as we approach the one-year mark since President Putin launched his brutal war against Ukraine, it\u2019s critical that we maintain and increase that support.\u00a0 President Putin\u2019s war continues to be a strategic failure.\u00a0 He\u2019s failed to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine, to subsume Ukraine into Russia, or to break the will of its people.\u00a0 He\u2019s lost the battles for Kyiv, for Kharkiv, for Kherson.\u00a0 His military is suffering staggering losses on the battlefield, and he\u2019s failed to weaken our Alliance and what it stands for.\u00a0 In fact, that alliance \u2013 NATO \u2013 is stronger and more united than it\u2019s ever been.\nToday, we focused on steps that we can take to ensure that Ukraine has the security assistance that it needs to defend its territory against Russian aggression.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue that conversation this afternoon when we\u2019re joined by the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, and the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, here at the State Department.\nWe\u2019ve calibrated our assistance to meet Ukraine\u2019s changing needs from the outset of the Russian invasion, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll continue to do.\u00a0 Two weeks ago, President Biden announced that the United States would send Abrams tanks to Ukraine.\u00a0 Germany committed to send its Leopard tanks and authorized other partners to do the same.\u00a0 This followed the earlier announcement by the United Kingdom that it would be sending Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine\u2019s defenders.\nLast week, we also announced two new assistance packages which will provide critical air defense and counter-drone capabilities to help Ukraine defend its people, including against the threat posed by UAVs supplied by Iran, which shares Russia\u2019s authoritarian vision and is increasingly aiding and abetting its aggression.\u00a0 We\u2019re also providing armored infantry vehicles and more of the equipment that Ukraine is using so effectively, like Javelin anti-tank missiles, artillery ammunition, and rockets for U.S.-provided HIMARS.\nIn total, the United States has committed nearly $30 billion since the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion.\u00a0 And our allies and partners have provided more than $13 billion in military assistance over the past year and tens of billions more in humanitarian and economic support.\u00a0 The contributions that Europe writ large has made to this effort are very significant, and making a profound difference.\nAs President Zelenskyy has said, diplomacy is the only way to definitively end Russia\u2019s war of aggression and to create a path to peace that is both just and durable.\u00a0 Clearly, President Putin has no genuine interest in diplomacy right now.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what he said just a few weeks ago:\u00a0 Unless and until Ukraine accepts \u201cthe new territorial realities\u201d \u2013 in quotation marks \u2013 there is nothing to even talk about.\u00a0 In other words, Ukraine and the world must somehow acquiesce to President Putin\u2019s land grab.\u00a0 That should be a non-starter for every country in the world that cares about the UN charter, and preserving international peace and security.\nThe best way to hasten prospects for real diplomacy is to keep tilting the battlefield in Ukraine\u2019s favor.\u00a0 This will help ensure that Ukraine has the strongest possible hand to play at a negotiating table when one emerges.\nWe also discussed the systemic and tactical challenges that China presents to the Alliance and the broader international system.\u00a0 Last week, Beijing violated international law and U.S. sovereignty with the presence of a Chinese surveillance balloon in U.S. airspace.\u00a0 This was an irresponsible act, in response to which we acted responsibly and prudently to protect our interests.\nThere is an ongoing operation to recover the balloon\u2019s components.\u00a0 We\u2019re analyzing them to learn more about the surveillance program.\u00a0 We will pair that with what we learn from the balloon \u2013 what we learn from the balloon itself with what we\u2019ve gleaned based on our careful observation of the system when it was in our airspace, as the President directed his team to do.\nWe\u2019ll also share relevant findings with Congress as well as with our allies and partners around the world.\u00a0 Senior administration officials are on the Hill this week, and we\u2019ve already shared information with dozens of countries around the world both from Washington and through our embassies.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing so because the United States was not the only target of this broader program which has violated the sovereignty of countries across five continents.\u00a0 In our engagements, we are again hearing from our partners that the world expects China and the United States to manage our relationship responsibly.\u00a0 That\u2019s precisely what we\u2019ve set out to do.\u00a0 We continue to urge China to do the same.\nWe\u2019re also continuing to strengthen and broaden NATO\u2019s partnerships, and weave them together in new ways.\u00a0 The United States welcomed the Secretary General\u2019s visit to South Korea and Japan last week as an extension of those efforts, demonstrating the growing synergy between our Atlantic and Pacific alliances.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re very focused on the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO.\u00a0 These countries are ready to bring their strengths to bear on our Alliance.\u00a0 They\u2019re capable, they\u2019re trusted partners, they\u2019re strong democracies that are dedicated to the values that underpin the Alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to push for the completion of this process as we head towards the Vilnius Summit in July.\nAnd as we look to Vilnius, our Alliance is working to operationalize the strategic concept to make sure that NATO is fit for the future, including on challenges like emerging technologies, cyber defense, climate, and energy security.\u00a0 These were all significant achievements under the leadership of Secretary General Stoltenberg in bringing forward and having approved a new strategic concept for the Alliance to reflect the realities of the moment we\u2019re living in and to project what we need to do into the future.\nSo, it\u2019s a busy time, but we\u2019re confident about what our Alliance could achieve \u2013 confident because of the great unity that we\u2019ve shown again and again over the last year, and confident because of the shared purpose we bring to the year and the years ahead.\nWith that, Jens, over to you.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, it\u2019s great to be back in Washington and to be together with you again.\u00a0 I would like to start by commending President Biden and the United States for providing such a strong leadership at a time when we face the most serious security crisis in a generation.\u00a0 And thank you, Tony, for your personal commitment and your leadership on every issue related to NATO and the vital bond between America and Europe.\u00a0 Unwavering American leadership and bipartisan support have ensured that NATO Allies are united like never before.\u00a0 And our unity makes a real difference.\nPresident Putin launched his illegal war of aggression almost a year ago.\u00a0 Since then, NATO Allies have provided unprecedented support for Ukraine \u2013 around $120 billion in military, humanitarian and financial assistance.\u00a0 As the biggest Ally, the United States is playing an indispensable role in supporting Ukraine.\u00a0 European NATO Allies and Canada have stepped up as well, contributing over half of the overall assistance, including tanks, advanced air defense systems, and other military equipment.\u00a0 Europeans have also welcomed almost 5 million refugees from Ukraine, applied unprecedented sanctions, and decoupled from Russian gas and Russian oil.\u00a0 This shows how much we can do when Europe and North American stand together.\nToday, we discussed the situation in Ukraine.\u00a0 Putin started this war of aggression, and he can end this war today by withdrawing his troops from Ukraine and coming to the negotiating table.\u00a0 But regrettably, we see no sign that Russia is preparing for peace.\u00a0 On the contrary, Moscow is preparing for new military offensives, so we must continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs to retake territory and prevail as a sovereign, independent nation.\nIf Putin wins, it will be a tragedy for Ukraine, but it will also be dangerous for all of us.\u00a0 It will send a clear message not just to Putin but also to other authoritarian regimes that when they use force, they can achieve their goals.\u00a0 That will make the world more dangerous, and all of us more vulnerable.\nBeijing is watching closely and learning lessons that may influence its future decisions.\u00a0 So, what happens in Europe today could happen in Asia tomorrow.\u00a0 China is substantially building up its military forces, including nuclear weapons without any transparency.\u00a0 It is attempting to assert control over the South China Sea and threatening Taiwan, trying to take control of critical infrastructure, including in NATO countries, repressing its own citizens and tramping on human rights, and deepening its strategic partnership with Moscow.\u00a0 So, NATO Allies had real concerns which we discussed today.\nIn this more dangerous and more competitive world, we must continue to strengthen our deterrence and defense, and further increase defense spending; and that is what we are doing.\u00a0 In 2014, under the Obama-Biden administration, all NATO Allies agreed the Defense Investment Pledge.\u00a0 Since then, we have seen eight consecutive years of increased defense spending across Europe and Canada \u2013 with an additional 350 million extra U.S. dollars spent. [1]\u00a0 More countries are now spending at least 2 percent of GDP on defense, and I expect that trend to continue.\nToday, we also discussed the importance of completing Finland and Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO.\u00a0 At the Madrid Summit, last July, all Allies made the historic decision to invite both countries to join NATO.\u00a0 All Allies have signed the accession protocols, and 28 Allies have already ratified the agreement.\u00a0 Finland and Sweden are now being integrated into the civilian and military structures of our Alliance.\u00a0 This has only strengthened their security, and it is inconceivable that Allies would not act should Finland or Sweden come under pressure.\u00a0 It is important that we conclude this membership process as soon as possible.\u00a0 This will strengthen the security of all Allies.\nSo Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, thank you again for your strong personal commitment and for the extraordinary leadership of the United States as we face global challenges together.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We will start with Leon Bruneau of the\u00a0AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi there, Mr. Secretary and Secretary General.\u00a0 Thanks for doing this.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, you started the press conference speaking about the tragic earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria, and actually that\u2019s \u2013 my question is relevant to that.\u00a0 Specifically, as you know, there\u2019s \u2013 in one border crossing in the northwest of Syria, which is damaged by the earthquake and there are no other crossings, and so obviously it\u2019s going to be difficult to get the aid there.\u00a0 And you also said that \u2013 you were adamant in saying that all U.S. aid would go through local NGOs, U.S.-funded local NGOs.\nAnd so, my question is this, is I was wondering if the administration has had any contact at any level with the Syrian Government?\u00a0 And if there were a request through the Syrian Government, would the U.S., the administration, accede to that request to coordinate aid for the Syrian people?\nAnd a question for the secretary general.\u00a0 Since T\u00fcrkiye is obviously a NATO member, could you provide us some detail on what NATO is actually doing to help the recovery efforts in T\u00fcrkiye?\u00a0 And also, tragically, would this tragedy in any way help to ease tensions with T\u00fcrkiye on relevant issues that you mentioned on your agenda?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Leon, thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to Syria, I\u2019m not aware of any contacts between the United States Government and the Syrian Government in recent days since the earthquake.\u00a0 But here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing.\u00a0 If you go back to 2011, we provided more than $15 billion in assistance to the Syrian people through NGO partners \u2013 international NGO partners, partners on the ground in Syria.\u00a0 We\u2019re a leading provider of humanitarian assistance to Syria, to the Syrian people, not to the government.\u00a0 And working through these partners, we\u2019ve tried to make sure that the assistance gets to where it\u2019s needed, and that\u2019s the people who are affected by the horrific war that Assad has waged on his own people, since 2011 \u2013 and now, in the case of the earthquake, to people affected by the earthquake.\nYou\u2019re exactly right that there is one crossing that allows assistance to get into Syria from the outside, and that was disrupted by the earthquake.\u00a0 It\u2019s exactly why we have been fighting every single year not only to preserve that crossing at the \u2013 it\u2019s authorized, as you know, by the United Nations \u2013 but to get additional ones so that if a crossing was taken out of action, there would be other places that people could get humanitarian assistance in.\u00a0 And of course, year after year, Russia has sought to block those crossings or to limit them, and that only compounds the tragedy that people in Syria are now experiencing.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0 Just a couple of hours after the earthquake, we sent out a call from the NATO headquarters to all NATO Allies to provide immediate support, to help T\u00fcrkiye with the consequence of a devastating earthquake.\u00a0 And I welcome that Allies have stepped up and are now providing different types of support.\u00a0 Of course, the U.S., Secretary Blinken mentioned, has already provided lot of support, but also other Allies are stepping up.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the continued message from NATO, is that we should support T\u00fcrkiye, a valued and important NATO Ally, where we see human suffering and the devastating consequences of the earthquake.\nAnd of course, Allies have also expressed their deepest condolences, and it is heartbreaking to see all the suffering, but also to see how people and Allies are now stepping up to provide as much help as possible.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Tove Bj\u00f8rgaas, NRK.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Question for Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 How important is it for the Biden administration that Sweden is also allowed to join NATO, not just Finland?\u00a0 And what is the U.S. doing to solve this argument with Erdogan and T\u00fcrkiye?\u00a0 What \u2013 how can the U.S. influence that T\u00fcrkiye changes its position?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, first, this is not a bilateral issue between the United States and any other country.\u00a0 This is an Alliance matter, and our view is very clear:\u00a0 Both Finland and Sweden are ready to be NATO Allies, and the Alliance should welcome them as quickly as possible.\u00a0 Their militaries already work seamlessly with Alliance forces.\u00a0 As I said earlier, they\u2019re strong, vibrant democracies.\u00a0 We\u2019re confident that NATO will formally welcome both countries, and that that will happen soon \u2013 and this will in turn enhance security across the entire Euro-Atlantic region.\nAs this process continues, we are fully committed to Finland and Sweden\u2019s accession to the Alliance.\u00a0 And again, I think you can see the strength of that support across the Alliance.\u00a0 Nearly all countries took swift action.\u00a0 Our Senate overwhelmingly, and on a bipartisan basis, voted for their membership, and the time is right now to finalize that accession process and to welcome as full members of NATO.\nWe support the work that both countries have been doing with T\u00fcrkiye to address legitimate concerns that T\u00fcrkiye has brought to the table about its security.\u00a0 There\u2019s an ongoing process there, but \u2013 as you know, both countries, Finland and Sweden, took significant steps to address concerns that T\u00fcrkiye raised.\u00a0 They made commitments under a memorandum of agreement that was signed in Madrid, and they are making good on the commitments that they\u2019ve made.\u00a0 Again, we acknowledge T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s longtime security concerns.\u00a0 We appreciate the tangible actions that both countries, Finland and Sweden, have taken to address them.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Nick Schifrin of PBS.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, forgive me, two questions for you, and then I\u2019ll turn to the secretary general.\nToday the British prime minister announced that the UK would provide fighter jet training, Western fighter jet training, to Ukrainian pilots and would examine the possibility of providing Western jets to Ukraine. \u00a0Why does the U.S. continue to oppose a step that the British Government now believes would be helpful to Ukraine long-term?\nAnd on the balloon, you\u2019ve described now the network of aerial surveillance conducted by China in five continents.\u00a0 Do you believe that that network is run by the PLA air force, and do you believe Xi Jinping himself was aware of the balloon last week?\nAnd Mr. Secretary General, U.S. officials have described that Chinese surveillance balloons have flown over at least one European country.\u00a0 Is that something that NATO is aware of and are you concerned about?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Nick, very much.\u00a0 So first of all, with regard to the balloon, we will have more to say about that in the days ahead.\u00a0 We are getting more information almost by the hour as we continue to work to salvage the balloon.\u00a0 We\u2019re learning from that, and, as well, we\u2019re learning from what we saw and picked up as the balloon traversed the United States.\nAs to who\u2019s responsible for that, China is, and it doesn\u2019t matter on one level which individuals may or may not have been responsible.\u00a0 The fact is China engaged in this irresponsible action, a violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity and international law.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve noted as well, we\u2019re not alone in this.\u00a0 Countries across five continents have also had surveillance balloons overfly their territory, which is why we\u2019re sharing this information with others.\u00a0 We continue to look to China to act responsibly; and as well to help us in managing this relationship responsibly.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we continue to look for.\nAnd I\u2019m sorry, the first part of your question \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Fighter jets.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Oh, the fighter jets.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve said throughout this process, at every single turn, we will \u2013 working very closely with the Ukrainians as well as working with other partners and allies \u2013 work to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs when it needs it to effectively defend itself and to continue to take back the territory that\u2019s been seized from it by Russian forces.\u00a0 As the nature of the conflict, of the aggression has evolved, so too has the support that we\u2019ve provided.\nAnd what we did initially \u2013 in fact, before the Russian aggression itself, as we saw it coming and wanted to make sure that Ukraine had in its hands what it would need to defend itself \u2013 we did these very significant drawdowns a year \u2013 more \u2013 well more than a year \u2013 a year and a half ago, back in September before the aggression \u2013 Christmas before the aggression.\u00a0 And as a result, they had things like Stingers and Javelins on hand when Russia went at Kyiv, and they were able to repel the attack and push it back.\u00a0 At every step along the way, as needs have evolved, so too has what we have provided Ukraine; and that most recently took place with the decision to provide the Abrams tanks and \u2013 of course, Germany providing the Leopard tanks and other Europeans doing the same.\nWe\u2019ve also been very clear all along that what\u2019s vital is not just a particular weapon system or piece of equipment.\u00a0 Equally important is the ability of Ukrainians to use it effectively, and that requires in some cases significant training.\u00a0 Equally important is the ability to maintain it.\u00a0 And then finally all of that has to be brought together in an actually \u2013 in a coherent strategy.\u00a0 All of those elements are important.\nIt\u2019s a long way of saying this is an evolving process, and we will continue to make judgments about what we think Ukraine needs and what it can be most effective in using.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do that in very close consultation with the Ukrainians and, of course, in consultation with our partners.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0 The Chinese balloon over United States confirms a pattern of Chinese behavior, where we see that China over the last years has invested heavily in new military capabilities, including different types of surveillance and intelligence platforms.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also seen increased Chinese intelligence activities in Europe \u2013 again, different platforms.\u00a0 They use satellites, they use cyber, and as we\u2019ve seen over the United States, also balloons.\nSo, we just have to be vigilant.\u00a0 We need to be aware of the constant risk of Chinese intelligence, and then step up what we do to protect ourself.\u00a0 And we need also to react in a prudent, responsible, and vigilant way, as we have seen the United States has reacted to this specific balloon over North America and United States.\nI think it also highlights that security is not regional; security is global.\u00a0 What happens in Asia matters for Europe, and what happens in Europe matters for Asia and also, of course, for North America.\u00a0 This was a message that was very much confirmed during my visit to Japan and South Korea \u2013 East Asia \u2013 last week, where those close partners of NATO very much highlighted the importance of strengthening the cooperation between NATO and our partners in the Indo-Pacific to address the challenges that China poses to our security, to our values, and to our interests.\u00a0 And I think that is \u2013 the balloon over North America just confirms that pattern.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll take a final question from Karin Eriksson of\u00a0ND.[1]\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 So back to T\u00fcrkiye, then, because T\u00fcrkiye is now sending the signal that it might accept Finland but not Sweden into NATO, separating the processes.\u00a0 I wanted to ask you both:\u00a0 To what extent do you see this as a possible or viable path forward? Thank you.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0\u00a0First of all, I think we have to remember that all Allies, also T\u00fcrkiye, made an historic decision in July last year when all Allies at the NATO summit in Madrid invited both Finland and Sweden to become members of the Alliance.\u00a0 Then all Allies \u2013 all 30 Allies \u2013 signed the Accession Protocols.\u00a0 And so far \u2013 already, 28 out of 30 Allies have ratified the Accession Protocols.\nThese are historic decisions.\u00a0 And so far, this has been one of the quickest accessions processes in NATO\u2019s history and the quickest in NATO\u2019s modern history, because we have to remember that Finland and Sweden applied in May last year, and only in July they were invited, and now 28 out of 30 have ratified the protocols.\u00a0 They applied together, they were invited together, and 28 Allies have already signed both protocols.\nI think it\u2019s important that we recognize the importance both for Finland and Sweden, but also for the whole Alliance, that they become a member \u2013 that they will become members as quickly as possible.\u00a0 As part of the decision in Madrid, Finland, Sweden, and T\u00fcrkiye signed a joint memorandum on how to step up cooperation \u2013 not least in the fight against terrorism.\u00a0 Finland and Sweden have delivered on their commitments under that memorandum.\u00a0 I also expressed that view in my meetings with the Turkish leadership.\u00a0 So, I\u2019m confident that both will become a member, but I\u2019m not ready to go into exactly when that will happen.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0What he said.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, gentlemen.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nFootnote:\n[1]Correction: An additional $350 billion since 2014\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-virtual-covid-19-global-action-plan-ministerial/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "February 8, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Mary Beth, thank you very much, and good morning, good afternoon, good evening.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to see so many friends and colleagues on the screen today.\u00a0 Thank you so much for joining the fourth and actually final COVID-19 Global Action Plan Ministerial meeting.\nSo we created this campaign almost exactly a year ago, with a pandemic disrupting the lives and livelihoods of virtually everyone on our planet.\u00a0 We came together appreciating that foreign ministries and multilateral institutions have a critical role to play in coordinating and prioritizing this challenge across borders and across bureaucracies, because we know that a pandemic is not just a health crisis \u2013 it\u2019s a security crisis; it\u2019s an economic crisis; it\u2019s a humanitarian crisis.\u00a0 Health security is national security.\nWe launched the Global Action Plan as an intensive 12-month effort \u2013 mobilizing over 33 countries as well as the European Union, the African Union, the World Health Organization \u2013 to help lead the world out of the acute phase of COVID-19.\u00a0 And thanks to the work of so many of you, along with NGOs, the private sector, our health and frontline workers, we\u2019ve made significant headway.\nWe know the pandemic is not over, but we have reached what the WHO considers a transition point.\u00a0 While COVID will be with us for the foreseeable future, we have dramatically reduced global deaths and severe illness.\u00a0 We\u2019ve managed the effects of COVID through increasingly available vaccines and treatments, and we\u2019re figuring out how to apply lessons from this pandemic to enhance health security going forward.\nAcross all six lines of effort that we laid out a year ago, our progress has been impressive and, in some cases, remarkable.\u00a0 First and foremost, this group has helped get shots into arms, with nearly 64 percent of people around the world having completed their first two doses.\u00a0 Greater coordination through GAP has also strengthened supply chains and improved distribution to some of the most remote corners of the world \u2013 whether shipping supplies like syringes where they\u2019re desperately needed, or inventing new cold chain storage solutions, as Japan so innovatively did.\u00a0 We combatted misinformation and disinformation, hosting local information sessions to address misperceptions and help skeptical communities appreciate that vaccines are safe and beneficial.\u00a0 GAP has also taken steps to support health workers on the frontlines, from providing personal protective equipment to getting those workers vaccinated.\nToday, nearly 90 percent of health workers around the world are fully vaccinated, and greater protection for our health workers means that they\u2019re able to better care for others.\u00a0 We\u2019re also strengthening testing and treatment to ensure that those at the highest risk can get tested as soon as they develop symptoms and rapidly receive medication and care if needed.\u00a0 That includes partnering with the private sector in places like South Africa to make medical oxygen more affordable.\nFinally, we\u2019re working to strengthen global health security.\u00a0 That means improving our collective early warning systems for detecting diseases, speeding up production and distribution of vaccines, PPE, and tests.\u00a0 It means negotiating a pandemic accord with other WHO members, as well as boosting financing for preparedness like with the new pandemic fund that the World Bank and the WHO are putting together.\u00a0 The United States has already pledged $450 million to that fund, and we\u2019ll be looking to other nations, including many of you, for your contributions and your leadership.\nTaken together, we\u2019re building a world better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to the next pandemic, and to do so quickly, effectively, and equitably, because an equitable approach is both the right thing to do and the smart thing to do.\nDespite all of this progress, we know that real challenges remain.\u00a0 Too many older and immunocompromised people are not getting vaccines or antiviral treatments, and new variants an unanticipated obstacles could of course set us back.\u00a0 The world cannot succumb to the cycle of panic and neglect that we saw with Ebola in 2014 and Zika in 2016.\u00a0 We like to say that this time is different.\u00a0 Now, we actually have to prove it.\nIn the long term, we need to institutionalize the role that foreign ministries played in the COVID response and apply it to our continued efforts to strengthen health security.\u00a0 The pandemic underscored that we have to confront these shared challenges together.\u00a0 GAP showed that we are capable of doing that.\u00a0 Now, I think it\u2019s on us to try to maintain the momentum to safeguard the health of our people, to save lives.\nAs we open today\u2019s discussion, I simply want to say this: \u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you to all of you for your engagement \u2013 and especially the countries that have served as ministerial cohosts: Japan, Bangladesh, Botswana, and Spain.\u00a0 And now I look forward to hearing from everyone else.\u00a0 Thanks so much.\nMary Beth, back to you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-austrian-foreign-minister-alexander-schallenberg-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

evening, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great pleasure to welcome Foreign Minister Schallenberg here to the State Department, to Washington.\u00a0 And I want to come to the importance of his visit in a moment, but if you\u2019ll just allow me \u2013 and I suspect, Alexander, you may have the same thoughts in mind \u2013 the horrific earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria.\u00a0 I know it\u2019s very much on both of our minds.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the truly devastating pictures coming out of T\u00fcrkiye and Syria today.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the collapsed buildings.\u00a0 We see children being pulled out of the rubble.\u00a0 Thank God there\u2019s still people being pulled out of the rubble.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019re all profoundly touched by the images, the stories that we\u2019re hearing.\nMany of us have worked to swing into action to help our friends in T\u00fcrkiye and also to help the Syrian people who are suffering from this. \u00a0The United States Government has been in full motion.\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier today, we\u2019ve deployed now more than 150 search and rescue personnel to T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 USAID, the Agency for International Development, is in the lead of our efforts.\u00a0 We have U.S. helicopters that are supporting Turkish response efforts in very hard-to-reach areas.\u00a0 We\u2019re in close contact with the Turkish Government.\u00a0 I spoke to my Turkish counterpart yesterday.\u00a0 Other colleagues have been speaking to their counterparts and the broader response team that\u2019s on the ground to support efforts both in T\u00fcrkiye and across the border in northwest Syria to do anything we possibly can to come to the assistance of people who are in need.\nIn Syria itself we have U.S.-funded humanitarian partners that are coordinating lifesaving assistance, and we\u2019re committed to providing that assistance to help people in Syria recover from this disaster, just as we have been their leading humanitarian donor since the start of the war in Syria itself.\u00a0 I want to emphasize here that these funds of course go to the Syrian people, not to the regime.\u00a0 That won\u2019t change.\u00a0 But as I said, we\u2019re able to work through humanitarian partners on the ground in Syria.\nWe\u2019ll have more to say in the coming days as these efforts continue, and as necessary expand or respond to the way the situation evolves.\u00a0 But just very important to say at the outset how much we\u2019re focused on this, how much our hearts go out to people in T\u00fcrkiye and in Syria, and how much our efforts are going out to try to help in this hour of need.\nHaving said that, Alexander, I\u2019m so pleased to have you here in Washington at the State Department.\u00a0 Austria is a strong and deeply valued partner for the United States.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a pivotal player in European security and European stability.\u00a0 We see that of course in the support that Austria is providing to Ukraine in its hour of need, but also critically in Austria\u2019s leadership in the Western Balkans, where it really plays I think a unique leadership role \u2013 something that we\u2019ll talk about \u2013 as well as now in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the OSCE.\nSo there is a lot happening in that space, a lot to talk about, and I\u2019m grateful for this opportunity to do it.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SCHALLENBERG:\u00a0 Dear Secretary of State, dear Tony, thank you for the very warm welcome.\u00a0 And I want to replicate we too were shocked by the news coming out of T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 I had yesterday and today contact with our friend and colleague Mevlut Cavusoglu.\u00a0 We are offering up to 80 \u2013 above 80 search and rescue experts with dogs and doctors which should be on the way right now.\u00a0 And obviously funds, but this can be only the first step.\u00a0 I believe what they need most now is our solidarity and active engagement, and our deep feelings and condolences go out to our Turkish friends.\nOn \u2013 thank you for receiving me.\u00a0 I had a very good and intensive day today, very good talks in Virginia, and I believe there\u2019s a lot on our agenda.\u00a0 My basic point is I believe in times of crisis you need to know who are your partners, and my aim is really to strengthen this also bilateral relationship \u2013 to have the strategic partnership we have as strong as possible, irreversible as possible.\u00a0 For too long we have taken each other for granted, maybe, the European Union and the United States.\u00a0 For too long we have stood back to back instead of shoulder to shoulder.\u00a0 And I believe, if anything, the last 11 months have shown if we stand together, if we are united, we are a formidable force.\u00a0 And that is, I believe, the biggest task of the coming year.\nThat is part of my message from my side, that yes, we want to stand together.\u00a0 We have to.\u00a0 There\u2019s simply no alternative.\u00a0 Trying times ahead of us, and you mentioned some of the regions where we or some of the organizations where we are asked to act, and I believe it\u2019s the decisions which will be taken this year will be \u2013 will have long-term repercussions.\u00a0 It\u2019s still foggy, and we count also on your leadership, and I\u2019m very thankful of everything you have done the last 11 months \u2013 you personally, the National Security Advisor and others, and the President, obviously, who will have \u2013 and I\u2019m thankful for receiving me today, because you have the State of the Union address in the evening.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So a very special day.\nAnd rest assured that Austria will do its share.\u00a0 We have taken in 90,000 Ukrainians.\u00a0 We have \u2013 I believe even some say number one in comparison to GDP as far as humanitarian aid is concerned.\u00a0 And we know exactly that in this crisis, our unity, our strategic patience is the most \u2013 are the most necessary assets, and you can count on us.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Treaty Room", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "February 7, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great pleasure to see my friend, the vice chancellor, here again at the State Department.\u00a0 I think it was almost exactly a year ago \u2014\nVICE CHANCELLOR HABECK:\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2013 yeah, exactly.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 \u2014 we had an opportunity to meet.\u00a0 A few things have happened since then.\u00a0 But one thing that stands out above all others is the extraordinarily close partnership and collaboration between Germany and the United States, something that we\u2019re grateful for every day.\nWe see that powerfully in Ukraine as both of our countries have worked closely together with other allies and partners to make sure that Ukraine has the security assistance it needs to defend itself, the economic assistance that it needs to keep its economy going, and of course the humanitarian support that its people need faced with the ongoing aggression from Russia.\u00a0 Of course, Germany has taken in hundreds of thousands, I think even a million, refugees from Ukraine and has been a leader in this effort over the last almost year now.\nI also have to applaud the extraordinary work that Germany has done, particularly Vice Chancellor Habeck, in helping to move Europe off of dependence on Russian energy.\u00a0 And this is having the dual benefit not only of reducing and ultimately eliminating that dependence, but also speeding up the green energy transition and all the benefits that would bring to both of our countries.\u00a0 So we\u2019re grateful for this partnership.\nLet me just say one other thing that\u2019s unrelated but I think important.\u00a0 I know we\u2019re both incredibly moved by the images that we\u2019re seeing coming from T\u00fcrkiye and Syria with the horrific earthquake that these countries experienced over the last couple of days.\u00a0 We see the images of collapsed buildings.\u00a0 We see people \u2013 thankfully, some still being pulled alive from the wreckage, children, but incredible suffering.\u00a0 Both of our countries are working very hard to support T\u00fcrkiye and the Syrian people in their hour of need.\u00a0 We\u2019ve deployed more than 150 search and rescue personnel.\u00a0 The U.S. Agency for International Development has been leading in this effort.\u00a0 In addition, through the humanitarian partners that we fund in Syria, we\u2019re providing assistance to people in Syria to try to recover from the earthquake.\u00a0 But I know both of our countries are focused on this human tragedy that\u2019s taking place right now in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria.\nBut, Robert.\nVICE CHANCELLOR HABECK:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, Antony.\u00a0 Thank you very much for having me once again here.\u00a0 Yes, let me start with the last remarks you gave.\u00a0 I discussed almost all day economic issues, debt reduction act, and the press attention was also focused on these issues.\u00a0 But thinking about the tragedy in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria gives this a certain (inaudible).\u00a0 Of course, these are important issues, but thousands of people are losing their lives, have lost their lives, and this is the real tragedy and the real situation where we have to help now, and we will do that.\u00a0 I thank the U.S. and I\u2019m proud for giving and supplying help, and I can say the same for Germany.\u00a0 Whatever is needed, and we can \u2013 we can give a supply is to be given.\nLast year when I visited the Secretary, we discussed mainly two issues.\u00a0 The first one was the military situation in Ukraine due to the Russian aggression, and the second one was energy questions and energy issues.\u00a0 And the first one, I must honestly say is still there\u2019s an ongoing war in Europe.\u00a0 Due to the bravery of the Ukraine army and the incredible willingness to stand together of the Ukraine people, there is a chance that Ukraine can be successful in this war, and I would like to thank the American partners especially that they are giving so much support.\nThis is a fight for freedom and democracy in Ukraine, and without the American help it would not be possible to achieve this situation as it is now, but of course it is a sheer catastrophe.\u00a0 Putin is slaughtering \u2013 is slaughtering so many men and life over there \u2013 of course mainly Ukraine people, but also he is fighting a war against his own countrymen.\u00a0 The soldiers dying there definitely had better in mind than dying for Putin in an unnecessary and unjustified war.\nThe second issue we discussed last year was the threat of a lack of mainly natural gas supply of Russia to Germany and Central Europe, and the worries were that if that\u2019s going to happen, then the European and German economy would collapse.\u00a0 And there is no Russian gas supply and the economy has not collapsed.\u00a0 We achieved security in the supply chain.\u00a0 We \u2013 we had \u2013 we rebuilt three new LNG terminals in a short amount of time.\u00a0 The storages are full, the prices are going down.\u00a0 They are still too high, but they are not in the mid of the winter where they were afraid or supposed to be.\u00a0 The inflation is broken.\nSo I think that Europe, and Germany and Europe, has shown what it can achieve if it wants to achieve something.\u00a0 And with this spirit we go on the talks.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-republic-of-korea-foreign-minister-park-jin-at-a-joint-press-availability-2/", "title":

Foreign Minister Park are now signing the protocol to amend and extend the U.S.-Republic of Korea Science and Technology Agreement.\u00a0 The first iteration of the agreement was signed in 1992.\u00a0 A new one was signed in 1999 and has been renewed since then.\u00a0 However, this amended version adds important new components to strengthen our science and technology agreement and extends the agreement for an additional 10 years.\n(The agreement was signed.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0 I am delighted to welcome Foreign Minister Park back to Washington.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s very, very good to be with my colleague and my friend.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0The Republic of Korea is a vital and longstanding strategic partner, and I\u2019m particularly grateful to have such a close friend in Jin to bring this alliance between our countries even closer.\u00a0 Before I talk about the productive discussions that we had today and the agreement we just signed \u2013 Jin, if you\u2019ll allow me \u2013 I\u2019d just like to briefly address the presence of the Chinese surveillance balloon in U.S. airspace.\nI spoke this morning with Director of the CCP Central Foreign Affairs Office Wang Yi to convey that in light of China\u2019s unacceptable action, I am postponing my planned travel this weekend to China.\u00a0 As you know, President Biden and President Xi agreed during their meetings in Bali in November that I would travel to Beijing to follow up on their discussions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working across the U.S. Government to prepare for a substantive set of discussions on issues that matter to the American people and to people around the world.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been engaging for some time with our counterparts in Beijing to prepare for these meetings.\nYesterday, the Department of Defense announced that we had detected and were tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon that remains over the continental United States.\u00a0 We continue to track and monitor the balloon closely.\u00a0 We\u2019re confident this is a Chinese surveillance balloon.\u00a0 Once we detected the balloon, the U.S. Government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information.\nWe communicated with the PRC Government directly through multiple channels about this issue.\u00a0 Members of my team consulted with our partners in other agencies and in Congress.\u00a0 We also engaged our close allies and partners to inform them of the presence of the surveillance balloon in our airspace. \u00a0We concluded that conditions were not conducive for a constructive visit at this time.\nIn my call today with Director Wang Yi, I made clear that the presence of this surveillance balloon in U.S. airspace is a clear violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law, that it\u2019s an irresponsible act, and that the PRC\u2019s decision to take this action on the eve of my planned visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.\u00a0 I told Director Wang that the United States remains committed to diplomatic engagement with China and that I plan to visit Beijing when conditions allow.\nIn the meantime, the United States will continue to maintain open lines of communication with China, including to address this ongoing incident.\u00a0 Indeed, that\u2019s why we need direct and regular communications in the first place, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that such lines remain open at all times to help avoid miscalculation and conflict.\nOne final but important note.\u00a0 The world expects the United States and China to manage our relationship responsibly.\u00a0 And indeed, addressing many of today\u2019s global challenges \u2013 challenges that affect the lives of our people and people around the world \u2013 demands that we find a way to work together as well.\u00a0 The United States will continue to act in a way that reflects that responsibility.\u00a0 We look to our PRC counterparts to do the same.\nNow, the foreign minister and I just signed an important agreement that will guide our country\u2019s cooperation on science and technology in the years ahead.\u00a0 The agreement builds on one that we signed in 1992, which helped foster three decades of consequential collaboration.\u00a0 Our universities have conducted joint research on cancer and climate change.\u00a0 Our governments have worked together to reduce air pollution, to promote research and development on semiconductors which power modern technologies from cars to smartphones.\u00a0 Our businesses have partnered on life saving vaccines and treatments, like the collaboration between the U.S. pharmaceutical company Moderna and South Korean biotechnology company Samsung Biologics to manufacture and \u2013 a safe and effective COVID vaccine for the region.\nToday\u2019s arrangement \u2013 today\u2019s agreement will expand the scope of that cooperation, both in areas that we\u2019ve long worked together on like space but also in emerging fields like biotechnology, quantum, artificial intelligence.\u00a0 Scientific cooperation is just one of many areas where our nations are working together to the benefit of our populations.\nAnother is our shared security, an area where we have enduring ties, as our troops continue to train and conduct joint exercises side by side.\u00a0 As President Biden has said, our alliance is the linchpin of peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.\u00a0 And it\u2019s poised to grow stronger still with the launch of the Republic of Korea\u2019s new Indo-Pacific strategy this past December, which reflects our own shared interests and shared approaches to the region\u2019s most pressing challenges.\nBut, today, we reaffirmed our commitment to improving our allied defense against common threats, as well as our commitment to defending the Republic of Korea using the full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities.\u00a0 Earlier this week, Secretary of Defense Austin met with President Yoon as well as Defense Minister Lee in Seoul to boost our deterrence planning, including through even deeper information sharing on North Korean nuclear threats.\u00a0 We remain committed to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nThe Foreign Minister and I also discussed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 We\u2019re increasing our trilateral security cooperation with Japan, which puts us on stronger footing to address shared security threats, including the DPRK\u2019s unlawful and reckless missile launches.\u00a0 We held a series of joint ballistic missile defense and anti-submarine warfare exercises this past fall.\u00a0 We\u2019re also deepening our trilateral collaboration on other security challenges, as well as on helping Pacific Island countries adapt to the growing impacts of climate change.\nWe\u2019re working with other countries to advance joint priorities, like boosting inclusive economic prosperity through the Indo-Pacific and beyond, including through the Indo-Pacific Framework for Prosperity and the Minerals Security Partnership.\nOf course, our partnership extends well beyond the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Since President Putin launched his brutal and unprovoked war on Ukraine, our countries have stood together, along with other allies and partners, to impose unprecedented sanctions and export controls designed to deprive Russia\u2019s war machine of resources, as well as to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their country.\u00a0 Here, too, we\u2019re working in concert with broad coalitions.\u00a0 Earlier this week, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg traveled to the Republic of Korea and Japan as part of his regular engagement with NATO\u2019s Asia-Pacific partners, demonstrating the growing synergy between our Atlantic and Pacific alliances.\nWe applaud, too, the Republican Korea\u2019s $100 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, aid that has brought vaccines to children, emergency medical supplies to families, power generators to communities \u2013 to replace the ones Russia has deliberately bombed as it tries to deprive Ukrainian civilians of heat, light, and water.\nThis October we\u2019ll celebrate the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK alliance.\u00a0 At the treaty signing 70 years ago, South Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister Pyon remarked that he was sure \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cThis written bond of solidarity would bring joy and encouragement to all \u2026 friends of freedom.\u201d\u00a0 Secretary of State Dulles said that the alliance was \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cfirmly dedicated to peace.\u201d\u00a0 For the past seven decades, our alliance has indeed sustained peace.\u00a0 And with the progress that we\u2019ve made today, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ve taken another step toward a more secure and prosperous future to the benefit of the people of our countries, of the Indo-Pacific, and of the world.\nAnd with that, Jin, over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK:\u00a0\u00a0Well, thank you, Tony, for your warm remarks and for welcoming me back to Washington.\u00a0 I would also like to thank your superb team for arranging today\u2019s meeting.\u00a0 This year marks, as you said, the historic 70th anniversary of the ROK-U.S. alliance, and I\u2019m delighted to kick off year-long commemorations with my good friend, Secretary Blinken.\nThe ROK-U.S. alliance is one of the most durable and successful alliances in history.\u00a0 It is special not only due to his longevity, but because it is a vibrant, adaptive partnership that consistently rises to the challenges of our times.\u00a0 And President Yoon and President Biden met in Seoul in May last year and declared that we would develop an upgraded global comprehensive strategic alliance.\u00a0 And we will expand the scope of the alliance to encompass not only political, military, economic partnership, but also technological and cultural dimensions.\u00a0 Alliance for the Future, the 70th anniversary slogan, aptly encapsulates this forward-looking spirit and an alliance in action.\nToday, Secretary Blinken and I had a productive and comprehensive discussion on a wide range of topics.\u00a0 First and foremost, we discussed ways to build on the agreements reached by our two leaders last year to lay out a blueprint for the next 70 years.\u00a0 In particular, we agreed to focus on issues that benefit our businesses and reassure and enrich the lives of our citizen in tangible ways.\u00a0 From extended deterrence to supply chain stability, to cutting edge technologies and space cooperation, our two governments will continue to enhance strategic communication at all levels across these critical areas.\nSecretary Blinken and I also reaffirmed our unwavering determination to denuclearize North Korea.\u00a0 This is at the forefront and center of our joint efforts to establish sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0 Peace without denuclearization is fake peace.\u00a0 North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs are a direct and serious threat to not only Korea, but also international peace and security.\u00a0 They undermine the very foundation of the global non-proliferation regime.\u00a0 The ROK and the U.S. will continue our water-tight coordination to achieve\u00a0genuine peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0 We are committed to strengthening extended deterrence while maintaining a robust combined defense posture.\u00a0 Any provocations by North Korea will be met with a firm and united response.\nThe Secretary and I also agreed to strengthen efforts to close loopholes and fully implement UN Security Council resolutions as well as to cut off Pyongyang\u2019s unlawful revenue streams.\u00a0 Countering North Korea\u2019s illicit cyber activities must be a priority.\u00a0 We agreed that China has the distinct capability and the responsibility to influence Pyongyang\u2019s behavior.\u00a0 Denuclearization of North Korea has long been an area of cooperation for China as well as ROK and the United States, and it needs to stay that way.\nWe will also embolden Korea-U.S.-Japan trilateral security cooperation to address North Korea\u2019s escalating threat.\u00a0 We also discussed maintaining focus on the egregious human rights situation in North Korea.\u00a0 In this vein, I welcome the nomination of Ms. Julie Turner as a new U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights.\nThe Secretary and I also discussed ways to scale up cooperation on economic security and cutting-edge technology.\u00a0 Just a few moments ago, I was pleased to sign with Secretary Blinken the Protocol Amending and Extending Scientific and Technical Cooperation Agreement between the ROK and the U.S.\u00a0 It will strengthen partnership on critical technologies by promoting research and development cooperation as well as exchange of experts and knowledge.\nWe agreed that space is the next frontier in our expanding partnership.\u00a0 President Yoon has stated that Korea will launch a new aerospace agency within this year.\u00a0 I was delighted to meet with NASA Administrator Bill Nelson yesterday to discuss cooperation on space that will benefit our civil, commercial, and security domains.\u00a0 This year we plan to hold the ROK-U.S. Space Forum through which we hope to further strengthen space cooperation.\nThe Secretary and I agreed to continue close coordination to address disruptions in the global supply chain.\u00a0 We will explore potential for cooperation under the CHIPS and Science Act.\u00a0 We will also work together to ensure that the Inflation Reduction Act is implemented in ways that address Korea\u2019s \u2013 Korean companies\u2019 concerns and benefit both our businesses and industries.\nAs you may know, last year Korea announced our own Indo-Pacific strategy.\u00a0 No region is more directly tied to global peace and prosperity than the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our respective Indo-Pacific strategies squarely embrace this fact.\u00a0 We will complement and amplify our engagements in this region in accordance with the core values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and rule of law, and in partnership with other countries that share these values.\nIn this regard, 2022 was a breakthrough year for ROK-U.S.-Japan trilateral cooperation.\u00a0 In June our leaders met for the first time in five years on the occasion of the NATO summit.\u00a0 They met again in Phnom Penh and announced the need to qualitatively expand trilateral cooperation to deter economic coercion, bolster economic security, and tackle 21st century challenges together.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and I also agreed to continue efforts towards a swift conclusion of the war in Ukraine and the restoration of peace to its incredibly brave and resilient people.\nSecretary Blinken and I covered a wide range of issues today.\u00a0 This is a testament to how closely our two countries have been working hand in glove at all levels.\u00a0 This is truly an alliance in action, an alliance for the future that is based on common interests and a common vision.\u00a0 I look forward to deepening my partnership and friendship with Tony in this seminal and historic year for the ROK-U.S. alliance.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Minister.\nMr. Secretary, this is the first time, according to the Pentagon, that China has sent a surveillance balloon over the U.S. for such duration.\u00a0 And as you have just said, it\u2019s the first time on the eve of a planned visit by an American secretary of state to China.\u00a0 Is canceling your trip, or postponing your trip, enough of a consequence?\u00a0 What are the other consequences that China should have to take for these actions?\nAnd secondly, if I may, what are the opportunity costs of not meeting with the Chinese and with the Chinese president\u00a0at a time of such tensions with Taiwan and continuing U.S. concerns over China\u2019s support for Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Andrea.\u00a0 Let me start with this:\u00a0 It\u2019s very important to emphasize that the presence of this surveillance balloon over the United States in our skies is a clear violation of our sovereignty, a clear violation of international law, and clearly unacceptable.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve made that clear to China.\u00a0 Any country that has its airspace violated in this way I think would response similarly, and I can only imagine what the reaction would be in China if they were on the other end.\nAnd what this has done is created the conditions that undermine the purpose of the trip, including ongoing efforts to build a floor under the relationship and to address a broad range of issues that are of concern to the American people, I believe to the Chinese people, and certainly as well to people around the world.\u00a0 So we took the step that I announced earlier today in postponing the planned visit for this weekend.\nMeanwhile, we are going to remain engaged with the PRC as this ongoing issue is resolved.\u00a0 The first step is getting the surveillance asset out of our airspace, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\u00a0 And I thought it was very important for Wang Yi, the senior foreign policy official in Beijing, to hear this directly from me.\nIt would be premature for me to weigh in on any other specifics as this surveillance balloon remains in our airspace.\u00a0 As I said, job one is getting it out of our airspace.\u00a0 We continue to believe that having open lines of communication is important.\u00a0 Indeed, this incident only underscores the importance.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we will maintain them, and that\u2019s also why, when conditions permit, I plan to go to China.\u00a0 But the most important thing right now in the moment is to see that this surveillance asset gets out of our airspace, and we\u2019ll take it from there.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But shouldn\u2019t there be \u2013 shouldn\u2019t there be other consequences, sir?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Seungmo\u00a0Nam of SBS.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Shouldn\u2019t there be another announcement \u2014\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Andrea, Andrea, we need to move on.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of anything other than to say that the first step is to get the surveillance craft out of our airspace.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Seungmo\u00a0Nam of SBS.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I have two questions.\u00a0 Firstly, Mr. Secretary, Secretary Blinken, North Korea\u2019s nuclear threats are increasing every day, even openly, especially to South Korea.\u00a0 Now many Koreans don\u2019t feel safe even with the U.S. commitments to the nuclear umbrella.\u00a0 The U.S. says there is no better guarantee than the U.S. Forces Korea.\u00a0 Right, but credibility has declined due to the discussions on withdrawal during the Trump administration.\u00a0 And as you know, it\u2019s not the first time.\nThis is why there are growing calls for South Korea to have nuclear weapons.\u00a0 My question is:\u00a0 Why is the extended deterrence currently being discussed by the U.S. and South Korea more reliable than existing nuclear umbrella (inaudible)?\u00a0 Please give me some examples that can reassure Koreans in this.\nAnd my next question is to Minister Park.\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 For the U.S. Government, U.S. Government is not making other people to make a choice, but while U.S. is trying to establish it\u2019s own supply chains, Korean companies are forced to make a change.\u00a0 So U.S. supply chains \u2013 regarding that, what is U.S. asking us and for our companies and our economy?\u00a0 What\u2019s ROK Government\u2019s position to handle this while we can\u2019t really make one choice or the other?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much, and I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 Let me be very clear:\u00a0 Our commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea as well as to Japan is ironclad.\u00a0 And in that light, we\u2019re also committed to strengthening our trilateral cooperation, which enhances both deterrence and the defense of our countries.\nWe take extended deterrence very seriously.\u00a0 And just in the last year, we\u2019ve renewed our Working Group on Extended Deterrence, we\u2019ve engaged in multiple exercises, and we have colleagues who at this very moment are working to strengthen and deepen even further our collaboration on extended deterrence.\nWe are committed to defending the Republic of Korea using the full range of our capabilities \u2013 nuclear, conventional, missile defense capabilities.\u00a0 So there should be no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind, starting with Pyongyang, of our commitment to defend our allies, our partners, our friends, and to extended deterrence.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Regarding your second question, for the international supply chains there is a very rapid change, as you all know, and Korea is trying its best\u00a0to make it beneficial, make the environmental \u2013 this international conditions beneficial for us, and we\u2019re trying very hard for it.\nThe Korea\u2019s network of economy and trading, we have to use it very well so that we can benefit our national interests, and our Korean Government is doing everything that it can do.\u00a0 The most important thing is to stabilize the supply chains based on the U.S.-ROK alliance.\u00a0 In this regard, so we are participating in IPEF and also we initiated or initially participated in the Fab 4 meetings so that we can benefit or serve our national interests and to create environment conducive for our national interests.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that pick one thing over the other.\u00a0 We are still maintaining relationship, economic relationship with China, and we are exporting a lot to China in terms of semiconductor business.\u00a0 And Samsung and SK, they have presence in China.\u00a0 So export control policies and its effect on us needs to be considered comprehensively so that we can come up with the most suitable policy for Korean situation.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Iain Marlow, Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, you\u2019ve described the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential one in the world, and yet the Department of Defense also described this Chinese spy balloon as not really representing a national security threat.\u00a0 What would you say to those who might suggest canceling this very important trip, as you\u2019ve outlined, is in part related to optics and being seen to respond to criticism that the Biden administration might be soft on China, or at least needs to take a tough response?\nAnd separately, you\u2019ve said that you\u2019ll go when conditions allow.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if you might elaborate on that.\u00a0 Are we talking a week or a month?\nAnd Foreign Minister Park, could you offer a little bit of an assessment on what you think the U.S., South Korea, and Japan can do to cut off these illicit revenue streams for North Korea, especially including the sale of ammunition to Russia or cryptocurrency theft?\u00a0 And how do you think China can be brought into those discussions?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Iain.\u00a0 China\u2019s decision to fly a surveillance balloon over the continental United States is both unacceptable and irresponsible.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is about.\u00a0 It\u2019s a violation of our sovereignty.\u00a0 It\u2019s a violation of international law.\u00a0 And it was very important that we, of course, take the actions we did to protect any sensitive information, to protect our people, and to make clear to China that, again, this is an unacceptable as well as irresponsible action.\nIt\u2019s even more irresponsible coming on the eve of a long-planned visit that followed from the meeting between the two presidents in Bali on the margins of the G20.\u00a0 And in our judgment, it created conditions that undermine the very purpose of the trip, including ongoing efforts, as I said, to build a floor under the relationship as well as to address a very broad range of issues that are important to Americans, to Chinese, to the entire world.\nSo that is why I conveyed to Wang Yi, the senior foreign policy official in China, this morning that I was postponing the travel and that we will look to see about doing the trip when conditions allow.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to put a date or time on that because what we\u2019re focused right now is on making sure that this ongoing issue is actually resolved.\u00a0 The first step, as I said, is getting the surveillance asset out of our airspace.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK:\u00a0 With regard to your question about North Korea\u2019s illicit cyber activities, as you may know, after the UN Security Council adopted stronger sanctions starting in 2016, North Korea\u2019s foreign exchange reserve decreased significantly.\u00a0 Since then, North Korea has been stepping up its illegal cyber activities to circumvent the sanctions regime, and reportedly, it has stolen more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars by hacking since 2017.\u00a0 It is more worrisome that Pyongyang uses such revenue to develop nuclear and missile programs.\u00a0 In this regard, its illicit cyber activities constitute a grave threat not only to the global economy and industries, but also to international peace and security.\nSo we must consolidate international efforts to block North Korea\u2019s illicit revenue stream.\u00a0 And I think Republic of Korea, the United States, and Japan should cooperate to deal with these challenges, and by doing so we will leave Pyongyang with no option but to return to dialogue and give up its nuclear development.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Dong Hyun Kim of Yonhap News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, thank you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, today you discussed many ways to strengthen the Korea-U.S. alliance.\u00a0 Would a April state visit by President Yoon be considered as one of those measures?\nAnd Minister Park, just last week the Chinese\u00a0military aircraft entered Korean air defense identification zone, and now there\u2019s a Chinese surveillance balloon in the U.S. airspace.\u00a0 Do you consider this kind of behaviors to be a threat to the alliance?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 President Biden very much values his relationship and partnership with President Yoon, but I would refer you to the White House for any information about any visits.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken gave me very detailed explanations about the Chinese balloon incident, and I sufficiently understand the decision to postpone Secretary\u2019s visit to China and I think that China should make a swift and very sincere explanations about what happened.\u00a0 But at the same time, the U.S.-China relationship is a very important relationship in international relations, so at some point in the future, I hope that President \u2014 Blinken can have a chance to visit China and to communicate with Beijing.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Minister.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 That concludes the press conference.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-28/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken At a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Waldorf Astoria Hotel", "location": "Jerusalem", "date": "January 31, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve had a busy few days at a pivotal time for the region.\u00a0 The United States is determined to work with our partners to foster a more stable, secure, and prosperous Middle East.\u00a0 The horrific terrorist attacks in Jerusalem, the escalation of violence on the West Bank have underscored the significant challenges to security and stability that the region faces and that we face.\nWe began this trip in Cairo, where I met with President Sisi and Foreign Minister Shoukry as well as with Egyptian human rights defenders and young leaders.\u00a0 Among a wide range of issues in my meetings with the government, we discussed the role Egypt and other neighbors can play in helping Israel and the Palestinians de-escalate, reduce tensions, and lay the foundation for a more peaceful path.\nUpon arriving in Israel, I expressed my condolences and those of the American people to Israel and to the families of the seven civilians who were killed in the horrific terrorist attack outside a synagogue in Neve Yaakov.\u00a0 In the wake of this and the subsequent attack on an Israeli father and son, I reaffirmed to Israel and its people the United States\u2019 ironclad commitment to Israel\u2019s security.\nA rising tide of violence has resulted in the loss of many innocent lives on both sides.\u00a0 As I discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas and everyone I met in Israel and the West Bank during this visit, all sides must take steps to prevent further escalation in violence and restore calm.\u00a0 That\u2019s the only way that we can create conditions in which people\u2019s sense of security will start to improve and fear can start to recede.\nAcross my meetings with Israel\u2019s Government, the Palestinian Authority, our partners in Cairo, I heard a deep concern about the current trajectory.\u00a0 But I also heard constructive ideas for practical steps that each side can take to lower the temperature, to foster greater cooperation, to bolster people\u2019s security.\u00a0 And so I\u2019ve asked senior members of my team to stay on in the region and continue discussions on how these steps might actually be advanced.\nThese are the steps that the parties themselves must lead on, and we have no illusions that heightened tensions can be defused overnight.\u00a0 But we\u2019re prepared to support efforts here and with partners in the region if the parties have the will to do so.\u00a0 The United States is always ready and willing to be a partner in the cause of peace and security.\nOn my return home and in the coming days, I\u2019ll also continue to engage with partners in the broader region who share our serious concerns about the escalating cycle of violence and like us want to support the parties in finding a way forward.\nSo restoring calm is our immediate task, but over the longer term we have to do more than just lower tensions.\u00a0 The United States is committed to working toward our enduring goal of ensuring that the Palestinians and Israelis enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, justice, and dignity.\u00a0 And it\u2019s President Biden\u2019s firm conviction that the only way to achieve that goal is through preserving and then realizing the vision of two states for two peoples.\u00a0 The United States will continue to oppose anything that puts that goal further from reach, including but not limited to settlement expansion, legalization of illegal outposts, a move towards annexation of the West Bank, disruption to the historic status quo on Jerusalem\u2019s holy sites, demolitions and evictions, and incitement and acquiescence to violence.\nWe will also support all efforts to move us closer to peace, expand the horizon of hope, advance equal rights and opportunities for Palestinians and Israelis.\u00a0 That includes building on the efforts that we\u2019ve made over the past two years to improve the lives of the Palestinian people in concrete ways.\nWe bolstered our assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, including approximately $50 million in new funding that I announced today in Ramallah, enabling the provision of essential services like food, vaccines, education, as well as vital aid for refugees.\u00a0 That brings U.S. total funding for Palestinians over the last two years to nearly $940 million.\u00a0 We\u2019re supporting quality health care through the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, and we\u2019re making real progress toward implementing an agreement to provide a 4G network in the Palestinian territories.\nWe\u2019re also working to broaden and deepen the circle of peace between Israel and its neighbors.\u00a0 As we demonstrated earlier this month when U.S. officials joined representatives from Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates for the first meeting of the Negev Forum Working Groups.\u00a0 Again, this was the largest assemblage of officials from Arab countries and Israel since Madrid, going back many decades.\nOn crucial issues like food and water security, clean energy, regional security, our efforts are creating collaboration that will improve the lives and livelihoods of people across the region and erode longstanding biases and distrust.\nEven as we\u2019re making real strides toward expanding peace with Israel\u2019s neighbors, we continue to work together to tackle shared threats.\u00a0 This morning, Minister of Defense Gallant and I discussed ways to deepen our cooperation to confront and counter the Iranian regime\u2019s destabilizing actions in the region and beyond.\u00a0 I also met with opposition leader Lapid, who shares the same commitment to counter Iran.\nTehran\u2019s deepening ties with Moscow and the sophisticated weaponry that they\u2019re exchanging to enable one another\u2019s aggression are among the many reasons that we\u2019ve raised with Israel the importance of providing support for all of Ukraine\u2019s needs \u2013 humanitarian, economic, and security \u2013 as it defends its people against Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression.\nWe discussed a number of ways to advance the United States\u2019 and Israel\u2019s shared security interests, just as I did yesterday in my meeting with the prime minister, with President Herzog, and with Foreign Minister Cohen.\u00a0 Across these discussions, I made clear that America\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s security is unwavering, just as it has been for nearly 75 years.\nFinally, the United States will continue to deepen our bonds here with partners outside of government.\u00a0 Today I had the opportunity to spend time with Palestinian and Palestinian American civil society leaders, entrepreneurs, business owners in Deir Dibwan who shared the vital work they are doing to improve the lives of their communities.\u00a0 And I started my day by hearing from a group of young Israeli leaders, Jews and Arabs, who are doing inspiring and critical work, from advancing LGBTQ rights and the rights of people with disabilities to building trust and ties between communities.\nThese meetings were a reminder that the civil society in both of our countries plays an indispensable role \u2013 an indispensable role in defending and strengthening the rights of \u2013 and principles at the heart of a free and open society, and helping people tackle some of their most pressing challenges.\u00a0 It\u2019s a reminder of how citizens are willing to continue to engage, to hold their leaders accountable, and to keep working to create the world that they and their communities want.\u00a0 They can count on the United States in a partner in all of those endeavors.\nWith that, I\u2019m happy to take some questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Tracy Wilkinson of\u00a0The LA Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Tracy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you for taking this time, because I know you have had a couple of very busy days.\u00a0 We can all bear witness.\nYou just mentioned the deep concern over the trajectory that you saw here.\u00a0 And in your meetings both with Israeli officials and people and Palestinian officials and people, I wanted to dig a little deeper into that.\u00a0 Do you concur with or at least understand Israelis who fear that some of the new \u2013 some of the actions of their new government threaten democracy here?\u00a0 And after meeting with \u2013 with Prime Minister Netanyahu, do you believe that he can and wants to preserve democracy?\nAnd on the Palestinian side, Palestinians are increasingly disillusioned with the two-state solution.\u00a0 Many have given up on it, convinced that Israel will never let it happen, yet you continue to advocate it, as you just did a minute ago.\u00a0 After meeting with President Abbas, do you think he is the person to resolve the statehood issue, to defuse the tensions, and to fight terrorism?\u00a0 In other words, do you have confidence in him and in the Palestinian Authority?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Let me take the second part of the question first and then come to the first part.\u00a0 Look, as always, we\u2019re focused on the policies that governments, administrations pursue, not individual personalities.\u00a0 And so we\u2019re focused on what the Palestinian Authority is doing both to work to improve the lives of the Palestinian people as well as to engage responsibly with Israel on, first and foremost, defusing the current situation, the current cycle of violence; reducing tensions, not escalating them; calming things down, not ramping things up.\u00a0 That is the immediate focus.\u00a0 And I heard both from Palestinians, including President Abbas, as well as from Israelis some ideas for how that \u2013 how we can move that forward, which is why I asked some of my colleagues to stay behind to support the efforts that are being made to calm things down.\nThat\u2019s really the first order of business.\u00a0 And my hope is that if that succeeds, then we can look to both sides to take some positive steps to try to rebuild confidence, rebuild trust, and that in turn lays the foundation for at some point pursuing two states.\u00a0 But I think in this moment the most immediate challenge is, as I said, defusing the cycle of violence that has people here, first and foremost, but around the region deeply, deeply concerned.\u00a0 As I said, the President \u2013 President Biden \u2013 remains committed to and convinced of the importance of a two-state solution, but one step at a time.\u00a0 We have to focus first on making sure that Israelis and Palestinians defuse the current situation and then start to build some positive steps into their relationship.\nWith regard to the first part of the question \u2013 and I think you heard me address this yesterday \u2013 the relationship that we have with Israel is based fundamentally on shared interests and shared values, and it\u2019s been that way for 75 years.\u00a0 I spoke about some of those values yesterday, including, of course, respect for human rights, equal justice under the law, equal rights for all, the rule of law, free press, a robust civil society.\u00a0 And as I mentioned, I had an opportunity to engage with some representatives of civil society just today.\u00a0 And to be sure, Israel has a very robust civil society, and we\u2019ve seen that in recent days.\u00a0 And again, I saw that today in my own meetings.\nWith regard to the proposed reforms, there\u2019s clearly a very vibrant debate that\u2019s going on, a discussion that\u2019s going on in Israel, and these debates are a very healthy part of a vibrant democracy.\u00a0 In fact, they\u2019re unique to democracies.\u00a0 And as democracies, one of the things that we recognize is that building consensus on new proposals is the best way to make sure that not only are they embraced but that they actually endure.\u00a0 All of this, of course, is for Israelis themselves to work out, but we look forward, generally speaking, to working with Israel to advance the interests and values that have been at the heart of this relationship, as I said, for 75 years.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Gili Cohen of Kan News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary, for doing this.\u00a0 Following the legislative reform, several members of the Israeli coalition, including one minister, has said after your comments yesterday with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the Israeli prime minister doesn\u2019t need a lesson in democracy.\u00a0 I wonder what you think about such comments.\u00a0 And also, Secretary, have you received any assurance from Netanyahu about how he going to implement this plan?\nAnd another question regarding the escalation:\u00a0 Prime minister office announced after the terror attacks that they will promote steps to strengthen the settlements and even increase the number of guns held by citizens.\u00a0 Do you think that this might contribute to another escalation?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Two things.\u00a0 What I talked about yesterday and again talked about just now reflects the shared values that the United States and Israel have had and held for more than 75 years, and it is nothing more and nothing less than that.\u00a0 And I continue to be inspired by the vibrancy with which Israel shares those values, something that, again, we\u2019re seeing right now, and I think I can say the same thing about my own country, the United States.\nWith regard to the second part of your question, we have been clear and consistent in our conviction that neither side should take any unilateral actions that, right now, potentially would add fuel to a fire and, over the medium to long term, would make the prospects of achieving two states even more distant than they currently are.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Will Mauldin,\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for doing this. \u00a0I wanted to ask you, in your meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant, if any new issues or overlap came up in the issue of Iran? \u00a0Any new ideas for U.S. policy after the failure of the JCPOA talks to make headway? \u00a0And did you express support for those \u2013 their efforts to target Iran\u2019s hardware (inaudible) nuclear bombs or for cooperating with Russia militarily?\nAlso just wanted to ask you a Palestinian question. \u00a0Do you think you\u2019ve made any headway here? \u00a0You said you had some ideas that were aired. \u00a0Would you like to share any of those with the press or with the American public?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 On Iran, we have \u2013 Israel and the United States \u2013 a shared commitment.\u00a0 One, that Iran not acquire a nuclear weapon, and two, that we continue to stand together with other countries as well against the many destabilizing and dangerous actions that Iran is engaged in in the region, and now, increasingly, beyond.\u00a0 One of those actions is \u2013 that we talked about was the provision by Iran to Russia of drones, technology to be used in Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nAnd as I mentioned before and as we also discussed with our Israeli counterparts, this is a two-way street.\u00a0 Not only is Iran providing sophisticated military equipment to Russia, but Russia in turn is doing the same with Iran, which is, of course, of real concern to us and real concern to Israel.\nSo we continued what has been an ongoing discussion of ways that we can continue to work together, collaborate \u2013 and not just us \u2013 with other countries \u2013 in countering the malicious actions that Iran is engaged in, whether it\u2019s in this region or beyond.\nWith regard to what I heard on this trip, no, I\u2019m not going to detail the ideas.\u00a0 But I think there are some concrete ideas from both sides that, if pursued, would really help diffuse the current situation, and it\u2019s why I asked some of my colleagues to stay behind to support the efforts that both parties are making to try to get to a better path.\nIt is fundamentally up to them.\u00a0 They have to work together to find a path forward that, as I said, both diffuses the current cycle of violence and, I hope, also leads to positive steps that each can take to build back some trust, to build back some confidence, to help make material improvement in people\u2019s lives, to foster a greater sense of security for Israelis and Palestinians alike.\u00a0 That will take time.\u00a0 The immediate task, as I said, is to diffuse this cycle of violence.\u00a0 And if both sides are genuinely committed to it, I think there are steps that they can take and that we heard from them that would help achieve that.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We have time for a final question from Lana Kamleh.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good evening. \u00a0I\u2019m Lana Kamleh (inaudible) first let me thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak here on behalf of my colleagues in Palestine TV. \u00a0(Inaudible) from working in East Jerusalem for the third year in a row. \u00a0I would like to remind you of the phone call between President Abbas and President Biden in May 2021 and the meetings that followed highlighting the importance of halting unilateral measures such as settlement activity, killing, house demolition, and the attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque, et cetera. \u00a0What (inaudible) this government to stop such unilateral actions difficult? \u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 All I can tell you is that we have long been and remain opposed to unilateral steps by either side that, in the first instance, actually fuel tensions and lead to I think a more dangerous environment for everyone, and that fundamentally make more difficult and more distant the prospect of moving toward two states.\u00a0 So that hasn\u2019t changed.\u00a0 I repeated that in my meetings throughout my stay here, as I just did now.\u00a0 And again, we look to both sides not to take steps that actually make things worse, and as well to take some positive steps that can create a better path forward for both Israelis and Palestinians.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "President\u2019s Office", "location": "Ramallah", "date": "January 31, 2023", "content": "\n\nPRESIDENT ABBAS:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Mr. Secretary of State, Mr. Antony Blinken, gentlemen,\u00a0 we welcome you.\u00a0 And we affirm that the Israeli Government is responsible for what\u2019s happening these days, because of its practices that undermine the two-state solution and violate the signed agreements, and because of the lack of international efforts to dismantle the occupation and the settlement regimes, and the failure to recognize the Palestinian state and its full membership in the United Nations.\nThe continued opposition to the efforts of the Palestinian people to defend their existence and their legitimate rights in international forums and courts, and to provide international protection \u2013 to provide international protection for our people \u2013 is a policy that encourages the Israeli occupier to commit more crimes and violate international law.\nThis comes at a time when Israel is being overlooked without deterrence or accountability, and it continues its unilateral operations, including settlement, actual annexation of lands, settler (inaudible), storming Palestinian territory, committing crimes, house demolitions, forcible displacement of Palestinians, changing the identity of Jerusalem and violating historical status quo, and the violation of sanctity of Al Aqsa Mosque, and the seizure of funds, and accompanying operations of ethnic cleansing and apartheid.\nAfter we exhausted all means with Israel to stop its violations they\u2019ve agreed from the signed agreements and not commit to stopping its unilateral actions, we took a number of decisions which we began to implement in order to protect the interest group of our people.\nThe complete cessation of unilateral Israeli actions, which violate the signed agreements and international law, is the main entry point for returning the political horizon, ending the occupation in accordance with international preferences and the Arab Peace Initiative in order to make peace, stability, and security for all in our region and the world.\nWe have always shown commitment to the resolutions of international-led peace, renunciation of violence and terrorism, and respect for signed agreements.\u00a0 We are now ready to work with the U.S. administration and the international community to restore political dialogue in order to end the Israeli occupation of the land of the state of Palestine on the 1967 borders with Israel (inaudible) as its capital.\nOur people will not accept the continuation of the occupation forever, and the regional security will not be strengthened by violating the sanctity of the holy sites, downplaying on the dignity of the Palestinian people, and ignoring their legitimate rights to freedom, dignity, and independence.\nMr. Blinken, we welcome you and highly appreciate the efforts that you exert to bring peace, and we welcome you again.\n(In English)\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, Mr. President, thank you very much, first of all, for hosting us today and for the very productive discussion.\nLet me begin by expressing our condolences and sorrow for the innocent Palestinian civilians who\u2019ve lost their lives in escalating violence over the last year.\nPalestinians and Israelis alike are experiencing growing insecurity, growing fear in their homes, in their communities, in their places of worship.\nSo in the first instance, we believe it\u2019s important to take steps to de-escalate, to stop the violence, to reduce tensions, and to try as well to create the foundation for more positive actions going forward.\nThose are the necessary first steps, but they\u2019re also not sufficient.\u00a0 It\u2019s also important to continue to strive not only for reducing violence but ensuring that ultimately Israelis and Palestinians alike enjoy the same rights, the same opportunities.\u00a0 What we\u2019re seeing now from Palestinians is a shrinking horizon of hope, not an expanding one; and that, too, we believe needs to change.\u00a0 I also appreciate, Mr. President, your consistent and resolute stance against terrorism.\nFor our part, we have been working to strengthen our own relationship with the Palestinian people and to help to improve their lives.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing it in tangible ways, including our support to UNRWA \u2013 about $890 million for everything from food to vaccines to support for refugees, education, et cetera.\u00a0 And today I can announce that we\u2019re going to be providing an additional $50 million to UNRWA.\u00a0 When President Biden visited in July, he also committed $100 million to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network.\u00a0 We reached an agreement as well to provide 4G communications to Palestinians, and we\u2019re working to implement that.\u00a0 And the President also named Hady Amr, who is with us today, as our first representative for Palestinian affairs.\u00a0 And at the same time, we\u2019ll continue to work to reopen our consulate in Jerusalem.\nAll of these steps are part of the longer term ambition to re-establish, but then not just re-establish, rebuild our relationship, as I said, with the Palestinian people and with the Palestinian Authority.\u00a0 And this will allow us to more effectively work toward the goal of Palestinians and Israelis enjoying equal measures of democracy, of opportunity, of dignity in their lives.\u00a0 We believe that that can be achieved by a realization of two states.\u00a0 President Biden remains committed to that goal.\nMeanwhile, we oppose any action by either side that makes that goal more difficult to achieve, more distant.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been clear that this includes things like settlement expansion, the legalization of outposts, demolitions and evictions, disruptions to the historic status quo of the holy sites, and of course incitement and acquiescence to violence.\u00a0 We look to both sides to unequivocally condemn any acts of violence regardless of the victim or the perpetrator.\nSo we discussed all of these vitally important and urgent matters.\u00a0 In addition, we talked about the importance of the Palestinian Authority itself continuing to improve its governance and accountability, strengthening the institutions of the PA.\u00a0 That too will improve the lives of the Palestinian people and also lay the groundwork for a democratic Palestinian state.\nFinally, I shared with the president that I had an opportunity to meet with Palestinian and Palestinian American civil society leaders.\u00a0 They share a deep commitment to improving the lives of their fellow Palestinians.\u00a0 And we discussed ways that the United States can continue to be a strong partner for them, as well as how the Palestinian Authority can support their efforts.\nThis is a challenging time.\u00a0 I appreciate the president\u2019s determination to try to work through it in a responsible way that looks out for the lives of everyone, of Palestinians and Israelis alike.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake in this moment, and it\u2019s important that we all work together, but particularly Palestinians and Israelis work together, as I said in the first instance, to de-escalate, to reduce the tensions, and then to build from there.\u00a0 Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-meeting-with-palestinian-civil-society-representatives/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

you all.\u00a0 My friend, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, welcome to Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the state of Israel.\u00a0 I\u2019m very pleased to host a true friend of Israel.\u00a0 This is a very difficult week for us in Israel and for all of our friends and allies.\u00a0 Your presence here during this very sad week is most meaningful.\u00a0 Every visit of an American secretary of state is historic and important.\u00a0 It is significant, and we strengthen the relationship between our countries.\u00a0 Our alliance serves as one of the main pillars of our national security, defense, and foreign relations.\nThis past Shabbat, the residents of Jerusalem suffered two terrible terror attacks.\u00a0 The first took place on International Holocaust Remembrance Day outside of (inaudible) on Friday night.\u00a0 Seven Israeli civilians were murdered by a Palestinian terrorist.\u00a0 They were killed just because they are Jews.\u00a0 The very next day, a 13 year-old Palestinian terrorist filled with blind hatred, which he learned from his parents, his school, and his society, shot and wounded an Israeli father and son who were on the way home from Shabbat prayer services.\u00a0 Palestinian incitement stemming from terrorist organization and the Palestinian Authority has real and deadly implications, provoking violence and terror against innocent civilians.\u00a0 This must be stopped.\nSecretary Blinken, I would like to thank you personally for your clear message against terrorism and incitement.\u00a0 The word of support we receive from our friends in the United States strengthen us.\u00a0 We received many messages of support from leader around the world, including many Arab and Muslim countries who were shocked by these attacks and expressed their sorrow.\u00a0 It is truly heartwarming to know that Israel has so many friends around the world.\nMy friend, Antony, the Middle East has changed dramatically as a result of the signing of the Abraham Accords, which was led by the United States.\u00a0 This agreement increased regional stability and economic prosperity.\u00a0 It also created a unique opportunity in the form of a regional coalition against the Iranian threat.\u00a0 My goal is to strengthen the existing Abraham Accords and to expand relations with additional countries.\u00a0 In order to achieve this goal, we need your leadership, Secretary Blinken, and of the United States, which has been with us every step of the way in expanding peace in the region.\nI also want to thank you, Mr. Secretary, for the United States strong commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.\u00a0 Unfortunately, we are in a reality where Iran is rapidly advancing towards its goal of becoming a nuclear state.\u00a0 The international community must act quickly and effectively against Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u00a0 Its destabilizing activities in the Middle East and its finance of terror organization, including the Revolutionary Guard, which is the largest state terror organization in the world.\nA few days ago, I spoke with my counterpart in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Kuleba, and inform him that the coming weeks, the Israeli embassy in Kyiv will return to full activity.\u00a0 I also informed him on my plan to visit Kyiv,\u00a0to be the first minister from the Middle East to visit Kyiv, in the near future.\nI want to thank you, Secretary of State, for the good news that Israel received today regarding the visa waiver.\u00a0 I also would like to thank President Joe Biden and special thank you to Ambassador Tom Nides of his personal involvement in this matter.\u00a0 We will take all the necessary measures, including legislation, in order to meet the requirements by the end of this year.\nThe alliance between the U.S. and Israel is strong and unbreakable as ever.\u00a0 Even though we may have some differences of opinion on certain issue, we will always, always remain friends and we\u2019ll always be able to discuss our differences in a friendly manner and reach agreements.\u00a0 Thank you very much, dear Antony, for this important visit.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Cohen, thank you very much for those warm words, for hosting us today, for the conversations that we\u2019re about to have.\u00a0 I had a chance to speak with Eli, I think on your second day in office.\u00a0 We dove right into a conversation on a wide range of regional and global issues, and it\u2019s simply a powerful reflection of our mutual interests \u2013 our decades-long security partnership, which transcends any one administration in either Israel and the United States.\nThe closeness of that relationship grounded in a long history of shared democratic values gives us the foundation for addressing a range of challenges, which I look forward to pursuing today.\u00a0 We covered a lot of ground as well in the meeting with the prime minister a short while ago.\u00a0 I look forward to pursuing this in the hour ahead.\nBut we\u2019ll continue to work together to confront and counter the dangerous and destabilizing influence of Iran.\u00a0 As President Biden has made clear, the United States is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 Iran is a threat not only to Israel and the region, but increasingly to the world, as we\u2019ve seen recently in its provision of drones to Russia to prosecute its war of aggression in Ukraine.\nWe\u2019ll also talk about the importance of supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their nation against Russian aggression.\u00a0 The United States appreciates Israel\u2019s humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0 We welcome the foreign minister\u2019s decision to visit Kyiv.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s very welcome \u2013 the opening of the embassy \u2013 and look forward to discussing what more can be done to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in a critical time.\nWe\u2019ll also discuss the deteriorating security situation in the West Bank, the ongoing cycle of violence that has (inaudible) innocent lives.\u00a0 It\u2019s incumbent on all parties to take urgent steps to de-escalate tension, establish conditions for the security and stability that both Israelis and Palestinians deserve.\u00a0\u00a0As I discussed with both the prime minister and the foreign minister, we\u2019ll do the same with President Abbas.\u00a0 The United States stands ready to support the parties in this vital effort.\nAnother priority in our conversation and throughout my trip will be advancing integration and cooperation throughout the region.\u00a0 I look forward to discussing with the foreign minister how to build on last month\u2019s truly historic meeting in Abu Dhabi with the Negev Forum Working Groups.\u00a0 Together with our partners from Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, we came together \u2013 and more officials from those countries and Israel together in the same place than at any time since the Madrid Conference many decades ago.\nThe goal for both of us is to expand the circle of peace, and we\u2019re determined to pursue that.\nSo there is a lot of ground to be covered in what I\u2019m sure will be the first of many meetings in the weeks and months ahead, but let me also just conclude where I started today at the airport, which is to reiterate the deep condolences of the United States \u2013 its government and its people \u2013 for the seven Israelis who were murdered by a terrorist a few days.\u00a0 We stand in solidarity with all the people of Israel as they confront terrorism.\u00a0 We will do so together.\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Tony, welcome once again to Jerusalem.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:\u00a0 Your visit is another expression, a continual expression, of the unbreakable bond between Israel and the United States.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the great alliances of modern history.\u00a0 We share common interests, which are growing by the day.\u00a0 We share common values; two strong democracies which will remain, I assure you, two strong democracies.\nThis alliance is something that President Biden is committed to.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known him for 40 years.\u00a0 He\u2019s a true friend of Israel, a true champion of this alliance, as are you.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure that all of Israel know your own contribution in helping us with missile defense in times of peril.\u00a0 You\u2019ve actually helped us during one crisis in record time and then did so again; and you\u2019ve also just helped us push back on the attempts to delegitimize Israel in the United Nations.\u00a0 And we\u2019re grateful for that and for your continual friendship.\nYour visit comes at an important time.\u00a0 It\u2019s a time where many in the international community \u2013 I would say most of the international community \u2013 have seen the true face of Iran.\u00a0 They\u2019ve seen the barbarism of this regime against its own people.\u00a0 They\u2019ve seen how it exports aggression beyond its border and beyond the Middle East, and I think there is a common consensus that this regime must not acquire nuclear weapons.\nWe\u2019ve had very good discussions on forging a common policy on trying to work together to thwart the danger.\u00a0 I can repeat again something that you\u2019ve heard me say many times:\u00a0 Our policy, and my policy, is to do everything within Israel\u2019s power to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.\u00a0 And that will remain so.\u00a0 But obviously, the fact that we and the United States are working together is something that is important for this common goal as well.\nIn addition to thwarting the danger, we also see an opportunity to seize opportunities, the opportunities of expanding the circle of peace.\u00a0 We intend to deepen the peace that we\u2019ve already made in the Abraham Accords.\u00a0 We discussed some of the initiatives that we are considering doing together, but also to perhaps achieve dramatic breakthroughs that I think could be both historic and enormously significant in our common efforts to bring prosperity, security, and peace to this part of the world and to \u2013 and beyond.\nSo with this in mind, I have to tell you that I also believe that expanding the circle of peace \u2013 working to close, finally, the file of the Arab-Israeli conflict \u2013 I think would also help us achieve a workable solution with our Palestinian neighbors.\u00a0 And for all these reasons, I welcome you once again to Jerusalem.\u00a0 Welcome.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Prime Minister, thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to see you, and I want to thank you for what has been, as always, a very productive, very candid, and I think important discussion that covered a lot of issues.\nJust as I did upon arrival in Israel, I had a chance to express directly to the prime minister my condolences and that of the United States Government for the seven Israelis who were killed in the horrific terrorist attack early this week outside their synagogue.\u00a0 President Biden called the prime minister immediately after the attack to underscore the United States\u2019 steadfast support for Israel and its people, a message that I reaffirmed in the meeting we just had.\nIn the context of this attack and escalating violence, it\u2019s important that the Government and people of Israel know America\u2019s commitment to their security remains ironclad.\u00a0 That commitment is backed up by nearly 75 years of United States support.\u00a0 America\u2019s commitment has never wavered.\u00a0 It never will.\u00a0 And today the prime minister and I discussed ways that we can continue to strengthen our partnership and our shared security interests.\nWe agree that Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon, and we discussed deepening cooperation to confront and counter Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region and beyond.\u00a0 Just as Iran has long supported terrorists that attack Israelis and others, the regime is now providing drones that Russia is using to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians.\nIn turn, Russia is providing sophisticated weaponries to Iran.\u00a0 It\u2019s a two-way street.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s ongoing atrocities only underscore the importance of providing support for all of Ukraine\u2019s needs \u2013 humanitarian, economic, and security \u2013 as it bravely defends its people and its very right to exist, a topic that we also discussed today.\nNow, one of the most effective ways to make Israel more secure is to continue to build bridges in the region and even well beyond the region.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019ve worked relentlessly to deepen and broaden the Abraham Accords and other normalization agreements between Israel and Arab states.\u00a0 Earlier this month, a large delegation from across the United States Government joined representatives from Israel, from Bahrain, from Egypt, from Morocco, from the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi for the first meeting of the Negev Forum Working Groups.\u00a0 This was the largest gathering of Israel and Arab officials since the 1991 Madrid Conference.\nThese groups are focusing on issues affecting the lives and livelihoods of all of our people \u2013 food and water security, clean energy, health care, education and coexistence, tourism, regional security.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of a comprehensive effort to enable collaboration not only between our governments but also our businesses, entrepreneurs, civil societies, young people.\nThe prime minister has spoken about our ability to do big things together.\u00a0 Well, Israel\u2019s greater integration in the region is very much one of them.\u00a0 A few years ago this kind of cooperation would have been unimaginable.\u00a0 Today it is genuinely fostering new opportunities for people across the participating countries to connect, to collaborate, to learn, from teaming up on cancer research, to launching new startups in green energy and drought-resistant agriculture, to competing in real sports and e-sports.\nEach of these interactions helps chip away at enduring biases and mistrust, and this never would have happened without the leadership of the prime minister.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined to keep building on that progress, on new issues with new countries, as we work to strengthen the circle of peace.\nThese efforts are not a substitute for progress between Israelis and Palestinians, but as we advance Israel\u2019s integration, we can do so in ways that improve the daily lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.\u00a0 And that\u2019s crucial to moving toward our enduring goal of Palestinians and Israelis enjoying equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, justice, and dignity.\u00a0 President Biden remains fully committed to that goal.\nWe continue to believe that the best way to achieve it is through preserving and then realizing the vision of two states.\u00a0 As I said to the prime minister, anything that moves us away from that vision is, in our judgment, detrimental to Israel\u2019s long-term security and its long-term identity as a Jewish and democratic state.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re urging all sides now to take urgent steps to restore calm, to de-escalate.\u00a0 We want to make sure that there\u2019s an environment in which we can, I hope, at some point create the conditions where we can start to restore a sense of security for Israelis and Palestinians alike, which of course is sorely lacking.\nWe also remain committed to supporting religious coexistence and diversity, including in Jerusalem.\u00a0 We continue to support upholding the historic status quo at Jerusalem\u2019s holy places, including the Temple Mount Haram al-Sharif.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to the prime minister for his repeated expressions of support for that position.\nOne of the things that makes the partnership between us so strong is that it goes well beyond any one American or Israeli government.\u00a0 Few people understand that better than President Biden, who\u2019s worked closely with every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir, and Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has worked closely with his share of American presidents.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:\u00a0 Quite a few.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Throughout the relationship between our countries, what we come back to time and again is that it is rooted both in shared interests and in shared values.\u00a0 That includes our support for core democratic principles and institutions, including respect for human rights, the equal administration of justice for all, the equal rights of minority groups, the rule of law, free press, a robust civil society \u2013 and the vibrancy of Israel\u2019s civil society has been on full display of late.\nThe commitment of people in both our countries to make their voices heard, to defend their rights, is one of the unique strengths of our democracies.\u00a0 Another is a recognition that building consensus for new proposals is the most effective way to ensure they\u2019re embraced and that they endure.\u00a0 Our fellow democracies can also make us stronger.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the United States and Israel have done for each other over many decades, by holding ourselves to the mutual standards we\u2019ve established; and by speaking frankly and respectfully, as friends do, when we agree and when we do not.\nThe discussion that the prime minister and I had today was no exception.\u00a0 That conversation will continue, including with other members of Israel\u2019s Government and civil society, as part of a perpetual process to defend and bolster the pillars of our democracy, which we are both committed to.\nSo Mr. Prime Minister, again, thank you so much for your hospitality, for the very good conversation, and for the enduring partnership between our countries.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url":

Good evening.\nI\u2019m glad to welcome my dear friend Secretary Blinken once again in Egypt.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to receive him here at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\u00a0 We value the friendly relations between our countries and we are keen on enhancing these relations on the basis of mutual respect and interests.\u00a0\u00a0The variety of issues that have been tackled during our discussions reflected the clear rapprochement regarding our strategic interests and showed also our matching visions towards several issues, and also showed great potential to develop our strategic partnership in many fields.\nSecretary Blinken was received this morning by President Sisi, and during the meeting, they tackled the bilateral relations between the two countries, the strategic nature of these relations, and the consistency in visions of the two countries whether in regards to developing the strategic relations or international and regional issues.\u00a0 We greatly depend on the cooperation between Egypt and the United States to achieve stability in the Middle East, and to push forward the development efforts according to the principles of international legitimacy and according to the mutual interests that we\u2019re working to enhance.\nThe Middle East region took up a large part of the discussions of Secretary Blinken with the president or in our wider discussions as the Palestinian issue was discussed, and the importance of achieving stability and preventing escalation to find the right political framework to reach a permanent, comprehensive, and just solution for the Palestinian issue on the basis of the two-state solution.\u00a0\u00a0For sure, the latest developments were unfortunate and we are working on containing the situation and reaching calm bearing into consideration the interests of all parties and the stability of the region.\nOur meeting also discussed the GERD issue and the importance of continuing the joint action to preserve the interests of all three parties according to international law and legitimate rights to preserve water resources and ensure Egypt\u2019s water security.\u00a0 We also tackled the issues of Libya, and Sudan, and the importance of joint action to face all the challenges that we both work to overcome, like combating terrorism and extremism, which are considered top priorities.\nWe are working together to convene the joint economic committee this year on the occasion of 100 years of relations, and this has increasing importance in light of the current economic conditions and the pressures facing not only Egypt but also facing many other developing countries.\u00a0 We are looking forward to more U.S. investments and joint actions to face these challenges and overcome these difficulties.\nI welcome again Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to be meeting and I consider him a friend.\u00a0\u00a0Our meetings are always fruitful and help in enhancing our mutual interests, and we will keep in contact during the coming period to achieve our mutual interests.\u00a0 The floor is yours, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first of all, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 And Mr. Shoukry, Sameh, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your wonderful hospitality today, but thank you for the friendship and partnership over many, many years.\u00a0 As the minister said, we have known each other for a long time going back to the days when the minister was ambassador to Washington, and I very much value the relationship that we have that we\u2019ve built over many years.\u00a0 And I also want to express appreciation to the president for receiving us today and for the time that we were able to spend together and the very good conversation that we had.\nWe\u2019ve had an opportunity to come together many times over the last months and last couple of years, including most recently at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, COP27 of course here in Egypt, the Negev Forum and \u2013 in Washington and Cairo separately.\u00a0 And this regular engagement is a reflection of how much our countries, both of us, value the strategic partnership between us, and how important it is to the region and, indeed, to the entire world.\u00a0 Both the United States and Egypt are firmly committed to deepening that bilateral relationship.\nA key priority in that relationship is building on the longstanding economic cooperation that we\u2019ve had to the mutual benefit of Americans and Egyptians.\u00a0 Through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we are supporting a $600 million project to build an undersea telecommunications cable that will connect Singapore to France through Egypt and the Horn of Africa, delivering high-speed, reliable, secure connections for people across the continents, including Egyptians.\nEgypt has some of the best solar and wind energy potential in the world.\u00a0 We recently sent a green economy trade mission to ensure that American companies are competing in this country\u2019s renewable energy market.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to establishing and moving forward, as you heard the minister say, on the Joint Economic Commission to actually build even greater cooperation on economic and commercial issues.\u00a0 And the goal in all of this, as we discussed today, including with the president, is to produce concrete results, to produce real, new opportunities for people \u2013 jobs, livelihoods, a better future.\u00a0 That\u2019s the common objective.\nWe\u2019re also partnering very closely on the climate crisis, which is also its own opportunity to create good paying jobs for our people.\u00a0 We conveyed the appreciation for Egypt\u2019s leadership during the COP27, as well as the national commitments that it made, including a pledge to quadruple its renewable energy share through the NWFE and adopt an ambitious 2050 emissions reductions target.\u00a0 We in the United States are very proud to support these efforts, including through a new public-private partnership that aims to raise $50 million to preserve the extraordinary Red Sea coral reef.\nThe climate crisis further underscores the importance of a swift diplomatic resolution to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.\u00a0 We have heard clearly from Egyptian leadership that this is an existential concern for Egypt.\u00a0 We appreciate that fact.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to working toward a settlement that advances the interests of all parties, that supports the water security, the economic development, and the livelihood of Egyptians, and also their neighbors in Sudan and in Ethiopia.\u00a0 Like all difficult discussions, that process is best served by a spirit of flexibility and compromise from all sides, but we fully recognize and appreciate the quite literally existential issues \u2013 interests that Egypt has in water.\nThroughout its history, Egypt has spearheaded efforts to address some of the world\u2019s most complex challenges and promoted a more peaceful, a more secure, and a more prosperous region.\u00a0 It continues to play that role, and that role remains as critical \u2013 maybe even more critical than it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 Egypt\u2019s engagement in the Negev Forum is helping to accelerate cooperation between Israel and its neighbors, contributing to a more integrated and ultimately more prosperous region.\nJust a few weeks ago, we had delegations from the Government of the United States and Egypt joining those from Israel, Bahrain, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi for the first meeting of the working groups under the Negev Forum, where we\u2019re working together on some of the most important issues affecting the lives and livelihoods of people in all of our countries \u2013 food security, clean water technology, health care, regional security.\u00a0 This was the largest gathering of representatives from Arab countries in Israel since the Madrid process.\nEgypt has also consistently played a critical role in de-escalating tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, including helping to broker a ceasefire when violence escalated in 2021, and then again last year in 2022.\u00a0 Today, as we see a new and horrifying surge in violence, I discussed with President Sisi and with the foreign minister how we can work together, as always, to reduce tensions, to restore calm.\nEgypt\u2019s leadership has been critical in addressing the ongoing crisis in Libya; you heard the minister address that as well.\u00a0 Holding elections this year is the only viable path to a durable solution and to ensuring that the Libyans people \u2013 the Libyan people, excuse me, actually have the right to choose their own leaders.\u00a0 The progress on a constitutional basis for elections announced in Egypt earlier this month was an important step forward in that direction.\u00a0 Now, we stand behind the work of the United Nations special representative in forging a credible roadmap to swift and early elections in Libya.\nWe also discussed our ongoing efforts to support the Sudanese-led political process that\u2019s aimed at restoring Sudan\u2019s transition to democracy.\u00a0 Sudan\u2019s future depends on forging a government that meets its people\u2019s demand for freedom, for peace, for justice.\u00a0 And the stability that will come with that in turn will bring economic and security benefits to people across the region.\nHuman Rights was also, as it is, a top item on our agenda today, as it is with partners around the world and in our conversations with many other countries.\u00a0 The United States welcomes the important steps that Egypt has taken to protect freedom of religion, to empower women.\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of a national dialogue, the release of hundreds of detainees, the reactivating of a presidential pardons committee.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to encourage the Egyptian Government to take further actions to pursue concrete progress, including further releases of prisoners, reforms to pretrial detention, and other law enforcement practices; protecting the essential work of civil society, including journalists, human rights defenders; and making sure that all Egyptians can freely express themselves without any fear of reprisal.\u00a0 That\u2019s the message I shared when I met with leading Egyptian human rights defenders yesterday.\nMaking tangible and lasting improvements on human rights is essential to strengthening even more our bilateral relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s a priority for members of our Congress from both of our parties.\u00a0 And it\u2019s fundamentally in the interest of the Egyptian people, which is why I know the President is pursuing these efforts.\nFinally, we discussed Russia\u2019s brutal war on Ukraine.\u00a0 Egypt\u2019s votes in the United Nations to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion and reject Moscow\u2019s attempts to illegally annex parts of Ukraine have been a powerful demonstration of support for the principles that are at the heart of the United Nations Charter, to which both of our countries adhere, including the right of every nation to have its territorial integrity respected, its sovereignty respected.\u00a0 When Egypt stands up for the shared principles, countries around the world take notice.\nRussia\u2019s war, of course, is exacting severe costs on people here in Egypt, half a world away.\u00a0 Egypt is the biggest importer of wheat in the world, and up to 85 percent of its supplies have traditionally come from Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working to mitigate the damage that\u2019s been done, the economic strain that\u2019s been imposed on Egypt by supporting its long-term capacity to produce its own food, including a $50 million investment to help support smallholder farmers, which builds on the more than $1.4 billion that we provided to the Egyptian agricultural sector over recent decades.\u00a0 As well, we\u2019re addressing assistance to help try to meet the more immediate, urgent concerns, again, that have been dramatically exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\nLast year, our countries marked more than \u2013 marked, excuse me, a hundred years of bilateral relations.\u00a0 We are proud of this shared history, but ultimately it is our shared future that we\u2019re focused on and that our discussions today and everyday focus on.\u00a0 Yesterday I got a chance to meet with some young Egyptian leaders who are shaping that future in virtually every arena \u2013 from journalism to business, from medicine to high technology.\u00a0 And seeing their dynamism, their energy, their vision gives me great confidence that the future of Egypt and the future of our relationship is bright, is strong, and will carry us forward.\nWith that, I thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via translation) Minister Sameh Shoukry.\u00a0 U.S.- Egyptian relations are strategic and extend over many decades. The current economic crisis in the world is very tough, and Egypt has been affected in many areas.\u00a0\u00a0However, there is a feeling among many Egyptians that U.S. economic aid is not up to the standard of the relationship as the United States is the biggest economy.\u00a0 Did you feel during today\u2019s meetings that there will be a change in the level and amount of support?\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken pointed out the projects that will be implemented in the energy field and other types of funding.\u00a0\u00a0Would you summarize to us what has been agreed upon?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:\u00a0 (Via translation) Thank you.\u00a0 Egypt values the economic aspect of the U.S.-Egyptian relationship and the development that we have achieved during the last four decades in this regard, starting from the economic aid which was provided and which was reduced due to U.S. needs, and how Egypt responded to that.\u00a0 We are looking forward to more cooperation and contribution from the United States as it has well-known capabilities and, for sure, the projects mentioned by Mr. Secretary are very important, but they are projects limited to technical aspects.\nHowever, the crisis that we\u2019re facing, and other developing countries are currently facing as well \u2013 such as high inflation, food security and energy security pressure, and high prices \u2013 are all issues that need more cooperation within the framework of the strategic relationship, and there is a need to make use more of U.S. potential, whether through working with international financing institutions or through the bilateral relations.\nI felt that Secretary Blinken understood and appreciated these economic pressures, and there is a desire to contribute to alleviating these pressures.\u00a0 And we hope the coming meetings of the joint economic committee will help create a framework and effective mechanisms that are useful to us, and this is not just limited to the fruitful cooperation between the private sectors in both countries as Egypt host many U.S. company.\u00a0 The U.S. administration also has mechanisms regarding\u00a0the export guarantee and other U.S. resources that may relieve the burden on the Egyptian people and the Egyptian economy in this critical time.\nWe have great ambition and our partner should help us cherish this ambition within the framework of the strategic relation and mutual benefit. The stability of Egypt and its strength contribute to realizing the mutual interests of both countries and reaping benefits for both sides.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Good to see you, Mr. Secretary, again.\u00a0 Prime Minister Netanyahu, in his cabinet meeting, threatened to deport Palestinian families of perpetrators of attack against Israel and stripping them of their nationality.\u00a0 Israel has been demolishing Palestinian homes as well.\u00a0 Do you see this as a collective punishment?\u00a0 Is it a violation of international law, and will it lead to escalation?\n(In Arabic.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Okay.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, just very quickly, on the last question \u2013 because I just wanted to add very quickly to that on the economic relationship and the work we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 You\u2019re right, of course, that there\u2019s a long history here.\u00a0 Over the course of the last decades, the United States has provided about $30 billion in economic assistance to Egypt.\u00a0 But what we\u2019re focused on now is the current challenge and also the current opportunity.\nThe current challenge is this:\u00a0 Egypt, like a number of other countries, many of us, is being buffeted by an almost perfect storm of events that are having a direct and clear impact on the day-in, day-out lives of the Egyptian people.\u00a0 Global inflation is having a big impact.\u00a0 Rising food prices, energy prices \u2013 much of this exacerbated by events happening half a world away, as I mentioned.\u00a0 The Russian aggression against Ukraine has had an impact on both of those.\u00a0 The effort to rebound from COVID, disruptions to the global supply chain \u2013 so many of these things coming together in a perfect storm and having a real impact on people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 We\u2019re very conscious of that, concerned about that, and working closely together to help address that.\u00a0 I mentioned some of the ways we\u2019re working to address food insecurity.\u00a0 There\u2019s much that we\u2019re doing on energy as well.\nBut I would just highlight both the \u2013 some of the projects that I mentioned that are already underway, including the undersea cable, which is significant, but also the work of this Joint Economic Commission, which we\u2019re standing up and, as the minister and I agreed, really needs to focus on concrete, tangible things that can produce opportunity for people.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have a lot more to say about that in the weeks ahead, but it\u2019s important and it\u2019s a sign of the commitment we have to working together to strengthen our economic relationship, to provide more investment, more trade.\u00a0 I would say also that the work that Egypt is doing, including under the new IMF program in terms of the reforms that it\u2019s making, is very important for the long-term economic success of Egypt.\nWith regard to the question on Israel, I\u2019ll have a lot more to say in Israel when I\u2019m there and on the West Bank over the next day or so.\u00a0 I want to have an opportunity to hear from everyone concerned, and I\u2019ll be doing that.\u00a0 There is no question that this is a very difficult moment. We\u2019ve seen the horrific terrorist attacks in recent days.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen over many months rising violence that is affecting so many.\u00a0 As you heard very clearly, the condemnation from the United States of the terrorist attacks \u2013 the President, the Vice President, myself.\u00a0 And we deplore overall the loss of innocent civilian life.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be reiterating that message and encouraging the parties to take steps to calm things down, to de-escalate tensions.\u00a0 We, like Egypt, continue to stand behind the importance of working toward a two-state solution.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have more to say about that as well.\nAnd I would just note that throughout all of this, Egypt has played a very important role.\u00a0 As I mentioned, Cairo\u2019s efforts last year and the year before to help diffuse two crises was instrumental in successfully diffusing them.\u00a0 And Egypt, like us, is a stalwart believer in the negotiated two-state solution, the only path to a lasting resolution to the conflict and, critically, equal measures of democracy, opportunity, and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via translation) Omar from Sky News Arabia.\u00a0 A question to the Egyptian foreign minister:\u00a0 From Minister Blinken\u2019s words and what was issued yesterday by the U.S. State Department, which was an affirmation of Egypt\u2019s role in calming and stabilizing the region \u2013 so after meeting President Sisi, I mean, did a reaffirmation of this matter happen?\u00a0 Did you discuss with the U.S. side a possible Egyptian role or a partnership between Egypt and Cairo and Washington in this file?\u00a0 Can we hear in the coming days what can be described as an initiative that unites the efforts of Cairo and Washington in this context, especially since Minister Blinken will go today and tomorrow to Palestine and Israel?\u00a0 Will he carry this perception?\u00a0 Can there be a role for Egypt in this context?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:\u00a0\u00a0(Via translation) Certainly there is an extended and continuous partnership between Egypt and the United States to deal with all regional issues, especially the Palestinian cause, and to work not only to calm things down and not escalate tensions, but also to find an appropriate political path in accordance with the rules of international legitimacy and in accordance with international consensus on the need to reach a permanent and comprehensive solution through a negotiation process, a political path based on the principle of a two-state solution, Egypt\u2019s efforts, whether in cooperation with the United States and its other partners, or within the framework of its bilateral relations with all parties \u2013 whether it is the Palestinian National Authority, Israel, Jordan, the Arab countries \u2013 to always work towards achieving stability and achieving interests for all.\nThe parties coexist together to get out of this crisis and its destructive effects on the security and stability of the peoples of the entire region, and the broad prospects for resolving this crisis and a permanent solution and the establishment of the Palestinian state to completely change the map of the region or unleash its capabilities and capabilities.\u00a0 Certainly cooperation with the United States and coordination in that is necessary and important, and we do this and play supportive roles for each other, and we also formulate a vision in which there is a lot of consensus on the steps which we take considering the two parties to the conflict and any initiatives that are crystallized through consultations and agreement on the best ways to achieve our common goal.\nRegarding the question from Al Arabiya, I imagine that it is important to deal with all issues with one standard, but rather we are talking about the importance of not taking unilateral measures, not taking escalatory measures that inflame feelings and are outside the scope of international laws and legitimacy.\u00a0 It is always important that we have credibility by dealing with all measures according to a single criterion and in accordance with considerations of principles established in international law, in international covenants, and rules also related to human rights, all of which are interrelated and cannot be in isolation from each other.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (In Arabic.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, first, does the U.S. see the attack attributed to Israel on a defense factory in Isfahan as harmful or helpful to its broader goal of containing Iran?\u00a0 And second, the Biden administration has repeatedly raised with Egyptian officials the cases of political prisoners, including Alaa Abdel Fattah, Mohamed El-Baqer, and Mohammed Oxygen. Why do you think Egypt hasn\u2019t listened to the U.S. and other governments\u2019 calls to release them?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have much to say with regard to what\u2019s been reported in Iran.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen the reports and I really don\u2019t have anything to add to them at this time.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say more generally, though, that for the United States as well as for many of our partners in the region, it is very important that we continue to deal with and work against, as necessary, the various actions that Iran is engaged in throughout the region \u2013 and beyond the region \u2013 that threaten peace and security and human life.\nWe see that in the region with its support for terrorism.\u00a0 We see that for its support for destabilizing actions in a variety of countries.\u00a0 And now, of course, we\u2019re seeing that in a very different part of the world with its support for Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, with the provision of drones and potentially other military technology.\u00a0 And of course, we see what\u2019s happening on the streets of Iran as people are simply trying to stand up to be able to voice their views and are not being allowed to do so.\u00a0 So this is something that\u2019s part of the conversation that we\u2019re having across the region, including here in Egypt, as well as, of course, in Israel and with other partners.\nWith regard to human rights individual cases, I have raised in the past and again raised today individuals.\u00a0 That\u2019s important.\u00a0 So too, though, are \u2013 is progress on systemic change, and I mentioned the issue of pretrial detentions.\u00a0 I also again want to point to the fact that Egypt has taken important strides in recent years.\u00a0 I mentioned the protection of religious freedom, the empowerment of women, steps now to stand up a national dialogue, to revive the pardons committee, to also move forward with some releases.\u00a0 But the concerns that we have remain, and in the spirit of candor and the spirit of partnership that we have, we express those very clearly.\u00a0 I can\u2019t answer for you why the government does or does not do certain things.\u00a0 Those are its prerogatives.\u00a0 But we share our views, our concerns, and we look to Egypt to continue to take action.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(In Arabic.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, my friend.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-egyptian-foreign-minister-sameh-shoukry-before-their-meeting-3/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

We had good conversations at the Africa Leaders Summit in Washington. I was very much appreciative of the time we were able to spend with the president this morning. And simply, to your point, this is a vital partnership for us. Egypt has been and remains a force for peace and stability and security in a region that certainly needs even more of that. And our work together in so many different areas to advance peace and security is more important than ever, as well as the bilateral relationship itself and the work that we\u2019re doing together.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "American University in Cairo Tahir Square Campus", "location": "Cairo, Egypt", "date": "January 29, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It\u2019s really wonderful to be here in this truly historic institution that has brought Egyptians and Americans together for so many years \u2013 continues to do that, continues to build such strong bonds between our people, and especially our young people \u2013 and has been training Egyptians and Americans alike, and it\u2019s something we place great value on.\nAnd yes, this is my first \u2013 literally the first stop in Egypt over the next two or three days in Egypt.\u00a0 I\u2019m then heading to Israel, the West Bank.\u00a0 But I wanted to start here for a couple of reasons.\u00a0 So the main reason is this:\u00a0 As we\u2019re looking at the partnership between the United States and Egypt, the strategic partnership that is of great consequence to the United States, we know that going forward that partnership ultimately is going to be built and sustained and strengthened by the people here today and the people that you represent.\u00a0 Sixty percent of the population in Egypt, of course, is 25 years old or younger.\u00a0 So this is an incredibly dynamic and youthful place.\u00a0 It\u2019s important for us not just to engage government to government, as important as that is, but to engage with every sector of society, and again, especially the rising generation of Egyptians because, quite literally, you will be the ones making this country and you will be the ones who are carrying forward the relationship with the United States.\nSo that was important for me, for us to get a chance really to hear from you, I hope as much as you may hear from me.\u00a0 We want to know what\u2019s on your minds, what you\u2019re thinking about, what you\u2019re concerned about, and how you\u2019re looking at things.\u00a0 Because for me, the most important thing is this:\u00a0 Just because we\u2019ve done something one way for the last 50 years doesn\u2019t mean we need to do it the same way for the next 50 years.\nAnd for those of us in positions of responsibility, it\u2019s vitally important that we\u2019re constantly asking ourselves questions, having \u2013 hearing questions from others, and particularly thinking about new and different ways to do things \u2013 things that you\u2019re all engaged in in so many different ways, whether it\u2019s dealing with climate change \u2013 and I know we\u2019ll want to talk about that, especially coming off of COP; whether it\u2019s finding ways to build genuinely sustainable economic growth that empowers every sector of society, notably women; whether it\u2019s looking at the challenges that we\u2019re facing globally that affect Egyptians and Americans as well, from global health to the challenges of food insecurity.\u00a0 All of these things I know are front and center in your own concern and your own thinking.\u00a0 But we want to know, we want to understand how we can best partner together and also to, again, listen to\u00a0 your ideas, listen to your thoughts.\nOne of the things we established recently was a council of advisors for the ambassador \u2013 a youth council.\u00a0 But what\u2019s so important about it is \u2013 and I know some of you have participated \u2013 what\u2019s really important about it is it\u2019s not just designed to advise our team and our ambassador on so-called youth issues; it\u2019s designed to advise him and the team on every issue of concern to both of our societies, because your voices, your views, your perspectives, your ideas, your insights are by definition going to be different than the ones that we have, that people who are a little bit older like me may have, and we need to be constantly getting that input and getting that advice, getting those ideas.\nSo that\u2019s really why I wanted to start here.\u00a0 I think this is the most vital place for making sure that we are thinking together, we are working together, as Egyptians, as Americans, but also as global citizens, which our two countries have to be given the importance (inaudible).\nSo in a nutshell that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u00a0 You said we have an incredibly diverse group.\nMS AZM:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I know that.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen everyone\u2019s backgrounds and biography, and it\u2019s kind of intimidating.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll do the best we can with that.\u00a0 And I\u2019m really eager to have a conversation.\u00a0 So with that.\nMS AZM:\u00a0\u00a0Actually, this is a statement of Egyptian future.\u00a0 They represent really the Egyptian future that \u2013 of youth, 20 or 30 years ahead of us, and you will lead \u2013 be leading this country at one point.\nAt this point, I would like to ask my fellow colleagues from the press to please leave with Mr. Jacob.\u00a0 I know it\u2019s a frustration.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 This is how it is.\u00a0 Please, if you can leave now so we can resume our discussion.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-united-states-trade-representative-katherine-tai-at-a-virtual-ministerial-for-the-americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken  And United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai   At a Virtual Ministerial for the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "January 27, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0 Very good to see you all.\u00a0 Thanks so much for joining us here today.\u00a0 It\u2019s really wonderful having an opportunity to see so many friends from across our hemisphere together virtually, and we also look forward to the opportunities to get together in person.\nThere is no region that the United States is more profoundly \u2013 or personally \u2013 connected to than the Americas.\u00a0 We have a hemisphere that\u2019s forever linked by common language and geography; by incredibly close bonds of family and community; and by a shared focus on advancing democracy so that we can deliver for our people.\nWhen President Biden announced the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity at the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles last June, he did so recognizing that the countries in our region are stronger, and better prepared to seize opportunities for our people, when we work together.\nAnd I think we all recognize that our cooperation is more important than ever, as we face in our hemisphere serious challenges: from COVID-19 and its economic consequences, to high food and energy prices exacerbated by President Putin\u2019s war of aggression in Ukraine, to enduring problems like a lack of broad-based economic opportunity, corruption, chronic insecurity.\nCitizens in all of our countries across the region are looking for their governments to address these shared challenges, to deliver results, so that they\u2019re free to pursue a future that is full of opportunity and, hopefully, prosperity.\u00a0 Today, we are excited to officially launch an ambitious, high-standards initiative that will help us do just that.\nAnd let me say here: the Americas Partnership is just that \u2013 a partnership.\u00a0 Our governments have been in constant dialogue to shape the agenda.\u00a0 We\u2019re also consulting closely with civil society, with labor, environmental groups, the private sector, and we\u2019re committed to bringing historically underrepresented groups to the table as well.\nThe Americas Partnership will accelerate our shared work to strengthen supply chains and to make them more resilient to future shocks \u2013 so that the goods and products that our populations rely on are affordable and available, and workers\u2019 rights are respected in the doing.\nIt will deepen our cooperation on the clean energy transition, conservation, climate resilience \u2013 helping us share technologies and best practices and boost public and private investment \u2013 all while creating good-paying jobs.\nIt will reinvigorate and reform our regional economic institutions, like the Inter-American Development Bank, and deploy new financing tools to mobilize more investment and focus on priorities like the climate crisis, inclusive opportunity, private sector development.\nThe partnership will boost our longstanding trade and commercial ties, and work to bring the benefits of sustainable, inclusive, responsible trade to all of our people \u2013 which Ambassador Tai will speak more about in just a moment.\nFinally, it will help update what President Biden calls the \u201cbasic bargain\u201d \u2013 what our citizens expect from their governments.\u00a0 The Americas Partnership will explore how all of us can support public investments and innovations that make life better and fairer for our communities \u2013 creating opportunities for workers to earn a decent wage, for children to get a good education, for women to enter or return to the workforce.\nWe\u2019ll continue to adapt the agenda based on the needs of our populations, the changing circumstances in our region and the world, and the voices of the countries here.\u00a0 And let me emphasize that the door to this partnership will remain open, open to any country that is willing to uphold our high standards and work toward our shared goals.\nThis dialogue marshals the strength, the ingenuity, the diversity of an incredibly dynamic region.\u00a0 We\u2019re 90 percent of the Western Hemisphere\u2019s GDP; nearly two-thirds of its population.\u00a0 And as President Biden has said, there is nothing we cannot do together.\nSo we\u2019re very much looking forward to hearing from everyone today \u2013 but not just today, in the months ahead \u2013 about how we can make real our shared vision of the Americas Partnership.\u00a0 Our people are looking to us to deliver \u2013 and I\u2019m confident that, together, we can honor their trust.\nWith that said, let me turn it over to Ambassador Tai.\u00a0 Katherine.\nAMBASSADOR TAI:\u00a0 Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 And I\u2019m glad to see all of you as we advance the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.\u00a0 Thank you so much for joining us today.\nPresident Biden summed up the goal of this initiative when he announced it during the Summit of the Americas last June: to respond to basic human desires that we share for dignity, for safety, and for security.\u00a0 The traditional way of doing trade gave us cheap goods and more production.\u00a0 But at the same time, it also contributed to growing inequality, sprawling and vulnerable supply chains, and workers and communities being displaced and left behind.\nUnder the President\u2019s leadership, this administration has been writing a new story on trade, one that addresses today\u2019s pressing issues that directly impact everyday people to deliver real opportunities for workers and communities and advance our global priorities, like tackling the climate crisis and building resilient supply chains.\nThe Americas Partnership is a part of our pursuit of a worker-centered trade policy.\u00a0 It will be a new type of economic arrangement anchored on cooperation to build our economies from the bottom up and from the middle out.\u00a0 This will be a historic agreement with one of the most dynamic, economic regions in the world.\u00a0 The Western Hemisphere accounts for almost 32\u00a0percent of global GDP, and the United States\u2019 ties with the region are broad and deep.\nWe have some of our most longstanding trade agreements in this region, like our agreements with Chile, Colombia, and Peru.\u00a0 We also have some of our newest, like the renegotiated U.S.\u2011Mexico-Canada agreement and the Protocol on Trade Rules and Transparency with Ecuador.\u00a0 We are committed to working with our partners to fully implement these existing agreements.\u00a0 And at the same time, we recognize that we need new tools to address new problems that will shape the coming decades to better integrate our economies, reinforce our regional ties, and ensure that the benefits of trade are shared by all our citizens.\u00a0 And that is exactly what we intend to do through the partnership.\nI am very pleased with the joint declaration we\u2019re releasing today.\u00a0 It\u2019s ambitious and reflects our shared priorities, and that includes empowering our workers and eradicating forced labor, strengthening our supply chains to be more resilient against unexpected shocks, growing our economies, fostering innovation in both the public and private sectors, and tackling the climate crisis by growing climate-related industries and creating good-paying jobs throughout our region.\nThis is truly a partnership, as Secretary Blinken said, not only among the governments represented here but also with our relevant stakeholders, including civil society, labor, the private sector, and our Congress.\nIn my role as the U.S. Trade Representative, I\u2019ve made it a priority to meet with manufacturers, farmers, producers, and fishers as much as I can to hear directly from them and to incorporate their priorities in our policies.\u00a0 The same principle applies to this initiative.\u00a0 The Americas Partnership will be a tool to bring more voices to the table, to ensure that people who have been traditionally left out of the conversation, like women, women entrepreneurs, indigenous peoples, and other underrepresented groups, can help shape this new chapter in our collective story on trade.\u00a0 Our approach with this partnership will reflect these values to make a future that is more resilient, more sustainable, and more inclusive, and to create new opportunities for all our communities.\nI look forward to working with Secretary Blinken and all of you as we begin this exciting opportunity.\u00a0 Thank you again for coming along with us, and I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Katherine, thank you very much.\u00a0 And to all our colleagues, again, it\u2019s wonderful to have everyone with us today.\n[Ministers from participating countries make remarks.]\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Madam Minister, thank you very, very much, and\u00a0gracias a todas y a todos.\u00a0 We\u2019re really delighted to have everyone together today.\u00a0 Let me just say in conclusion how much we appreciate the insights that we\u2019ve heard, and especially the partnership that we share in this initiative.\nWith the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, we\u2019re sending a strong message that we intend to respond to the challenges as well as the opportunities of our time alongside our partners.\nThat focus on partnerships is why we created the Americas Health Corps, the Cities Forward Initiative, the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis, and other regional initiatives.\nIt\u2019s not just about responding to the challenges, but also about an affirmative vision for the future.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s imbedded in the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.\u00a0 What we do together in our region will have global effects, and I think and hope that it can actually help shape a global race to the top, not to the bottom.\nSo simply put, we look very much forward to working everyone in the months ahead \u2013 including in April at the Cities Summit of the Americas.\nWith that, Katherine, I\u2019ll leave it to you to close out.\nAMBASSADOR TAI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken, Tony.\u00a0 I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all my fellow ministers for all of your thoughtful insights today.\u00a0 And as I\u2019m looking around at the screens, it occurs to me that I have had a chance to see almost all of you in person recently, if not in the past couple of weeks, in the past couple months, whether in the context of U.S.-Mexico-Canada, APEC, the WTO, the WTO mini-ministerials.\nAnd I want to express how truly delighted I am and excited I am to have the opportunity to work with all of you in this grouping on a hemispheric project.\u00a0 I\u2019m confident that together we can build a fair and equitable tomorrow for our citizens and bring lasting change, and I\u2019m grateful to have all of you as partners as we begin this endeavor with the Americas Partnership.\nWhen he addressed the United Nations General Assembly, President Biden said that the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to people\u2019s lives \u2013 all people\u2019s lives \u2013 and trade is a critical part of this relentless diplomacy.\u00a0 All of us are here to drive sustainable and inclusive economic growth for our people.\nWe share this goal because we know that our well-being and economic security are inextricably linked.\u00a0 We all know the challenges we face.\u00a0 Many of our economies are still recovering from the COVID pandemic, as many of you have commented, as well as global inflation, which has been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which is straining families\u2019 budgets.\nTo advance our vision for a human-centric approach to trade, all 12 of our economies must be in this together to deepen our economic cooperation, strengthen our collective resilience, and advance \u2013 as many of you noted \u2013 democracy and a shared prosperity.\u00a0 We have a lot of work ahead of us: strengthening our supply chains, lifting up our small businesses, creating green jobs, reinvigorating our financial institutions.\u00a0 These are all priorities that we will focus on as we begin to fill in the details.\nSo let\u2019s come together and demonstrate that we can use trade as a force for good, and that we can use this partnership as a new model for others in our region to join.\nThank you again, and I look forward to working with all of you in the months ahead.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Tony.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Gracias.\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\n\n"}, {"url":

Thank you, Katie, for the introduction, and for so much more.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be \u2013 have more to say about that later.\u00a0 I want to welcome my old friend back \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0That\u2019s right.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 to the Institute of Politics.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you remember, Mr. Secretary, when I called you in the winter of 2016 to talk to you about this.\u00a0 I distinctly remember, but I may be representing this, that I said:\u00a0 I think this job will be a stepping stone to secretary of state \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 being a fellow at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0It was a stepping stone to employment after the Obama administration, so I\u2019m grateful for that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0(Laughter.)\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 But before we get to the weightier issues at hand, because of this occasion, what did that fellowship mean to you?\u00a0 What did you take away from it?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first, I took away that this is just an extraordinary community.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had some chance to spend time on university and college campuses over the years, and I think it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve never been more impressed with a group of students that I had the opportunity to spend some time with back in 2017 \u2013 just extraordinary.\u00a0 So it\u2019s good to be with all of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0You guys can applaud for yourselves, it\u2019s okay.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Although I have to say it was also just a little bit intimidating, because I asked myself at that age \u2013 and it\u2019s not \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 not a good \u2013 not a good answer.\u00a0 But also \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0You were playing rock and roll, I think.\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, or trying to, anyway.\u00a0 But what I so admire about what you\u2019ve done, Ax, and the entire team here, is help build a remarkable community, a community that\u2019s giving back in a big way.\u00a0 The numbers I saw said that you\u2019ve managed over the years to place 26-, 2700 people into internships in public service.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what we need, so I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Good, because we\u2019re going to talk to you about some State Department internships after this.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Oh, good.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We now have paid internships for the first time in history, so \u2013 (applause).\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0I call that a cheap applause line.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Actually, a costly applause line.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0This isn\u2019t just the anniversary of the founding of the Institute of Politics, but it\u2019s also the two-year anniversary of the Biden administration.\u00a0 Talk to me about these two years from your perspective as Secretary of State.\u00a0 What has gone well?\u00a0 What are you proudest of?\u00a0 What are the things where you look back and say, gee, I wish we had done that a little bit better, or differently, I should say?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So I think two years in, what it\u2019s safe to say from my perspective, at least, is that we\u2019re in a better place in the world than we were.\u00a0 The first instruction that I got from President Biden on taking the job was:\u00a0 Get out there, re-energize, rejuvenate, re-engage our alliances, our partnerships, our work in international organizations.\u00a0 And the reason he was so determined that we do that is that, if you\u2019re looking around at all of the issues that are actually having an impact on the lives of pretty much everyone in this room \u2013 whether it\u2019s the impact of a global pandemic; whether it\u2019s climate change; whether it\u2019s the effect that all of these new technologies are having on our lives, the stuff that we carry in our pockets every single day; whether it\u2019s drugs, the fentanyl crisis \u2013 we can\u2019t deal effectively with a single one of these issues unless we\u2019re actually finding ways to cooperate and coordinate and work with other countries.\nWe\u2019re \u2013 on climate change we\u2019re 15 percent or so of global emissions.\u00a0 If we do everything right at home, we\u2019ve still got to bring along the other 85 percent.\u00a0 COVID, which we all know all too well, we can do everything right at home \u2013 if there\u2019s another variant circulating out there somewhere, it could still come back and bite us.\u00a0 I could go down the list.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve done that, and in ways big and small, rolling up our sleeves every single day, we\u2019re re-engaged.\nThe other thing he said was this:\u00a0 We have to be out there not only to cooperate and coordinate with other countries \u2013 we have to be out there and at the table.\u00a0 Because when we\u2019re not, when America\u2019s disengaged, one of two things happens.\u00a0 Either someone else tries to take our place, and probably not in a way that advances our own interests and values, or maybe just as bad, no one does, and we know the world doesn\u2019t organize itself, and in the absence of anyone taking on that role you tend to have a vacuum that may be filled by bad things before it\u2019s filled by good things.\nSo the bottom line is this:\u00a0 We are re-engaged, we\u2019re out there, we\u2019re leading again, and we\u2019re doing it with other countries in ways that are building coalitions to tackle these problems.\u00a0 Now, there are a huge number of disruptors out there, and we have to find ways to effectively address them.\u00a0 We have geopolitical disruptors in the form of great power competition that\u2019s emerged again, particularly with Russia and with China in different ways, and we have these transnational disruptors, the ones we\u2019ve just referenced, that are having a big impact on people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 But we\u2019re in a better place to address them.\nLast thing is this.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been really smart about something else.\u00a0 Our strength at home is directly tied to our standing around the world.\u00a0 When we\u2019re making smart investments in ourselves \u2013 as we did with infrastructure; as we did with the CHIPS Act to make sure that we remain the leader in making semiconductors here in the United States; as we did with the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which is the biggest single investment made to deal with climate change in the history of this country \u2013 when we\u2019re making those investments at home, it\u2019s actually having an impact on our standing around the world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got partners, countries coming up to us and saying:\u00a0 We see what you\u2019re doing to make yourselves stronger at home.\u00a0 We want to work with you; we want to partner with you.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I want to ask you about two aspects of that.\u00a0 One is what \u2013 there\u2019s such a gap between the \u2013 your description of the meaning of foreign policy and public perceptions of it.\u00a0 I just saw a list of issues that people thought were most important, and I think \u2013 foreign policy was on it, and I think it was dead last among all the issues.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 You ask people how much money \u2013 when you ask about waste in a focus group, they say, \u201cWell, there\u2019s all that foreign aid.\u201d\u00a0 Well, how much do you think it is?\u00a0 \u201cTwenty-five percent of the budget.\u201d\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s less than one.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 So how do you engage \u2013 I mean, you just made the case, but doesn\u2019t there need to be sort of an active effort to engage the American people?\u00a0 Because we\u2019re living in an age in which people are feeling very much inward \u2013 so how do you sell foreign policy in an environment like this, and isn\u2019t that important?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to do a better job in connecting the dots.\u00a0 One of the reasons that I wanted to be here today was to do that.\u00a0 One of the reasons that the President asked me to speak to the Conference of Mayors in Washington just a couple of days ago was to do that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 One example, among others.\u00a0 The number one killer of Americans between the age of 18 and 49: fentanyl.\u00a0 Last year we lost more than 100,000 Americans to drug overdoses; 70 percent of those were from synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\u00a0 Well, there\u2019s a lot that we can do and we are doing to try to reduce demand here.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot that we are doing and can do to try to disrupt the criminal organizations that are responsible for that.\nBut here\u2019s the way it works.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got chemicals that are produced halfway around the world, mostly in China right now \u2013 perfectly legal.\u00a0 They are then sent somewhere else, maybe to Mexico.\u00a0 They\u2019re diverted to a criminal organization.\u00a0 It then uses those chemicals to make a synthetic opioid.\u00a0 You get pill presses that put them together.\u00a0 They get sent over the border one way or another.\u00a0 And you can make hundreds of thousands of pills in a room the size of this stage.\u00a0 Last year in the United States we seized \u2013 we seized \u2013 because keep in mind what we seize does not reflect what\u2019s out there; we don\u2019t even know exactly what\u2019s out there \u2013 we seized enough fentanyl in this country to kill every single American.\nSo how do you connect the dots?\u00a0 Well, one of the things that we\u2019re doing is trying to organize other countries to make sure that at least when perfectly legal chemicals are being shipped, people know who they\u2019re shipping them to; that we\u2019re sharing information to make sure that if front companies get set up, they\u2019re identified; that things are labeled properly; that you know your customer.\u00a0 And that\u2019s one of the ways our foreign policy \u2013 because it requires working with China, it requires working with India, it requires working with Mexico, and more and more countries that are being affected \u2013 that\u2019s just one example of how what we\u2019re doing around the world has a direct impact on people \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Let me come at this from a different perspective, which is the perspective of the world.\u00a0 I mean, one thing that\u2019s clear when you talk to leaders from around the world or diplomats from around the world, as you do on a daily basis, is how much the American example and American actions mean to particularly other democracies.\u00a0 And the thing you hear is:\u00a0 Yeah, we trust Biden and we think things have \u2013 we appreciate the agreement and the outreach and so on, but how do we know that that\u2019s going to be the case two years from now, or even six years from now?\u00a0 And they watch what happened on January 6th.\u00a0 They watched \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 They watch other sort of elements of our democracy that are less attractive and less reassuring.\u00a0 And they say:\u00a0 Can we count on the country?\u00a0 I mean, you must hear that all the time.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0You get some of that.\u00a0 Look, the President said it himself \u2013 I think pretty early on he was talking to one of his counterparts who said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad America\u2019s back,\u201d and then he said, \u201cbut for how long?\u201d\u00a0 So sure, you hear that, and I can say two things.\u00a0 First, we have to deal with the here and now, what we can do in this moment, in the time that we have.\u00a0 And my premise is this:\u00a0 If we demonstrate by the policies we pursue and the way we pursue them that we\u2019re actually delivering results, that we\u2019re actually getting things done, that we\u2019re actually making life a little bit safer, a little bit more secure, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more healthy for our fellow citizens, then hopefully they\u2019ll continue to support that approach.\u00a0 And I say the same things to colleagues around the world who are looking at how they\u2019re going to work with us.\nSecond, there\u2019s something incredibly powerful about our own recent history, which I\u2019ve shared with others in conversation.\u00a0 One of the things that we still do as a country and that sets us apart is when we have problems here at home, we still deal with them openly, transparently.\u00a0 We don\u2019t try to sweep them under the rug, pretend they don\u2019t exist no matter how painful it is, no matter how ugly it is.\u00a0 And that\u2019s actually a very powerful example, because when we\u2019re asking other countries to do the same thing we can actually say:\u00a0 We\u2019re doing it.\u00a0 You need, we hope, to confront your own problems; we\u2019re actually demonstrating that you can do that and do it in an open and transparent way.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 You talked about alliances.\u00a0 Obviously the place where it has been most dramatically reflected is in Ukraine, a situation that you couldn\u2019t have foreseen when you became Secretary of State.\u00a0 The question comes up \u2013 and the failure just in the last 24 hours to come to an agreement on whether tanks, the German tanks, can be shared with the Ukrainians \u2013 the question comes up:\u00a0 How much time do you have there before the coalition frays?\u00a0 Putin is obviously playing a waiting game, and the Russians have great tolerance for suffering and he seems intent to try and wait this out.\u00a0 What are you telling the Ukrainians and what is your sense of where this goes and how quickly it has to move before this thing kind of frays?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 First I\u2019d say that from almost day one, we\u2019ve seen a lot of premature reports of the demise of the coalition.\u00a0 And on the contrary, not only has it held together, it\u2019s grown consistently stronger.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll come to the specific issue you raised.\u00a0 But time and again we\u2019ve seen dozens of countries come together to try to make sure that Ukraine is getting what it needs when it needs it to defend itself, to push back against the Russian aggression, to take back the land that was seized, the humanitarian support, the economic support.\u00a0 We just did another so-called drawdown of military equipment for Ukraine, more than $2.5 billion.\u00a0 We\u2019re up to almost $30 billion in military support, about $60 billion in total support.\u00a0 The Europeans have done much the same.\nBut what I\u2019m finding is this:\u00a0 The center is very much holding, in two ways.\u00a0 Just before Christmas I had a chance to speak to the entire Senate \u2013 and something that your successor, Senator Heitkamp, knows so well \u2013 and I found talking to Republicans and Democrats alike in both the Senate and then the House that the center is still very, very much there.\u00a0 Similarly, if you go around the European countries \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 The House, by the way, a little less so.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 No, but even so.\u00a0 I had a chance to spend some time with the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mike McCaul \u2013 very strong supporter of the efforts in Ukraine.\u00a0 So I think the center is very much holding, and in Europe as well.\nNow, on the weapons, let me say this:\u00a0 Every step along the way, starting from before the Russian aggression, we tried to make sure the Ukrainians had in their hands what they needed, what they could use to effectively push back against any Russian aggression.\u00a0 Before the war started, we saw the storm clouds.\u00a0 We tried to warn the world.\u00a0 We tried to prevent it.\u00a0 But even as we were doing that, we tried to make sure the Ukrainians were prepared.\u00a0 We did drawdowns of our equipment \u2013 Stingers and Javelins \u2013 going back to Labor Day a year ago and then again before Christmas.\u00a0 So they had in their hands what they needed when the Russians went to Kyiv, and they were able to repel it.\nAll along the way, we\u2019ve tried to make sure that as the war moved, as the Russians shifted what they were doing and where they were doing it, the Ukrainians had what they needed.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve seen a succession of different weapons systems go to the Ukrainians.\u00a0 There are \u2013 the discussions that we have with allies and partners, and including ourselves, is not only what weapons do they need but they need to be trained on them, so we\u2019ve got to do that; they need to be able to maintain them; and they\u2019ve got to be able to use them effectively.\u00a0 All of that goes into these decisions.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So it\u2019s an ongoing process.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 But everybody seems to agree \u2013 all the military, including our own, leaders seem to agree that they need tanks now.\u00a0 The British just sent them.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t get them out of this meeting yesterday.\u00a0 How does this get resolved?\u00a0 Because this seems to be essential to the spring fighting that everybody predicts is going to happen.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We just sent Ukraine a large number of Bradley Fighting Vehicles, which are basically light tanks.\u00a0 The French have done some \u2013 done the same.\u00a0 The British have actually sent them combat tanks.\u00a0 Others are looking to do that.\u00a0 This is a \u2013 it\u2019s an ongoing process that we\u2019ll continue to work.\u00a0 But again, we have to make sure that for each system we send \u2013 and these are sovereign decisions for each country to make \u2013 different countries have contributed different things at different times, but all told what it adds up to is a Ukrainian fighting force that first of all starts with the courage and resilience of the fighting force and Ukrainian people, but because of what we\u2019ve been able to provide them has done as well as it\u2019s done.\nAnd on the Russians, let me just say this to the first part of your question:\u00a0 This is not a static thing.\u00a0 You say Putin is going to try to wait them out.\u00a0 He\u2019s not waiting them out in a situation where every single day he\u2019s not doing extraordinary damage that he\u2019s inflicting on his own people and his own military.\u00a0 That military has suffered horrific losses and continues to do so every single day.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the sanctions, the export controls that we\u2019ve imposed on Russia are dramatically, dramatically undercutting its ability over time not only to continue the war, but to advance Russia\u2019s economy, to allow it to pursue energy extraction.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to have an increasingly profound and heavy effect on Russia going forward.\nI wish that wasn\u2019t the case.\u00a0 This is a tragedy brought about by Putin.\u00a0 The question that one would really love to ask the Russians, if we could speak more directly and clearly to them, is:\u00a0 How is what Putin is doing in Ukraine \u2013 how has that changed your life for the better?\u00a0 How has it done a single thing that makes you better off?\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 He \u2013 in addition to the price that Russia is paying, he\u2019s inflicting a tremendous amount of heartache and damage on Ukraine.\u00a0 And it seems like with each assault and each attack, from a political standpoint, it makes it harder for President Zelenskyy to reach any sort of negotiated settlement other than the exit of Russia from the country.\u00a0 And one also wonders what Russian-held ground would be like given the hostility that people feel for them.\u00a0 But where do you think this ends?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, fundamentally this has to be a decision for Ukraine to make.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah, I knew you would say that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 But I mean, I\u2019m just \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I probably should kick myself for asking.\u00a0 But I mean, General Milley said he thought the fighting would go \u2013 would go on, that it ultimately would be a negotiation \u2013 it would have to be, that every war ends with a negotiation.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Right.\n\nAXELROD:\u00a0But it seems like it gets harder and harder, given how much destruction is being inflicted on the Ukrainians.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, it does, and of course Zelenskyy has to be responsive to public opinion.\u00a0 He is a democratically elected president; he has to represent the Ukrainian people.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0What\u2019s your sense of him, by the way?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Oh, he\u2019s extraordinary.\u00a0 I got to know him a bit before the Russian aggression.\u00a0 I was over in Ukraine several times before the Russians went in, spent time with him.\u00a0 In fact, when we had the intelligence that we shared with the world about what Russia was planning, one of my responsibilities at the President\u2019s request was to go see President Zelenskyy and share with him what we had, basically to tell him, \u201cWe think your country\u2019s going to be attacked,\u201d which was a pretty sobering moment.\u00a0 But \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Publicly he was he was pushing back on that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, there\u2019s a reason for that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0He didn\u2019t want people to flee.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0He didn\u2019t want people to flee, he didn\u2019t want investment to flee, because he was afraid that the more the possibility of conflict was talked up, the more his economy would be talked down.\u00a0 I understand that.\u00a0 But meanwhile, he was making the preparations that were necessary, and you saw that in what the Ukrainians were able to do, with our assistance, in repelling the attack against Kyiv.\u00a0 And by the way, Putin has already lost in terms of what he was trying to accomplish.\u00a0 What he was trying to accomplish was to erase Ukraine\u2019s identity.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Topple him and \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And \u2013 topple him, erase Ukraine as an independent country, subsume it into Russia.\u00a0 That has failed; that can\u2019t succeed.\u00a0 Now, where this settles is a profound question, and what damage is done in between now and then, we don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I was at \u2013 just earlier today in Chicago, I was in \u2013 at Ukraine Village and went to the modern art museum.\u00a0 They have an exhibit now on \u2013 of drawings, paintings by the children of war, by young Ukrainian children.\u00a0 And it shows their experience of the war through these drawings and paintings, and these are kids from \u2013 I don\u2019t know, age 2, 3 up to 10, 11, 12, teenagers.\nAnd this gets to another really important point.\u00a0 You walk in, you look at this, and I think the first reaction you have, if you have children, is:\u00a0 These could be my kids.\u00a0 What if this was my kid?\nAnd what Putin is trying to do with the daily assault is to anesthetize all of us, to normalize this, for people to basically say, \u201cOkay, this is happening,\u201d and we just accept it as somehow normal, acceptable.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we really have to avoid.\u00a0 We have to make sure that we collectively continue to make clear that no, this is not normal, this is not acceptable.\u00a0 And if we allow this to go forward with impunity in Ukraine, then we open a Pandora\u2019s box where would-be aggressors around the world will say:\u00a0 Hmm, I can get away with it, I can get go ahead, seize another country\u2019s territory by force, erase its borders, kill its people destroy its infrastructure, and nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 That\u2019s why this is important and is bigger than Ukraine itself.\u00a0 It goes beyond that, and it\u2019s why we have to stick with it.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0You were asked recently about what the greatest global challenge was, and it wasn\u2019t from Russia, it was from China.\u00a0 You\u2019re headed there in a few weeks.\u00a0 The President saw President Xi in Bali.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s right.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Talk about China, where \u2013 the China that you\u2019re going to visit right now, not necessarily the same China from a year ago before the COVID debacle, before their economy was ground to a halt.\u00a0 What are you hoping to accomplish there?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So the President and President Xi had a very good, constructive, long conversation in Bali on the margins of this G20 meeting toward the end of last year, and I think the most important thing in the immediate for us is this:\u00a0 This is the most consequential and complex relationship of any that we have in the world.\u00a0 And by the way, the same is true \u2013 I think many other countries could say the same about the relationship with China.\u00a0 We\u2019re in a competition.\u00a0 We have, I think, a moment in time, which we can also talk about, where we\u2019re no longer in the post-Cold War era.\u00a0 There\u2019s a competition on to shape what comes next.\nChina is a leading competitor, and in many ways, the vision that they have for what the world should be and where it should go is not the same as the one we have.\u00a0 But competition is one thing, conflict is another, and it\u2019s strongly in our interest to make sure that even as we compete very, very vigorously, we avoid competition veering into conflict.\u00a0 One of the ways you do that is making sure that you actually have good lines of communication, that you\u2019re talking, that you\u2019re engaging, that you\u2019re putting some guardrails on the relationship, that you\u2019re putting a floor underneath it.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the President and President Xi were doing in Bali.\u00a0 That\u2019s the conversation they asked me to continue.\nSo that\u2019s a big part of what we\u2019re going to try to do.\u00a0 The other thing is this.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Well, that question can be very much shaped by issues like Taiwan \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s right.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 and China\u2019s posture toward Taiwan.\u00a0 We saw what happened in Hong Kong.\u00a0 Do you think that you have a deeper understanding of their intentions, and do they have a deeper understanding of what the U.S.\u2019s reaction would be to that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think \u2013 I think they do, especially from the last conversation between the presidents.\u00a0 And again, that\u2019s something that I think it\u2019s important to continue to pursue.\nLook, two things.\u00a0 On Taiwan, what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years is, I think, China make a decision that it was no longer comfortable with the status quo, a status quo that had prevailed for decades, that had actually been successful in terms of the relationship between our countries in managing what is a difficult situation.\u00a0 But they\u2019d made a decision that that status quo was no longer acceptable, and we\u2019ve seen them over the last few years \u2013 not the last few months, the last few years \u2013 ratchet up the pressure on Taiwan \u2013 military pressure, economic pressure, trying to cut off its ties to countries around the world, to international organizations.\u00a0 And from our perspective, that status quo has worked and it\u2019s vital to what\u2019s important to us, which is maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\nWhat we\u2019ve said to China is this.\u00a0 They say this is a sovereign issue for us; our response is this is an interest to the United States and to countries around the world.\u00a0 Because if peace and stability is disrupted across the strait, if something happens as a result of the actions you take, 50 percent of every container ship that is moving around the world every day goes through the Taiwan Strait; 70 percent or more of the computer chips manufactured in the world at the higher ends are manufactured on Taiwan.\u00a0 If that gets disrupted, the entire world economy will suffer.\u00a0 Every country in the world has an interest in making sure that peace and stability remains in the strait and that differences are resolved peacefully, not through pressure, not through coercion, and certainly not through the use of force.\u00a0 So it\u2019s very important that they understand that even as we listen to their concerns.\nOn COVID, it\u2019s also profoundly in our interest that China succeed in dealing with COVID.\u00a0 First, we do not want to see people suffering anywhere from the disease.\u00a0 Second, for its own \u2013 for the sake of its own economy, and as a result, for the sake of economies around the world, it\u2019s important that they be able to recover and recover successfully.\u00a0 And third, if COVID is out of control anywhere, as I said earlier, you may get new variants.\u00a0 Those variants are going to travel around the world.\u00a0 They may come back here and we may find ourselves in trouble again.\u00a0 So it\u2019s both the right thing on a human, moral level and the smart thing to want to make sure that they succeed.\u00a0 We can\u2019t make those decisions for them.\u00a0 I hope that they do.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 And you feel that the temperature has been lowered to some degree?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I think so, because again, when you\u2019re talking and engaging, it tends to have that effect.\u00a0 There\u2019s something else that\u2019s going on.\u00a0 One of the things that I\u2019m hearing around the world \u2013 and I think the Chinese are hearing the same thing \u2013 is there\u2019s a demand signal.\u00a0 The rest of the world expects us to manage this relationship responsibly.\u00a0 They know that the way we manage it\u2019s actually going to affect them too.\u00a0 They know that if we\u2019re not finding ways and areas where we can, where it\u2019s in our interest to cooperate, they will lose out on some of the benefits.\u00a0 We need, for example, to see China play a leadership role in dealing with climate change.\u00a0 We need to see them play a leadership role in dealing with global health, along with us and other countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s in our interest to do so, but also that\u2019s what other countries are saying to us.\u00a0 So we\u2019re trying to be responsive to that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see if Beijing can do the same thing.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 You mentioned the world in which we live today.\u00a0 I think about the young Tony Blinken \u2013 younger Tony Blinken \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 who walked into the White House National Security Council as a junior aide years ago in the Clinton administration, and that was right after the Berlin Wall had fallen, the Soviet Union had collapsed, the U.S. was sort of a colossus astride the world \u2013 a unipower, as it were; superpower \u2013 and trade and globalization were seen as ways to lift economies around the world, and also as tools of diplomacy.\u00a0 We\u2019re \u2013 it seems like we\u2019re in a much different place.\u00a0 There was the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the administration in which you were the deputy secretary of state was going to be a way of creating an alliance of nations as a hedge against Chinese economic aggression, and that failed, and you don\u2019t hear much about trade anymore.\u00a0 Globalization \u2013 we just had this Davos, the annual thing, Davos, which feels very much now like sort of Disneyland for the elites.\u00a0 It\u2019s sort of like still fun to go but it\u2019s a little dated.\nSo talk about how the world has changed and what that means for the U.S.\u00a0 What is the challenge in this new world that we find?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So I guess I\u2019d say two things.\u00a0 First, let\u2019s not be too hard on ourselves in terms of that moment in time and what we thought about it, because we got a lot of the big things right even as we got a lot of small things wrong.\u00a0 We managed to get through the Cold War without getting another world war.\u00a0 We managed to see the world lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty during that period.\u00a0 All of that was good.\u00a0 And if you actually did a freeze frame before COVID hit, in the aggregate, even \u2013 so even as recently as three years ago, in the aggregate, I think it\u2019s fair to say the world was actually safer, more prosperous, healthier than it had been probably at any time in human history.\u00a0 This is kind of the Steven Pinker view of the world, but I think a lot of that is borne out.\nBut what we collectively, I think, missed were a few things.\u00a0 One is we missed that even as inequities between nations were actually shrinking, they were growing within them, and that\u2019s had profound effects.\u00a0 And we see that play out here.\u00a0 We see that play out around the world.\u00a0 I think we had a faith that economic integration was going to bring other countries into much more positive relations with every other country.\u00a0 That hasn\u2019t borne itself out.\u00a0 We thought that economic liberalization would lead to political liberalization.\u00a0 That \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Well, I mean, I think these things are connected, right, because that \u2013 the great economic polarization that we saw, winners and losers as a result of trade, as a result of globalization, created a backlash.\u00a0 And we see it in populist movements around the world, including the U.S.\u00a0 We saw it in Brexit.\u00a0 We saw it \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it in a lot of different places.\nWhat do we do about that?\u00a0 What do we do to give people a sense that they actually have a stake in the economic systems of our countries and that it\u2019s not just the global elite that are benefiting from them?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, in the first instance, I come back to what I started with a few minutes ago, which is to say it starts at home and it starts with making smart investments in ourselves, investments that are actually going to deliver better results and better lives and livelihoods for our own people.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been making those investments and I think they\u2019re going to start to pay out in the next few years.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah, it also starts with a recognition that there were people and regions \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Oh, absolutely.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 \u2014 that were losers in this deal.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 Which is one of the reasons, for example, we want to make sure we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the incredibly positive power for many years of the internet, but of course if it\u2019s not widely shared that positive power is not going to be there for everyone.\u00a0 So rural connectivity has been a huge piece of this.\u00a0 And of course we also know the downsides of connectivity for everyone that we also have to grapple with.\u00a0 I guess \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 There is enough connectivity that it has helped fuel some of these populist movements.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 So we have \u2013 that\u2019s a whole other subject.\u00a0 But I think you\u2019re exactly right.\u00a0 There has to be and I think there has been an awakening to the fact that in different ways too many people have been left out, left behind.\u00a0 But also, look, I think there are a lot of profound things that have happened.\nThis is \u2013 the President talks about this as an inflection point in world history that comes along every six or seven generations \u2013 not every decade but six or seven generations.\u00a0 And so much has been said and written about this, but one of the things I feel profoundly \u2013 you asked me what\u2019s changed since I was first in government \u2013 when I started in government in the early 1990s the information environment was this:\u00a0 You, if you were working at the White House or anywhere else for that matter, at 6:30 at night you turned off your \u2013 turned on your TV if you had one in your office and you watched the network news, one of three channels.\u00a0 When you woke up in the morning, you opened your front door and you picked up\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nNow, of course, we\u2019re on an intravenous feed of information every single day, every single millisecond of the day.\u00a0 And that has created a number of things, including for those of us who are in government this incredible pressure, which you know so well from being at the heart of things at the White House, this incredible pressure to be reactive almost immediately to everything that\u2019s going on.\u00a0 Having the discipline to not to do that, to actually sit back, step back, think through what you\u2019re doing \u2013 that\u2019s more difficult than it\u2019s ever been, but it\u2019s also more imperative.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I should say parenthetically here I\u2019m not going to ask you about the whole documents thing because I know you won\u2019t answer, so I just wanted to put a pin in there.\nA lot of the young people here care deeply about the issue of human rights.\u00a0 And I know you and I know your family history and I know how passionate you are about human rights, and yet there is always this tension between wanting to lead on human rights and the strategic imperatives of the country.\u00a0 So we think of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\u00a0 You just met with the foreign minister from T\u00fcrkiye, who wants F-16 fighters, something that the administration supports and some members of Congress don\u2019t on human rights grounds.\u00a0 How do you navigate that?\u00a0 How do you say we are the guarantors of human rights at the same time that \u2013 but there are times when we can\u2019t?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 President Biden wanted to make sure that one of the things we did was to put human rights back at the heart of our foreign policy, but it\u2019s not and can\u2019t be the totality of our foreign policy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see a zero-sum choice between values on the one hand and interests on the other.\u00a0 Human rights are a profound value for us, but they\u2019re also a strong interest because we know that countries that actually respect the human rights of their citizens in a multiplicity of ways are going to be much better actors on the global stage with us, for us, and for the things that we care about.\nSo one of the things that we have to do in every relationship that we have is figure out the right balance of interests at any given time.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to advance all of them.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Is that painful?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s painful, but sometimes it works in interesting ways that may not be so evident.\u00a0 You mentioned Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Well, we spent a lot of time trying to recalibrate that relationship to make sure that it\u2019s working better than it has been to actually address our interests.\u00a0 One of those interests is human rights.\u00a0 One of the benefits of what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years is we\u2019ve gotten the Saudis engaged in a much more productive way and positive way in trying to end the war in Yemen.\u00a0 This is, when we took office, arguably was the worst humanitarian situation in the world, and the abuse of human rights of the people of Yemen was probably near the top of the list.\nAs a result of the kind of engagement that we pursued \u2013 okay, the conflict is certainly not over, but it\u2019s in a much better place than it\u2019s been.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a ceasefire that\u2019s now endured for many, many months.\u00a0 People are not being killed the way they were before.\u00a0 Rights are in a better place than they were.\nSo you have to think about these things, I think, in ways that are you getting practical results.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 It can be unsatisfying.\u00a0 You know there are a lot of \u2013 there are some journalists here who \u2013 and others who remember the Jamal Khashoggi massacre.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s \u2013 it was jarring to see the President fist bump the guy who apparently was the mastermind of that murder.\u00a0 But you\u2019re saying that\u2019s \u2013 this is \u2013 this is what I\u2019m trying to get at \u2013 I\u2019m not being judgmental about that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 No, no, these are \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I\u2019m saying, these are hard decisions.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to meet the Chinese.\u00a0 They have essentially a gulag where the Uyghurs \u2013 a million Uyghurs are being \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We \u2013 no, you\u2019re right.\u00a0 These \u2013 there are hard decisions; there are challenging balances to try to get right.\u00a0 But again, in the case of Saudi Arabia, I think there \u2013 I think it\u2019s fair to say that there are Yemenis who would probably not be alive today had we not found a way to engage and bring the Saudis along in a way that\u2019s at least produced, for now, a ceasefire.\nSimilarly, as we\u2019re looking at these challenges we have with China, the profound abuses being committed against people in Xinjiang, we\u2019ve stood up, we\u2019ve spoken out, we\u2019ve encouraged and gotten other countries to do the same thing, and we put a spotlight on it.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve taken concrete actions in terms of sanctions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken concrete actions in terms of, in many places, trying to make sure, for example, that we\u2019re not importing products that are produced through slave labor.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 But it\u2019s a balancing act.\u00a0 You can\u2019t \u2013 I realize you\u2019re a diplomat, so you\u2019re \u2013 there are things you can say and things that you can\u2019t say.\u00a0 But I must say it must be frustrating at times that you have to make these balancing judgments, because I know your passion for \u2013 for people.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 If there weren\u2019t frustrations on a daily basis, we\u2019d be out of a job.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 We all \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It would be great to be able to go out of business because the world is perfect, everything\u2019s going well.\u00a0 But it\u2019s the nature of the job.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 One other thing I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask you about \u2013 because I asked you at the beginning what went well, what could have done better.\u00a0 You\u2019re about \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re about to go through some bracing hearings about the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0 And let\u2019s stipulate that \u2013 I think a lot of Americans would say yeah, it is a good thing that we are not there anymore \u2013 concern about what\u2019s happened to human rights there \u2013 but the withdrawal remains a question.\u00a0 And as always in Washington, there\u2019s a lot of fingers pointing in different directions, some of them at the State Department.\u00a0 Do you look back at that and say \u2013 and ask the sort of after-action, \u201cWhat should we have done differently?\u201d\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 You always look back at what you\u2019ve done and try to ask that question.\u00a0 And one of the things that we did is we\u2019ve actually \u2013 we\u2019re taking a hard look at that.\u00a0 And we commissioned a study by one of our leading retired diplomats to do just that, and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be, I\u2019m sure, talking about in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0 We want to make sure that in any instance, especially one as challenging, as fraught as that, that we learn whatever lessons are to be learned and that we apply them going forward, and we\u2019ve already started to do that.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 But you acknowledge it was fraught?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So I\u2019d say a few things.\u00a0 First, to your point, President Biden ended the longest war in American history, and the result of that is that there will not be future generations of Americans going off to fight and die in Afghanistan.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s a good thing, and I think that\u2019s something that most Americans support.\nSecond, many of the predictions \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 And I was there in 2009; he\u2019s very consistent in his view.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We both heard it together then.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Second, many of the predictions, at least until now, of some of the terrible things that might result have not borne out.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not seen an upsurge in terrorism coming out of Afghanistan \u2013 in fact, we\u2019ve demonstrated that to the extent that terrorists and there and being harbored there, we\u2019re able to actually get at them, as we were able to do with Zawahiri.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t seen to date a mass refugee exodus \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Been hard for women and girls there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 But \u2013 that\u2019s what I was coming to.\u00a0 We have also seen the Taliban being either unable or unwilling to make good on things it\u2019s said it would do and that the international community, not just the United States, said we expected of them, starting with making sure that they were actually protecting the rights of all Afghans, including women and girls.\u00a0 That has been a dramatic step backwards, and we\u2019re working to deal with that as best we can now.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to go to questions.\u00a0 I do want to ask you this.\u00a0 There are a lot of people here who are considering what they want to do with their lives.\u00a0 And there was a period of time in the last decade when joining the Foreign Service became less attractive.\u00a0 And talk \u2013 I want to give you a couple of minutes to make a sales pitch here for why people should consider that work, that form of service.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So I\u2019ve had an incredible opportunity in my own life to do a bunch of different things.\u00a0 I was a journalist for a while.\u00a0 I was a lawyer for a while, for one year, 10 months, two weeks, three days, and five hours.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 That good, huh?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, that good.\u00a0 But for those of you who intend to go into the law, it\u2019s great.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I dabbled in movies, et cetera.\u00a0 And then, after a long, circuitous journey, I wound up in government, working for President Clinton.\u00a0 And for the past 30 years, that\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019ve done, with a couple of periods of time out of government because elections happen and things change.\nAnd what I can tell you is this: There are so many different ways to find fulfillment, to find happiness, to find a sense of purpose in life \u2013 in the private sector, in NGOs, in academia, you name it.\u00a0 For me, at least, having had these different experiences, there is something unique about serving in government, and that something unique is right there behind us, and it\u2019s behind me every single day, either figuratively or literally.\u00a0 And it may sound corny, but for me at least, knowing that I\u2019m there with the American flag behind me every day is something that I haven\u2019t really found in any other pursuit that I\u2019ve engaged in.\nSo I really commend it to folks to find a way, and it doesn\u2019t have to be in Washington in the federal government.\u00a0 I think public service in some fashion, serving your community, if not serving your country \u2013 there\u2019s something about that that just is unique in the fulfillment that you get from it, even with the frustrations that come along with it.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We just had the largest entering class at the State Department that we\u2019ve had in more than a decade, so I am incredibly proud of that \u2013 (applause).\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And \u2013 but here\u2019s the thing.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the thing:\u00a0 It needs constant renewal.\u00a0 One of my missions is to make sure, to the extent I can have anything to say about it, is that we continue to attract the most talented, most dedicated people that we possibly can.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I want to see happen.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the reasons, David, that we\u2019re spending time not only in dealing with all of these external problems, but also trying to make our own institution as strong as it can be and an attractive place to work.\nWe\u2019re in a competition for talent.\u00a0 We know that.\u00a0 So we have to make sure that our department is a place that people want to work.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in a number of ways that probably time doesn\u2019t allow me to get into.\u00a0 But as it happens, our diplomat in residence, Susan Falatko, is right here today.\u00a0 I think she may even be at a table outside.\u00a0 If you\u2019d like some information about the State Department, we welcome you stopping by and grabbing it or looking at the website.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 I hope you do.\u00a0 I hope you do.\nWe\u2019ve got to take some questions.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have to, but we want to.\u00a0 I shouldn\u2019t say it like that.\u00a0 And as usual, I\u2019ve snarfed up more than my share of time.\u00a0 Where is the staff member \u2013 where are staff members with the microphones?\u00a0 All right, you choose somebody.\u00a0 Choose somebody.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to do it and make everybody else mad.\u00a0 Just pick somebody who wants to ask a question \u2013 a student, though, would be preferable.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Hi, can everybody hear me?\u00a0 I\u2019m in the middle last row, David, if you can\u2019t see me.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Okay.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I really enjoyed listening to Secretary Blinken and David talk about the role of the U.S. on the global stage. \u00a0My name is Andre.\u00a0 I\u2019m a first year in the college and I\u2019m from Hong Kong, so I\u2019m particularly concerned with where Hong Kong stands on the table of priorities currently at the State Department.\nAnd I understand that there are many international constraints in its balancing act, but domestically the U.S. can do much more boldly to protect Hong Kongers.\u00a0 In 2021, President Biden issued a deferred enforced departure order for Hong Kongers in the U.S.\u00a0 Currently that\u2019s expiring in a little less than three weeks.\u00a0 That means Hong Kongers living in the U.S. still live in uncertainty whether they have to go back to Hong Kong, to a city where it\u2019s not their home anymore, and join the ranks of more than 1,200 political prisoners.\nSo my concern is:\u00a0 Why is the administration not more proactive on looking for longer-term solutions for Hong Kongers despite the presence of many bipartisan efforts in the past, especially in Congress, to give Hong Kongers more options?\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 Yeah, yeah \u2013 I don\u2019t want to cut you off, because it\u2019s such a profound question, but I want to give you a chance to answer maybe yet another question as well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good, yeah.\u00a0 First of all, thank you for sharing that.\u00a0 And let me first of all assure you that we are working on this and we are engaged with Congress on this.\nSecond, I think the experience of Hong Kong in recent years has been one of the most sobering reality makers for people around the world that we\u2019ve seen, and what has happened in terms of the reversal of Hong Kong\u2019s democracy through the actions that the \u2013 that Beijing has taken.\u00a0 What has happened in terms of in effect gutting the notion of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d has had I think a profound effect not only for people in Hong Kong but beyond, and I think one of the reasons that you\u2019re seeing people focused on Taiwan so much right now is precisely because of the experience that Hong Kong has gone through over the last few years.\nWe continue to look for ways to see what we and others can do to make a difference, both in making sure that we\u2019re helping and supporting those who are in very difficult circumstances as a result of the change in Hong Kong.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking very hard at the effect this is having on Hong Kong itself, and there are lots of things that are happening, competing pressures that are changing the entire nature of Hong Kong, which is deeply, deeply, deeply disturbing.\u00a0 But I want to assure you that in terms of the needs of people who are in jeopardy as a result of what\u2019s happened, this is something that we\u2019re very actively focused on.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0 It seems like this is one of those frustrating issues where imperatives collide.\nOne more question.\u00a0 Yeah, don\u2019t \u2013 address yourself to the people with the \u2013 who have all the power with the microphones.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Hi, my names is James and I\u2019m a second year in the college, and what I want to ask about is the way in which that you answered the question, saying that the Biden administration and its foreign policy is leading both with having strategic interests as well as human rights as the forefront.\u00a0 And I was \u2013 really wanted to direct the question toward the United States\u2019 relationship with Israel, and especially in these \u2013 this past few weeks, Prime Minister Netanyahu not adhering to the rule of law, and especially this week having a deadline really to fire the minister that was supposed to be expelled by the supreme court.\nSo I was wondering, in which \u2013 how will the United States\u2019 relationship with Israel change, especially noting that they are a strategic partner in the Middle East \u2013 but also, democracy is very important in the region; and having a partner that adheres to democracy \u2013 in which ways will the Biden administration further that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So thank you.\u00a0 A lot to be said about this.\u00a0 In the interest of time, let me just say this.\u00a0 First, we have a relationship with Israel that has been built over many, many decades, through many different administrations in both the United States and in Israel.\u00a0 There are certain things that are foundational, including a commitment to Israel\u2019s security, and that is not going to change.\u00a0 One of the benefits of a relationship as close as the one that we have is that we can speak very directly and very clearly to each other in private as well as in public when we do have differences, including differences in approach in things that are happening inside of Israel, just as we\u2019ve heard Israelis make very clear their differences about some of the policies that we\u2019ve pursued over the years.\u00a0 And that also is not going to change.\nSo one of the things that I\u2019ve said is we\u2019re very much focused, not on the particular personalities of any one Israeli government but on the policies that that government pursues, and we\u2019re very much engaged with them now.\u00a0 But we have to also give a chance for things to play out.\u00a0 Some of the things that you mentioned are very recent developments that have not yet run their course, so let\u2019s see how things actually evolve.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Let me just ask one follow-up to that, which was a good question.\u00a0 Given the coalition that Prime Minister Netanyahu has had to put together, the most right wing coalition in the history of the country, what has been \u2013 what have you communicated \u2013 I guess this is stupid question because you won\u2019t answer, but have you \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 what has been communicated about red lines?\u00a0 And are their red lines in terms of settlements, in terms of human rights, in terms of issues of concern, democratic rights within the State of Israel?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0David, I\u2019m tempted to say, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to \u2014\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Yes \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 we\u2019ve known each other a long time.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0But in fact, a couple of months ago I had an opportunity to speak to the relationship and the various issues in the relationship.\u00a0 I got a chance to talk to folks at J\u00a0Street in Washington.\u00a0 And besides making clear our enduring commitment to Israel\u2019s security and laying out how we\u2019re doing that, I also made clear that we continue to believe deeply in and are committed to two states, and to make sure, to the best of our ability, that we\u2019re pursuing policies that allow Israelis and Palestinians alike to know equal measures of democracy, dignity, opportunity.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been very clear in the past; we\u2019ll remain very clear in the future about our views on settlements and their expansion, on demolitions, and on violence, including from the settler community, directed at Palestinians or Israeli Arabs \u2013 just as we were very clear, of course, about incitement, certainly about terrorism, et cetera.\nSo I think there\u2019s a very clear consistency in our policy that we\u2019ve laid out before the new government came in, and that we\u2019ll continue to engage on in the weeks and months ahead.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 I guess the thing that we have to \u2013 that we\u2019ll discover is how much that clarity of message is received.\u00a0 But let me just say, Mr. Secretary, my friend, Tony, we are so proud to claim you as an alum of the Institute of Politics.\u00a0 The Institute of Politics is what it is because people like you with a wealth of experience are willing to share their time and the lessons of their experience with the leaders of tomorrow.\u00a0 And so the fact that you came back here today and took time in your busy schedule to be with us as we marked our own occasion means the world to me.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0David, thank you.\u00a0 And I feel a real attachment, not only to you personally because we\u2019re such good friends and colleagues over many years, but to the IOP and to the University of Chicago.\u00a0 It was a great experience for me, so being back is a wonderful thing.\u00a0 I had some just extraordinary colleagues who were here as fellows at the same time, so I\u2019m really grateful for that.\nLast night \u2013 I\u2019ve got \u2013 as you know, I\u2019ve got little kids.\u00a0 I have a soon-to-be three-year-old daughter and a soon-to-be four-year-old son.\u00a0 And my wife was putting our daughter to bed, and as she was putting her to bed, my daughter said, \u201cOh, should we wait for daddy?\u201d\u00a0 And my wife said, \u201cNo, no, he \u2013 actually he\u2019s in Chicago tonight and he\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0 And she looked at my wife with real concern and said, \u201cDo they have beds in Chicago?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I\u2019m gonna go back tonight and report that yes, they do.\u00a0 And they have an incredible Institute of Politics.\nMR AXELROD:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s one of our \u2013 it\u2019s one of our great virtues.\u00a0 So \u2013 thank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

but also iconic because what Eli\u2019s has done over decades is to create a family that is making this extraordinary product.\u00a0 Thirty percent of the team here is a refugee coming from some other distant part of the world, coming to the United States and making their future here.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing to see as you walk down the line and talk to people who are coming from all over the world, coming to the United States as their beacon of hope, and then making their future here.\nAs Marc Schulman told me and would tell you, this is not a work of charity to bring people here to work at Eli\u2019s; it\u2019s actually smart, good business because this team with their energy, with their ingenuity, with their drive, with their determination, it\u2019s a core part of the business.\u00a0 It\u2019s what makes it such a success.\u00a0 As Marc was saying, it is all about the people, and I could see that even in the brief time that I was on the floor here talking to people and hearing their passion, their gratitude for what the Schulman family has done to bring them in, but also our gratitude to them for now being the next generation of Americans who are carrying our story forward.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is all about.\nIt doesn\u2019t just happen, though, magically.\u00a0 It takes the extraordinary commitment of a great company.\u00a0 It takes the incredible work of our resettlement agencies to help connect refugees with places of work.\u00a0 And here RefugeeOne has been such an amazing partner to Eli\u2019s and to so many others; we\u2019re grateful for that.\u00a0 And ultimately, it takes individual Americans who want to carry on the extraordinary tradition that we have as a country in welcoming people from around the world to become part of our country, part of our future.\nWe just announced at the State Department a new program to tap into that energy, to tap into that desire that we\u2019re finding around the country to help, to support people coming to the United States.\u00a0 The Welcome Corps is now a way for individuals, organizations, various groups, alongside the resettlement agencies that are already there, to themselves help welcome refugees to this country, to help them get on their \u2013 get on their feet, to connect them with jobs, to help get their kids to school, to help them figure out how to sign up for the various services that they\u2019re entitled to as refugees.\nAnd what I\u2019m hearing and what I\u2019m seeing and feeling as I talk to people from across our country is an absolute energy, desire to help, to be part of this ongoing story that is our country.\u00a0 Welcome Corps is now a new way to do that.\u00a0 So we\u2019re incredibly excited about that, and I\u2019m incredibly excited about the fact that I\u2019m actually going home not empty-handed but with a couple of cheesecakes too.\u00a0 Thank you. \u00a0(Applause.)\nAnd it\u2019s great to be here with Congressman Quigley as well.\u00a0 He represents this district and has been such a strong supporter of everything that\u2019s going on here.\u00a0 Congressman?\nMR QUIGLEY:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you for coming to Chicago.\u00a0 I told the Secretary and Marc earlier that when I come to Eli\u2019s with the food and the spirit of the place, I\u2019m not sure whether to put my hand over my heart or my stomach.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Somehow those two are intertwined.\nOne of the favorite days I have every year is being at a ceremony swearing in new U.S. citizens.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 It is Frank Capra-esque in a world sometimes of a harder \u2013 a harder place.\u00a0 And it means the world to me.\u00a0 And when I speak to them, I always quote Walt Whitman, who talked about when there\u2019s life going on and that you may contribute a verse.\u00a0 And the thing that strikes me about every class being sworn in is they have a verse in mind.\u00a0 Right?\nJust this last August, I welcomed at North Park Village some refugees who had been brought up here and unceremoniously dropped off.\u00a0 And when we met them, what struck me is they had just been treated rather coldly.\u00a0 They had just gone through extraordinary efforts to get here.\u00a0 But they were still upbeat, optimistic, in a good mood, grateful.\u00a0 And what they were messaging to me was they just wanted a chance.\u00a0 They just wanted to contribute their verse.\nSo let\u2019s keep that in mind in the tough days that come ahead, and that which gives us optimism and hope for this country and all that we are, strong, and the reasons, and who we are as a country \u2013 and the Statue of Liberty is not holding up a stop sign.\u00a0 And we need to work toward that end.\u00a0 Thank you so much.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Ukrainian Cultural Center", "location": "Chicago, Illinois", "date": "January 20, 2023", "content": "\n\nSENATOR DURBIN:\u00a0 We live in a dangerous world, and there is probably no more dangerous place than Ukraine at this moment.\u00a0 The people of Ukraine are fighting for their lives.\u00a0 With this unjust, ruthless invasion by Vladimir Putin and the Russian troops, they have faced 11 months of devastation, death, and destruction, and yet they have shown uncommon courage.\u00a0 They are standing up for values that really define them and now define America as well, and that is why this administration and our country have made a major commitment to help the Ukrainian people and to engage the NATO Alliance at a level that hasn\u2019t been seen ever in history.\u00a0 I think it is a successful effort and it is one that is inspired by the people of Ukraine.\nOne of the leaders in that effort for the United States is our Secretary of State Tony Blinken.\u00a0 I am honored to have him visit Chicago today, and he has come to ground zero when it comes to Ukrainian support in America: Ukrainian Village in the city of Chicago.\u00a0 We just had a very productive and positive meeting to discuss what is happening in Ukraine and what we can do to give more strength to our relationship and support in the future.\nIt is my honor to introduce the Secretary of State Tony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Senator, Dick, thank you so much.\u00a0 It\u2019s really wonderful for me to be in Chicago today, to be here in Ukrainian Village.\u00a0 As the Senator said, we have been dealing with the \u2013 for the last almost year now with this Russian aggression against Ukraine, but not only against Ukraine and its people and the country, but an aggression against the very principles that are so important into making sure that we can actually uphold peace and security around the world.\u00a0 And if we did not stand up against this Russian aggression, as we\u2019ve been doing, we would be opening a pandora\u2019s box around the world for would-be aggressors everywhere to think that they can simply go into another country, seize its territory, kill its people, and get away with that with impunity.\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re determined that that not happen.\nAnd thanks to extraordinary leadership that we\u2019ve seen from Senator Durbin and other colleagues in Congress, the Biden administration along with Congress has provided historic support to Ukraine to make sure that Ukrainians have what they need to defend themselves, to deal with the humanitarian catastrophe that is being unleased on them by Russian aggression, to support their economy, as well as to put pressure on Russia to end the aggression \u2013 and in doing so, at the same time, bringing dozens of countries together around the world, all in support of the same objectives.\nBut at the heart of so much of what we\u2019re doing is work that\u2019s been done \u2013 being done by communities across our country also in support of Ukraine, and no more so than right here in Chicago, Ukrainian Village, which, as the Senator said, is really the beating heart of the Ukrainian American community.\nWe had an opportunity this morning to do two things.\u00a0 We were across the street at the museum of modern art, where we saw an extraordinary exhibition of artworks from Ukrainian children \u2013 the children of war \u2013 that\u2019s on display here.\u00a0 And you\u2019re seeing the war, the brutality, the inhumanity through the eyes of children, as expressed by their extraordinary, extraordinary art.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s a powerful reminder to each and every one of us that this war, this aggression is not an abstraction.\u00a0 It\u2019s having an impact on real people\u2019s lives; it\u2019s affecting, tearing apart the lives of children.\u00a0 And if you go to that exhibit and look at these extraordinary drawings and paintings, I think the first thing you think about is:\u00a0 What if this were my kids?\u00a0 This could be my kids.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a reminder of why it is so important that we sustain our support for Ukraine until the aggression ends.\nSecond, as Senator Durbin said, we just had an opportunity to meet with an extraordinary group of Ukrainian Americans, the diaspora community that in so many ways are doing what\u2019s vital to supporting Ukraine, both in terms of mobilizing support going to Ukraine but also supporting Ukrainians who have had to flee their country in the wake of this aggression and come to the United States, supporting their efforts to come here, integrate here, be able to find jobs, send their kids to school, and so forth.\nThis community-led effort is, maybe more than anything else, the profound expression of what our country\u2019s all about: supporting each other, but also supporting others in times of need.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing, and we were grateful to be able to get some of the feedback, the input from the community to hear about what they\u2019re doing and to hear what else we can do to support their efforts.\nSo I can\u2019t really, Dick, thank you enough for having us here today, connecting us to this community.\u00a0 It\u2019s an ongoing \u2013 ongoing dialogue, an ongoing effort, and I think there\u2019s a great determination to see it through to success.\nThanks.\nSENATOR DURBIN:\u00a0 Thanks.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-turkish-foreign-minister-mevlut-cavusoglu-before-their-meeting-5/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Applause)\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Please, take a seat.\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for that introduction.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to see you in person.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen you on TV a few times.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd to all of you, it\u2019s just wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 I want to thank the mayor again for his leadership of the U.S. conference.\u00a0 And thank you to Tom Cochran \u2013 I was just backstage with him \u2013 and the entire team for having me here with you this morning.\nSo in Washington, we have an old bad joke about the worst words that someone can say that you all know very well: I\u2019m from the federal government; I\u2019m here to help.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well, this group, on the other hand, gets to say, \u201cI\u2019m the mayor \u2013 I really do help.\u201d\u00a0 And I know the difference.\nFor more than nine decades, the U.S. Conference of Mayors has harnessed the incredible power of American cities to advance a stronger and more secure America.\nIn the earliest days of the Depression \u2013 when millions were unemployed, bread lines stretched for blocks, banks had run dry \u2013 America\u2019s mayors forged this coalition to secure the first-ever direct assistance package to cities.\u00a0 If you go back and look at their campaign, the mayors were united, they were committed, and they were relentless \u2013 so relentless, in fact, that when President Hoover later threatened to veto the bill, they marched to the Oval Office and didn\u2019t leave until he pledged his support.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t remind President Biden that I shared that story with you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIn the decades since, this group has come together again and again to meet America\u2019s needs: advocating for civil rights, supporting the vulnerable, taking in refugees fleeing conflict, tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and fighting violent crime in our neighborhoods.\nToday, on the defining priorities of our time, America\u2019s mayors continue to lead the way \u2013 and to deliver results for our people.\nWe know that cities are the engines of opportunity and ingenuity in the United States.\u00a0 They\u2019re where challenges tend to emerge first, and solutions are often forged quickest.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been able to see some of that firsthand in my own travels over the last couple of years.\nThe great vitality of cities is why President Biden asked four mayors to join his cabinet.\u00a0 It\u2019s why whenever I visit our cities and meet their leaders, I tend to leave more optimistic and more confident about America\u2019s future \u2013 our best days are genuinely ahead of us.\nNow, I realize it may be a little unusual for the Secretary of State to address the Conference of Mayors.\u00a0 And as you heard from Mayor Suarez \u2013 and I\u2019m told this is accurate \u2013 I have been \u2013 I will be the first Secretary of State to do so.\u00a0 But I wanted to be here to spend time with the leaders who are probably closest to our communities.\u00a0 And the reason for that is, it\u2019s a key part of fulfilling a pledge that President Biden made at the beginning of this administration.\u00a0 As he put it:\u00a0 \u201cEvery action that we take in our conduct abroad, we [have to] take with American working families in [our] mind[s].\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s the instruction that I got on my first day on the job.\nWhen he took office, the President asked me to prioritize the issues that most directly affect our fellow Americans, and he asked the same of our entire national security team.\nWe have tried to take that charge seriously.\nIt\u2019s guided our work on acute challenges, like the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 We know \u2013 we\u2019ve experienced this firsthand: viruses have no respect for borders.\u00a0 So to combat COVID-19 at home, we need to slow the spread everywhere.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve supported the donation of over 680 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to over 116 countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s why we partnered with dozens of countries, with the World Health Organization, with regional organizations to deliver on what we call a Global Action Plan to increase vaccinations, to strengthen health supply chains, to combat misinformation and disinformation that\u2019s aiding the virus\u2019s spread \u2013 accelerating the work that mayors are doing here at home.\nAnd it\u2019s why we\u2019re doing everything we can to ensure that the world is better prepared to prevent, to detect, to respond to future epidemics because we know they\u2019re coming \u2013 including by working to establish a State Department bureau on global health security and diplomacy to make sure that my agency is as organized as it can be to deal with this in the future.\nAnother immediate challenge is, of course, the climate crisis, which America\u2019s mayors know \u2013 and see firsthand \u2013 there is a clear, present, and growing danger. \u00a0Now, maybe you live in Florida, which last fall was hit by Hurricane Ian, one of the worst disasters in a century.\u00a0 Or the Midwest, where farmlands keep flooding, pushing up food prices for everyone.\u00a0 Or out West, where wildfires get worse every single year, and historic storms just slammed the coast.\nNow, I know mayors aren\u2019t just witnessing climate change \u2013 you are helping to lead the fight against it.\u00a0 When Washington pulled back from the Paris Agreement, it was America\u2019s mayors and governors who stepped up.\u00a0 As the effects of climate change came to your doorsteps, you found the solutions to keep people safe, to transition to clean energy, to cut emissions, to conserve ecosystems.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve worked with counterparts from around the world to share lessons and to raise one another\u2019s ambitions.\nYour leadership is vital, and it\u2019s going to be even more so in the years ahead.\u00a0 And so will the role of American diplomacy \u2013 because, just as with pandemics, we simply can\u2019t solve this problem on our own.\u00a0 Our country accounts for about 15 percent of global emissions, so even if we did everything right here at home, we\u2019ve got to bring the other 85 percent along.\nNow, we\u2019ve rallied three quarters of all countries to support something called the Global Methane Pledge to cut emissions by 30 percent by 2030, emissions coming from the flaring of gas.\u00a0 If that succeeds, it would be the equivalent of taking every ship out of the seas and every plane out of the skies in terms of emissions.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with 139 other nations to phase down hydrofluorocarbons, a greenhouse gas used in refrigerators and heat pumps and air conditioning.\u00a0 That step alone could avoid as much as half a degree Celsius of warming by the end of the century.\nAnd we\u2019re leading the Subnational Climate Action Leaders\u2019 Exchange.\u00a0 This is a new initiative to help cities, states, and regions develop and implement net-zero climate resilient targets and roadmaps.\u00a0 These actions advance our climate goals around the world, but they also spur job creation here at home.\u00a0 And as you\u2019ve often heard the President say: when I think about climate change, I think about jobs.\u00a0 This connection is real; we can make it even more powerful.\nWe\u2019re also currently negotiating a global agreement to end plastic pollution by 2040.\u00a0 In the U.S., cities are going to be crucial to that effort.\u00a0 We know that cities like Seattle and Phoenix are on the cutting edge of the quest to reduce, to reuse, to recycle plastic.\u00a0 And we\u2019re hoping to work with the Conference of Mayors to help create an agreement that mayors here and around the globe can successfully implement.\nOur focus on delivering for the American people is also shaping our work on longer-term strategic challenges, like the global technology revolution that\u2019s quite literally changing how we live and how we work.\u00a0 We need to make sure that critical and emerging technologies \u2013 and all of their applications, from artificial intelligence to biotechnology \u2013 actually protect our privacy, our security, our democracy, even as they usher in incredible opportunities in your communities here at home.\nSo we\u2019re forging new partnerships to bring our closest economic partners and fellow democracies together to try to shape, uphold, and promote common rules of the road to do just that.\u00a0 A lot of these rules get shaped in windowless conference rooms around the world, sometimes in the United Nations system.\u00a0 That\u2019s where it\u2019s actually happening.\u00a0 That\u2019s where decisions are made that actually affect the way that everyone gets to use this technology.\nSo it\u2019s important \u2013 more than important, it\u2019s vital \u2013 that the United States be at the table \u2013 in fact, be at the head of the table \u2013 when all of those rules are being laid out.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got a new bureau at the State Department for Cyberspace and Digital Policy.\u00a0 We have a new office for the special envoy for critical and emerging technologies to make sure that we will be well positioned to lead on these issues, that we will be at the table, that we will be at the head of the table.\nWe\u2019re also leading a concerted diplomatic push to make our supply chains more secure and more resilient.\u00a0 Now, just a few years ago, if you said supply chain I think people\u2019s eyes would glaze over.\u00a0 It still maybe creates that effect.\u00a0 It\u2019s kind of a wonky phrase.\u00a0 It\u2019s used mostly by economists and trade experts.\u00a0 But I think now most of our fellow citizens have experienced firsthand what it means when a supply chain is disrupted.\u00a0 If you look at the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, for example, it is manufactured between 11 sites across five countries, with inputs coming from many, many places.\u00a0 If that gets disrupted, we know what happens.\nSo we\u2019re mobilizing our partnerships to strengthen the supply chains that affect the availability and affordability of everything from cars to basic medical supplies.\u00a0 We\u2019re forging new partnerships to diversify supply chains for critical minerals so that we can both lower the costs and reduce dangerous dependencies, especially on autocratic countries, because economic security is national security.\u00a0 We know that and we live that every day at the State Department.\nWe\u2019re also using our diplomatic toolkit to protect American workers and try to level the playing field on which they compete, because if they\u2019re giving \u2013 given a level playing field, they will outcompete anyone.\u00a0 In the administration\u2019s first year together with partners across the U.S. Government, we rallied 130 countries to sign on to a global minimum tax for the world\u2019s biggest corporations.\nThat agreement will help end the race to the bottom on corporate taxes.\u00a0 It\u2019s a major step toward making sure that multinational corporations invest here in America, eliminating the incentive to shift job creation and profits abroad chasing the lowest taxes.\u00a0 It\u2019ll make America more competitive and ensure that our government and all of you have the resources to invest in our roads, in our bridges, in the educational systems that give opportunity to the next generation.\nWe\u2019ve also set up new partnerships like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity to try to shape the economic rules of the road for the future and create more opportunities for your citizens.\nFinally, we\u2019re focused on a crisis that I think everyone in this room knows all too well: fentanyl.\u00a0 The fentanyl overdose epidemic is the number-one killer of Americans age 18 to 49.\u00a0 That is a mind-boggling fact, and it\u2019s worth repeating \u2013 the number-one killer in this country of Americans 18 to 49: synthetic opioids, fentanyl.\u00a0 At the State Department, I\u2019ve made clear that we have to bring to bear the full power of American diplomacy to this challenge. \u00a0So we\u2019re working with international partners and with the private sector to try to disrupt the synthetic drug supply chain and prevent the diversion of chemicals from legitimate purposes to the production of synthetic drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamines.\nAnd we\u2019re committed to working with you to create and execute solutions that can actually make a difference in your communities.\nSo public health, climate, supply chains, the future of technology, economic security \u2013 these are the issues that our diplomats, your diplomats are working on day-in and day-out.\u00a0 It\u2019s what we mean when we talk about a foreign policy for the middle class.\u00a0 It\u2019s what we mean when we say that the line between foreign and domestic policy is more blurred than it\u2019s ever been.\nAnd just as what we\u2019re doing abroad has a major impact at home, what we\u2019re doing at home matters profoundly to our success around the world.\u00a0 That is more true than ever at a time when we see geopolitical competition has reached its most intense point since the end of the Cold War.\nHistoric investments like the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \u2013 these are actually critical to our standing and to our influence around the world.\u00a0 I feel this every single day.\u00a0 When those laws were passed, it literally added lift to our diplomacy around the world.\u00a0 It created American jobs, revitalizing our industries, recharging our innovation base, better positioning us to compete with rivals, demonstrating the power of democracy \u2013 when it gets it right \u2013 to deliver for its people.\nIt\u2019s precisely because foreign and domestic policy are so inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing that, in our judgment, we need to try to deepen the partnership between institutions like mine and yours.\nAnd that\u2019s why the State Department launched a new subnational diplomacy unit.\u00a0 I\u2019m thrilled to have Ambassador Nina Hachigian here.\u00a0 She\u2019s serving as our envoy to all of our cities and states.\nNina comes to us from Los Angeles, where she served as the first deputy mayor for international affairs.\u00a0 Before that, she was our ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and she worked with me on the National Security Council way back in the Clinton administration.\u00a0 I know that she is extremely excited to be working with all of you.\nLast November, Nina traveled to Richmond, Virginia, where she met with Mayor Stoney and representatives from the business community.\u00a0 And she heard something that we\u2019ve been hearing in many parts of our country: more needs to be done to create good-paying jobs.\u00a0 Cities are eager for help attracting more foreign direct investment and creating more markets for exports.\nBut that\u2019s not all.\u00a0 Nina and her team also heard that cities are looking to the federal government for help tackling other issues that affect their ability to expand inclusive economic opportunity and to grow businesses \u2013 like how to fix supply-chain issues, how to navigate complex global tax regimes, or how to support woman- and minority-owned businesses as they compete around the world.\nWe can help.\u00a0 These are issues that we work on every day.\u00a0 And with the subnational diplomacy unit, mayors now have an address at the State Department when they need help.\nThe subnational team will also strengthen partnerships between America\u2019s mayors and the world.\u00a0 U.S. mayors are already leading in the global arena \u2013 last fall at COP27, where the Mayors Conference hosted sessions on climate migration, social justice, and financing.\nSo we\u2019re here to accelerate that engagement, to support it, including by connecting you with our partners beyond our borders, like fellow mayors, as well as national governments, businesses, multilateral organizations.\u00a0 We know that they have a lot to learn from you.\nSo I\u2019m here really to tell you that this subnational diplomacy unit, this new office at our department, is your tool.\u00a0 And I very much hope that you\u2019ll use it.\nNow, it\u2019s also far from the only part of the State Department that\u2019s focused on our cities.\u00a0 I\u2019ve made clear to every part of my team that it\u2019s on all of us to connect our states, to connect our cities with our foreign policy.\u00a0 And I want to encourage you to work with us in this mission.\nJoin us, for example, at the City Summit of the Americas in late April, which will bring mayors, governors, and community leaders together to help shape our hemisphere\u2019s priorities to make sure that our work on democracy, on public health, on climate, on migration, on digital technologies and more actually benefit citizens at the local level.\u00a0 That is fundamentally what this is all about.\nJoin us in initiatives like the Open Government Partnership.\u00a0 Sign onto the Global Mayors Declaration for Democracy to defend the rule of law, to empower our citizens, to help fight corruption.\nKeep welcoming people from around the world to travel, to study, to work, to live in your cities, which is foundational to our own economic growth, to our competitiveness, and to middle class prosperity.\nAnd help us learn.\u00a0 Help us learn from your successes and ensure that others do as well.\u00a0 The answers to so many of the challenges that our world faces can be found right here in American cities.\nCities like Boston, which figured out that tracking COVID-19 in wastewater is one of the best ways to anticipate its spread, and then set up a system to test the water, neighborhood by neighborhood, to calibrate the city\u2019s pandemic response and stop the spread.\nAnd cities like Carmel, Indiana, home to over 140 roundabouts, which significantly reduced traffic fatalities and also mean that cars emit fewer tons of carbon emissions every single year.\nSolutions are found in cities like San Diego, which is using geospatial data to determine which communities are most in need of digital connectivity and has set up open, public Wi-Fi hotspots, free tech support, free computer and internet skills classes where they\u2019re needed most.\nThree cities, three examples of innovation that are making a difference for their residents.\u00a0 Three opportunities the federal government and the rest of the world need to learn from.\u00a0 Three reasons why our foreign policy needs cities as partners.\nTogether as partners, my hope is that we can get to work, and get to work for the American people.\u00a0 That\u2019s our common responsibility; we\u2019re determined to do it with you.\u00a0 Thank you so much for having me this morning.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"},

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Benjamin Franklin Room", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "January 17, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0 James, my friend, we\u2019ve been around the world together on many occasions already \u2013 everywhere from New York to M\u00fcnster to Bucharest, just in recent months.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a special pleasure to have you here at the State Department for the first time in your current role, and we\u2019re adding another chapter to a very long history of this Special Relationship at a time when it could not be more important and could not be more vibrant.\nIn each of these engagements, our shared work to confront the threats posed by President Putin\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine was at the top of the agenda, as it was today.\u00a0 Both President Biden and Prime Minister Sunak have committed to standing with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\u00a0 And our teams are in lockstep as we coordinate our efforts both with one another and also with our many allies and partners.\nWe remain committed to sustaining our security assistance to Ukraine as it defends its people against Russia\u2019s brutal attacks, like the one we saw just this weekend on an apartment building in Dnipro on Saturday \u2013 far from the front lines.\u00a0 The senseless attack was launched from a missile designed to sink ships and killed dozens of people, wounded scores more.\u00a0 The youngest was just three years old.\nWe applaud the prime minister\u2019s commitment over the weekend to send Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems to Ukraine, elements that will continue to reinforce and add to what the United States has provided, including in our most recent drawdown.\nWe remain united in strengthening our humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people, especially as President Putin continues to weaponize winter by attacking Ukraine\u2019s electricity grid.\u00a0 Through the G7, we\u2019re working with the United Kingdom and other partners to help Ukraine repair, restore, and defend that grid.\nAnd we joined in applying economic pressure through coordinated sanctions and export controls on Moscow, holding President Putin and his enablers accountable, imposing costs designed to deprive Russia of the resources it needs to keep fueling its war machine.\nWe\u2019re undertaking these efforts and more to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position when a negotiating table emerges so that there can be a just and durable peace.\u00a0 That is our common objective.\nAt the same time the Russian military attacks Ukraine\u2019s energy supplies, Putin is using energy to try to punish countries that support Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together in several ways to ensure that these efforts fail as well.\u00a0 We\u2019re increasing the supply of liquified natural gas from the United States and the United Kingdom.\u00a0 We\u2019ve improved information sharing on ways to strengthen the market for energy smart appliances.\u00a0 We\u2019re investing and developing and deploying new clean energy technologies all across Europe.\nIn the face of these challenges, it\u2019s striking that many citizens of the United Kingdom and across the continent are rationing their energy use, taking quicker showers, lowering their heat.\u00a0 They understand the stakes of this war and they, too, stand in solidarity with Ukraine.\nThe foreign secretary and I also had an opportunity to discuss Iran.\u00a0 We stand with the British Government in condemning Iran\u2019s execution of Iranian-British dual national Alireza Akbari, which was politically motivated and unjust.\u00a0 It fits a pattern of abuse by the regime: detentions, torture, forced confessions, unjust executions.\nWe\u2019ll continue to work with the United Kingdom and our other allies and partners to hold Iran\u2019s leadership accountable for these and other abuses.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep standing with the brave Iranians who are standing up for their own basic rights led by young women \u2013 all of this in the face of extraordinary repression.\nWe discussed matters as well related to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 We welcome the United Kingdom\u2019s commitment to deepening its engagement in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We look forward to continuing our close consultation on a host of issues in the region, including maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\nWe also support the United Kingdom\u2019s increased focus on national security risks to the sensitive technology sectors.\u00a0 In recent days, the United Kingdom has denied export licenses to research laboratories funded by foreign defense companies and blocked the transfer of sensitive intellectual property.\nOur conversation also touched on Northern Ireland.\u00a0 I affirm President Biden\u2019s unequivocal support for the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, which over the past 25 years has been integral to preserving peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Northern Ireland.\u00a0 The United States believes that there must be a negotiated settlement to the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol that\u2019s acceptable to all sides.\u00a0 And we\u2019re heartened that in recent days the United Kingdom and the European Union have made substantive progress towards the negotiated solution.\nLast month, we appointed Joe Kennedy as our new Special Envoy to Northern Ireland for Economic Affairs.\u00a0 A career public servant, Joe will draw on his extensive experience to support economic growth in Northern Ireland and to deepen our nation\u2019s people\u2011to\u2011people ties with all communities.\nThis September will mark an important occasion in our own Special Relationship \u2013 the 75th anniversary of the UK-U.S. Fulbright Program.\u00a0 It\u2019s supported over those years more than 27,000 students, scholars, professionals \u2013 spanning disciplines from art and science, to history, to mathematics \u2013 as they travel between our countries and learn from and grow with one another.\nThat bond between our people is the beating heart of this relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s carried us through challenging times.\u00a0 It\u2019s created opportunities and innovation to the benefit of both of our people, and, I might add, for the world.\u00a0 I know that it will keep us connected closer than ever this year and in the years to come.\nAnd with that, James, over to you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Tony, thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m delighted to pay my first official visit to Washington as foreign secretary.\u00a0 As you\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve had plenty of opportunities to meet and work together over the last few months since my appointment in multilateral fora, where we reinforce often our respective positions.\u00a0 And I am incredibly grateful to Secretary Blinken for this opportunity to discuss a wide range of foreign policy issues and to reaffirm the unbreakable friendship and enduring alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\nNow, as it happens, we are meeting on the 80th anniversary of the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, where Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt \u2013 and their respective military chiefs, General Alanbrooke and General Marshall \u2013 planned the liberation of Europe and planned the victory over aggression.\nAnd as Secretary Blinken said, the main subject of our talks today was Ukraine\u2019s current struggle against aggression in our time.\u00a0 From the onset of this crisis, Britain and America have worked hand in glove to help our Ukrainian friends defend their homeland against Putin\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s heroic armed forces have liberated thousands of square miles, and I have no doubt they can win in their battle for freedom.\u00a0 As you will have seen, Britain has decided to accelerate our support, including the supply to Ukraine of main battle tanks, heavy artillery, and other military systems.\nSecretary Blinken and I are hugely encouraged not just by the unity between our two countries, but the transatlantic unity between the United States and Europe and the support from nations on every continent.\u00a0 Almost a year after Russia\u2019s attack against Ukraine, which broke the fundamental principles of international law \u2013 and we see them committing acts of barbarism wherever they advance \u2013 what we see is dozens of countries supplying Ukraine with weapons and enforcing sanctions against Russia.\u00a0 And I pay particular tribute to the United States of America, the largest military and economic donor to our friends in Ukraine, reinforcing this country\u2019s longstanding to \u2013 longstanding commitment to protecting freedom and opposing tyranny wherever it rears its ugly head.\nAnd whilst three-quarters of the entire membership of the United Nations voted to condemn this invasion, we should remember that never in living memory has Russia been more isolated and the Atlantic Alliance more united.\u00a0 If Putin believed that the world would succumb to Ukraine fatigue and lose the will to resist his ambitions, then that was, once again, another colossal misjudgment on his part.\nAs Tony said, we also discussed the situation in Iran, where the regime has committed a cowardly and shameful act by executing a British-Iranian dual national Alireza Akbari.\u00a0 I\u2019m very grateful to the United States of America for publicly condemning the execution and for Secretary Blinken expressing his condolences in our meeting a few moments ago.\u00a0 And also, our two countries stand with the brave and dignified people of Iran as they demand their rights to live free of terror and oppression.\u00a0 And the UK has sanctioned involved with the execution of Mr. Akbari and those involved in the oppression of their own people, including the Iranian prosecutor general.\nFor years, Iran\u2019s leadership have inflicted bloodshed on their regional neighbors by arming and supporting military extremists and militias.\u00a0 Now Iran has gone further and supplied Russian with the drones that were used to kill civilians in Ukraine.\u00a0 And the UK will join with the U.S. and other allies to hold the Iranian regime to account for the violations of the rights of their own people and by making themselves accomplices to Putin\u2019s assault on Ukraine.\nAnother threat to the international peace and security comes from Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which has never been more advanced.\u00a0 And the U.S. and the UK are determined that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon.\nWe also discussed China\u2019s growing assertiveness on the world stage, which poses a systematic challenge to many of our values and interests, and we recognize the need to manage competition with China, including through diplomacy and engagement.\u00a0 And we spoke of the need to enhance, with our allies and friends, our respective economic security, and we also need to take a long view, strengthen our resilience, and reduce strategic dependencies.\nBut nor can we ignore China or the need to engage with it, given China\u2019s significance on every issue in world affairs, ranging from economic stability to climate change.\nBritain and America share a steadfast commitment to peace and security in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And the AUKUS partnership \u2013 a decade-long project to provide a nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarine capability to Australia \u2013 is only possible because of the unique bond of trust between us.\nWe also spoke about Northern Ireland and our negotiations with the EU and our efforts to resolve the issues of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\u00a0 And we recognize the interest that the President of the United States has on this \u2013 on this issue, and his desire, which is shared of course by us, to see the institutions of the Northern Ireland back up and running.\nIn all these areas, and indeed many others, Britain and America are working in concert in the greatest tradition of our alliance.\u00a0 And I thank you, Secretary Blinken, once again for the opportunity to discuss these issues here in Washington.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much, gentlemen.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, first I do want to ask you both about Ukraine.\u00a0 But first let me just ask you, because while you were at the State Department, not at the White House and the Vice President\u2019s Office, you were for two years the managing director of the Penn Biden Center, and just ask if you were aware of any reason why classified documents would have been packed and brought there while you were there, and whether you would be available for an interview if the special counsel requests.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 The short answer is no.\u00a0 Just as you heard from President Biden about a week ago, I was surprised to learn that there were any government records taken to the Penn Biden Center.\u00a0 I had no knowledge of it at the time.\u00a0 The White House of course has indicated that the administration is cooperating fully with the review that the Justice Department has undertaken, and I of course would cooperate fully with that review myself.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 On Ukraine, the world has been horrified by what happened in Dnipro over the weekend.\u00a0 And this brutal attack only reinforces President Zelenskyy\u2019s requests for more weapons, including long-range missiles from the United States, tanks, fighter jets, attack \u2013 obviously Apaches, whatever else they need.\u00a0 The secretary, the foreign secretary, has said that we need to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d and give them what it takes to win.\u00a0 Why has the United States not provided more of these long-range weapons, more of these systems?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Secretary, the U.S. has said that they were concerned about \u2013 that they are concerned about Russia\u2019s response by provoking a further escalation.\u00a0 Is that not a concern for Great Britain, or do you think that that is overstated and that there is a greater need, as you have certainly expressed by your own actions?\nThank you both.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to kick it off.\u00a0 Andrea, thank you.\nFirst, I think it\u2019s important to say that as this aggression has evolved, so too has our assistance to Ukraine \u2013 making sure that it has what it needs to meet the aggression head on.\u00a0 And as I said before, that started long before the Russian aggression.\u00a0 When we saw the storm clouds gathering in the months before the aggression, we initiated what we call drawdowns of our own military equipment to Ukraine to make sure that it had on hand what it would need if Russia went through with the aggression.\u00a0 So Stingers, Javelins \u2013 all of those were provided initially around Labor Day a year ago, and then again before Christmas. \u00a0So this is months before the Russian aggression.\nThe result of that was that when Russia went in, when they attacked, the Ukrainians had on hand what they needed to repel the effort to take Kyiv, to take the whole country.\u00a0 And then of course, the war has evolved.\u00a0 The aggression has evolved; it moved to the south and the east, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s been.\nBut if you look at the trajectory from Stingers, to Javelins, to HIMARS, to Bradley Fighting Vehicles, to Patriot missile batteries, we have continuously provided what Ukraine needs.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing it in a way to make sure that it\u2019s responsive to what\u2019s actually happening on the battlefield as well as projecting where it might go, making sure as well that the Ukrainians are trained on the systems that were provided, that they have the ability to maintain the systems, because if they\u2019re not trained and the systems can\u2019t be maintained, it\u2019s not going to do you very much good for very long.\nSo all of these things taken together have been critical to the success that Ukraine has had to date.\u00a0 It starts with their own courage and resilience, but it\u2019s certainly been strongly supported by our two countries and many other countries, and we continue to adapt along the way.\nNow, all of that totals for, on the part of the United States, some $25 billion in security assistance to Ukraine over less than a year.\u00a0 And I would anticipate that you\u2019ll hear more announcements in the days to come.\u00a0 There\u2019ll be a meeting again at the end of the week of the so-called Ramstein group that Secretary Austin put together to make sure that we\u2019re coordinating security assistance among many countries.\u00a0 So stay tuned for more on that.\nBut the bottom line is we are determined to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to succeed on the battlefield.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve said, the fastest way to bring this war to a just and durable end, to get to diplomacy, to get to a negotiation, is to give Ukraine a strong hand on the battlefield.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say just because I have the opportunity to address this.\u00a0 There had been a narrative that the Russians were trying to push for many weeks and many months that they\u2019re interested in diplomacy in Ukraine and we are not.\u00a0 That of course is entirely false, but I think you only have to look at Putin\u2019s own words in a recent conversation with President Erdo\u011fan of T\u00fcrkiye in which he says unless and until Ukraine accepts the new territorial realities, as he put it, there\u2019s nothing to negotiate.\u00a0 In other words, unless and until Ukraine acknowledges and accepts the fact that territory that Russia has seized by force, it\u2019s not getting back, there\u2019s nothing to negotiate. That of course is in and of itself a nonstarter.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Andrea, look, I said in my opening remarks and I\u2019m going to reinforce it here: we should never lose sight of the fact that United States of America is the single largest donor of military and economic aid to support Ukraine\u2019s self-defense of any country in the world, and the UK is very proud to be number two in that pecking order.\nAnd it\u2019s very easy to get focused on individual equipment types, and of course tanks are the headline of today.\u00a0 But in our package of military support there were heavy artillery, the AS-90 system and the M-109 system, the 155-caliber guns, as well as 105-caliber guns, as well as 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, millions of rounds of small arms ammunition.\u00a0 That was part of the package that we put forward.\nBut we should also recognize the importance of the Patriot missile system.\u00a0 This is an incredibly sophisticated and important piece of air defense equipment.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the horrors that Ukraine is having to endure because of air attacks, and so those air defense missile systems, the 50-plus Bradley armored fighting vehicles that were recently announced, these are really significant, meaningful donations to the military effort.\nFrom the UK\u2019s point of view, we certainly value the longstanding commitments that the United States of America has made.\u00a0 The contributions that we are making in the UK both in terms of equipment and training, we do so standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States of America, as we have done throughout this.\u00a0 I was at the United Nations Security Council meeting literally sitting next door to Secretary Blinken when we together warned the world of what Putin was about to do.\u00a0 We knew what his intention was, we provided that warning to the world, and we have both physically and metaphorically been shoulder-to-shoulder in our condemnation of Putin\u2019s actions and our support to Ukraine ever since.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s really important the American people recognize what is \u2013 what their own government in doing in support of freedom and in opposition to this aggression and oppression.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Nick Allen.\u00a0 Nick Allen of The Telegraph.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks very much.\u00a0 A question for each of you, please.\nFor Secretary Blinken, another question on tanks.\u00a0 Germany suggested today that it won\u2019t allow tanks to be sent to Ukraine unless the U.S. sends them first.\u00a0 What\u2019s your response to that?\nAnd for the foreign secretary, did you pledge today that the Northern Ireland Protocol issue will be resolved by the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, and did you discuss whether President Biden will visit the UK in April?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So on the question of tanks, and for that matter any weapons system, these are sovereign decisions for each country to make.\u00a0 I would note that what Germany has done to date has been quite extraordinary, and we\u2019ve just had the recent announcement that they\u2019ll send infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine and a Patriot missile battery.\u00a0 And that follows a long line of other steps that they\u2019ve taken that I suspect most of us would not have thought, if not possible, certainly probable just a year ago.\u00a0 But these are fundamentally decisions for each country to make as something that we respect.\nWe\u2019ve seen incredible solidarity among countries around the world to support Ukraine.\u00a0 And as I mentioned, Secretary Austin is going to be hosting another meeting of all of the countries that are involved in providing support to Ukraine at the end of this week, and I would expect further announcements to come out of that meeting.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to the Northern Ireland Protocol and the negotiations with the European Commission, I did update Secretary Blinken on that.\u00a0 Those negotiations \u2013 as I have said publicly and Maro\u0161\u00a0\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d has also said publicly \u2013 have been negotiated \u2013 have been conducted in good faith, with a genuine desire to get resolution to these important issues.\nAnd of course we always welcome the \u2013 visits from senior members of the United States Government, including of course the President himself.\u00a0 But I want to make it absolutely clear that our desire to get resolution on the issues of the Northern Ireland Protocol are because we want to see the institutions of the Good Friday \u2013 Belfast Good Friday Agreement up and running.\u00a0 We want to see devolved government in Northern Ireland in Stormont back up and running.\u00a0 We want to see a free flow of trade within the UK internal market whilst respecting the desire of the European Union to protect its single market.\nAnd we do these things because they are the right things to do, not because we are trying to hit a particular date or anniversary.\u00a0 We want to get these things resolved as soon as possible so that the people of Northern Ireland can enjoy full economic freedom, can enjoy the relief packages that the UK Government has put in place to address some of the issues of, for example, energy prices that have increased as a direct result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 We do these things for those reasons, and of course, as I say, we recognize the President and I think the whole of the U.S. Government\u2019s desire to see this resolution.\u00a0 It mirrors our desire to get these things resolved, and indeed, I believe very strongly mirrors the European Commission\u2019s desire to get these things resolved.\u00a0 And we will continue working hard and in that good spirit of cooperation.\nI\u2019d make the point that I have tried to keep our negotiations discreet, and I think that discretion has actually helped us get some things over the line, so you will understand that my intention is to continue keeping those \u2013 the details of those negotiations discreet.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Courtney McBride, Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 You\u2019ve highlighted the evolution of security assistance to Ukraine from the U.S., the UK, and various allies and partners and said that you\u2019re doing things that were not previously thought possible.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious about what changed, what was the motivating factor that actually spurred that beyond just adapting to the changes in the battlefield environment, and also what obstacles remain both individually and collectively to get Ukraine to the point of that swift and decisive victory for which the foreign secretary has been advocating.\nAnd then finally, on NATO accession for Sweden and Finland, which you\u2019ve both said would be additive for the Alliance, what role are your countries playing in trying to expedite that process?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I don\u2019t think anything has changed.\u00a0 As I said from day one and before day one, we have sought to make sure to the best of our ability and to the best ability of many other friends and partners who are determined to support Ukraine that we were getting to the Ukrainians what they needed when they needed it to deal with the situation they were facing on the ground.\u00a0 And as we discussed just a few minutes ago, that \u2013 what they\u2019ve been facing has evolved.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s changed.\nAnd so we\u2019ve tried to make sure that we\u2019re as responsive as quickly as possible to the evolutions on the battlefield, not only where it is geographically but the kinds of things that the Russians are doing, as well as the kinds of things that the Ukrainians need to do to regain the territory that\u2019s been taken from them by force.\u00a0 So I think that\u2019s been the evolution.\nAnd again, what you\u2019ve seen in \u2013 just in recent weeks, not only from the United States and the United Kingdom but from many other countries, is a continued commitment to make sure that the Ukrainians do have what they need.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve seen countries in Europe provide everything from fighting vehicles to light tanks, air defenses, ammunition, artillery.\u00a0 All of that continues to come forward to the Ukrainians.\nWe\u2019re now in winter.\u00a0 There continues to be ferocious fighting, particularly along the eastern front.\u00a0 I anticipate that that will, unfortunately, go on for some time.\u00a0 But we are determined together, as well as with many others, to make sure, as I said, that the Ukrainians have what they need to recapture, regain what they\u2019ve lost and to deal with the Russian aggression.\u00a0 So that hasn\u2019t changed.\nWith regard to Finland and Sweden and NATO, there\u2019s been a process, an ongoing process involving T\u00fcrkiye, Finland, and Sweden, and I think that process has been very productive in addressing some of the concerns that T\u00fcrkiye has raised about its own security, and both Finland and Sweden have taken significant steps to address those concerns.\u00a0 And we anticipate that this process will move forward in the weeks and months ahead.\nThere\u2019s a strong consensus among NATO countries for bringing Finland and Sweden into the Alliance.\u00a0 You\u2019ve seen that in the extraordinary rapid signing of the protocols, the ratification now by 28 of 30 NATO members of Finland and Sweden\u2019s accession, and we look to the process that\u2019s ongoing between T\u00fcrkiye, Finland, and Sweden to move this forward and move it forward expeditiously.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, really, all I can do is find myself reinforcing the points that Secretary Blinken has made.\u00a0 I mean, in your question you said other than the evolution of the battle, what has changed \u2013 I mean, it really is as simple as that.\u00a0 At the start of this conflict, when the Ukrainians were defending themselves against heavy armor attacks in urban locations in and around Kyiv and Irpin and other places, what they needed were those small, portable, hand-held anti-tank missile systems, because in the congested real estate of urban warfare, those were the most effective weapon systems that they could have utilized against tanks.\u00a0 And the NLAW systems that we provide \u2013 manufactured in Northern Ireland, by the way \u2013 as well as the Javelins systems that the United States of America provided, and others, were absolutely instrumental in helping the Ukrainians defend themselves in those urban areas.\nAs the battle then moved to more attacks from the air, the air defense systems that we have subsequently provided became key, and now we see more conflict in open spaces, in open ground in the east and the south, which therefore necessitates more maneuverist equipment \u2013 the ability to fight and maneuver simultaneously.\u00a0 That has very much been the evolution of the response.\nAs Secretary Blinken has said, the Ramstein process where we sit with our international friends, the members of the NATO Alliance, to discuss what we can provide \u2013 what equipment is available, what equipment is ready to go on stream, what equipment the Ukrainians need \u2013 is essential.\u00a0 Then it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s about providing the right equipment at the right time so they conduct the right kind of fighting.\u00a0 And of course the work that the UK has done and the U.S. is doing in terms of training Ukrainian troops so that they can be more effective with the equipment and ammunition that we are providing them, that they can utilize our donations most effectively and maintain the equipment most effectively, is also important.\u00a0 And that process will continue and we will evolve our support just as the battle evolves.\nAnd all I can do is echo the words that Secretary Blinken said about Sweden and Finland.\u00a0 I have absolutely no doubt they will be incredibly effective allies.\u00a0 And I would make the point that in both those countries, they had a longstanding posture of not formally affiliating with NATO.\u00a0 That changed as a direct result of Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 His actions were designed to break NATO as a defensive Alliance, and what he did instead was strengthen NATO as a defensive Alliance.\u00a0 Add that to the charge sheet of strategic-level miscalculations that Putin has been making throughout this endeavor.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Robert Moore of ITV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks for taking these questions.\u00a0 I wanted to follow up with a question about Iran following the killing of Mr. Akbari.\u00a0 I mean, you\u2019ve both said here today and, Foreign Secretary, you said in the House of Commons that you will hold Iran to account.\u00a0 Can you be specific about what you mean given that these sanctions that you refer to have been in place for some time?\u00a0 And I wonder more broadly where this leaves our Iran policy. \u00a0Do we regard leaders in Tehran as legitimate interlocutors in terms of the nuclear talks?\u00a0 Are they dead in the water or are they on life support or can they be potentially kept going even following the killing of Mr. Akbari, even following Iran\u2019s provision of so much weaponry to Russia?\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 The execution of Mr. Akbari was a politically motivated act, and we acted swiftly to sanction the people involved with it, including the prosecutor general.\u00a0 We have already sanctioned members of the so-called morality police and of the members of the Iranian judiciary who have been involved with the crackdown of the legitimate protests of the Iranian people.\nI would make the point that there have been around 500 fatalities because of the crackdown from the Iranian regime against their own people; 18,000 people arrested by the Iranian regime.\u00a0 And the point that I would make is the leadership of Iran is a decision for the Iranian people, but I would just make the simple observation that the Iranian people are telling their government that they are not at all happy with the situation that they are living under and the limitations and privations.\u00a0 And it is in the hands of the Iranian Government to make those changes.\u00a0 They call \u2013 they call for us, for the U.S., for us, and our friends to lift sanctions.\u00a0 And the point that we have made is that if they want to see those sanctions removed, they have to fundamentally change their behavior.\u00a0 Sadly, we\u2019re not seeing any indication that they are ready to do so, and unfortunately that is as true with our efforts to prevent them acquiring a nuclear weapon as it is in the crackdown on the protesters and the persecution of their own people.\nIt is in the gift of the Iranian leadership to bring about change.\u00a0 We will continue to act in response to their behaviors, and you\u2019ll have to excuse me, I\u2019m not going to speculate about what further measures we might take.\u00a0 But I said at the dispatch box just before flying to the U.S. that we do not limit ourselves to the response that I have already announced.\nBut we will continue to speak to Iran where we\u2019re able to and we hope that at some point soon they will listen properly to what we\u2019re saying, because I don\u2019t believe that a country with a multi-thousand-year history of sophistication and art really wants to have the international reputation of ugliness and brutality that Iran currently has.\u00a0 They are betraying their heritage.\u00a0 They are objectifying \u2013 sorry, they are oppressing their own people.\u00a0 And the simple message I would put across is that they should change \u2013 not for our benefit, not because of what we say or do, but because their own people are demanding that they do so.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And really, I can only strongly echo what the foreign secretary has said.\u00a0 We were appalled by the execution of Mr. Akbari, just as we\u2019ve been appalled by everything we\u2019ve been seeing on the streets of Iran over the last months since these protests began \u2013 mass arrests, sham trials, the executions, the use of sexual violence as a tool for protest suppression.\u00a0 We, the United Kingdom \u2013 but not just us \u2013 countries around the world are watching this, seeing this, and share the revulsion that we have.\u00a0 And these abuses will not go without consequence.\u00a0 Together with many other countries, we\u2019ve been moving forward with a variety of unilateral actions, multilateral measures, using UN mechanisms to try to hold Iran to account.\u00a0 And that\u2019s played out in a number of different places in a number of different ways, and it will continue as long as necessary.\nWith regard to the JCPOA, the Iranians killed the opportunity to come back to that agreement swiftly many months ago.\u00a0 There was an opportunity on the table that they rejected, an opportunity that was approved by all who were involved \u2013 the Europeans, the United States, Russia and China even at the time.\u00a0 And so the JCPOA has not been on the agenda as a practical matter for many months now.\u00a0 It\u2019s not our focus.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on what\u2019s happening in Iran.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on what Iran is doing in terms of the provision of weapons to Russia to use against innocent people and the entire energy grid in Ukraine.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re focused on its other destabilizing activities throughout the region.\nWhat is also very much in our focus is the President\u2019s commitment, President Biden\u2019s commitment that Iran never acquire a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 Now, we continue to believe that the most effective way to do that is through diplomacy, and we saw the results and success of diplomacy when it comes to the original JCPOA, which put Iran\u2019s nuclear program in a box.\u00a0 And it was a terrible mistake to have torn up that agreement and walked away from it, and now we\u2019re dealing with the results.\u00a0 The results include, as the foreign secretary said, Iran making very significant progress on its nuclear program, and that represents an additional challenge to the other things that Iran has engaged in.\u00a0 But, as I said, the JCPOA right now is not on the table.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is that when it comes to diplomacy in general, you tend to spend a chunk of your diplomacy engaging with countries with whom you have profound disagreements or worse, including outright adversaries.\u00a0 That\u2019s the nature of what we do.\u00a0 And the one thing that\u2019s clear is that engaging in diplomacy, including with those who are engaged in outrageous actions, is sometimes necessary to try to advance our interests, and it never takes the word \u201cno\u201d from our vocabulary.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, gentlemen.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 That concludes the press conference.\n"}, {"url":

welcome to NASA Headquarters.\u00a0 I\u2019m NASA Press Secretary Jackie McGuinness, and we\u2019re honored to be joined today by leaders from the United States and Japan to sign a framework agreement that recognizes our nations\u2019 mutual interest in peaceful exploration.\u00a0 The Framework Agreement Between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America for Cooperation in Space Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, For Peaceful Purposes covers a broad portfolio of joint activities between our nations, including exploration, science, aeronautics, technology, and much more.\nFirst, I\u2019d like to welcome NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to deliver a few words.\nMR NELSON:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Jackie.\u00a0 Is the microphone coming through?\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Welcome, everybody, and on behalf of the deputy administrator, Colonel Pam Melroy, on behalf of our entire workforce at NASA, which is a group of wizards \u2013 they make the impossible possible, as you have seen in some of the extraordinary things that have happened just in the last year \u2013 on behalf of all of these, I want to welcome you, Mr. Prime Minister here, your delegation.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to have you, the foreign minister, Mr. Ambassador.\u00a0 It\u2019s also our JAXA President Yamakawa, and it\u2019s great to have our astronauts, Aki and Anne.\u00a0 So thank you all.\nAnd of course, JAXA\u2019s Koichi Wakata, a very experienced astronaut, is on the International Space Station as we speak, and he has flown with us five times already.\u00a0 I also want to thank the Secretary of State.\u00a0 I want to thank my old buddy, Ambassador Emanuel, who I\u2019ll get to see in just a few weeks in Japan, and I want to thank all of you for being here.\nThe principles of diplomacy, democracy, and discovery are the core cornerstones of the U.S.-Japan alliance.\u00a0 Our nations are both spacefaring nations, nations poised to unlock the secrets of the universe.\u00a0 And today, we are once again reaffirming that Japan and the U.S. explore openly, explore peacefully, and explore together.\u00a0 And this framework that will be signed by the Secretary of State and the foreign minister, this framework deepens our partnership.\nSpace unites us.\u00a0 In this era of space exploration, every announcement and advancement is not an achievement for just a single country \u2013 it is a victory for all of humanity.\u00a0 And that is how the U.S. chooses to lead in this effort with Japan and others in the 21st century, on Earth and in the heavens.\nDeputy Administrator Melroy and I are looking forward to visiting Japan next month, and we are going to be there to grow the bond between NASA and JAXA.\u00a0 Our space programs have storied histories of barriers overcome and new worlds understood, and so today we chart a new chapter in a continuing adventure together as allies and partners.\u00a0 Welcome.\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Administrator.\u00a0 Next, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio will deliver remarks.\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Well, hello, everyone here.\u00a0 I am Fumio Kishida, prime minister of Japan.\u00a0 I am truly pleased that the framework agreement on Japan-U.S. space cooperation is being signed today.\nThe U.S.-Japan space cooperation has entered a new era with the Artemis project and many projects, including lunar activities, are already in the works by Japanese and U.S. astronauts.\u00a0 But I strongly hope that this agreement will robustly promote our space cooperation even further and also further expand the field of cooperation under the Japan-U.S. alliance, which has become stronger than ever under the leadership of President Biden, Vice President Harris, and myself.\nAllow me to commend the efforts of everyone from both sides in developing this Framework Agreement, and I am committed to continuing to working lockstep with the United States to deepen this collaboration.\nArigato gozaimasu.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Prime Minister.\u00a0 Next we will hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 And good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 It\u2019s especially wonderful to be here at NASA.\u00a0 I take a point of \u2013 as you would say in the Senate \u2013 personal privilege to say how good it is to be with the administrator.\u00a0 I can\u2019t help but thinking of him as senator for the many years that I had the honor of working, in effect, for him as staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee.\u00a0 So, Mr. Administrator, it\u2019s wonderful to be here with you and with the women and men of NASA at Headquarters together with friends from JAXA.\u00a0 And I realize that I\u2019m actually sharing this podium with three people who have been to space \u2013 the administration[i]\u00a0included.\nMr. Prime Minister, it\u2019s an honor to sit with you, with my friend Foreign Minister Hayashi, and with our ambassadors as well.\u00a0 This week, our governments have been holding incredibly productive and wide-ranging meetings that underscore that on virtually every issue of consequence to our people in Japan and the United States alike, we are stronger together.\nOur bilateral partnership is among the strongest in the world \u2013 in part because we\u2019re always adapting it to meet the evolving challenges of our time.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the case on everything from advancing security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, to bolstering our economic and energy security, to defending the rights at the core of the United Nations Charter.\nWe\u2019re also expanding the horizons of our partnership in a very literal way: through space cooperation.\u00a0 And here I also want to thank Vice President Harris for her leadership as chair of the National Space Council.\nFor decades now, Japan and the United States have worked together to extend humanity\u2019s reach in space.\u00a0 We\u2019ve long collaborated to support the International Space Station.\u00a0 We were two of the first signatories of the Artemis Accord that the prime minister referred to.\u00a0 We\u2019re partners in the Artemis Program, which will return astronauts to the lunar surface \u2013 including the first woman and the first person of color.\u00a0 We just signed a new arrangement to support the Lunar Gateway, which will prepare for future missions to Mars.\nThe Framework Agreement that we\u2019re about to sign will take our cooperation to new heights.\u00a0 It\u2019ll strengthen our partnership in areas like research on space technology and transportation, robotic lunar surface missions, climate-related missions, and our shared ambition to see a Japanese astronaut on the lunar surface.\nIn the last century, the space race electrified the world \u2013 seizing the imaginations of millions of people, awed by the men and women who dared to go into the unknown.\u00a0 It inspired generations of scientists, researchers, innovators, dreamers.\u00a0 And it paved the way for countless technological advances \u2013 in computers, satellites, GPS, camera lenses, medical equipment, and so much more.\u00a0 And these advances have improved the daily lives of people across the planet.\nNow, we\u2019re entering a new chapter of space exploration.\u00a0 And our ambitions are no less soaring than in President Kennedy\u2019s time, when he declared his commitment to \u201clanding a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth\u201d within the decade.\u00a0 And our achievements, I believe, will be no less impressive, or important, for the benefit of humankind.\nBut even more than in the past, we will reach new frontiers through an approach that is fundamentally collaborative.\nWe\u2019ve seen what international space collaboration can achieve.\u00a0 Just in the last two years, it put a rover on Mars and launched the most powerful space telescope ever, the James Webb Space Telescope.\u00a0 Just this week, that telescope confirmed the existence of an exoplanet for the first time \u2013 an Earth-sized planet located 41 light-years away from us.\u00a0 With Japan, our countries will soon make similar incredible discoveries, as we prepare to send a probe to Mars\u2019s moons, explore the South pole of our Moon, and more.\nAgreements like the one that we\u2019re signing today help create and strengthen the partnerships that are at the heart of this extraordinary progress.\u00a0 We need to harness the world\u2019s collective vision and all of our strengths to reach these new horizons.\nMajor General Bill Anders, a member of Apollo 8 \u2013 the first human spaceflight to reach the Moon \u2013 said, and I quote, \u201cWe came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.\u201d\nHe understood that one of space exploration\u2019s greatest powers \u2013 maybe one of its greatest gifts \u2013 is to bind people together, across continents, across oceans, in pursuit of knowledge, in pursuit of understanding.\nIt\u2019s in that spirit that the United States and Japan take this step.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0 And now for the main event.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and Japan\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs Hayashi Yoshimasa will sign the Framework Agreement for the United States and Japan.\nFor our participants on stage, please rise to join Secretary Blinken and Minister Hayashi.\n(The Framework Agreement was signed.)\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Please be seated.\nNext we will hear from Minister Hayashi.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 This is my honor to sign this historic agreement for Japan-U.S. Space Cooperation with my dear friend Tony here.\u00a0 With the exploration and the use of outer space growing increasingly active, the signing of this agreement is of extreme significance.\u00a0 I understand that as part of Artemis program, Japan and the U.S. are planning development of lunar exploration vehicles, lunar activities by Japanese and American astronauts.\u00a0 And so with the conclusion of this agreement between our two countries, numerous cooperative projects \u2013 including the above-mentioned plans \u2013 will be conducted efficiently under this agreement.\nI sincerely hope that Japan-U.S. space cooperation will further deepen based on this agreement, and it will benefit the future of all mankind.\u00a0 I anticipate more activities by both of our countries\u2019 experts working on space.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0 Thank you, Minister.\nAnd last but not least, Ambassador Rahm Emanuel, the floor is yours.\nAMBASSADOR EMANUEL:\u00a0 I think this is on.\u00a0 I got this.\u00a0 It\u2019s all right.\nWhen you\u2019re the fifth and final speaker, you\u2019re reminded of what Lyndon Johnson once said, which is that everything that needs to be said has been said; it just hasn\u2019t been said by everybody that needs to say it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMr. Prime Minister, thank you for your visit here.\u00a0 To my good friend \u2013 he\u2019s Administrator Nelson, but I have to call him Senator Nelson; he always was a senator as we worked together.\u00a0 And to Tony and to Hayashi-san, it\u2019s a pleasure to see you here.\nIt\u2019s been \u2013 this is a historic week in the United States and Japan relationship.\u00a0 And I cannot think of a more fitting way to conclude the prime minister\u2019s visit, for his heroic leadership, but to have this signing that symbolizes not just the exploration of space but the partnership and the friendship between the United States and Japan doing something in a peaceful way.\nWhen I think about back in May when the President was in Japan and launched the idea that we would have an incredible space partnership between Japan and the United States \u2013 he did it at the Kantei, pledged that there would be a Japanese astronaut as part of Artemis to go to the moon.\u00a0 A few months later, we signed the Gateway Agreement.\u00a0 A few months later, we signed this agreement, the Framework Agreement that initiates and lays out the roadmap for the next 10 years.\u00a0 And then in a couple of weeks we\u2019ll have Administrator Nelson in Japan.\u00a0 It\u2019s been quite a busy and active but productive nine months in the relationship.\nAnd I don\u2019t know about the rest of you \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m a little cynical \u2013 but when you see the pictures from the Webb program, if you had to close your mind eye and think, \u201cWhat does the heavens looks like?\u201d, those are the photos.\u00a0 It\u2019s the barrier of what \u2013 the sublime and the beginnings of what science looks like, and it captures the imagination.\u00a0 So whether it\u2019s a child from Tokyo or Topeka, a child from Chicago or Chiba, or a child from New Orleans or Nagoya \u2013 I just wanted to prove that I knew the cities of Japan \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and the United States \u2013 I\u2019m sure a lot of you didn\u2019t think I knew a city outside of Chicago.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR NELSON:\u00a0 But you included \u2014\nAMBASSADOR EMANUEL:\u00a0 Yeah, yeah, but I left everything out of Florida, just for the record.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nYou want them to feel a part of what we\u2019re exploring rather than apart from what we\u2019re exploring.\u00a0 Today is the beginning of another day, a different future, one of peace, one of prosperity, and one of partnership.\u00a0 This is a new beginning.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS MCGUINNESS:\u00a0 Thank you, Ambassador.\u00a0 Today you\u2019ve witnessed a bit of history with the signing of this latest agreement between our two nations.\u00a0 Thank you and\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to all of those who have worked so hard to make this agreement a reality, and thank you to our participants and guests.\u00a0 I hope you have a great day.\u00a0

everyone.\u00a0 Very good to see you all.\u00a0 And let me say first, Secretary Austin and I just concluded a very productive and wide-ranging discussion with our colleagues \u2013 Foreign Minister Hayashi, Defense Minister Hamada \u2013 and this of course is ahead of President Biden hosting Prime Minister Kishida at the White House on Friday.\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of the U.S.-Japan Alliance.\u00a0 For more than seven decades, it\u2019s been the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 ensuring the security, the liberty, the prosperity of our people and people across the region.\nOne of the Alliance\u2019s enduring sources of strength is our ability to adapt it to meet the evolving challenges as well as the opportunities before us.\nJapan\u2019s new national security strategy, national defense strategy, and defense buildup program reflect the scale and scope of that transformation.\nThese new strategies make clear Japan\u2019s commitment to invest in enhancing its capabilities, to take on new roles, and foster even closer defense cooperation with the United States and our mutual partners.\u00a0 We applaud Japan\u2019s pledge to double defense spending by 2027.\nJapan\u2019s strategies align closely with our own National Security Strategy \u2013 both in the key challenges we identify as well as in how to effectively address them.\nWe\u2019re committed to upholding shared values of democracy and human rights, defending the international rule of law, continuing to lead the world in tackling global challenges that no one country can solve alone, like the climate crisis and deadly viruses.\nWe agree that the PRC is the greatest shared strategic challenge that we and our allies and partners face.\nWe stand together with Ukraine against President Putin\u2019s war, which threatens the principles at the heart of the international rules-based order \u2013 including that all nations should be able to chart their own path, and have their sovereignty, their independence, their territorial integrity respected.\nIn the face of these and other challenges, today we discussed ways to deepen our coordination, including on allied command and control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, joint and shared usage of facilities, and increased bilateral exercises.\nMore than ever before, we\u2019re buttressing the U.S.-Japan Alliance through deeper cooperation with other allies and partners, through both regional and multilateral bodies.\nIn the face of the DPRK\u2019s unlawful and reckless missile launches \u2013 including the launch of a long-range ballistic missile over Japan in October \u2013 we\u2019re deepening our trilateral cooperation with the Republic of Korea to deter and, if necessary, defend against aggression.\u00a0 That\u2019s a pledge the leaders of our three countries underscored in their November trilateral summit.\nToday we held our first formal dialogue in this 2+2 format on extended deterrence \u2013 namely, to enhance the capability and credibility of our allied defense against a wide range of threats.\nIn June of 2022, Prime Minister Kishida became the first Japanese leader to attend a NATO summit.\u00a0 Japan is spearheading the NATO Asia Pacific partners\u2019 group \u2013 demonstrating the growing synergy between our Atlantic and Pacific alliances.\nWe\u2019re working together with our G7 partners to impose coordinated sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, and to help Ukraine repair, restore, and defend its embattled energy grid.\u00a0 We look forward to Japan\u2019s leadership in driving an ambitious agenda on these and other priorities during its presidency of the G7 this year, culminating in the Hiroshima Summit.\nJapan has also stepped up to help our European friends diversify their LNG supply in response to President Putin\u2019s weaponization of energy.\nWe\u2019re working to advance peace and security through regional bodies like ASEAN, whose centrality is vital to the Indo-Pacific; and through the Quad, including by working with India and Australia to expand what we call maritime domain awareness, basically giving our partners a better ability to detect and respond to challenges in their territorial waters like illegal fishing, trafficking, climate-related disasters.\nAt the United Nations, we\u2019re rallying member states to defend the rights at the core of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 It\u2019s been less than two weeks since Japan took its non-permanent seat at the Security Council; already we see its leadership on key priorities, like peacebuilding, Afghanistan, and the ministerial that the foreign minister will chair tomorrow on the rule of law.\nAnd because our National Security Strategy is so bound up in our economic and energy security, we\u2019re strengthening our cooperation in these spheres as well.\u00a0 In May we joined a dozen other economies that represent 40 percent of global GDP to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which sets out a roadmap to help our economies grow faster and fairer, so that all of our people can reach their full potential.\nLast month we kicked off the first Japan-U.S. Energy Security Dialogue; tomorrow our governments will co-host the Fifth Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Tokyo.\nWe\u2019re constantly expanding the horizons of our cooperation \u2013 beyond even our planet.\u00a0 Later this week, the foreign minister and I will sign a new agreement on U.S.-Japan cooperation in space.\u00a0 This agreement has been a decade in the making; it covers everything from joint research to working together to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon.\nThe bottom line is this: We and our people are always stronger and more secure together.\u00a0 Today we\u2019ve taken yet another step toward tightening already incredibly strong bonds.\nWith that, Yogi, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, Minister Hamada, and I have just come out of the Japan-U.S. 2+2 meeting, which we had in person, where we engaged in extremely meaningful exchange of views.\u00a0 During the past year since the previous 2+2 meeting, Russia\u2019s aggression of Ukraine, an event that shakes the foundation of international order, occurred, placing the international community at historical crossroads.\u00a0 In the midst of elevated severity in the security environment, today\u2019s Japan-U.S. 2+2 took place at a timing shortly after the release of strategic documents by both countries.\nToday\u2019s meeting delivered three major outcomes, and let me go through them one by one.\nFirst, based on the strategic documents of our two countries, we were able to hold in-depth discussions to confirm the alignment of the recognition on both sides over the regional strategic environment thoroughly and in detail.\u00a0 Specifically, first of all on China, China presents an unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge.\u00a0 Its foreign policy to recreate international order to serve its self-interest is a grave concern for the Japan-U.S. Alliance and for the whole of the international community.\nUpon confirming such shared recognition, we confirmed that Japan and the U.S. will continue to be united in raising objections against China\u2019s attempts to change status quo in the East China Sea, including its behavior that seeks to undermine long years of administration by Japan of the Senkaku Islands.\nWe also confirmed our strong opposition against unlawful claims and coercive and provocative efforts and actions by China in the South China Sea.\u00a0 We reaffirmed that the basic positions of our two countries over Taiwan remains unchanged, and confirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits, which is an essential element for the safety and prosperity of the international community.\u00a0 At the same time, we concurred that there have not been any changes to our policies to strengthen communication with China, including in the area of security.\nOn Russia, we reaffirmed our notion that aggression of Ukraine shakes the foundation of international order; accused Russia for its reckless nuclear rhetoric and attacks against civilian infrastructure; and concurred to continue our strong support to Ukraine.\u00a0 In addition, we shared our concern over the enhanced military cooperation between China and Russia.\nFurther, on North Korea, we strongly accused them for the launch of ballistic missiles during the past year at unprecedented frequency, and reaffirmed our unwavering commitment towards the complete denuclearization of North Korea based on UN Security Council resolutions.\nWith our positions perfectly aligned, we agreed to continue to work closely together in responding to the North Korea issue, including the pursuit of immediate resolution of the abduction issue.\u00a0 And we agreed about deepening the trilateral cooperation between the three countries.\nSecondly, we affirmed the further endeavors to bolster the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance in view of the new strategies based on the increasingly severe security environment.\u00a0 I welcomed the U.S. resolve to optimize the force posture in the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, and we decided to continue close consultation how to further optimize the U.S. force posture in Japan, including the readjustment of the USFJ realignment announced this time.\nExtended deterrence was one of the agenda, and there was in-depth discussions at the ministerial level.\u00a0 Spending some time having discussed that, we reaffirmed the strong U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan, underpinned by the full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear.\u00a0 Furthermore, there was an affirmation of strong support by the U.S. on the new security policy of Japan in that it will fundamentally reinforce the deterrence capability of the Alliance.\nIn addition, we agreed on the importance of deepening our cooperation in the areas of space and cyber, the promotion of technological cooperation, the further strengthening of information security.\u00a0 The fact that we were able to agree on the announcement of the applicability of Article\u00a0V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty on attacks on others in outer space was a significant achievement in terms of the reinforcement of deterrence capability of the Alliance as a whole.\nThirdly, we once again affirmed the importance of the reduction of the impact on the local communities, including Okinawa.\u00a0 We also reaffirmed that in order to avoid the continued use of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, the relocation to Henoko is the only solution.\nFurthermore, I once again requested the U.S. side on safe operations with utmost consideration to the impact on the local communities; appropriate responses to incidents and accidents, including sharing information in a timely manner; and on environmental issues, and confirmed our close coordination.\nThe joint announcement \u2013 the joint statement issued as a result of this 2+2 is a presentation of the vision of a modernized Alliance (inaudible) posture to win in the new era of strategic competition.\u00a0 The vision will be executed speedily, and together with Minister Hamada, Secretary Blinken, and Secretary Austin, we will constantly bolster the Japan-U.S. Alliance.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks to everyone for being here.\u00a0 At the outset, let me thank my friend and colleague, Secretary Blinken, for hosting today\u2019s U.S.-Japan 2+2 Ministerial Meeting.\u00a0 Thanks, Tony.\nMinister Hamada, Minister Hayashi, I want to underscore my support for the bold decisions that Japan has made in your 2022 national security strategy, your national defense strategy, and your defense buildup program.\u00a0 There is clear strategic alignment between the visions of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida.\u00a0 It is a shared commitment to uphold the rules-based international order and to strengthen resilient partnerships around the globe.\u00a0 And the essential U.S.-Japan Alliance is at the center of these efforts.\u00a0 Our respective defense strategies provide a strong foundation for our ongoing work to modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance.\u00a0 In addition, Japan\u2019s commitments to substantially increase its defense spending and to invest in defense institutions and infrastructure and capabilities will accelerate our Alliance\u2019s efforts.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019re meeting at such a consequential time, as Japan strengthens its own defense and further contributes to regional peace and stability.\nToday we welcomed an historic Alliance decision to optimize U.S. force posture in Japan by forward stationing more versatile, mobile, and resilient capabilities.\u00a0 These actions will bolster deterrence in the region and allow us to defend Japan and its people more effectively.\u00a0 In an increase \u2013 in an increasingly challenging security environment, we\u2019ve decided that the 12th Artillery Regiment would remain in Japan and be reorganized into the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment by 2025.\u00a0 We will equip this new formation with advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as anti-ship and transportation capabilities that are relevant to the current and future threat environments.\u00a0 These posture updates adhere to the basic tenets of the 2012 realignment plan, and they will strengthen our Alliance\u2019s ability to maintain regional peace and stability.\nWe also discussed updating our Alliance\u2019s roles and missions so that Japan can more actively contribute to regional security alongside the United States and other likeminded partners.\u00a0 And so in our meeting today we strongly endorsed Japan\u2019s decision to acquire a counterstrike capability, and we affirmed that close coordination on employing this capability will strengthen the U.S.-Japan Alliance.\u00a0 We also discussed a number of key issues including our shared interest in peace and stability in the East and South China Seas and around Taiwan and our commitment to \u2013 to the denuclearization of North Korea, and our efforts to increase multilateral cooperation with the Republic of Korea, Australia, and other likeminded partners and our growing cooperation across all domains, including space and cyber.\nNow, as you\u2019ve heard me say before, the People\u2019s Republic of China is a pacing challenge for the Department of Defense.\u00a0 Japan and the United States remain united in our concern over China\u2019s destabilizing actions, and I want to reaffirm the United States ironclad commitment to defend Japan with the full range of capabilities, including nuclear, and underscore that Article V of the mutual security treaty applies to the Senkaku Islands.\u00a0 And tomorrow Minister Hamada and I will sign new arrangements that will increase opportunities for the Japanese and the United States defense enterprises to closely cooperate on advanced technologies as well as increased linkages between our respective industrial bases.\u00a0 And our close consultations today have advanced our Alliance\u2019s efforts to address common challenges ahead of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s meeting at the White House this week.\nI\u2019ll close by reiterating that the U.S.-Japan Alliance remains a cornerstone of our Indo-Pacific strategy, and it\u2019s critical to upholding a free and open regional order.\u00a0 Our Alliance is stronger than ever, building on a foundation of teamwork, trust, and shared values that has underpinned our relationship for decades.\u00a0 And so there is no challenge that we can overcome if we continue to work shoulder to shoulder.\u00a0 Thank you.\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) At the outset, I extend my deepest appreciation to Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, and members of the U.S. side for having organized this meeting.\u00a0 My three colleagues have already mentioned the severity of the security environment surrounding us.\u00a0 As we live in this age of intense competition, in order to sustain a new rules-based international order and free and open Indo-Pacific, the role that the Japan-U.S. Alliance must play has never been so enormous.\u00a0 The national security and defense strategies of our two countries that have been prepared most recently are highly consistent at a degree never seen before and will serve as a strong infrastructure for our bilateral cooperation.\nWhat is noteworthy is the importance attached to the \u2013 attached by both countries to integrate all means and approaches to deter a situation from occurring.\u00a0 Alignment of our positions as such has been significant.\u00a0 At the same time, strategies don\u2019t end by just preparing them.\u00a0 In light of the severity of the security environment, both Japan and the U.S. is expected to put their strategies into action swiftly and steadily.\nBased on the new strategy, in order to expeditiously achieve the fundamental reinforcement of Japan\u2019s defense capabilities, I am committed to making maximum efforts to gain new capabilities, including counterstrike capability and to enhanced persistent warfare capability.\u00a0 I am much encouraged by the strong support shown by Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken as I shared with them such resolve.\u00a0 Japan and the U.S. must properly engage in discussions on strengthening partnership.\nDuring today\u2019s consultations, we agreed on the need to realize division of roles and missions assuming the fundamental reinforcement of Japan\u2019s defense capabilities.\u00a0 The four of us agreed to promote initiatives in extensive areas, including effective operation of counterstrike capability based on bilateral cooperation, strengthening collaboration in space and cyber, and deepening cooperation in equipment and technology.\nWe also agreed to deepen cooperation with partners, including Australia, ROK, ASEAN, and Europe, to expand partnership and based on our Alliance, because in the increasingly important extended deterrence in the region, I have listened to the extensive viewpoints of the U.S. from Secretary Austin.\u00a0 Based on that, in order for the U.S. extended deterrence to be even more reliable and resilient, we discussed what the two countries need to do in order to optimize the U.S. force posture in Japan.\u00a0 The current realignment plan was coordinated in 2012, but in order to deal with the increasingly severe security environment, both Japan and the U.S. have decided to readjust the plan while maintaining the fundamental principles.\nKeeping the 3rd Marines Division command and the 12th Marines Littoral Regiment in Okinawa will allow the forward-deployed U.S. force posture to have more versatile capabilities, be more resilient and more mobile.\u00a0 This effort will significantly strengthen the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and at the same time it will demonstrate the robust commitment of the U.S. to the defense of Japan.\u00a0 In order to execute these plans, we will coordinate closely with the U.S. side.\nI also mentioned that for the stable stationing and activities of USFJ, the understanding by the local community such as Okinawa is crucial.\u00a0 We will continue to work on the reduction of impact on Okinawa.\u00a0 It was extremely significant that, at a timing so soon after the two countries had formulated the strategic documents that will guide the future national security and defense policies, that the four ministers responsible for defense and foreign policy got together and had the opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions on how to implement their respective strategy.\u00a0 I shall continue the discussions in order to bolster our Alliance.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We will alternate questions per side.\u00a0 We will start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi there.\u00a0 Good evening.\u00a0 Thanks for this.\u00a0 Can I follow up on a couple of things that you just announced?\u00a0 Speaking about the Marine littoral regiment, both of the defense \u2013 both the Defense Secretary and defense minister spoke of the increasing \u2013 the increasingly challenging security environment.\u00a0 Can you be more specific in what you\u2019re responding to?\u00a0 Is this specifically China?\u00a0 Is these \u2013 are these contingencies in Taiwan or potentially in the Senkaku Islands, North Korea?\u00a0 And also you mentioned the impact in Okinawa.\u00a0 Is there any concern that this could aggravate tensions locally in Okinawa?\u00a0 Will this result in a net increase in the forces there?\u00a0 And if you don\u2019t mind, could I also ask about space?\u00a0 There have been some reports that space will now be included as part of the defense partnership.\u00a0 Could you comment on that?\nAnd for \u2013 on the American side, if you don\u2019t mind \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind a couple of questions that are a little bit off topic.\u00a0 To Secretary Austin, the situation in Ukraine \u2013 Soledar.\u00a0 There have been lots of reports the Wagner Group has claimed to control it, and there\u2019s been another shake-up in the Russian military command.\u00a0 What do you make of this?\u00a0 Do you think that it\u2019s fallen?\u00a0 What significance do you see?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, a couple of days ago \u2013 you were just in Latin America yesterday, but a couple of days ago in Brazil there was, of course, the unrest.\u00a0 Former President Bolsonaro remains in the United States.\u00a0 There have been some calls from the Democratic Party to make a persona non grata.\u00a0 How tenable is it to \u2013 for him to stay in Florida despite what happened a couple of days ago in Brasilia?\u00a0 Thanks very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 You want to start?\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0So I lost count \u2013 I lost count on a number of questions, but we\u2019ll try to knock them down.\u00a0 If we miss one, then we\u2019ll double back.\nFirst, let me begin with the question you asked on Soledar and whether or not it\u2019s fallen to the Russians.\u00a0 At this point, we can\u2019t corroborate that reporting.\u00a0 Of course, I\u2019ve seen some of that reporting, but you know that this has been a very fluid, dynamic environment, dynamic fight in that area.\u00a0 It\u2019s gone back and forth a number of times, and it really is some pretty brutal fighting.\u00a0 But the Ukrainians have acquitted themselves very, very \u2013 in a very impressive fashion as a \u2013 they\u2019ve fought a very \u2013 continue to fight a very determined fight.\nWe are focused on doing everything we can to help make sure that the Ukrainians have the capabilities that they need to be successful in their efforts to defend their sovereign territory.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been \u2013 we talk \u2013 I talk to my counterpart routinely.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to conduct another Ukraine Contact Group \u2013 Defense Contact Group meeting next week in Germany, where we\u2019ll get another \u2013 we\u2019ll get 50 or so ministers of defense together to talk about what Ukraine\u2019s needs are now and what they need to be successful going forward.\nSo you\u2019ve heard us say over and over again that we\u2019re going to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, and from everything that I can see from our allies and partners, they feel the same way.\u00a0 So we remain united in our efforts.\nOn the Marine littoral regiment, we believe that this brings \u2013 this capability brings a tremendous capability to the Alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019re replacing an artillery regiment with an outfit that\u2019s more lethal, more agile, more capable.\u00a0 And as you have seen from what\u2019s been published on this particular formation, it consists of a combat element, which is a battalion-size element; a long-range fires element, which allows us to \u2013 gives us an anti-ship capability, which I think is very, very important; and also a logistical element that helps sustain the overall regiment there.\nSo I think this is going to contribute in a major way in our efforts to help defend Japan, and also promote a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And that\u2019s really our focus.\u00a0 Japan \u2013 we share a common vision with Japan to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, and all the things that we\u2019re doing points towards that direction.\nSo I\u2019m going to stop there and allow Minister Hamada to comment, if you\u2019d like.\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Regarding the current topic, our position is, in Okinawa, that there are realignment in many other comments referred to.\u00a0 With regard to these aspects, we understand \u2013 and together with the U.S. forces, including the coordination, our discussion will have to take place.\u00a0 But at any rate, regarding the matters in Okinawa, that there is the relationship with the local communities, and we will have to continue our effort to explain in order to overcome these challenges.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Shaun, just to respond, I think, to a couple of other questions you asked.\u00a0 First, in terms of the security environment that we\u2019re dealing with, there\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s no secret that it is a more challenging one, and we see different challenges to the status quo coming from different countries \u2013 including China, including the DPRK, including of course Russia.\u00a0 Even though that aggression against Ukraine is happening in Europe, it has profound implications for countries around the world, including in Asia \u2013 because this is not only a challenge to Ukraine and the lives and livelihoods of its people, it\u2019s a challenge to the entire international rules-based order and the very principles that underlie that order that are so important in every part of the world: sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, the right to shape your own future.\u00a0 That\u2019s why Japan, from day one, has been such a strong partner with us and many other countries in seeking to uphold that order, whether it comes to Russia\u2019s aggression or in any other areas.\nYou asked about our cooperation in space.\u00a0 Well, there\u2019s cooperation in cyberspace and there\u2019s cooperation in outer space.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be putting out a statement, if it\u2019s not already out, that reflects the additional steps that we\u2019ve taken.\u00a0 But this is very significant.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to deepen our cooperation across every realm \u2013 land, sea, air, and yes, space, cyber and outer.\nThe outer space component of this is important to the security and prosperity of our Alliance.\u00a0 We agreed, as you\u2019ve heard, that attacks to, from, or within space present a clear challenge, and we affirmed that depending on the nature of those attacks, this could lead to the invocation of Article\u00a0V of our Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.\u00a0 That is significant.\u00a0 We\u2019ll sign, as I mentioned, a space agreement a little bit later this week at NASA.\nOn cyber, we have emphasized the foundational importance of cyber security and information security for our Alliance.\u00a0 We agreed there as well to deepen our collaboration.\u00a0 This is a challenge that we both face, other countries face; it\u2019s important that we work on it together.\u00a0 We\u2019re all learning lessons in dealing with the challenges that come in cyberspace.\u00a0 Being able to share best practices, being able to support one another, is more important than ever.\nWe\u2019re also committed in that light to bolstering technology cooperation as well as making joint investments in emerging technologies to try to further sharpen the competitive edge of the Alliance.\nLast question, as I heard it, with regard to Brazil.\u00a0 As President Biden told President Lula, we stand with the people of Brazil.\u00a0 We stand with Brazil\u2019s democracy and its institutions.\u00a0 The President will have an opportunity to confer directly and closely with President Lula when he visits Washington in early February, and the President looks very much forward to that.\nPresident Lula has called for an investigation of the events of January 8th.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to get ahead of that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve not received any specific requests from Brazilian authorities.\u00a0 Of course, if and when we do, we\u2019ll work expeditiously to respond, as we always do.\nAnd then with regard to individuals, we\u2019re talking now about people who are private citizens.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard various public statements that have been made by those individuals about their plans, but we really don\u2019t have anything to add, and it\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment on any individual\u2019s visa status.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Next, from the Japanese press, Miki-san of\u00a0Nikkei\u00a0newspaper company.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) My name is Miki of\u00a0Nihon Keizai Shimbun\u00a0company.\u00a0 I have a question to both foreign and defense ministers of Japan and the United States.\u00a0 In East Asia, there are concerns of unilateral change of status quo by force, and there are those who point out the Taiwan contingency risk.\u00a0 You\u2019ve mentioned the southwest defense bolstering, but what agreement have you reached in the 2+2 to upgrade the response and deterrence capability?\u00a0 And how will you go about in terms of integrated operations between SDF and U.S. forces?\nAnd in the renewed national security strategies, both countries positioned China as being a challenge for the international community.\u00a0 How do you assess the risk in terms of security by China in East Asia, and how will you respond?\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) First of all, on Nansei Islands, with severity of the security environment surrounding Japan increasing, in order to reinforce the defense of our nation, including the Nansei Islands, strengthening the deterrence and response capabilities of our Alliance is an urgent mission.\u00a0 At today\u2019s 2+2, we concurred on the decisive importance of joint initiatives at peacetime to deter armed attack against \u2013 and attacks that undermine regional stability.\nBased on such shared recognition, the joint statement issued today refers to concrete initiatives \u2013 for example, in the area including the Nansei Islands, joint use of Japan-U.S. facilities will be expanded and joint exercises and training will be increased.\nOn Taiwan, I refrain from responding to a hypothetical question on contingency in Taiwan.\u00a0 It has been the consistent policy of Japan that peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is important not only for Japan\u2019s security, but also for the stability of the international community at large, and that we hope to see Taiwan-related issues be resolved peacefully through dialogue.\nNow, on China, as explicitly mentioned in the new national security strategy, present external posture and military orientation of China are grave concerns for Japan and the international community.\u00a0 As we strive to secure peace and stability of Japan and the international community and strengthen international order based on rule of law, China presents an unprecedented and the greatest challenge.\u00a0 At the same time, Japan and China both bear important responsibility for regional and global peace and prosperity.\u00a0 Establishment of a constructive and stable relationship by Japan and China is essential for peace and stability of the international community, including the Indo-Pacific.\nDefense Minister?\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Yes.\u00a0 As mentioned by Minister Hayashi, that is our position.\u00a0 Based upon the mutual recognition of Japan and the United States in the area including Nansei Islands, we will expand the joint use of facilities of Japan and the United States, and we\u2019ve committed to increase joint exercises and joint trainings.\u00a0 In such form, we will upgrade the deterrence and response capabilities of our Alliance, which is necessary, and we will continue to work in close coordination with the United States following today\u2019s meeting.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I have little to add because my colleagues have covered it so well.\u00a0 Suffice to say that first, we are united in ways that, at least in my experience over the last 30 years, we\u2019ve never been before.\u00a0 There\u2019s greater convergence in our approach, greater alignment in our approach \u2013 both in terms of the way we see the challenges and how we propose to respond to them \u2013 than ever before.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s very significant, and you\u2019ve heard both ministers speak to it.\u00a0 The statements that we\u2019re putting out \u2013 or we\u2019ve already put out this afternoon \u2013 will reflect in detail that alignment, that convergence between Japan and the United States.\nWhen it comes to Taiwan, I think it\u2019s very important to note that what we\u2019ve seen from China in recent years \u2013 not recent months, recent years \u2013 is, unfortunately, an effort to undermine the longstanding status quo, a status quo that\u2019s maintain peace and stability for decades.\u00a0 We, on the other hand, want to sustain that status quo; we want to bolster it.\u00a0 We oppose any unilateral change to the status quo by either side.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue for a calm, resolute approach to uphold peace and stability.\u00a0 Japan in the United States are united in that effort.\nAs you\u2019ve heard us say, our Alliance is a cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And the steps that we announced today will strengthen the Alliance\u2019s ability to uphold the rules-based order that we are both very much committed to.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0I think that my colleagues have \u2013 did a \u2013 have done a tremendous job of outlining the key points here, and so I won\u2019t plow that ground again.\u00a0 But I would just say that we really do remain committed to enhancing resiliency and interoperability between U.S. and Japanese forces and deepening the operational cooperation.\u00a0 So the things that we touched upon today, especially the agreement to increase bilateral exercises and training, I think are a real powerful statement of that commitment.\u00a0 So I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on these issues going forward.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Our next question goes to Ryo Kiyomiya from\u00a0Asahi Shimbun.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much.\u00a0 I\u2019m Ryo Kiyomiya from\u00a0Asahi Shimbun, Washington, D.C. bureau.\u00a0 I have questions for each of you.\u00a0 First, Secretary Austin, while U.S. and Japan share the concern about the \u2013 China\u2019s military aggression, how can the U.S. manage the relationship with China and avoid miscalculation leading to the contingencies?\u00a0 And last October you said that you don\u2019t see an imminent invasion of Taiwan by China.\u00a0 Do you still hold that view?\nAnd also, if I may, Japan decided to establish our self-defense force joint headquarter.\u00a0 From your perspective, what would be the ideal Alliance command and control relationship between U.S. and Japan to enhance interoperability and readiness?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, regarding U.S.-China relations, how do you plan to manage and build the relationship with China during your upcoming engagement with China?\u00a0 And also, what kind of role do you expect Japan to play in diplomacy to manage this relationship?\nAnd finally, to Minister Hamada and Minister Hayashi, there is a growing sense of risk about China\u2019s invasion of Taiwan.\u00a0 In the previous 2+2 meeting, U.S. and Japan welcomed the robust progress on bilateral planning for contingencies.\u00a0 How would you evaluate the current progress on bilateral planning for contingencies so far with the U.S.?\u00a0 Also, from the perspective of deterring China\u2019s aggression, how do you evaluate the recent U.S. announcement of reorganization of Marines in Okinawa into the Marine littoral regiment?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0Okay, thank you.\u00a0 I think your first question was: how do we avoid miscalculation?\u00a0 You\u2019ve heard me say a number of times that it\u2019s absolutely critical that leaders of great powers maintain open lines of communication and be able to talk with each other.\u00a0 In that way, we can avoid miscalculation wherever possible.\u00a0 And you see us continuing to try to ensure that we keep those lines open, and I would invite my colleagues in China to meet us halfway there and work hard to keep those lines of communication open.\u00a0 And that is the primary and best way to avoid that miscalculation.\u00a0 Of course, I believe that our forces are trained and disciplined, and to the degree that they\u2019re going to do everything within their power to avoid any kind of misunderstanding or miscalculation.\u00a0 But again, that dialogue is enormously important.\nSo \u2013 and then your second question was regarding whether or not China is \u2013 whether or not an invasion of Taiwan by China is imminent.\u00a0 I won\u2019t second-guess Mr. Xi, but what I will tell you, what we\u2019re seeing recently, is some very provocative behavior on the part of China\u2019s forces and their attempt to re-establish a new normal.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve seen increased activity in \u2013 aerial activity in the straits.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen increased surface vessel activity around Taiwan.\u00a0 And again, we believe that they endeavor to establish a new normal, but whether or not that means that an invasion is imminent, I seriously doubt that.\nSo we will continue to watch and we will continue to work with our allies and partners to do everything that we can to ensure that we promote peace and stability in the strait and in the region overall.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And just quickly to \u2013 more broadly to add to that on China, as you know, President Biden, President Xi had a very open, candid conversation during the last G20 meeting in Bali, and they spoke about our intentions.\u00a0 President Biden shared our intentions and our priorities, and we got some sense of that from President Xi as well.\u00a0 As the Secretary of Defense just said, these lines of communication, starting with the presidents but also including many of us, are vitally important \u2013 vitally important to keep open and, I would hope, to deepen, because, as the Secretary of Defense said, what we don\u2019t want is for any misunderstanding to veer into conflict.\nI will have an opportunity to travel to China in the coming weeks to follow up on the President\u2019s discussions precisely to move forward on those lines of communication between us.\u00a0 We \u2013 both of our countries, Japan and the United States \u2013 have complex and consequential relationships with China, and there are clearly aspects of intense competition between us.\u00a0 There are aspects as well of cooperation, and it\u2019s important to see if we can pursue those.\u00a0 We hear from countries around the world the desire for the United States, China, Japan to manage this relationship responsibly and, if there are areas where we can cooperate that would be to the benefit not only of our own people but of people around the world, whether it\u2019s in climate, whether it\u2019s in global health, whether it\u2019s in dealing with drugs, we should pursue them.\nBut we are going to compete vigorously.\u00a0 The President\u2019s been very clear about that.\u00a0 We\u2019re not looking for conflict.\u00a0 We\u2019ll manage the competition responsibly, but we will compete vigorously.\u00a0 And we will seek to keep these lines of communication open and do all that we can to establish guardrails to prevent competition, as I said, from veering into conflict.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) First of all, U.S.\u2019s commitment and optimization of the posture in the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, is very much welcome.\u00a0 And including the recoordination of the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in order to optimize posture of USFJ, we decided to continue our close consultations.\u00a0 And this may not be a direct response to your question \u2013 I may have misunderstood your question \u2013 but if your question is implying on guideline, there was no discussion over U.S.-Japan guidelines.\u00a0 Regarding the necessity of review of the Japan-U.S. guidelines, of course, it is being constantly studied.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t assume that it will be immediately necessary.\u00a0 Thank you.\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) On the U.S.-Japan bilateral planning, in 2015, based upon the guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation, the Japan-U.S. governments are to prepare and renew bilateral planning.\u00a0 And we very much welcomed the steadfast progress of this task.\u00a0 And in order to respond to the very severe security environment in Japan, by maintaining the remaining Marine Corps in Okinawa after the realignment decision was made to keep the 3rd Division of the Marine Corps and the 12th Regiment of the Marine Corps and agreed to realign into MLR by 2025, we believe that this will bolster the USFJ posture in Japan.\u00a0 And this also is a demonstration of the unwavering commitment of the United States towards the defense of Japan.\u00a0 And together with the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities of Japan, this will significantly elevate the deterrence and response capabilities of our Alliance against attacks \u2013 armed attacks \u2013 to Japan.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) This will be the last question.\u00a0 Tajima-san,\u00a0Asahi Shimbun\u00a0newspaper.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Tajima,\u00a0Asahi Shimbun.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 During this meeting, I believe the new national security strategy and the new defense strategy were the main topics, so I asked Minister Hayashi and Minister Hamada \u2013 so the reinforcement of defense, including counterstrike capability and the meaning and the goal of significant increase of defense expense, how did you explain to the U.S. side, please?\nAnd then, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin, if I may, the strengthening of Japan\u2019s defense capability, what is your assessment?\u00a0 And the new strategies of both countries have been evidence coming forward \u2013 the deterrence and the response capability of the two countries.\u00a0 How do you intend to elevate?\u00a0 Earlier Minister Hayashi referred to the guideline, about the possibility of the need to revise the guideline.\u00a0 What is your view?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0 Please allow me to start.\u00a0 At the 2+2 today, the \u2013 based on the new strategy, we affirmed the future activities in order to bolster the defense response capabilities of the Alliance under the new strategy in light of the increasingly severe security environment.\u00a0 I mentioned that the fundamental reinforcement of Japan\u2019s defense capability will lead to further effective exercise of U.S. capabilities, and that in turn would mean a further reinforcement of the deterrence response capabilities of the bilateral Alliance and would play a huge role for the peace and stability of the region.\u00a0 The U.S. in response expressed firm support.\nAs I mentioned earlier, as a result of the 2+2, the joint statement to be released, this presents a vision of the Alliance in the new era of strategic competition.\u00a0 The plans will be implemented speedily, and together with Minister Hamada, Secretary Blinken, and Secretary Austin, we will constantly bolster the bilateral Alliance.\nDEFENSE MINISTER HAMADA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) If I may, regarding the fundamental reinforcement of Japan\u2019s defense in order to speedily realize about the significant increased defense, we will acquire new capabilities, including war sustainability and counterstrike capability, and I expressed my very strong commitment.\u00a0 As Minister Hayashi just mentioned, the U.S. side mentioned that they will strongly support Japan\u2019s new strategy, that it is a major evolution of the bilateral Alliance.\nBased on today\u2019s discussion, in this most severe and complex security environment after the war, we will fundamentally reinforce the defense capability, including the counterstrike capability.\u00a0 And together, in order to make the U.S. Alliance be a contribution to peace, stability, and prosperity of the region and the world, we will continue to work with Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, and Minister Hayashi to strengthen the Alliance.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you for the question.\u00a0 It\u2019s very simple:\u00a0 We heartily welcome the new strategies, especially because there is, as I said and we\u2019ve all said, remarkable convergence between our strategy \u2013 strategies \u2013 and Japan\u2019s.\u00a0 We applaud the commitment to increased investment; to enhanced roles, missions, and capabilities that you\u2019ve heard; to closer cooperation not only between the United States and Japan, but as well with other allies and other partners on a bilateral basis but also on a trilateral and multilateral basis.\u00a0 We already have a strong foundation.\u00a0 That\u2019s only going to grow.\nAs we read them, these new documents really reshape the Alliance\u2019s ability to promote peace and protect the rules-based order in the region but also beyond, around the world.\u00a0 I think what you\u2019re seeing in real time is an Alliance that is modernizing, and the United States and Japan are working in lock step to be prepared for the emerging challenges in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.\nSo we could not be more pleased with the work that we\u2019re doing together, but also, and I have to say for Japan\u2019s extraordinary leadership, I know President Biden will have an opportunity to share that appreciation with Prime Minister Kishida when he welcomes him here to Washington later this week.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 I certainly agree with Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 There is clear strategic alignment between the visions of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida.\u00a0 You see that reflected in the strategies as you put them side by side.\u00a0 We are all focused on maintaining a rules-based international order and promoting peace and stability in the region.\nSo what you\u2019ve heard us talk about today \u2013 the things that we discussed in the meeting \u2013 really bring that strategy to life.\u00a0 Optimizing force posture, agreeing to increase our bilateral exercises and training events \u2013 all of those things are real good indicators that all of us are committed to making sure that, as Prime Minister Hamada has said previously, we don\u2019t just write strategies, we do the things necessary to be able to execute them.\u00a0 And this is work that\u2019s never finished, okay, so we will continue to work to optimize force posture and increase interoperability so that we maintain a credible deterrent force.\u00a0 And I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to do that, what I would call hard government work.\u00a0 But thank you very much.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 That concludes the press conference.\n# # #\n\n"}, {"url":

noches a todos.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Welcome, Mr. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Madam Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada M\u00e9lanie Joly.\n(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) M\u00e9lanie Joly.\u00a0 We are thankful for the presence of Marcelo Ebrard\u00a0Casaub\u00f3n, minister to foreign affairs in Mexico,\u00a0and most especially, the attendance of the negotiators of this very important declaration that is the decisive action of these three countries to go forward to promote \u2013 in promoting the anti-racism, inclusive, and equal societies, most especially democratic societies.\u00a0 And so let us listen to the message of Madam Minister of Foreign Affairs from Canada M\u00e9lanie Joly.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for this kind presentation.\nThank you so much for being with us today and thank you for addressing these important topics on inclusivity, inclusion (inaudible).\n(In English) Everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, no matter their race, religion, gender identity, or orientation.\u00a0 As leaders from Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, we have a responsibility to combat discrimination and hate in all its forms.\u00a0 Today we are committing to doing just that.\u00a0 By signing the declaration for racial equity and inclusion, we are pledging to uproot deep and longstanding inequalities.\u00a0 We know we can\u2019t change the past, but we can work towards a more just and inclusive future.\nThis declaration is a historic step in our work to eradicate deep and \u2013 deep-seated injustice.\u00a0 Diversity is a fact, but inclusion is a choice.\u00a0 How we choose to incorporate the diversity of our communities can mean the difference between a stagnant and thriving country and continent.\u00a0 While we have certainly made progress, systemic racism and bigotry is still a daily reality for many.\u00a0 It\u2019s dehumanizing, humiliating, and above all else \u2013 above all else, unacceptable and it has no place in society.\nThat is why Canada has been taking action.\u00a0 As we are engaged on the path of reconciliation, we have continued to tackle systemic inequities and discrimination against indigenous peoples of Canada.\u00a0 We sat also down and listened to marginalized communities, incorporating their recommendations in the new Canadian anti-racism strategy.\nThe work to rid our societies of intolerance will not be easy, but it will be necessary.\u00a0 Canada is by no means immune to intolerance.\u00a0 Anti-indigenous, anti-black, anti-Asian, and anti-Semitic hate have sharply risen.\u00a0 Muslim communities in Canada have experienced several horrific, deadly Islamophobic attacks in recent years.\u00a0 That is why we must take further action.\u00a0 In our upcoming action on combating hate, we will address this head on.\n(Via interpreter) With both our friends, Mexico and the United States, Canada is committed to work together and to accept all people as they are without any violence, without any bias, and together.\u00a0 Together we will use our leadership and use our platforms to change our attitudes and behaviors.\nMerci.\u00a0 Gracias.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR VELASCO:\u00a0\u00a0Merci beaucoup, Madame Joly.\n(Via interpreter) And now, Secretary Blinken.\n(In English) Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Gracias,\u00a0Roberto, and\u00a0buenas noches a todos.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be here, to be here with some really extraordinary colleagues as well.\u00a0 I\u2019m really honored to be seated here with my friends Marcelo and M\u00e9lanie to sign what is an important declaration.\u00a0 And you heard M\u00e9lanie address it so eloquently. \u00a0It goes to a common ideal that is at the core of our democracies: that we\u2019re all better off when every individual in our societies enjoys equal rights and equal opportunities.\u00a0 And it reflects a fundamental recognition that if we want to improve the lives of our citizens, it\u2019s in our interest to ensure that all communities and individuals can reach their full potential \u2013 not just within our own countries, but across North America, across our hemisphere, across the world.\nLike everything that we\u2019re focused on at this summit, we\u2019re more effective at delivering on this goal when we work together.\u00a0 That is the entire premise of the North America Leaders\u2019 Summit.\u00a0 It\u2019s animating the work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 And the declaration that we\u2019re signing today sets out three ways that we\u2019re going to do that, so let me just briefly touch on them.\nFirst, the fight for greater equity and inclusion begins at home.\u00a0 It begins in Canada, it begins in Mexico, it begins in the United States.\u00a0 In every nation, members of marginalized groups face discrimination.\u00a0 They face barriers that prevent them from participating fully in society.\u00a0 It\u2019s a daily reality for people from indigenous communities and communities of African descent, women and girls, LGBTQI+ people, people with disabilities, religious minorities and others, including in the United States.\nWith this declaration, each of our nations acknowledges the responsibility to work with fierce urgency to knock down these enduring barriers and to try to stamp out the prejudice at their root.\nOn his very first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities through the federal government, bringing our entire government together in an effort to address these challenges.\nThe willingness of each of our three countries to acknowledge that we all have significant work to do to root out discrimination and inequity at home shows that we\u2019re willing to ask the same of ourselves as we\u2019re asking of others.\u00a0 And that\u2019s vital to our legitimacy when it comes to pursuing the declaration\u2019s second commitment: redoubling our collaboration to advance equity and racial justice around the world.\u00a0 The United States, Mexico, and Canada have long worked together on this goal. \u00a0It\u2019s at the heart of the commitment that our democracies made to uphold the Inter-American Democratic Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nAt the State Department we\u2019re committed to integrating this work across the entirety of our foreign policy.\u00a0 Last June, I had the opportunity to establish our first special representative for racial equity and justice, who is charged with advancing the human rights of people from historically marginalized racial and ethnic communities around the world, and I\u2019m very grateful to have our Special Representative Cormier Smith here with us today.\u00a0 Thank you for the work that you\u2019re doing every day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBy making this a priority across our bilateral relationships, our multilateral relationships, we know it\u2019s the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also the smart thing to do.\u00a0 It\u2019s in our interest because more equal countries tend to be more stable, they tend to be more secure, they tend to be more prosperous partners.\u00a0 That\u2019s good for the United States.\nThird, we\u2019re better at advancing equity and inclusion when we draw on the knowledge, on the expertise, on the experience of leaders outside of government.\u00a0 In that spirit, we\u2019re establishing a trilateral racial equity and inclusion expert network to share knowledge, to share best practices for advancing equity and racial justice.\nThat\u2019s just one way that we\u2019ll integrate our citizens into this effort.\u00a0 In April, the United States will host the first-ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver.\u00a0 Diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility will be a key part of the discussions that we hold there, ranging from strengthening public health and good governance to fostering innovation in clean energy transitions.\u00a0 And these discussions will incorporate not only local officials but also leaders from civil society, from the private sector, from youth groups, from academia.\nWe have a lot to learn from these groups.\u00a0 Just take a look at our history.\u00a0 So much of the progress we\u2019ve made as societies has actually been driven by our citizens.\u00a0 They put a spotlight on discrimination, on inequities.\u00a0 They\u2019ve led efforts that have inspired people not only in our own countries but across borders.\nThis is, simply put, one of our greatest strengths as democracies, that we trust our people.\u00a0 We trust our citizens to help fix some of our most intractable challenges; to be part of the ongoing process of, as we like to say in the United States, trying to form a more perfect union.\u00a0 That is at the heart of our national experience, of our national enterprise \u2013 this idea that it\u2019s in the work that we do every single day to make our societies a little bit better, a little bit stronger, a little bit more inclusive.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we make progress.\nIn this, as in so much of what we do, we\u2019re fortunate to have neighbors who share our highest ideals and a steadfast commitment to keep working to make them a reality.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pleasure to be with you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR VELASCO:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) and prior to giving the mike to Minister Ebrard, we recognize the attendance of the U.S. and Canada ambassadors, Mr. Clark \u2013 Graeme Clark \u2013 and the under secretaries Brian Nichols, David Morrison, and Michael Grant, who are here in attendance, as well as the Parliamentarian Secretary Sidhu and many high officers representing both countries.\u00a0 Minister, you have the floor.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you in three languages.\nIt is a pleasure to see you here and to greet you.\u00a0 The protocol we are about to sign today, we \u2013 the method is the other way around.\u00a0 First we\u00a0suggest an agreement and then each sees to it in their own countries, but this agreement came forth because we were at the same point exactly.\u00a0 Interesting \u2013 three countries thinking exactly the same way in regard to our internal policies.\u00a0 This is quite an opportunity and we are very lucky, because you don\u2019t have to start convincing anybody about what is it we have to do.\u00a0 Rather, we should start getting organized, which we are already doing.\nIn the case of Mexico, racism is something quite relevant.\u00a0 For a long time, nobody spoke about racism in Mexico.\u00a0 Many studies have been undertaken.\u00a0 This is a very important topic.\u00a0 We have visited our history in regard to slavery \u2013 nothing said in textbooks, at \u2013 in school about slavery in Mexico.\u00a0 So you say, \u201cWas there any slavery in Mexico?\u00a0 Oh, unheard of.\u201d\u00a0 Many people came to Mexico in that regime without \u2013 without mentioning the colonial history, so racism is a current topic that has to do with the design of our society whether we like it or not.\u00a0 Racism in Mexico is a synthesis of the inequalities \u2013 gender inequalities, many other inequalities, racial inequalities \u2013 and we\u2019ve made great efforts so far to dismantle the culture of racism.\nIt\u2019s culture.\u00a0 This is no easy topic to deal with, but this is a fight we must lead to dismantle racism in Mexico.\u00a0 We have 63 live languages, 63 indigenous communities in our countries.\u00a0 President\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador requested us to make great efforts to revisit the historical sites in Mexico and the situations like the Yaquis in Mexico, where they were practically exterminated because they were defending their land and the water.\u00a0 That community survived.\u00a0 That was important.\u00a0 So what we\u2019ve done is go back \u2013 not only recognize that foe and ask forgiveness for what happened 200 years ago, but what can we do to do better in the society we currently have.\u00a0 Same thing happened with the Mayans.\nAnd I mentioned 63 languages, 63 ethnic groups.\u00a0 Recently in the U.S., our president asked us that the consulates \u2013 Mexican consulates in the U.S. \u2013 when you call them on the phone, don\u2019t force everybody to speak Spanish, because it\u2019s not their maternal language.\u00a0 If you\u2019re calling the U.S., people speak Nahuatl, and they work in the U.S.\u00a0 They speak Otomi, they speak Zapoteco.\u00a0 And for the first time in our history, we\u2019re taking phone calls in their maternal languages \u2013 well, only have three languages, but we need to cover all 63 languages.\nHence, when we see that in the U.S., the Biden administration has similar concerns based in the U.S. context, and Minister Trudeau, every time we meet, it\u2019s a great concern of his \u2013 this is no discourse, this really moves him deeply.\u00a0 And we tell the story I\u2019m telling you now.\u00a0 So let\u2019s do something together.\u00a0 So if we\u2019re doing something in, say, along the same lines, let\u2019s have a common cause.\u00a0 This is not a \u2013 this is not a random situation, because we\u2019re sharing values that are tied to and pursuing more equal societies, more inclusive, more just.\nSo, of course, I congratulate my colleagues and everybody that helped us realize that we are leading a common battle together, but we have the same cause.\u00a0 We have the same motive to go on and to go forward.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR VELASCO:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Prior to signing this document, we need to recognize the presence of the Mexican ambassadors in Washington, Moctezuma, and our designate ambassador in Canada, Carlos Joaquin, and Claudia Morales, incumbent at the national commission to prevent and eradicate discrimination.\u00a0 And now let us sign this very important partnership of North America for equality and racial justice.\n(The declaration was signed.)\n(Applause.)\nMR VELASCO:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) So the meeting stands adjourned.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 The meeting is adjourned.\n\n"},

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Benjamin Franklin Room", "date": "January 4, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, first of all, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 A Happy New Year to everyone.\u00a0 This is actually the first event that I\u2019ve had an opportunity to do in this new year, and I think that\u2019s very fitting, and only underscores the importance that this department attaches to it, and that I attach to it personally.\nDirector Klein, Jen, thank you for the introduction, but also and especially for your leadership, for the Gender Policy Council\u2019s leadership in developing the U.S. Global Women\u2019s Economic Security Strategy that we are, in fact, launching today.\nJen and I have been colleagues, friends, going back a few years.\u00a0 I think we both started out together in the Clinton administration in grade school, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But I am just grateful for the collaboration that goes forward every day.\nAnd Kat, I\u2019m so grateful to you for your remarkable leadership of GWI in this very consequential time, and especially for the remarkable collaboration that we have between the White House, the State Department, and the other agencies in our government.\u00a0 That is a big difference-maker.\u00a0 This strategy would not be possible without the vital contributions of so many, starting with another dear friend and close colleague, Administrator Power.\u00a0 Her team at USAID has done remarkable work on this, and you\u2019re going to hear more from Samantha in a short while.\u00a0 The GWI office here at State, besides Kat, an amazing team, doing great work.\u00a0 And again, across our entire government.\nWe\u2019re also deeply fortunate to have the collaboration and leadership of the United States Congress.\u00a0 And I\u2019m told that Sheila Jackson Lee may be in the house somewhere.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\u00a0 Andr\u00e9 Carson, in the house anywhere, I think was going to join us.\u00a0 But to you, to Barbara Lee who was going to be with us this morning but I think got tied up on the Hill, so grateful for this collaboration, for the leadership that you\u2019ve demonstrated over so many years \u2013 and which is coming to fruition in this strategy.\nI especially, though, want to say to our partners in civil society, the private sector, other governments, women from all walks of life \u2013 some of you are here in person, some of you are tuning in virtually \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your input; thank you for the collaboration; thank you for ensuring that this strategy reflects the breadth and the depth of our vision for women\u2019s economic security.\nPresident Biden came into office with a commitment to gender equality and equity because, as he put it, and I quote: \u201cgovernments, economies, and communities are stronger when they include the full participation of women.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s as simple and as straightforward as that.\nAs you just heard from Jen, he has put that commitment into action, including through the first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, which brings a whole-of-government approach to supporting women and girls both here at home, but also around the world.\nAt the State Department, the idea that every woman and girl should be able to reach her full potential is central to our diplomacy.\u00a0 Whenever women\u2019s rights and fundamental freedoms come under threat, we speak up, we mobilize others, we take action.\nPromoting gender equality and equity is also an affirmative part of our approach, because we recognize that doing so is essential to addressing some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges.\u00a0 We need women\u2019s full economic participation to actually lead an inclusive recovery from the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 As you\u2019ve heard, we need their leadership in resolving conflict.\u00a0 We need their ideas and their innovation to tackle the climate crisis.\nThe strategy that we\u2019re putting forward has at its heart a simple vision: creating a world in which all women and girls everywhere can contribute to and benefit from economic growth and global prosperity.\u00a0 That\u2019s a world in which we will all be better off.\u00a0 Closing the gender gap in the workforce by 2025, as you\u2019ve heard, would add up to $28 trillion to the global economy.\u00a0 Especially at a time when we are working to recover from COVID, deal with the impact of climate, address the many conflicts that are also holding back the global economy, that contribution is more vital than ever.\nThe strategy focuses on breaking down some of the barriers that stand in the way of women to full economic participation.\u00a0 Jen and Kat alluded to some of them \u2013 discriminatory policies that perpetuate unequal pay or limit access to credit that women entrepreneurs and innovators need to start and grow businesses; laws that ban women from energy, manufacturing, and other industries in certain countries; attitudes and practices that drive women out of education and out of the labor market.\nThe strategy that we put in place is focused on supporting women and girls in all of their diversity, including the women who most often face the greatest and highest barriers, such as those from marginalized backgrounds, from religious minorities, those with disabilities, LGBTQI+ persons.\u00a0 And we\u2019re committed to standing up for women wherever their rights are threatened, including in Afghanistan, as unfortunately we continue to see deepen and get worse.\nLet me just spend a few minutes addressing in a little bit more detail the four key lines of effort that are at the heart of this strategy.\nFirst, we will advance women\u2019s economic competitiveness so that more women can fully participate and lead in all sectors, in all industries \u2013 including as CEOs and board members.\u00a0 One way we\u2019re helping to do that is through programs like WE-Champs, which will provide technical assistance and training to women\u2019s chambers of commerce and business associations in 18 countries across Europe to support women-owned small businesses.\u00a0 That\u2019s one practical example of how we will bring that first pillar of the strategy to life.\nSecond, we will strengthen the foundational support \u2013 child care, elder care \u2013 that allows women to participate equitably in the economy.\u00a0 As you know, as you\u2019ve heard again this morning, COVID-19 forced millions of women around the world to withdraw from the workforce to take on caregiving responsibilities for their families.\u00a0 So we will expand access to options so that caregivers, most of whom are women, can actually return to work.\u00a0 To do that, we\u2019re supporting programs like the World Bank\u2019s Invest in Childcare initiative, which will help improve access to quality, affordable child care in low- and middle-income countries around the world.\nThird, we will promote women\u2019s entrepreneurship by addressing some of the challenges that too often hold women back, including a lack of membership \u2013 of mentorship, excuse me, and training opportunities.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to both create and also, as appropriate, replicate efforts like the U.S.-India Alliance for Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment.\u00a0 That connects the private sector and civil society to provide Indian women with technical skills and networking opportunities to help them grow their businesses.\u00a0 At the alliance\u2019s launch, Google India committed to mentoring 1 million Indian women entrepreneurs; we\u2019re working with other partners to increase that number.\u00a0 That would have a remarkable impact.\nFinally, we will work with partners to help dismantle some of the societal, legal, and regulatory barriers that stand in the way of having a level playing field, like laws that make it more challenging for women to work in certain roles, limiting their career progression.\nNow, if you look at some of the work and studies that have been done \u2013 for example, the World Bank \u2013 women have equal legal economic standing with men in 12 countries around the world \u2013 12 countries around the world \u2013 including through equal pay and legal protections in the workplace.\u00a0 So there is a huge amount of work to be done there, and, looking at the glass half-full as opposed to half-empty, a tremendous amount of opportunity as we grow the number of countries that offer genuinely equal opportunity.\u00a0 We\u2019ll encourage countries to repeal discriminatory laws; we\u2019ll advocate for reforms that promote gender equality, in part by showing the opportunity posed by closing these gender gaps.\nAcross each of these lines of effort, we will work in tandem with partners around the world.\u00a0 Indeed, we\u2019ll be working with all of you.\u00a0 Because we need all hands on deck if we\u2019re actually going to make a difference, if we\u2019re going to build sustainable, long-lasting change.\nThat includes, for our part, working with counterparts from other governments to develop their own domestic and global strategies for women\u2019s economic security.\u00a0 It includes applying the lessons from this work across the United States Government as we build out action plans for each agency and each department to advance women\u2019s economic security.\nAt the end of the day, if you sort of cut all of this away and go to the heart of what we\u2019re talking about, there\u2019s also something very simple and straightforward: \u00a0Promoting women\u2019s economic security is the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also the smart and necessary thing to do.\u00a0 When everyone can contribute to their full potential, our economies are more prosperous, our societies are more full of opportunity, our nations are more peaceful, and everyone is better off.\u00a0 There, too, it\u2019s as simple and as straightforward as that.\nThere\u2019s a huge amount of work to be done to make this real, to take the strategy that we\u2019ve now put in place and to implement it.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to take, as I said, all hands on deck.\u00a0 The work that so many of you have done to bring us to this moment when we have a strong strategy on paper has been absolutely essential.\u00a0 That\u2019s the good news.\u00a0 The bad news is we now have to get to work to make it real, and we\u2019re counting on all of you to help us do that.\nThank you very, very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-27/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken at a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Press Briefing Room", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "December 22, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Very good to see everyone here this afternoon.\nIn the first year of our administration, we focused on rebuilding and revitalizing America\u2019s alliances and partnerships, weaving them together as well in new coalitions of common purpose.\u00a0 As you all saw, we reinvigorated our engagement with NATO, with the European Union, the United Nations, the G7, ASEAN, the OECD.\u00a0 We elevated and strengthened the Quad.\u00a0 We created AUKUS, the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, among many other groupings.\nThe logic here was simple and straightforward:\u00a0 We\u2019re in a fundamentally stronger position to address the issues that actually affect the lives of the American people when we do so alongside the many countries that share our fundamental interests and values.\nIn year two, we showed why this was a smart and important investment.\u00a0 Whether we were addressing threats and risks posed by strategic competitors, combating global challenges like the climate crisis and the pandemic, or seizing opportunities to improve Americans\u2019 lives in tangible ways, our alliances and our partnerships proved the vital difference.\nWe kept up a pretty relentless pace of broadening and deepening our engagement across the world, hosting the Summit of the Americas, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the first-ever U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit, the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.\nWe drew enormous power as well as credibility from unprecedented investments in our economic strength and technological edge here at home \u2013 the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nSo, today, what I wanted to spend a few minutes doing, with your tolerance, is to highlight four of the most consequential areas where diplomacy delivered in 2022.\nFirst, we rallied the world to ensure that Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine is a strategic failure.\u00a0 Since February 24th, we\u2019ve brought together dozens of allies and partners to promote security, economic and humanitarian support to the Ukrainian people as they stand up for their country\u2019s democracy, its sovereignty, and its independence.\u00a0 Our collective support \u2013 including now an additional $1.85 billion in U.S. military assistance the President announced yesterday \u2013 has enabled Ukraine\u2019s fighters to go on the counter-offensive, liberating their people, retaking more of their territory.\nNATO has never been stronger or more united.\u00a0 The Alliance adopted a new Strategic Concept and added more forces and resources to our collective defense.\u00a0 We doubled the number of battlegroups along NATO\u2019s eastern flank.\u00a0 We\u2019ve increased deployments in the Baltics.\u00a0 We\u2019re on the cusp of adding Finland and Sweden as new members of the Alliance.\nWe worked with allies and partners to impose the strongest-ever sanctions and export controls on President Putin and those enabling his war of aggression \u2013 significantly diminishing the Russian military\u2019s access to funds, to goods, to technologies that are critical to the war effort.\u00a0 By any measure, the Russian war machine is in dire straits.\u00a0 U.S. diplomatic leadership has been indispensable in building and maintaining this unity of purpose and also this unity of action.\u00a0 Meanwhile, we brought our diplomatic muscle to bear on isolating Russia at the United Nations and other international organizations, and to reaffirming global support for the core principles of the UN Charter that President Putin is trying to shed.\nNow, we know that a tough winter lies ahead for Ukrainians, as President Putin pursues his new strategy of trying to freeze Ukrainian men, women, children, the elderly to death.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with the G7 and other allies and partners to repair, to replace, and defend Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, including bolstering its advanced air defense through precision systems like the Patriot missile battery that President Biden announced yesterday.\nWe are with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\u00a0 That\u2019s the message President Biden delivered personally to President Zelenskyy when he hosted him at the White House.\u00a0 It\u2019s a commitment backed up by robust and enthusiastic bipartisan support in Congress, which was on full display last night.\nMaintaining that support is crucial, because President Putin continues to show no interest in meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 We agree with President Zelenskyy that diplomacy is the only way to definitively end Russia\u2019s war.\u00a0 Until President Putin changes course, the best way to improve the prospects of a just and durable peace, to actually advance the prospects for meaningful diplomacy, is sustaining our strong support for Ukraine.\nSecond, we accelerated strategic convergence with our allies and partners on the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 This is crucial, for while Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, the PRC is our only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.\nBack in May, I set out our strategy to meet the challenge posed by the PRC: invest in the foundations of our strength at home; align with our partners and allies; compete with China so that we can defend our interests and realize our vision for the future.\u00a0 Our diplomacy has played a key role in carrying out that strategy.\nWe set out an affirmative approach for a free and open Indo-Pacific that draws on the views of many of our partners inside and outside the region, and that has in turn informed their own strategies.\u00a0 Together with the European Union we strengthened our complementary toolkits on key challenges posed by the PRC, from economic coercion to human rights.\u00a0 We\u2019ve deepened our cooperation on investment screening and export controls of sensitive and emerging technologies.\nFor the first time, NATO\u2019s Strategic Concept committed to address the PRC\u2019s systemic challenges to transatlantic security.\u00a0 We deepened the Alliance\u2019s coordination with Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and our other Pacific allies.\nWe\u2019re united in our commitment to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and we continue to raise concerns and take joint action around the PRC\u2019s human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, the erosion of freedom of speech and the press in Hong Kong.\nEven as we competed vigorously with the PRC, we\u2019ve worked carefully to prevent our competition from veering into conflict.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to manage this relationship responsibly, building on the candid and productive discussion President Biden and President Xi had in Bali \u2013 a conversation I look forward to advancing when I visit the PRC early next year.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to pursue cooperation on issues that demand that the United States and China work together \u2013 for the good of our people, but also for the good of people around the world.\nThird, we mobilized broad-based coalitions to deliver solutions to the shared global challenges that so many of us face, including on food security, on health, energy and climate, inclusive economic growth \u2013 challenges that have a real impact on the lives and the livelihoods of the American people, and that we cannot solve effectively alone.\nWe led the global response to an unprecedented global food security crisis \u2013 driven by COVID, climate, and conflict \u2013 worsened significantly by President Putin\u2019s war.\nIn 2022 alone, we contributed $11 billion in humanitarian and food security assistance.\u00a0 We hosted a Food Security Ministerial and summit with the African Union and the European Union to marshal the resources needed to save lives in the immediate, but also to help countries build their own capacity for resilient, sustainable agricultural production.\nWe made significant strides in ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 providing nearly $20 billion for the global response, distributing more than 670 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to over 115 countries.\nWe launched and led the Global Action Plan, which brought together dozens of countries to get shots in arms, to bolster health supply systems, to combat misinformation and disinformation.\nWe also took steps to ensure that the world is better prepared to prevent, to detect, and respond to future outbreaks.\u00a0 We worked with the G20 to create a new World Bank fund to help countries strengthen their pandemic preparedness.\u00a0 We will train 500,000 health workers over the next five years across our own hemisphere in Latin America.\u00a0 We\u2019ll invest $4 billion in health workers in Africa by 2025.\nOn climate, we leveraged historic investments at home and abroad to accelerate the clean energy transition and adapt to the effects of a warming climate.\u00a0 This is not just our responsibility; we also see it as a once-in-generations opportunity to create good-paying jobs for Americans.\nWe forged new regional partnerships to make our economies more resilient, more sustainable, more prosperous, more inclusive \u2013 including the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, whose members represent 40 percent of global GDP, and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.\nTogether with the G7, we launched the $600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGII, to develop a high-standard, transparent alternative for infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries.\nFourth, we used the power of American diplomacy to advance peace and prevent and mitigate conflict.\u00a0 Together with my counterparts from Israel, Morocco, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, I took part in the historic Negev Summit to advance integration and normalization in the Middle East.\nWe brokered a historic agreement between Israel and Lebanon to resolve their long-standing maritime boundary dispute.\u00a0 We supported African-led talks that led to the cessation of hostilities between Ethiopia and Tigrayan forces.\u00a0 We helped bring about a framework agreement to put Sudan back on the path toward civilian-led democracy.\u00a0 We helped secure \u2013 and later extend \u2013 a truce in the Yemen conflict.\nAnd we brought home unjustly detained Americans from Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Burma, Afghanistan, Haiti, and other countries.\u00a0 We will keep working every single day to bring home Americans who are wrongfully detained around the world, while taking steps to deter and prevent this abhorrent practice going forward.\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to use all of our diplomatic tools to drive these priorities, and many others \u2013 including maintaining our commitment to the people of Afghanistan, particularly those who supported the U.S. mission there over 20 years, as well as to stand up for the rights of women and girls.\nWe will also be intensely focused on coordinating international efforts to combat the scourge of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.\nNow, I focused a lot on how we\u2019ve worked with allies and partners in 2022 to confront today\u2019s biggest challenges.\u00a0 But even as we did that, we also took major steps here in this building to ensure that the State Department is positioned and empowered to meet today\u2019s challenges, and tomorrow\u2019s.\nWe launched a new Bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy.\u00a0 We notified Congress of our intent to create a new Bureau on Global Health Security and Diplomacy.\u00a0 We stood up a China House to lead the development and coordination of our policy toward the PRC.\u00a0 We expanded our diplomatic presence in the Indo-Pacific, and brought on the biggest cohort of Foreign and Civil Service officers in over a decade.\u00a0 And we made significant strides toward attracting and retaining a workforce that reflects one of our nation\u2019s greatest strengths \u2013 our diversity.\nBefore I conclude, I want to acknowledge the \u201cwe\u201d behind all of the hard-earned progress that we\u2019ve made. That starts with the individuals who make up the Department of State, particularly our Foreign and Civil Service officers, our locally employed staff.\u00a0 They\u2019re the ones who executed on this vision \u2013 day in, day out.\u00a0 And not just on the issues I highlighted today, but across every facet of our foreign policy \u2013 working together with our colleagues from across the U.S. Government, working as well with our foreign partners.\nI could not be prouder of my teammates.\u00a0 I also couldn\u2019t be more humbled by the opportunity to serve alongside them. To all of them, to their families, whose love and support and sacrifice allows them to provide this service, I simply want to say thank you.\nI also want to thank Congress for its partnership.\u00a0 By our count, the department had more than 3,200 briefings, meetings, and calls with Congress over the past year.\u00a0 I personally participated in more than 60 of those.\nI\u2019m especially grateful to members of both parties who have worked with us to confirm 91 nominees this year \u2013 a tally we hope to add to in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 Because when we have our team on the field, we deliver.\nFinally, I\u2019d like to thank all of you, the members of our press corps.\u00a0 The work that you do is indispensable to our democracy.\u00a0 And while it\u2019s not always easy answering your questions, the accurate information that you provide is a public good.\u00a0 It\u2019s as basic and as simple as that.\u00a0 It helps our citizens understand the forces that are shaping their lives.\u00a0 It empowers them to engage meaningfully in their communities, their country, the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the reasons that we fight so hard for a free and independent media around the globe, and it\u2019s why I\u2019m deeply grateful to you for the work that you do.\nWhen I first started in this job, many people were asking if America would \u2013 or even could \u2013 lead again around the world.\u00a0 Or, for that matter, whether the world wanted us to.\nIn 2022, I think we answered those questions. We showed that the United States is ready and able to lead on the fundamental challenges of our time.\u00a0 And countries around the world demonstrated why they want to be our partners in building a world that\u2019s more free, more open, more secure, and more prosperous.\nWith that, I thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to take some questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Ned.\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Merry Christmas and \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 \u2014 happy holidays, and I hope the lovely weather doesn\u2019t interfere with any travel plans that you might have.\u00a0 You \u2013 in honor of the new year I have 23 questions.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But in deference to everyone, I\u2019ll condense it to one so.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So your question\u2019s 23 parts.\u00a0 Is that it?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 No, no, no.\u00a0 Not even 23 parts.\u00a0 But you\u2019ll see.\u00a0 So in your year-end review of 2022, you mentioned a number of issues \u2013 Russia, China, Afghanistan.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t mention Iran and North Korea, which are \u2013 which were big issues this year and will continue to be, along with those other three.\u00a0 So when you talk about these challenges which we\u2019re facing, which you\u2019re going to face in the upcoming year, you often say that the ball is in their court, that you\u2019ve made a proposal, they need to respond.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if there are any \u2013 Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan \u2013 in which you could see the ball being in your court.\u00a0 In other words, any \u2013 are there any of them in which you can see the administration making fresh, new initiatives or proposing new ideas to resolve some of these problems, which are dramatic, to say the least?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank, Matt, very much.\u00a0 First, I think it\u2019s fair to say \u2013 to atrociously mix a metaphor \u2013 that the ball\u2019s been in our court and we\u2019ve been running with it, by which I mean this \u2013 take Russia, Ukraine.\u00a0 From the outset of this aggression, from even before the conflict, we were very clear, including with the Russians, that if they proceeded with the aggression we would do three things.\u00a0 We would work day in, day to support Ukraine and rally the world to do the same; we would impose severe costs on Russia for its actions; we would strengthen the Alliance that we have to defend us and defend our partners in Europe, NATO.\nWe have done and we continue to do day in, day out, exactly what we said.\u00a0 And that\u2019s not sitting back and waiting for someone to hit the ball at us.\u00a0 It is us, every single day, with our diplomacy \u2013 because this stuff doesn\u2019t just happen \u2013 making good on those commitments.\nWhen it comes to China, one of the things that we set out to do \u2013 and it\u2019s laid out in our strategy, as I said \u2013 was both to invest in ourselves, to align with our allies and partners, and then to compete vigorously where we disagree.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done and what we continue to do every single day.\u00a0 The convergence that we built, the convergence that is stronger and greater than any time that I\u2019ve seen it between the United States and Europe, the United States and Asia, and increasingly countries around the world on how to approach the challenge that China poses \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on every single day.\nAnd as I mentioned a few minutes ago, in area after area, we are more aligned than we\u2019ve been.\u00a0 We\u2019re approaching this in similar ways, often the same ways.\u00a0 And again, that is the product of active, proactive, engaged American diplomacy.\nI can go down the board.\u00a0 The common denominator here is that all of these areas we have been running with the ball.\u00a0 But it started with something that remains to me foundational, and that was the decision that we made, at the President\u2019s instruction on day one, to reinvigorate, to re-energize, to rejuvenate, to re-engage, and in some cases to reinvent these alliances and partnerships.\u00a0 The fundamental premise that we have is, one, as I\u2019ve \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard me say this a bunch of times, but it bears repeating \u2013 one, the world doesn\u2019t organize itself.\u00a0 And if we are not out there \u2013 if the United States is not out there leading, engaging, helping to do the organizing, then either someone else is going to do it or no one does it \u2013 either way, probably not good for us.\nBut second, and the flip side of the same coin, is that virtually all these problems to be effectively resolved require other countries in on the deal, require us to coordinate, to cooperate.\u00a0 That\u2019s where American diplomacy has been playing a leading role.\u00a0 Every single one of these issues \u2013 and again, when it comes to other issues that you\u2019ve mentioned \u2013 Iran, North Korea, et cetera \u2013 we\u2019ve not been sitting back.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been leaning in, but ultimately other countries have to make decisions about what they\u2019re going to do or not do.\nWe continue to believe, for example, on Iran\u2019s nuclear program that the best way to deal with this challenge, to deal with this threat is through diplomacy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been engaged in intense diplomacy.\u00a0 But if Iran is not willing or able to do what\u2019s necessary to get back into compliance, well, that\u2019s part of the equation too.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Michele.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah, I want to pick up on this issue of alliances.\u00a0 Because the Biden administration came under a lot of criticism, including from allies, for its handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0 I wonder if there were lessons learned that are \u2013 that have been useful to you in managing these alliances, now in dealing with Russia and China.\u00a0 And then also, just briefly, what, if anything, can the U.S. do now to support the women of Afghanistan?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So second part first.\u00a0 The decision that we just heard come from the Taliban on denying opportunities for women to go to universities, girls to go to school \u2013 I think what you\u2019ve already heard is a course of condemnation from around the world, and not only from us but from countries \u2013 virtually every continent, including Muslim countries, which, I think is, in and of itself, important and powerful.\u00a0 What they\u2019ve done is to try to sentence Afghan women and girls to a dark future without opportunity.\u00a0 And the bottom line is that no country is going to be able to succeed, much less thrive, if it denies half its population the opportunity to contribute.\nAnd to be clear \u2013 and we are engaged with other countries on this right now \u2013 there are going to be costs if this is not reversed, if this is not changed.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to detail them today, but we will pursue them in coordination with allies and partners.\u00a0 And I can tell you as well that any prospect that the Taliban seeks for improved relations with the world, with the international community, which is something that they want and we know that they need \u2013 that is not going to happen if they continue on this course.\nMore broadly when it comes to Afghanistan, of course, as we\u2019ve said, we have to learn the lessons of Afghanistan over the 20 years of the mission there, as well as the last year.\u00a0 I have to say \u2013 and if you go back and look at, for example, what the NATO Secretary General said and others have said, our consultation with allies and partners on Afghanistan in the moment were sustained, they were intense, and we strongly took note of everything that we heard from allies and partners in advance of the decisions that President Biden made and that we made.\u00a0 So I think this notion that we hear from some about a lack of consultation is actually not born out by the facts and also not born out by what many of our allies and partners have said.\nI\u2019ll also say this: we ended America\u2019s longest war.\u00a0 For the first time in 20 years, Americans will not be coming home from Afghanistan in a body bag or grievously injured.\u00a0 We brought more than 120,000 people out of the country.\u00a0 When it comes to Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, if we were still in Afghanistan, it would have, I think, made much more complicated the support that we\u2019ve been able to give and that others have been able to give Ukraine to resist and push back against the Russian aggression. We heard predictions that leaving Afghanistan would result in a tsunami of refugees of Afghanistan.\u00a0 That, to date, has not happened.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard that it would result in more terrorism.\u00a0 That to date has not happened.\u00a0 And on the contrary, we were able to take out one of the leading terrorists, Mr. al-Zawahiri.\nAnd so I think putting all of this in perspective is very important.\u00a0 Putting it in the perspective of 20 years, putting it in the perspective of the last year, putting in the perspective of what has happened since \u2013 that does not take away from our enduring commitment to make sure that we help those who helped us in Afghanistan.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t take away from our enduring commitment to stand up for the rights of women and girls, and more broadly for the rights of people in Afghanistan.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t take away from our enduring commitment to help as the leading provider of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.\u00a0 All that remains very much on our plates as we go forward.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Kylie.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks for doing this, Secretary.\u00a0 I wanted to point to something that you said earlier this month on Ukraine.\u00a0 You said the Biden administration is working to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to take back its territory that\u2019s been seized since February 24th.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if you had a sense in the private discussions with President Zelenskyy yesterday if that\u2019s something that Ukraine could agree to as an end state, because it does seem at odds with what Zelenskyy stated as what a just peace would look like.\nAnd then we just heard from the NSC\u2019s John Kirby that Biden\u2019s team is going to work with President Zelenskyy\u2019s team on looking at that peace proposal that they put forth.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering what the goal of that review is.\u00a0 Do you want to put forth a renewed peace plan that has the backing of the U.S. alongside Ukraine?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thanks, Kylie, very much.\u00a0 First, what\u2019s clear from all of our conversations with Ukraine, including the conversations just yesterday between President Biden and President Zelenskyy, is that we have the same objectives, the same goals: a free, an independent, a prosperous and democratic Ukraine, one that demonstrates that the principles of the United Nations Charter are being upheld, including on territorial integrity and sovereignty and independence.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something the President reiterated yesterday.\nWe\u2019ve also been very clear that fundamentally these decisions are for Ukrainians to make.\u00a0 They have to decide where they\u2019re going, how they\u2019re trying to get there, when they\u2019re trying to get there, of course with our very, very strong support.\u00a0 So fundamentally, they\u2019re the ones who are going to be making these decisions.\u00a0 What we\u2019ve heard from the Ukrainians in recent months is the intense focus on getting back territory in the east and in the south that was principally seized since February.\u00a0 That\u2019s where their focus has been.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t prejudge in any way where this goes, where it settles.\u00a0 Again, these are decisions for them to make.\nWhat we want and what many other countries around the world want is a peace, ultimately, that, as we\u2019ve said, is just and durable.\u00a0 And by \u201cjust,\u201d one that doesn\u2019t simply ratify another country seizing by force the territory of another; \u201cdurable\u201d in the sense that we want to make sure that it holds and that we\u2019re not simply putting Ukraine in a position where Russia is going to repeat what it did a month, six months, a year later.\u00a0 All of those elements are very important to what we factor in.\nWhen it comes to the peace proposal, I think here\u2019s what\u2019s important:\u00a0 President Zelenskyy has made repeatedly clear that this is going to end when it ends through diplomacy, through a negotiation, and he\u2019s put forward some ideas, some principles, some particular issues around which hopefully countries can come together to try to advance that proposition.\u00a0 But fundamentally, right now Russia has shown no interest in meaningful diplomacy, in meaningfully engaging to bring this war to an end.\u00a0 As President Biden said, that could happen tomorrow if Putin withdrew his forces, but that\u2019s not going to happen.\u00a0 And in the absence of that, we have to see some meaningful evidence that Russia is prepared to actually negotiate and negotiate, again, a just and durable peace.\u00a0 We just haven\u2019t seen that.\nIn our judgment, the best way to actually advance getting to that day is to sustain our support for Ukraine, to make sure that it does well on the battlefield; that it continues to have the support it needs to sustain itself against the Russian onslaught, including against its energy infrastructure; as well as economic support.\u00a0 That is what is most likely to speed up the day when President Putin comes to the conclusion that what he\u2019s engaged in is futile and that it\u2019s time for a genuine negotiation.\u00a0 I think President Zelenskyy\u2019s proposals are a good start at that.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking to countries around about those proposals.\u00a0 They\u2019re things that everyone should be able to \u2013 in one way or another to rally to.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But what\u2019s the goal of reviewing that peace plan they put forward, and how long will that take?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Kylie, we\u2019ll move around a bit.\u00a0 Humeyra, go ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 How long is it going to take for Biden administration officials to work with Zelenskyy\u2019s team to review that proposal that he\u2019s put forward?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, I don\u2019t want to put a timeline on anything, but I can just tell you that we\u2019re looking at what he\u2019s put forward.\u00a0 I was just on the \u2013 I was going to say on the phone \u2013 on the video with our G7 partners this morning, and this is one of the things that we talked about.\u00a0 So I think countries around the world are looking at this and they\u2019re seeing that, again, the Ukrainians want \u2013 look, no one wants peace more than President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019re the ones who are suffering from the aggression.\u00a0 But it has to be just and it has to be durable.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Humeyra.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Ned.\u00a0 Hello, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I just want to go to China.\u00a0 So at the moment, there is an uncontrolled COVID outbreak there since the reversal of their \u201cZero COVID\u201d policy, and many countries, including the United States, have expressed concern over it and they said they could help.\u00a0 I just want to zero in on that.\u00a0 Has the United States in recent weeks or since the reversal of policy offered China to provide them with vaccines?\u00a0 What was their response?\u00a0 And since the authorities there have changed the criteria to calculate COVID deaths, how accurate do you find China\u2019s official figures on casualties?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 First, let me say this.\u00a0 We want to see China get this outbreak under control for three reasons.\u00a0 First, we don\u2019t want to see people anywhere suffering from COVID.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s illness, whether it\u2019s death, we want to see that come to an end wherever it\u2019s happening, including in China.\nSecond, any time the virus is spreading or is moving around, there is the possibility that a new variant develops, that variant spreads even further, and it comes and hits us or hits other countries around the world.\u00a0 So we have a clear interest in that.\nAnd then, as we\u2019ve seen, there are clear implications for the global economy with China being shut down because of COVID.\nSo on all of those levels \u2013 a basic humanitarian level, the concern for everyone\u2019s health, as well as for the global economy \u2013 it\u2019s profoundly in our interest that China do what\u2019s necessary to get ahead of this.\u00a0 At the same time, it\u2019s also very important for all countries, including China, to focus on people getting vaccinated, making testing and treatment available, and, importantly, sharing information with the world about what they\u2019re experiencing \u2013 again, because it has implications not just for China but for the entire world.\u00a0 So we would like to see that happening.\nWe\u2019re the largest donor of vaccines, as you know.\u00a0 We\u2019re prepared to continue to support people around the world, including in China, with this and with other COVID-related health support.\u00a0 China has not asked to date for that help, but, again, we\u2019re fully prepared to provide assistance to anyone who asks for it if they think it\u2019s useful.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Farhad.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary, for taking our questions.\u00a0 You just mentioned right now that for the Iran nuclear deal, diplomacy is still the best option, while at the same time you are saying that the focus is the Iranian people asking or seeking their right.\u00a0 How can you \u2013 like, what sort of message are you sending to the Iranian people who are being repressed right now?\u00a0 And then the U.S. is going for a deal with a government that was the only government outside Russia that was yesterday mentioned by President Zelenskyy, a few meters away from here, saying that they are doing a terrorist action by providing drones.\u00a0 How can you add this up for the people of Iran?\nAnd also, what message do you have for the families of Emad Shargi, Morad Tahbaz, Siamak Namazi, and the green card holder Shahab Dalili?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So a couple of things on this.\u00a0 First, I think the world has been intensely focused on what\u2019s happening throughout Iran.\u00a0 We remain gravely concerned about Iranian authorities firing on peaceful protestors, notably on women, on children.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen mass arrests.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen sham trials.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen executions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen use of sexual violence as a tool for protest suppression.\u00a0 Not only us, the eyes of the world have seen this.\u00a0 And these human rights abuses are not going and will not go without consequence.\nWe\u2019ve been working from even before the \u2013 this repression to sanction those who are engaged in trying to repress the Iranian people, and just yesterday, I believe, we issued new sanctions, including on the prosecutor general of Iran.\u00a0 At the same time, as you\u2019ve heard me discuss, we\u2019ve been working to try to make sure that Iranians have in their hands the ability to communicate with each other, to remain connected with the outside world.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working on that and with partners, with allies, with countries around the world, including at the United Nations, we have worked to continue to hold Iran accountable and to condemn it for its actions.\nSo that is happening.\u00a0 That is ongoing.\u00a0 And that is the focus of so many countries around the world.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re intensely focused on the fact that Iran has provided UAVs to Russia to prosecute its aggression against Ukraine, and in particular, to attack civilian infrastructure.\u00a0 These Iranian drones are what is being used, among other things, to try to turn off the lights, turn off the heat, turn off the water for Ukrainians as they head into winter.\u00a0 And we\u2019re putting a spotlight on that and, again, trying to take actions wherever we can to disrupt that, including sanctioning the various UAV networks that Iran is engaged in.\nOther countries also are focused on this.\u00a0 We\u2019ve shared information at the United Nations on Iran\u2019s actions, which we see as a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231.\u00a0 We think it\u2019s a clear violation and we\u2019re urging an investigation of that.\nSo on all of these fronts as well as the many other areas where Iran is engaging in destabilizing activities, dangerous activities, support for terrorist groups, destabilizing actions throughout the region, we\u2019ve been focused and engaged.\u00a0 That also does not take away from the proposition that it is profoundly in our interest that Iran not acquire a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 And President Biden is committed to ensuring that Iran not acquire a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 We\u2019ve continued to believe that the most effective way, the most durable way to do that was through diplomacy.\nAnd when the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, was actually enforced, it did exactly what it was designed to do.\u00a0 It put Iran\u2019s nuclear program in a box.\u00a0 It was verified not only by international inspectors, it was verified by our own people, Iran\u2019s compliance with that, including by the previous administration.\u00a0 And in our judgment, it was a grievous mistake to pull out of that agreement and to let Iran\u2019s nuclear program out of the box.\u00a0 But that\u2019s the reality that we inherited and that we\u2019ve had to deal with.\nSo on the diplomacy, again, as I said, we think that\u2019s the best solution.\u00a0 But despite the efforts that we\u2019ve made, even as we\u2019ve been pushing back against Iran\u2019s other egregious actions, despite the efforts that we\u2019ve made and our partners in Europe have made, Iran has not been willing or able to do what\u2019s necessary to come back into compliance with the agreement.\u00a0 So we will continue to look and act on ways to make sure that, one way or another, Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Sean.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And the families?\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Could I ask you about the Middle East, elsewhere in the Middle East?\u00a0 There\u2019s a formation of the government in Israel to \u2013 Benjamin Netanyahu is going to be the prime minister again.\u00a0 You, yourself, gave a speech to J Street where you mentioned concerns about some potential actions, such as annexation, such as settlements.\u00a0 You mentioned that you \u2013 that you\u2019re going to deal with policies, not with personalities.\u00a0 Nonetheless, some of the personalities in the government have called for measures like this.\nBut how is the United States going to deal with that?\u00a0 Is there going to be \u2013 are you going to deal with these specific players in the government who may have backgrounds that are problematic?\u00a0 And in terms of the Arab world, through the Abraham Accords \u2013 you mentioned the Negev Summit.\u00a0 To what extent can you leverage that to \u2013 perhaps to send a message to the new Israeli government?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 So first I want to extend congratulations to Prime Minister Netanyahu on announcing the formation of a new government.\u00a0 The Knesset still has to approve it, as you know, before it can be formally sworn in.\u00a0 But we look forward to working with Israel to advance both the interests and the values that have been \u2013 long been at the heart of our relationship, and also to promoting a broader approach to try to bring equal measures of security, of opportunity, of prosperity, of dignity to Israelis and Palestinians alike.\nThere\u2019s been no secret about our approach.\u00a0 And again, I reiterated that in the remarks I made to J Street just a few weeks ago.\u00a0 And as you noted, what I said then, what I repeat now, is that going forward \u2013 just as in the past previous administrations on the Israeli side, on the American side, what previous American administrations have done \u2013 we will engage with and judge our partners in Israel on the basis of the policies they pursue, not the personalities that happen to form the government.\nI think we\u2019ve demonstrated over successive Israeli governments and over successive American administrations, precisely because we have a rock-solid partnership and one that is committed to Israel\u2019s security, that we can have very candid conversations when we disagree.\u00a0 That\u2019s not going to change, either.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 May I follow up, Ned?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Courtney.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, happy holidays.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The administration has maintained its position on diplomacy with North Korea over its missile program even as Pyongyang\u2019s provocations have increased in both frequency and severity.\u00a0 And now the White House has confirmed North Korea\u2019s transfer of weapons to Wagner Group.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering, what does running with the ball look like in 2023?\u00a0 What is the outlook for the new year?\u00a0 Are you seeing it as being time to change course?\u00a0 And are \u2013 when you talk about alliances, are the U.S., Republic of Korea, and Japan agreed on how to proceed?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We\u2019re in not only close communication and coordination, I think we\u2019re in very tight synchronization with the Republic of Korea and with Japan on the approach to North Korea.\u00a0 In fact, I think that alignment\u2019s not been stronger in recent years.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working together every single day.\nAnd when it comes to running with the ball, this is not only a question of condemning what North Korea\u2019s done and continues to do \u2013 the egregious violations of UN Security Council resolutions, the provocative actions, the threat to peace and security \u2013 not only sanctioning these acts, as we continue to do, and bringing them to the United Nations, we continue to take actions to shore up our own defensive and deterrent capabilities and capacities, including working ever more closely with Japan, with Korea on exercises, on preparedness, making sure that we and they have the systems in place to deter and ultimately defend against any North Korean aggression.\u00a0 All of that is ongoing.\nAnd I\u2019d also note that the sanctions that we have put in place and that we\u2019re working to strongly enforce have put some constraints on North Korea\u2019s ability to continue to advance its missile and nuclear programs.\u00a0 Nonetheless, they are \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not going to predict or preview where this is going in 2023, except to say that quite literally every single day we are working with our allies and partners to make sure that not only are we putting pressure on North Korea to end these practices, but we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re putting in place what is needed to deter aggression directly against any of our partners, as well as against us, and if necessary defend against it.\nLet me just add that China has an important role to play in this.\u00a0 It has the strongest, deepest relationship of any country in the world with North Korea.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s in China\u2019s interest not to see these kind of provocative actions continue.\u00a0 And we have conversations with China; this is something President Xi and President Biden talked about.\u00a0 I expect I\u2019ll continue that conversation when I get to China early next year, about what we hope that China will do to try to convince North Korea to move in another direction.\nWe have said very clearly, and it remains the case, that we\u2019re open to diplomacy without any preconditions.\u00a0 We remain committed to seeing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0 To date, North Korea\u2019s not engaged on that basis, but that remains a possibility.\u00a0 And I think China can play a role in helping to move things in that direction.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 One final question.\u00a0 Missy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 The Biden administration has promised to put human rights at the center of its foreign policy, and I understand I\u2019ve heard from you and from other senior members of the Biden administration that human rights is always part of the conversation but is obviously not the only concern when the United States deals with its partners and another \u2013 any country.\u00a0 Looking back at the last two years, how well do you think the administration has done in getting the mix right and effectively using American leverage and influence to actually get results when it comes to human rights?\u00a0 And if there are any specific examples of where you think the United States has done well or not so well, that would be helpful.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 As you said, very rightly, first, it\u2019s something that President Biden felt very strongly about putting back at the center of our foreign policy, and we\u2019ve done that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in shining a spotlight on human rights abuses.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in rallying other countries to speak out, stand up, and take action against these abuses.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in the actions that we\u2019ve taken ourselves.\nAt the same time, again, as you rightly said, it\u2019s at the heart of our foreign policy; it\u2019s not the totality of our foreign policy.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the critical elements that we look at and try to advance, but in every instance we have to balance a multiplicity of interests.\u00a0 And at the same time, we have to make judgments about what is ultimately the most effective way to try and advance our commitment to human rights.\u00a0 And most of this, as with a lot of the things we do, are not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 A lot of this is turning an aircraft carrier, and it takes time and it takes relentless effort.\nI mentioned earlier that we have greater convergence than I\u2019ve seen in my experience with our closest allies and partners in Europe, as well as in Asia, on China.\u00a0 I think you see that playing out, for example, when it comes to human rights abuses that are being committed by China, whether it\u2019s in Xinjiang, Tibet, other places, including for example in growing convergence on export controls not only going to the most sensitive technologies that might help China advance its military capacity, but also technology that could be used for the surveillance of people and other tools of repression against the rights of minorities and others in China.\nSame thing in a number of other countries.\u00a0 Similarly, we\u2019ve taken steps \u2013 and others have taken steps with us \u2013 to try to help ensure that products that are made with forced labor in countries don\u2019t come into our own country or to other countries.\nThere are lots of places where we\u2019ve seen human rights abuses committed in the context of larger conflicts.\u00a0 One way to make sure that we\u2019re actually getting at the upholding of human rights and the end of abuse is to try to resolve those conflicts.\u00a0 Yemen is an example of a place where we\u2019ve invested tremendously in support of diplomacy to try to end the conflict.\u00a0 And for all of the fragility, we had a ceasefire that was extended.\u00a0 And even though it\u2019s now not been formally extended another time, in practice it\u2019s holding.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of humanitarian assistance to get to people.\u00a0 It\u2019s also seen, I think, a reduction in abuses committed against civilians.\nSimilarly in Ethiopia, where we\u2019ve labored in close partnership with African countries, including the African Union, but also including countries like Kenya, the practical effect of getting a cessation of hostilities, of getting the guns quiet, of getting humanitarian assistance into Tigray has also been to reduce, if not eliminate, the human rights abuses that were being committed as the conflict was raging.\u00a0 And we\u2019re focused now on making sure that we can get independent human rights monitors into Tigray to verify that there are no ongoing atrocities, even as we\u2019re looking for accountability for what\u2019s already taken place.\nIn Ukraine, where we see human rights abuses being committed on an almost daily basis by Russian forces, we\u2019ve put a bright spotlight on that.\u00a0 Not only have we put a spotlight on it, we\u2019ve been working overtime to help collect the evidence and gather the information of these abuses.\u00a0 We\u2019re engaged across the international community, whether it\u2019s with the UN, whether it\u2019s with the International Criminal Court, whether it\u2019s looking at other mechanisms to make sure that not only is that information and evidence gathered, but that at the end of the day there will be accountability for these human rights abuses.\u00a0 And that\u2019s one way, as we put a spotlight on it, to deter it.\nSo I think there are many other places where, in one way or another, the combination of putting a spotlight on something, taking concrete action, getting others to do the same is making a difference.\u00a0 But the reality, of course, is that we continue to see abusive practices in many places.\u00a0 We will remain relentless in trying to stop it, to put a spotlight on it.\u00a0 And there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at each case, each instance, each place on its own terms, trying to make judgements each time about how we can actually be most effective in bringing these abuses to an end.\nThank you.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I really hope everyone gets a break, has time with family, with friends, and that we see you fully energized in 2023.\u00a0 Look forward to seeing you then.\u00a0 Thanks.\n\n"}, {"url":

morning, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s a real pleasure to have Foreign Minister Tewaney here in Washington.\u00a0 Panama is a highly valued partner of the United States.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing a lot of work together these past couple of years, really working to advance the common goals that we have for our people and more broadly for the region.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working together to improve regional security, to strengthen democratic institutions, to advance inclusive economic growth.\u00a0 And I\u2019m looking forward to discussing with the minister all of those issues.\nOf course, Panama is also a critical partner for us and many other countries in the region in addressing the challenges of irregular migration.\u00a0 We are facing together what is truly an historic challenge: there are more people on the move around the world \u2013 more than 100 million \u2013 than at any time in recorded history.\u00a0 And of course, in the hemisphere that we share, we know that as well and we see that as well \u2013 whether it is from Mexico, from Haiti, from Cuba, from Guatemala, from Honduras, from El Salvador, from Nicaragua, from Venezuela, and more\u00a0\u2013 Ecuador.\u00a0 People are on the move and there is increasingly a shared sense of responsibility that we all have for managing, in a humane and orderly way, migration in our hemisphere.\u00a0 So I look forward to that discussion as well.\nBut welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to have you here.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TEWANEY:\u00a0 On behalf of the President Cortizo and Vice President Carrizo, I want to convey a very warm regards, and also from the people of Panama.\u00a0 As you said, there are many values also, common values we share, democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law.\u00a0 So that\u2019s, I think, the core base of our strong relation.\u00a0 I think we have met before when I was minister of government very briefly, and now it\u2019s my honor to officially meet you as my counterpart, my homologue.\u00a0 As you met \u2013 the team is going to be here providing some extra information you find useful for the meeting.\nBut I would like to start again with the most important part, our strong relation.\u00a0 We share, as I said, strong values, and we are aligned on some of the most important issues of our time.\u00a0 And I want to convey the message from the president and vice president that we are committed to the rules-based world order and also on the well-being of the international community and the region.\nAs many countries in the world have also experienced decreased levels of trust in their democratic institutions, Panama has been leading efforts to build citizens\u2019 trust in their government.\u00a0 And even during the most difficult times \u2013 recently, in January and July \u2013 we proved that only through dialogue and peaceful resolution we could solve our own issues.\u00a0 In fact, I myself was part of the delegation that was negotiating in Panama peace and stability, and through that negotiation, we can now say that we are stable and strong again and, as allies, we stand together as brothers and sisters.\nWe understand the challenges with regard to migration that the U.S. is facing but we are facing too.\u00a0 And we\u2019re here again to help each other.\u00a0 There are many scopes and actions that we can take in order to address the migration issue, and we are here also to convey the message that we already working with the team to find out some ways.\nAs you know, the Darien Jungle is a geographically very dense jungle, and we want to \u2013 I mean, we have spoken in the region, and we have tried to make efforts and to convey the message that the jungle of Darien is not a safe route.\u00a0 And it should never be used as a route because it\u2019s a jungle that we have the duty to protect, too.\u00a0 We are committed to the climate change.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to the environmental values also.\u00a0 We cherish that, and I\u2019m sure the U.S. too.\u00a0 So we want to keep it that way.\nWe are also committed to human rights, as I told you.\u00a0 We have been taking care of migrants, and we have given and provided the due services that they request when they\u2019re coming out from it.\u00a0 And we thank the U.S. for all the support that has been given.\u00a0 We are also trying to encourage the south and international \u2013 the regional community to understand that this solution can only \u2013 we can only reach a solution through multilateralism and regional responsibility.\u00a0 And again, we share the same thoughts about this.\u00a0 So as you can see, Panama is a very important ally for the U.S. in that sense, and we feel the U.S. is a very important ally for us in that sense too.\nSo also with regards to ADD, we have an honor in that Wilsonian sense of brotherhood, sharing moral and values.\u00a0 We have led the ADD also with the purpose to create an infrastructure in which we can cherish those values too \u2013 not only talking about this, but we feel the need to create an infrastructure in which we can spread those democratic and human right values throughout the region.\u00a0 We have started definitely with the ADD.\u00a0 It has been very successful because we live \u2013 we also believe in development, freedom, democracy.\nAnd very recently, we hope we can do the same and spread that rule in Latin America also.\u00a0 So we intend to continue with those efforts.\u00a0 Panama has always been seen and it has been respected for that role of creating, and convening, and making \u2013 composing peace in the region.\u00a0 And we want to remain as such.\nSo with those words, I would like to \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you have other points in the agenda, or we can continue the discussion.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much.\u00a0 Welcome.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken at a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Walter E. Washington Convention Center", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "December 15, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Good to see you all.\u00a0 So earlier this year in South Africa, I had an opportunity to set out the administration\u2019s Strategy for Africa.\u00a0 And at its core, it really can be distilled to a single word, and that word is partnership.\u00a0 The reality is that the United States and African nations cannot deliver on any of the fundamental aspirations of our people \u2013 we can\u2019t solve any of the big challenges that we face \u2013 if we don\u2019t work together.\u00a0 So our approach is about what America can do with African nations and people, not for them.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this summit, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, has really been all about.\nWe took full advantage of having so many leaders from African governments, businesses to strengthen these partnerships, as was demonstrated, I think, by the robust engagement from President Biden, Vice President Harris, and a large number of our Cabinet secretaries throughout the course of the week.\u00a0 And as you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re putting considerable new resources toward advancing our shared priorities, $55 billion over the next three years alone.\nSo let me just take a minute to sum up and highlight a few of those key areas that have come out of the summit.\u00a0 But let me start by saying the bottom line is this:\u00a0 We made significant, tangible progress across every one of our priorities this week, building on the momentum that we\u2019ve generated over the past two years.\u00a0 We committed to ensuring African countries have a prominent seat at the table.\u00a0 Wherever consequential decisions are being made, consequential issues discussed, we\u2019ve delivered on that.\u00a0 At the United Nations General Assembly in September, you heard President Biden express support for adding a permanent member from Africa to the UN Security Council.\u00a0 And this week the President announced support for the Africa Union to join the G20 as a permanent member.\nIn our strategy, we also committed to expanding broad-based economic opportunity in Africa in part by mobilizing the unmatched power of the American private sector.\u00a0 If you go back to 2021, our government has helped close more than 800 two-way trade and investment deals across 47 African countries worth $18 billion.\u00a0 During the summit just this week, President Biden announced more than $15 billion in new deals.\u00a0\u00a0 At the U.S.-African Business Forum, we brought together leaders from over 300 American and African companies with the heads of the 50 delegations, fostering new connections that will create even more opportunity.\nSeizing 21st century opportunities requires digital connectivity.\u00a0 This is vital to the free flow of ideas, information, investment.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the President announced our plan to work with Congress to invest more than $350 million toward a new initiative on digital transformation with Africa.\nToo often, international infrastructure and trade deals are opaque.\u00a0 They\u2019re coercive.\u00a0 They lead to projects that are environmentally destructive, poorly built, that import or abuse workers, that foster corruption and burden countries with unmanageable debt.\u00a0 We have a different approach.\u00a0 We offer investments that are transparent, high-quality, and sustainable for the planet.\u00a0 We empower local communities.\u00a0 We respect the rights of their people.\u00a0 We listen to their people, to their needs.\nAmerica will not dictate Africa\u2019s choices.\u00a0 Neither should anyone else.\u00a0 The right to make these choices belongs to Africans and Africans alone.\u00a0 But we will work relentlessly to expand their choices, and the agreements and investments we made this week showed that when African governments, businesses, and communities are offered the choice to partner with the United States, they will take it.\nThe U.S. Strategy for Africa also committed us to help our partners recover from the devastation wrought by COVID-19 and the unprecedented global food security crisis.\u00a0 African countries have consistently made clear that as much as emergency assistance \u2013 in fact, even more than emergency assistance \u2013 what they want is to strengthen African capabilities, institutions, technology, supply chains, and industries so that they\u2019re more resilient in the face of future shocks, and together we are building that very resilience.\nOn health security, we\u2019ve provided 231 million doses of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines to African countries free of charge.\u00a0 At the summit, President Biden committed to investing at least $4 billion by 2025 to help African countries train and equip health care workers to meet citizens\u2019 needs.\u00a0 We\u2019re also expanding the capacity of African countries to manufacture vaccines, tests, and therapeutics in Africa for Africans, and indeed, for the world beyond.\nOn food insecurity, we\u2019ve provided more than $11 billion over the last year to address global hunger and improve nutrition.\u00a0 Much of this assistance has gone to African countries, which have been disproportionately impacted by the drivers of hunger \u2013 COVID, climate, and conflict, and by President Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, which has made a serious crisis much worse.\u00a0 We\u2019re making unprecedented investments to help African countries fulfill their goal of not only being able to feed their own people but those around the world.\u00a0 Sixteen of the 20 partners in the Feed the Future program, our flagship program to reduce malnutrition and increase food security, are in Africa, where innovations like high-yield, high-nutrition crops that can endure extreme weather are putting communities on the path to greater resilience.\nNow, we know that the climate crisis is a major driver of increased food insecurity and the spread of deadly viruses.\u00a0 It\u2019s exacerbating tensions that can spark and spread deadly conflict.\u00a0 Yet as the President often points out, it\u2019s also a once-in-a-generation\u2019s opportunity to create good paying jobs for the future.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we committed to foster a just energy transition that can both meet the region\u2019s need for more reliable, affordable energy and, at the same time, create opportunities for businesses and workers in African countries and the United States as well.\nSince January of 2021, we\u2019ve dedicated massive resources toward this very goal \u2013 solar energy in Angola, wind power in Kenya, hydro-solar energy in Ghana, and a new 100 million project that the President announced to expand off-grid access to solar energy; and that\u2019s just to name a few of the initiatives and projects that we\u2019re working on.\u00a0 We\u2019re deepening the resilience of African communities to a changing climate through a $150 million adaptation fund, and this is critical, and you\u2019ve heard the President talk about this.\u00a0 We have a responsibility in the United States as, historically, the largest emitter in the world \u2013 and now still the number two emitter after China \u2013 to help countries adapt, to help them build resilience.\nAnd we are putting the resources, we\u2019re putting the technology, we\u2019re putting the technical know-how, into doing that and sharing it with our partners.\u00a0 We\u2019re teaming up with governments and NGOs to incentivize the protection of irreplaceable natural resources like the Congo Basin rainforest, which absorbs more carbon than is emitted by the entire continent of Africa.\u00a0 Finally, we committed to work with African partners to fulfill the promise of democracy.\u00a0 That includes helping strengthen its core pillars \u2013 the rule of law, human rights, a free press \u2013 as well as addressing some of the root causes of insecurity, which undermines the ability of democracies to actually deliver for their people.\nYesterday President Biden hosted a small group of leaders to discuss how we can help support free, fair, and credible elections in 2023 like the ones we saw in several places this year, including Kenya.\u00a0 As part of that discussion, the president pledged to work with Congress to provide over $165 million to support elections and good governance in Africa in the coming year.\u00a0 These will be key themes of the second Summit for Democracy coming up in March, where Zambia will be one of our co-hosts.\nWhere there are crises and conflicts, we are supporting the African leaders, the regional institutions, and citizens who are stepping up to find diplomatic solutions.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last year through our diplomatic engagement in places like Chad, Ethiopia, Sudan, and eastern DRC.\u00a0 We know African countries face real security concerns, including terrorism and transnational organized crime.\u00a0 The message we sent this week is that African nations can continue to count on the United States as a partner in building more effective and accountable security forces.\nSo if you\u2019re keeping score \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t cover everything \u2013 there are a lot of commitments there.\u00a0 And we know that commitments are only as good as our ability to deliver on them.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we asked one of our most experienced senior diplomats, Ambassador Johnnie Carson, to return to the State Department as our special representative for the U.S-Africa Leaders Summit implementation.\u00a0 With nearly four decades of experience as a diplomat, deep relationships across the region, I can think of no one better to ensure that our words are actually translated into action.\nAcross every single one of our priorities, civil society will play a critically important role, and in particular, youth.\u00a0 Today the median age in Africa is 19 years old.\u00a0 By 2030, two in five people on this planet will be African.\u00a0 And the choices that rising generations make will shape the future not just for Africa but for the entire world.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing more in Africa\u2019s emerging leaders, more than ever before.\u00a0 The Vice President announced that we plan to devote an additional $1.1 billion over the next three years to youth programs like the Mandela Washington Fellows, a number of whom took part in this summit, and, of course, the YALI Network, which provides tools, resources, and a virtual community for now more than 700,000 rising leaders across the continent.\nOf course, a big part of that is investing in women and girls because we know that when they have the opportunity to reach their full potential, when they\u2019re empowered to lead in business and government and communities and families, all of society benefits.\nThe very first gathering that I took part in this week was a meeting of rising African innovators and entrepreneurs.\u00a0 The energy, the ingenuity of this group, its eagerness to turn so many of the problems that we face into opportunities, and to do so in partnership with the United States, is truly inspiring.\u00a0 It\u2019s impossible to feel cynical in their presence because they\u2019re so energized. They\u2019re so committed to serving their communities.\u00a0 They are so full of good ideas.\u00a0 And that kind of sums up the way that we feel coming out of this summit.\nAs the President said yesterday, we\u2019re all in on Africa\u2019s future because we know that the future of African nations and the United States is a shared one.\u00a0 And in what the President\u2019s called a decisive decade, that partnership is more vital than ever.\nWith that, happy to take some questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Shaun, where are you?\u00a0 There you are.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Laughter.)\u00a0 Good to see you.\u00a0 Could I just pursue in some more detail a couple of the security issues that you mentioned?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Sure.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0DRC:\u00a0 You mentioned \u2013 you mentioned the DRC in your remarks.\u00a0 You met with President Tshisekedi.\u00a0 If not mistaken, you didn\u2019t meet with President Kagame.\u00a0 What was the reason for not meeting with him?\u00a0 Does that indicate any sort of pessimism with controlling the M23 situation in the eastern DRC?\nEthiopia:\u00a0 You did meet with Prime Minister Abiy.\u00a0 How do you see the Pretoria agreement going forward?\u00a0 The fact that you met with him, does that show that he \u2013 that Prime Minister Abiy is back in U.S. good graces?\u00a0 Could there be discussion perhaps of renewing AGOA membership for Ethiopia?\nAnd if I could just pursue AGOA a bit more broadly as well, you \u2013 the President talked about a U.S. MOU with the nascent free trade agreement of Africa.\u00a0 What does that mean for AGOA?\u00a0 I mean, should African leaders presume that AGOA is finished after 2025?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Shaun, thank you very much.\u00a0 Let me say this a little bit more broadly before addressing the specific conflicts that you point to.\u00a0 As I said a moment ago, the approach that we\u2019ve taken \u2013 actually from day one of this administration \u2013 has been to support and empower African-led solutions to challenges the continent faces, including the conflicts that you\u2019ve alluded to.\nAnd from day one \u2013 whether it\u2019s Ethiopia, eastern DRC, Somalia, Sudan \u2013 the State Department has been deeply engaged and we\u2019ve lent our support, our assistance to the African Union, to the EAC, to other regional groupings, to individual countries to try to help solve these challenges.\u00a0 That\u2019s been the approach we\u2019ve taken.\u00a0 We believe that whenever and wherever we can find African-led solutions to these challenges, we\u2019re going to be better off, they\u2019re going to be more sustainable.\u00a0 And I\u2019m proud to say that our diplomats have played, I believe, important roles in helping to move some of these forward.\nSo with regard to Rwanda and the DRC, first of all, I spoke to President Kagame on the phone just before the summit and we had a good conversation, just as I had a chance to speak here in Washington to President Tshisekedi.\u00a0 And I can say this:\u00a0 There is a two-track approach that are \u2013 and these tracks are pretty much joined \u2013 the Nairobi Process and then the efforts that Angola is leading that led to an agreement in Luanda, where all sides made commitments to, in effect, pull back and de-escalate the situation.\u00a0 And that\u2019s an important agreement and, if and as it\u2019s implemented, I think it offers tremendous promise for ending the current conflict and hopefully leading to more durable stability in the eastern DRC.\nNow, a big part of that is M23 genuinely pulling back, and there, we are looking to Rwanda to use its influence with M23 to encourage that and to move that forward.\u00a0 At the same time, any militarized nongovernmental group needs to stand down, and that includes groups like the FDLR, and we are looking for all sides to use their influence to ensure that that happens.\u00a0 Rwandan forces need to pull back.\nSo the challenge now is implementation of what was actually agreed, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with the leaders in question, but also, critically, with those who are playing a leading role in trying to reduce tensions and resolve conflict \u2013 notably, Kenya, Angola, the EAC, et cetera.\nSo I have some hope that we now have an agreement and a process that can lead to that result.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on, and we\u2019ll continue to engage directly with the president of the DRC, the president of Rwanda, and with all of the others in the region who are leading this effort.\nWith regard to Ethiopia, there too we have a very important cessation-of-hostilities agreement that has led, over the last few weeks, to a significant reduction in violence in Tigray, the start of humanitarian assistance getting in in significant quantities, the beginning of the restoration of services, and, we hope as well, the need to verify with international monitors that human rights abuses are no longer taking place.\nImplementation of this agreement, just as with the Luanda agreement, is the critical piece.\u00a0 The agreement\u2019s there.\u00a0 We need to make sure it\u2019s implemented and that, ideally, the implementation is done as quickly and as effectively as possible.\u00a0 Another critical component of this agreement is for Eritrean forces to withdraw from Tigray, and we\u2019re looking to that and we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019ve had discussions with a number of the leaders who were here about the need to see that happen.\nSo in both of these cases, I think we have now positive foundations to try to reduce tensions, resolve conflicts, create a stronger foundation for durable peace.\u00a0 But these things are fragile; they demand constant engagement, constant effort.\u00a0 And part of what we did here in Washington this week with the relevant actors was to work on the roadmap ahead for implementing these agreements, so there\u2019ll be a lot of follow-up in the days to come.\nWith regard to AGOA, it\u2019s produced, I think, tremendously positive results in the time that it\u2019s been in force, and we are discussing now with all of the different stakeholders \u2013 the partner countries, the private sector, our Congress \u2013 and listening to them, learning from them about how AGOA can be as effective as possible and having these conversations as we look to see where we take it once it expires, as you said, in 2025.\u00a0 As to countries and their participation in AGOA, the law has clear criteria, and we simply apply the facts in any given case to the law.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Anthony Osae Brown, Bloomberg Africa.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 My name is Anthony Osae Brown from Bloomberg Africa.\u00a0 You mentioned protecting democracy, encouraging democracy in Africa, and one of the meetings you had yesterday with the Ghanaian Government, he raised the question of the Wagner Group being allocated a mine in Burkina Faso and basically called on the U.S. to help protect democracy in West Africa.\u00a0 And I\u2019m wondering what assurances are you giving to the Ghanaian Government and to your allies in the region that you\u2019ll protect them from destabilization from the activities of the Wagner Group or mercenaries in the area.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So a few things to be said about this.\u00a0 Wagner Group came up in a number of conversations over the course of this week on the margins of the summit, including, indeed, in my meeting with President Akufo-Addo of Ghana.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard repeated concerns that Wagner and groups that are linked to it manufacture or exploit insecurity, they threaten stability, they undermine good governance, they rob countries of mineral wealth, they violate human rights.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve heard that and seen that again and again.\nIf you go back to 2017, Wagner forces have deployed to the Central African Republic, they\u2019ve deployed to Mozambique, to Mali, to Libya, and at the same time we\u2019ve seen disinformation campaigns that are furthering the exploitative goals that Wagner and its founder have quite literally across the continent of Africa.\u00a0 There are United Nations investigations that detail the targeting of minority groups, the killing of civilians in Central African Republic, in Libya, in Mali by Wagner forces.\u00a0 I called out Wagner recently in a report that we put out on international religious freedom for its activities in the Central African Republic.\nThese investigations have documented human rights abuses.\u00a0 They\u2019ve documented recruitment and use of child soldiers.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve also documented the exploitation of resources that Wagner engages in.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also seen Wagner interfere with UN peacekeeping operations, endangering peacekeepers, endangering United Nations personnel.\u00a0 It\u2019s a long litany of bad things.\nAnd then the bottom line, ultimately, is this:\u00a0 Wherever we\u2019ve seen Wagner deploy, countries find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, and less independent.\u00a0 That\u2019s the common denominator.\u00a0 That\u2019s the common story across the board, which is why it\u2019s so important that we work together with partners in Africa to make them resilient to something like the Wagner Group.\u00a0 We have something called the Global Fragility Act that is now being implemented in an effort to address in a very comprehensive way problems of instability so that there\u2019s not a vacuum that something like Wagner comes in and tries to fill.\u00a0 We\u2019re using all of the relevant tools that we have to counter its influence, everything from sanctions to exposure, some of which I\u2019ve just done; bolstering state capacity, bolstering regional capacity, bolstering international cooperation.\u00a0 All of these things are necessary.\nAnd the bottom line is this:\u00a0 What I heard in conversations this week, as I\u2019ve heard in the past, is our partners in Africa tell us that they do not want their resources exploited.\u00a0 They don\u2019t want the human rights of their people abused.\u00a0 They don\u2019t want their governance undermined, and ultimately, as a result, they really don\u2019t want Wagner.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Shannon Crawford, ABC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Through the course of the summit, you have been very careful to make the case that the administration doesn\u2019t want to force African nations to choose between the U.S. and China, but the Secretary of Defense clearly said that Beijing\u2019s influence on the continent is a destabilizing threat.\u00a0 Do you share that assessment?\nAnd secondly, we heard today from the Ukrainian military that Russia is digging in for a prolonged war.\u00a0 Now, as you noted, the White House did commit $55 billion for Africa over the course of three years, but of course, aid to Ukraine through this 10-month conflict has already eclipsed that level.\u00a0 Are you confident that the U.S. can maintain support for Ukraine among members of the Global South through a drawn-out fight, levels of support that have already been described as tepid at best by some?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First part of the question \u2013 this summit is about one thing, Africa and the relationship between the United States and Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s about one region and only one region, Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about any other region.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about any other country, and I think you heard that across the board this week.\u00a0 And I recognize people may want to turn it into something else, but sometimes a thing is just what it is, and this is the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.\nAnd fundamentally, it\u2019s about what we are affirmatively able to bring to the table, some of which I described \u2013 the partnerships, the investments that are based on shared interests and shared values, and again, done in a way that\u2019s transparent, that\u2019s high-quality, that\u2019s sustainable, and with a focus on empowering local communities, respecting their needs, their decisions, and their rights.\u00a0 That is what we\u2019ve been talking about for the last three days.\nAnd in doing that, we\u2019re actually creating more opportunity, more opportunity for Africans, more opportunity for Americans \u2013 new, good-paying jobs, particularly in the green economy; infrastructure that actually connects countries and peoples, which is maybe one of the biggest needs in Africa because to realize the extraordinary potential, that connectivity is the one missing piece.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on that.\u00a0 A more educated, dynamic workforce; more effective approaches to shared challenges, particularly food insecurity, climate.\nIn short, what we\u2019re seeking to do is to try to help deliver on what people need.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is about.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a fundamental challenge.\u00a0 Can we effectively deliver?\u00a0 That\u2019s the challenge for all of our countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s what all of these leaders were talking about this week.\u00a0 And our answer to that question is yes, we want to work affirmatively with you; and the answer is yes, we can deliver if we do it together.\nNow, if other countries have the ability and the will to do the same thing, that\u2019s great.\u00a0 There\u2019s more than enough need to go around.\u00a0 But from our perspective, to the extent that anyone else is engaged, we just want to make sure it\u2019s a race to the top, not a race to the bottom.\u00a0 We want to make sure that when we\u2019re seeing investments in Africa, they\u2019re done to the highest standards.\u00a0 They\u2019re not piling debt on countries.\u00a0 They\u2019re not abusing workers or importing workers from outside.\u00a0 They respect the environment.\u00a0 They don\u2019t bring corruption with them.\nIf that\u2019s the case, if we have these affirmative partnerships and investments, then it\u2019s great for everyone to be involved.\u00a0 And ultimately, as I said, this is about choices that Africans will make, and our purpose is simply to make sure that they have a good choice.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is about.\nWith regard to Ukraine, let me just say two things.\u00a0 First, I had an opportunity over the last week to spend some time on Capitol Hill \u2013 first with the Senate last week, the House actually this morning before we came to the summit \u2013 with the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and colleagues from the Treasury Department, USAID, and others.\u00a0 And what I heard there was continued strong bipartisan support for the efforts we\u2019re making to help Ukraine defend itself, to sustain pressure on Russia, to end its aggression, as well as to continue to strengthen our own defensive alliance, NATO.\nWith regard to the Global South, it\u2019s very powerful because you hear countries that are \u2013 were here in Washington this week \u2013 Ghana, Kenya, so many others \u2013 that have been the victims of imperialism in the past and who see that now happening to Ukraine by Russia, and it cuts to the core for them.\u00a0 They feel strongly that this is not simply a matter of what\u2019s happening to Ukrainians in Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s a matter for all to be concerned by because it goes to the very principles that were established after two World Wars and after colonialism to try to make sure that there are rules and understandings that one country is not going to go in and change the borders of another by force; it\u2019s not going to engage in land grabs; it\u2019s not going to try to erase the identity of a country and subsume it into itself; that territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty, all of these things matter, they\u2019re meaningful, and they\u2019re especially meaningful when it comes to Africa.\u00a0 So we heard this again and again.\nNow, having said that, it\u2019s been very important to us to demonstrate that we can run and chew gum at the same time, by which I mean this:\u00a0 Even as we and many other countries are trying to deal with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re also working on, engaging, dealing with the problems, the challenges that people are feeling around the world, and notably in the Global South, including dealing with climate, dealing with global health and their own situations, dealing with food insecurity, problems that, parenthetically, in some cases have been made worse by the Russian aggression.\u00a0 I think everything that comes out of these three days demonstrates that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing \u2013 that we are responding in partnership to these needs even as we\u2019re dealing with the situation in Ukraine.\u00a0 It is not a zero sum, and I think if you \u2013 I don\u2019t want to speak for them, but if you ask many of the countries that were here this week, I think that they have to come away, based at least on what I\u2019ve heard, very \u2013 feeling very positive about the engagement of the United States on the issues that matter to them and to the lives of their people day in, day out.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Guilaume Naudin, RFI.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I wanted to have your take about the outcomes of this summit.\u00a0 Did it meet your expectations?\u00a0 Did it exceed it?\u00a0 And isn\u2019t the tough part starting right now, considering the last summit was eight years ago and we had to wait eight years to have another event like this, with the implementation and the follow-up of everything that was decided here?\n(Via interpreter) There are many French-speaking countries here.\u00a0 What is your feeling and the rapport from the summit?\u00a0 Does the hard work start now?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) The outcome is very positive, and you\u2019re entirely right: the hardest remains to be done now, and that\u2019s always the case with a summit such as this one.\nThe bottom line is this:\u00a0 We have made significant and tangible progress across every one of the shared priorities that we had going into the summit, and I described some of them a few minutes ago.\u00a0 And so I don\u2019t want to repeat the \u2013 I could actually spend probably the next 15 minutes just going through the list of what we call deliverables.\u00a0 But just in summary, we\u2019ve announced very significant commitments across the board, some of them even groundbreaking, on peace and security, on diplomacy and good governance, on trade and investment, on health, on the environment, on food security, on technology and innovation, on people-to-people connections and ties.\nBut to your point \u2013 and I very much agree with you \u2013 what happens over three days is very important in setting the direction, making the commitments, but it\u2019s what happens over the next 362 days that really matters.\u00a0 It is the follow-through.\u00a0 It is the implementation.\u00a0 And I think that was felt across the board.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the reasons why the President was keen on having maybe our most experienced diplomat for Africa over the last four decades, Johnnie Carson, take on this role of doing the follow-through, doing the implementation, making sure that everything that we said we would do we\u2019re actually going to do.\nSimilarly, the strategy that we put out on Africa a few months ago that I had the opportunity to do in South Africa, we\u2019re in effect putting out a report card on ourselves as well as in partnership with African countries to make sure that we\u2019re making good on what we said we would do.\nSo that\u2019s what, I think, ultimately this needs to be judged on.\u00a0 I believe that the last three days were a significant success, but ultimately, the ultimate judgment has to be in the days to come, the weeks to come, the months to come, are we making good on what we said we would do?\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced that we will.\nAnd by the way, over the last couple years that I\u2019ve been on this job, I\u2019ve had an opportunity to travel a fair bit in Africa \u2013 Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, Algeria, Senegal, Egypt, South Africa \u2013 but as the President mentioned today, I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of us in Africa next year, including the President.\u00a0 So that\u2019s an opportunity as well to carry forward everything that we\u2019ve done here, to continue these conversations, to continue the implementation.\u00a0 And I know when the President goes, when other Cabinet members go, we\u2019re going to want to be able to show that what we did and said here in Washington, we\u2019re actually carrying out.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Jonathan Donkor,\u00a0Ghanaian Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0My question has to do with debt forgiveness.\u00a0 Huge investment deals and commitments have been announced over the last three days.\u00a0 However, many African countries are saddled with debt.\u00a0 Ghana, for instance, is currently undertaking a debt exchange program as part of the IMF support it\u2019s seeking.\u00a0 Is the Western word willing to forgive the debt owed by African countries?\u00a0 And how would you help the countries to prevent similar situations in the future?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, thank you.\u00a0 So this is a subject, a theme that we\u2019ve heard loudly and clearly here.\u00a0 It\u2019s not new in the sense that this has been part of the conversation for some time.\u00a0 And there is no doubt that the rise of unsustainable debt burdens, especially in Africa, is a tremendous challenge, and it\u2019s one that we\u2019re committed to addressing.\u00a0 When you look at the debt crises that we\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re devastating from a humanitarian standpoint, and they can be debilitating when it comes to effective economic development and inclusive growth.\u00a0 So there are a number of things that we talked about and that we clearly need to move forward.\nOne is we need all creditors, both countries and the private sector, to work together with us to support debtor countries.\u00a0 It can\u2019t simply be the United States.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve attempted to address this \u2013 for example, through the G20, through the Paris Club \u2013 as I think you know.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also led debt reduction efforts through the \u2013 something called the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.\u00a0 That has provided, to date, about $75 billion in debt service relief to dozens of countries \u2013 I think nearly 40 countries \u2013 going back to 1996.\u00a0 Of those 40 or so countries, I think more than 30 are African countries.\u00a0 So there\u2019s a real focus on this.\nThere\u2019s a G20 initiative that suspended more than $12.9 billion worth of debt service payments owed by 48 countries.\u00a0 This was between May of 2020 and December of last year.\u00a0 So these are some of the things that we\u2019ve actually been doing and working on.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s also fair to say more needs to be done to prevent debt crises from emerging in the first place.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big part of the challenge.\nAnd one of the things that we\u2019re especially concerned about is the growth of untransparent debt, including off-balance-sheet debt and debt that\u2019s hidden by non-disclosure agreements.\u00a0 So a company or a country may come in, lend the money, and part of the agreement is, no, you can\u2019t reveal the terms.\u00a0 And that means, among other things, that when other countries are negotiating for loans, they don\u2019t know what the terms are, the people don\u2019t know what the terms are, and countries wind up being saddled with debt that they can\u2019t possibly repay.\u00a0 So that transparency that we bring to everything we do, we need to see that spread around in the way that these loans are made.\nAnd not only does this actually increase the risk of a debt crisis, but it also can prolong the duration and create barriers to actually resolving these debt burdens.\u00a0 So bottom line is this:\u00a0 We need both the creditors \u2013 again, countries, private sector, as well as the debtors \u2013 to do their part to support greater fiscal and debt transparency and try to remove the barriers that exist to that transparency.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, we\u2019re out of time.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY

this very simple and easy and quick:\u00a0 What he said.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut I feel an obligation to add just a little bit.\u00a0 First of all, welcome.\u00a0 It is wonderful to see so many friends \u2013 colleagues \u2013 here in this room.\u00a0 To those of you who haven\u2019t been here before, this is actually \u2013 Strive, this is the top floor, and this is the Benjamin Franklin Room.\nBenjamin Franklin is looking down on us this evening.\u00a0 He was, as many of you know, America\u2019s very first diplomat.\u00a0 He signed our first treaty, our first alliance, with France.\u00a0 He charted the Gulf Stream.\u00a0 He pioneered electricity.\u00a0 He gave us our ethos of self-government.\u00a0 And virtually none of this did he do while sober.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I invite you to be inspired by our first diplomat.\nA warm welcome to all of our dinner guests, especially, again, my colleagues and counterparts from African nations.\u00a0 It\u2019s been one of the great pleasures of my tenure in this job working with each of you, and I\u2019m so pleased that we\u2019re here together this week in Washington to continue that work.\u00a0 Thank you for your engagement, thank you for your leadership throughout this summit and everything leading up to it, and the many priorities that have been vital to our partnership.\nAnd thank you as well to the business leaders who are here with us tonight.\u00a0 Thank you for bringing your ingenuity, your energy to our shared work.\u00a0 Indeed, there are few issues that we\u2019ve been talking about these last couple of days that we can solve without the engagement of the business community.\nAnd to the assistant secretary, Molly, thank you not just for your dedication, shared by so many here at the State Department, but to the work that you\u2019re doing every single day and that our team is doing every single day not just to make this summit a success, but to strengthen the relationships that are at the foundation of the summit.\nIt really is not easy to follow Strive.\u00a0 Talk about someone who\u2019s made a profound difference, a real difference, in thousands and thousands of lives \u2013 scholarships for tens of thousands of orphaned children, mobilizing billions of dollars to support African farmers, leading the fight against HIV/AIDs, against Ebola, and more recently against COVID-19.\nAnd now, to my great gratitude, he\u2019s turning to the challenge of long-term food security on the continent, a mission that the United States shares and is joining him to advance.\nThe millions of lives that Strive has touched are a testament to the immense potential, the immense potential for good that can be created when the business community and governments actually work together.\nAnd that\u2019s what tonight is all about.\nPartnership is at the heart of President Biden\u2019s strategy for Africa \u2013 partnerships between the United States and African nations, with the private sector, and between our people.\nAnd in a sense, it\u2019s as simple as this:\u00a0 The challenges and the opportunities of this moment, from climate change to the clean energy transition, public health, economic opportunity, peace and security \u2013 these aren\u2019t African issues or American issues.\u00a0 They\u2019re global priorities, and the best way that we can address them, the best way we can be effective, is together, bringing the full force of our combined, collaborative efforts, including the efforts of the business community.\nI can think of no more compelling demonstration of the power of these partnerships than the successful collaborations between the countries and companies that are here in this room.\nTake the work of the Kenyan Government, which is teaming up with Varian to help millions access life-saving cancer care.\nBenin and Egypt, working with Citi to issue Sustainable Development Goal and green bonds that will help finance clean energy projects directly benefiting their citizens.\nThe small businesses and innovators across the continent who are working with Visa to access financing and global markets.\nOr take what governments and business are doing together to end the COVID-19 pandemic and better prepare us for future health emergencies.\nRight now, the public and private sectors are working with the World Health Organization in South Africa to create the first COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub.\u00a0 This ensures that we\u2019re not only providing emergency aid to African countries, but we\u2019re investing \u2013 investing in future tech know-how and production in Africa, by Africans, with all of the health, science, and economic benefits that this brings.\nAnd this really is at the heart of our thinking and it\u2019s at the heart, as well, of what Strive is doing.\u00a0 Yes, of course, we all have to face and deal with emergency situations.\u00a0 We\u2019re acutely aware of that and acutely invested in that.\u00a0 But even more important is making these investments in sustainable capacity in Africa for the long term, so that whether it comes to dealing with climate, whether it comes to dealing with COVID and global health, whether it comes to dealing with food security, that capacity exists for the long term in Africa.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is all about and what we have to be about together.\nThese partnerships are not simply or merely financial deals.\u00a0 They are actual solutions to some of the toughest and most important challenges that we face and that we have to face as a global community.\u00a0 They\u2019re also critical for increasing trade and investment between the United States and African nations to the benefit of all of us, and you\u2019ve heard us talk about this today.\u00a0 You heard President Biden address this in some detail today.\nTo try to accelerate that progress, the administration is taking a number of steps, including advocating for American business, driving U.S. private sector investment to growth industries in Africa, correcting misperceptions about risk, and working with African partners to strengthen the business climate in their countries.\nI want to thank especially my friend and colleague, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, for her tireless work on this front.\u00a0 She and her team are doing incredible things to make this real.\u00a0 This is where the rubber meets the road, and we\u2019re so grateful for the partnership that we have with our colleagues at Commerce and with Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 Gina, thank you for everything you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nFinally, you may have heard me say this before, but I think it always bears repeating:\u00a0 Africa is a major geopolitical force.\u00a0 It\u2019s one that has shaped our past, it\u2019s shaping our present, and it will shape our future.\nIt\u2019s a demographic reality.\u00a0 It\u2019s an economic reality.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a reality that\u2019s reflected in the incredible dynamism and vitality of African nations, of their people, and the companies that do business on the continent.\nIf we work together, if we harness those strengths, I am confident \u2013 more than confident \u2013 that we really can chart a more prosperous and more secure future for all of our citizens.\nSo there\u2019s a lot to be done day in, day out that makes good business sense, but believe me when I say beyond the business sense there\u2019s a higher calling here, one that can make genuine progress for millions and millions of people.\u00a0 It\u2019s where convenience and conviction come together, and all of you in this room are a big part of that story, a story I hope we can all tell together.\nThank you so much for being here this
