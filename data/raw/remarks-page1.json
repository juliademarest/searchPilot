Blinken At the Ukraine Conference Session 1\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Intercontinental Hotel ", "location": "London, United Kingdom", "date": "June 21, 2023", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Prime Minister Sunak, Prime Minister Shmyhal, thank you for bringing us together and bringing together such a broad and diverse coalition of governments, businesses, international financial institutions, civil society groups, all dedicated to Ukraine\u2019s recovery.\nAs President Biden has said since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. And that includes being by Ukraine\u2019s side as it recovers from this catastrophic Russian aggression.\nIt\u2019s easy sometimes to be a little numbed by what is going on day in, day out in Ukraine. We see the images flash by on our TV screens. We talk about the numbers. And sometimes what gets lost is the day-in, day-out human devastation that Russia is inflicting on Ukraine. And I think it\u2019s so important that even as we gather here today to talk in detail about what all of us are doing together with Ukraine to help it recover, we never lose sight of that human dimension, because at the end of the day that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\nBack in April, just one day in this devastating aggression, in the city of Uman \u2013 hundreds of miles from the front lines \u2013 another assault of Russian missiles on innocent Ukrainian civilians, on apartment buildings hundreds of miles away. In one of those buildings before dawn, a Russian missile struck.\u00a0A\u00a0father, Dmytro, in his apartment raced to his children\u2019s room. He opened the door to the room to try to see how his children \u2013 Kyrylo, 17, and Sophia, 11 \u2013 were doing. He opened the door to the room. It wasn\u2019t there anymore. His children were gone, two of the six children killed that one day \u2013 that one day in April \u2013 as a result of this ongoing aggression against Ukraine. Two of thousands killed through the course of this war, two lives interrupted, two stories stopped.\nThat\u2019s what this is about every day. But as Russia continues to destroy, we are here to help Ukraine rebuild \u2013 rebuild lives, rebuild its country, rebuild its future. Recovery is about more than just ensuring people have what they need to survive \u2013 food to eat, water to drink, medicine to take, heat in the winter, electricity in all seasons. Recovery is about laying the foundation for Ukraine to thrive as a secure, independent country, fully integrated with Europe, connected to markets around the world; a democracy rooted in the rule of law; a place where all Ukrainians have dignity, human rights, the opportunity to reach their full potential.\nEvery investment that we make in Ukraine\u2019s recovery is aimed at bringing Ukrainians closer to that reality. And today, I\u2019m announcing that, with the support of the United States Congress, we will provide more than $1.3 billion in additional aid to help Ukraine toward that goal. (Applause.)\nWe\u2019re going to invest over $520 million to help Ukraine overhaul its energy grid, more than half of which, as you\u2019ve heard, has been destroyed by Russia \u2013 and in so doing make it cleaner, make it more resilient, make it more integrated with Europe. And we\u2019ll support Ukraine\u2019s energy market reforms to combat monopolies and to spur more private investment, which will enable Ukraine one day to become a major energy exporter.\nThis support will complement the work that\u2019s already being done by the G7+ Coordination Group which we launched last October and have co-led ever since, first with Germany, now with Japan. That group has grown to include 18 countries and several multilateral institutions. Together we\u2019ve allocated billions of dollars to help repair and rebuild Ukraine\u2019s energy sector. We\u2019ve sent more than 5 million power generators to Ukraine \u2013 transformers, cables, pipes, circuit breakers, other pieces of energy equipment.\nThe United States will also provide $657 million to help modernize Ukraine\u2019s border crossings, its rail lines, its ports, other critical infrastructure that connect the country with Europe, allowing it to exchange more goods by more pathways more and more efficiently. We\u2019ll direct an additional $100 million toward digitizing Ukraine\u2019s customs and other systems to boost speed and to cut corruption. And we\u2019ll commit $35 million to help Ukrainian businesses and entrepreneurs through financing and insurance that reduces risks for investors in Ukraine.\nThis new support that I\u2019m announcing today comes on top of more than $20 billion that the United States has provided in economic and development assistance to Ukraine\u2019s workers, its businesses, its public services to help them endure the 16 months of punishing conflict with unwavering bipartisan support from our Congress. Across this support, we\u2019re striving to build a Ukraine that\u2019s inclusive, that\u2019s accessible, so that people with disabilities can reach their full potential, which is in the interests of all Ukrainians.\nMy announcement today also comes on top of the more than $2.1 billion in humanitarian assistance that we\u2019ve provided to Ukraine and to the region to respond to Russia\u2019s war of aggression, including lifesaving aid for those affected by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Within hours of its breach, we mobilized support for evacuations; for emergency deliveries of food, of safe drinking water, of fuel, of medical aid. In the weeks since, we\u2019ve continued to work with Ukraine in assisting the thousands of people who\u2019ve been displaced, the hundreds of thousands whose water supply has been contaminated. And these are just the immediate consequences of the catastrophe that will probably wreak environmental and economic devastation for many months and indeed many years to come.\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has publicly called out Moscow for blocking the UN from delivering aid to civilians in the flooded areas that Russia illegally occupies, adding to Russia\u2019s long track record of denying humanitarian access, which is a requirement under international humanitarian law.\nIn addition to our economic development and humanitarian assistance, the United States will continue to invest in Ukraine\u2019s long-term efforts to strengthen good governance, transparency, accountability. We\u2019ll bolster its justice sector and anti-corruption institutions,\u00a0strengthen its civil society and its free press. These institutions and organizations empower Ukrainians to hold their government accountable, to check the power of vested interests, and they\u2019re crucial to ensuring that the unprecedented resources that all of us are providing are managed responsibly.\nThe Ukrainian Government has made meaningful strides in bolstering these institutions, even as it fights for survival, and Kyiv has taken tangible and difficult steps to align its standards and practices with the European Union, particularly since the EU granted Ukraine candidate status a year ago. Earlier this month, Ukraine passed reforms to align its energy market regulations with the European Union, strengthening measures to combat market manipulation and insider training. And we look forward to the Rada taking up anti-monopoly legislation very soon.\nAdopting these and other critical reforms to increase Ukraine\u2019s transparency, competitiveness \u2013 to bolster the rule of law \u2013 will help attract more private investment. And that is essential, and you heard it from my colleagues. Governments are doing a lot. International financial institutions are doing a lot. Both of us have a hugely important role to play in Ukraine\u2019s recovery. But it is not enough. Only the private sector can mobilize the level of investment necessary to meet the country\u2019s massive needs. The diverse participation of the private sector here today in this conference shows the growth opportunity that global firms and investors see in the future of Ukraine, in the future of its people.\nBut make no mistake: All of these reforms and recovery efforts depend on Ukraine having the capacity to deter and defend against future attacks by Russia. That\u2019s why even as we invest in Ukraine\u2019s immediate and long-term recovery, we also have to build a Ukrainian military that is strong enough to protect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, its territorial integrity, and its independence \u2013 not just to defend Ukraine\u2019s land, but to defend all that Ukrainians are building and will build on that land.\nIt\u2019s also why the United States is committed to working to build support for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, the core elements of which I outlined a couple of weeks ago in Helsinki. Those include a peace that upholds the United Nations Charter and its fundamental principles \u2013 sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence \u2013 that addresses both accountability and reconciliation, that ensures Ukraine\u2019s full participation and assent, and that supports Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction and recovery.\nEven as we rally around Ukraine\u2019s recovery, we must not lose sight of why that is necessary in the first place. Indeed, even as we come together here in London, committed to supporting Ukraine\u2019s buildup, Russia continues to try to burn it down. So let\u2019s be clear: Russia is causing Ukraine\u2019s destruction, and Russia will eventually bear the cost of Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction. (Applause.)\nUntil that time, we will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine as they make the greatest sacrifices to defend, to rebuild, to reimagine their country. And in doing so, we will reaffirm the principle at the heart of the international order, that people in every nation can write their own future free from aggression, free from coercion, free from intimidation. That is a recovery well worth our robust and enduring support. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinken-and-ukrainian-foreign-minister-dmytro-kuleba/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

So the Foreign Secretary is going to make some remarks, followed by Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 And then we will have time for a couple of questions.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0If you\u2019re ready.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us here at 1 Carlton Gardens.\u00a0 It is a pleasure to formally welcome U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to London this week to join us, as we cohost the Ukraine Recovery Conference.\u00a0 It is a great opportunity to catch up and to compare notes, as we do regularly when we meet at various places around the world.\nMy current counterpart has hosted me on a number of occasions.\u00a0 I felt it was about time I returned the favor.\u00a0 But it did give us an opportunity to speak about the situation in Ukraine, the nature of our mutual support to Ukraine\u2019s self-defense efforts against the Russian Federation\u2019s brutal and unprovoked full-scale invasion on February of last year.\nWe also talked about the recent visit that my prime minister made to Washington, and his meeting with our American friends, including, of course, President Biden himself, and the close coordination and cooperation which we enjoy across a range of areas, including the signing of the Atlantic Declaration.\nI also had the opportunity to get an update from Secretary\u2019s Blinken\u2019s recent trip to Beijing.\u00a0 And of course, the ongoing work that we do to try and encourage peace and stability around the world is a regular feature of our bilateral discussions, including, of course, our ongoing work to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\nBut this week is very much about encouraging the private sector to invest in Ukraine\u2019s rebuilding and recovery.\u00a0 We recognize that that means that we need to demonstrate that those investments will be effective and that they will be safe.\u00a0 And that, of course, means the ongoing assurance that the Ukrainians seek that they will not be reinvaded once they have successfully regained their territory, their further integration into institutions \u2013 Euro-Atlantic institutions and European institutions \u2013 that they understandably aspire to.\u00a0 But of course, it also means supporting them as they perform the reform of their institutions that will facilitate the investments in their country.\nOne of the things that we have seen \u2013 one of the things that we have witnessed, with our support and with our encouragement, the very swift transformation of their armed forces to a very effective set of institutions, military institutions.\u00a0 And we want to see that same alacrity and pace with the reform of their governmental institutions.\u00a0 So with our help, with our support, with our encouragement, I have no doubt that they will replicate the speed of that transformation.\nAnd finally, whilst it was not an area of conversation with Secretary Blinken this afternoon, I would put on record the UK\u2019s Government\u2019s thoughts to those individuals who are currently in the submersible in the north Atlantic.\u00a0 We wish them all the luck.\u00a0 And of course, we hope that they will be swiftly found and returned to their loved ones.\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And I can only echo that, James.\u00a0 Thank you.\nIt\u2019s always wonderful to be in London, but it\u2019s particularly wonderful this time to be hosted by my friend the foreign secretary.\u00a0 Greatly appreciate that and especially appreciate your leadership \u2013 the UK\u2019s leadership \u2013 on this reconstruction conference for Ukraine, which brings us together this week.\nWe have more than 50 countries represented in London for the conference, not just to talk about the importance of Ukraine recovering from this war, but to make sure that it is thriving as a prosperous democracy and to take concrete steps in that direction.\u00a0 That\u2019s what these couple of days are all about.\nPresident Biden said from the outset of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine that we would stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\u00a0 And both of our countries are deeply committed to that.\u00a0 We will continue to deliver on that commitment, including through a new, robust U.S. assistance package that I\u2019ll be able to announce tomorrow.\nBut as we discussed \u2013 and as on virtually everything \u2013 we are in full alignment.\u00a0 Ensuring Ukraine\u2019s future as a secure, sovereign, independent nation demands not only providing for its security but also for its economy, its democracy, and its full integration into Europe.\u00a0 These are really flip sides of the Ukrainian success point that we are helping to deliver on.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here this week.\u00a0 Even as we\u2019re meeting Ukraine\u2019s needs on the battlefield as it continues to defend and take back territory seized from it by Russia, we are building the military for the long term so that it has in place the ability to deter and, if necessary, defend against future aggression.\nAnd here I just want to, again, thank both the foreign secretary and all of the UK for the extraordinary support that it continues to provide, including announcing just last week, another 250 million pounds in additional security assistance, alongside almost 100 million pounds worth of air-defense capabilities.\u00a0 And of course, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers trained in the UK are making a big difference on the battlefield.\nBut as I said, the flip side of this is all the work that we are doing here to help Ukraine prepare for having the strongest possible economy, the strongest possible democracy, which is actually necessary to achieve a thriving economy and for reconstruction.\u00a0 If Ukraine is going to attract the investment it\u2019s going to need \u2013 not just from governments, not just from international financial institutions, but from the private sector \u2013 it has to build the best possible environment to attract that investment.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll be talking about all of that over the next the next few days.\nWe also had an opportunity to talk about preparations for the NATO Summit that\u2019s upcoming in Vilnius and the practical steps that we will continue to take to shore up our own security and revitalize the Alliance to make sure it\u2019s prepared to meet all of the challenges of this century.\nAs James mentioned, as all of you know, I came to London from Beijing, and so we had an opportunity to discuss the trip that I just took.\u00a0 President Biden sent me to Beijing because he believes strongly that both the United States and China have an obligation to manage our relationship responsibly.\u00a0 And that starts with strengthening lines of communication across our governments, exploring and making clear our positions and intentions in the places where we have very significant differences, and also looking at where we might cooperate together when it\u2019s in our mutual interest, and often as well, in the interest of many other countries around the world.\nWe had very candid, substantive, and constructive conversations on each of these fronts, and I think it\u2019s clear that both sides agreed on the need to try to stabilize the relationship.\u00a0 And we identified specific areas where dialogue and cooperation might benefit both of us and also other countries around the world.\nHaving said that, the hard work now, our diplomatic work is going to be entrained to actually carry this forward.\u00a0 None of these \u2013 none of the work we\u2019re doing is done in a day or even in two days, even with as much time as we spend together.\u00a0 It\u2019s a process, and we\u2019ll be engaged in that going forward.\nBut here again, we are in full alignment with our friends and partners.\u00a0 If you look at what Prime Minister Sunak spoke about in Hiroshima, when all of the leaders were together at the G7, and particularly when you look at what James spoke about at Mansion House, you can see that there is very clear alignment, and not just between us \u2013 between virtually all of Europe and many countries in Asia as well and beyond.\u00a0 And I think that alignment in the approach that we\u2019re taking to the challenges posed by China is one of the most important assets that we have going forward.\nLet me just finally say that, as James mentioned, this visit also comes on the heels of Prime Minister Sunak\u2019s visit to Washington, where he and President Biden announced a new plan for adapting and reimagining our economies and our economic partnership for the 21st century. The Atlantic Declaration is broad and it\u2019s deep, as is our partnership.\nAnd among other efforts, it will expand our work together on artificial intelligence, something we talked about over lunch, both at the prime minister\u2019s first global summit on AI safety and elsewhere.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused together on establishing guardrails that maximize innovation to use AI for good, while minimizing the risks that it represents.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll work not just with each other, but other governments, with the private sector, with civil society to ensure that AI capabilities are used safely, that they strengthen human rights and democratic values rather than repress them, and that they advance equity, not bias.\nWe\u2019re also, of course, launching negotiations on a critical minerals agreement, and that will count five critical minerals extracted or processed in the UK toward the tax credits that exist now under the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.\u00a0 That, in turn, is going to create good paying jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, in both of our countries, while also meeting the high labor and environmental standards that we share.\u00a0 And it will help us meet the targets that we\u2019ve set to prevent catastrophic warming of our planet.\u00a0 The agreement will make our critical supply chains more resilient, less dependent on unreliable governments.\nSo across all of these efforts, including the one that brought me here today \u2013 ensuring a secure, independent, democratic, and prosperous Ukraine \u2013 as always, we simply could not ask for a better partner than the United Kingdom.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for that. and James, thank you for lunch.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Tony, thank you very much.\u00a0 Sam, are you going to be the ringmaster for a couple questions?\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Thank you both for that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got time for a few questions, and we will start with James Landale from the BBC, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, Foreign Secretary, good afternoon.\u00a0 James Landale, BBC.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, first of all, can you explain to us why the United States is currently unwilling to give Ukraine ATACMS long-range missiles?\u00a0 And why is the United States pushing for Jens Stoltenberg to say on as NATO secretary general?\nAnd Foreign Secretary, is the UK willing to give state-backed insurance coverage to British firms so that they can help rebuild Ukraine while the fighting carries on?\u00a0 And can you explain why you\u2019re blocking the release of funds from the sale of Chelsea Football Club \u2013 more than $2 billion pounds \u2013 that are designed to go to help those victims of the war in Ukraine?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 On weapons for Ukraine, at every step along the way of this aggression by Russia against Ukraine, we\u2019ve worked to get the Ukrainians what they need to defend themselves and, now as well, to take back the territory that\u2019s been seized from them.\u00a0 And in fact, that started even before the aggression.\u00a0 As we saw the storm clouds mounting the previous year, we did drawdowns for the kind of equipment that they needed \u2013 Stingers, Javelins \u2013 and that they had in-hand when the Russians did attack.\u00a0 And that enabled them \u2013 of course, starting with their own courage and resilience \u2013 to keep the Russians out of Kyiv, to hold on to their country, to push them to the east and push them to the south.\nBut ever since then, as the battlefield has changed, we\u2019ve adapted to that.\u00a0 And we are in constant communication, constant dialogue, along with about 50 other countries who\u2019ve been brought together in the Ramstein process, with the Ukrainians to make sure that they have what they need.\u00a0 And different countries are doing different things to address those needs, and all of that is coordinated.\nAt the same time, I think it\u2019s very important that, as always, that we not get focused on any particular weapons systems, because it\u2019s not just the weapons system.\u00a0 It\u2019s the training, it\u2019s the ability to sustain the systems that we provide them, and then it\u2019s the ability to use them in a coherent way across all of the different lines of effort that they\u2019re making, something that the foreign secretary knows a lot about given his own background.\nAnd so we will be in constant dialogue with them going forward to make sure that they are getting what they need.\u00a0 And again, I think focusing on any one weapons system at any one time, I think, oversimplifies the question.\u00a0 And to date, I think we\u2019ve been very successful collectively in making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to maximize its chances.\nWhen it comes to the secretary general of NATO, no, we have not \u2013 we\u2019re not pushing, promoting any particular candidate.\u00a0 We\u2019re in very close consultation with our allies and partners to determine where we want to go with NATO and its leadership.\u00a0 The current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has been, in President Biden\u2019s eyes, a remarkable leader of NATO.\u00a0 There are also some rather extraordinary people now who people are talking about as the next secretary general, and that\u2019s a decision we will all make collectively as an Alliance.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0James, thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to mash your two questions to me together, because ultimately this is about making sure that Ukraine has what it needs, not just to win this war of survival, this conflict about their self-defense against Russian aggression, but as Tony said and as we discussed earlier, this week is very much about creating the conditions necessary for public sector money, of course, but predominately private sector money to fund their reconstruction.\nNow, the precise details of how we do that, I don\u2019t want to prejudge.\u00a0 The whole point of the next couple of days is that the UK uses its expertise as a global financial services center \u2013 including as a global insurance center \u2013 but also our convening power.\u00a0 The fact that the U.S. Secretary of State is here and he found the time in his unbelievably busy schedule I think reflects the fact that the world views the UK as a good place to come together to discuss these complicated issues.\nSo I\u2019m not going to prejudge exactly what vehicles will be used to unlock both the public and the private money that Ukraine will need.\u00a0 But as Tony has said, ultimately, we want to ensure that the investment that goes into Ukraine is safe \u2013 safe from further conflict \u2013 and deployed as effectively as possible through robust and reformed Ukrainian institutions.\nAnd with regard to the recent funds from Chelsea, a foundation has been created that will ultimately be responsible for the distribution of all those funds, but we are talking about very, very large sums, and I made it very, very clear that I want to make sure that those funds are distributed effectively and to support the Ukrainian victims of this conflict.\u00a0 And it is better, when such significant funds are at stake, that we do it right rather than trying to do it quick.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 We will now move on to John Hudson from\u00a0The Washington Post, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, in Bali you had the advantage to watch President Biden and President Xi wrestle with some of the biggest issues of differences between the United States and China.\u00a0 Yesterday you got to meet again with President Xi, listen to his concerns about U.S. policy, and then yourself expressed concerns about China\u2019s policies.\u00a0 Do you believe that President Biden views President Xi as an equal?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m not quite sure how to take that question, John.\u00a0 President Xi is the leader of China, and in and of itself that makes him someone of tremendous significance on the world stage.\u00a0 The President and President Xi have known each other for quite some time, as you know.\u00a0 When they were both vice presidents, they spent time together both in China and the United States.\u00a0 So there\u2019s a long relationship there, good knowledge of each other.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, I think it\u2019s very important that we have these communications, these lines of communication that are regular, that are sustained, that are high level across our government.\u00a0 And the trip this weekend I think is a demonstration of that, and I suspect that as we have more members of our own government going to China, Chinese officials coming to the United States, we\u2019ll see the benefits of that, at least in stabilizing the relationship, making sure that we\u2019re managing it responsibly, making sure that the competition doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, exploring areas of cooperation.\nBut at the end of the day, I think that the relationship and the communications between the two leaders, between President Biden and President Xi, is most important of all.\u00a0 That\u2019s why they\u2019ve had a number of communications and meetings to date, and that\u2019s why I expect you\u2019ll see more of that in the time ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And Secretary Cleverly, when President Putin watches senior U.S. officials and senior Chinese officials talk for more than 10 hours, as they did in the last couple days, and have substantial conversations about the war in Ukraine, do you think that makes him nervous?\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0 Well, I can\u2019t make a \u2013 I can\u2019t make a credible explanation of anyone else\u2019s frame of mind, but I think the broad point about the importance of engagement, particularly in turbulent times, is absolutely key.\u00a0 In my Mansion House speech I made the point that international engagement matters.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken is doing his job as the representative of the United States of America on the world stage, engaging with world leaders and his counterparts around the world, to make sure that we continue to make the world a more safe, more prosperous, less conflicted place.\u00a0 And that is what \u2013 that\u2019s what foreign ministers \u2013 that\u2019s what foreign ministers do.\nBut you\u2019re right that at the moment we are very much focusing on the war in Ukraine, on Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine and what we do to bring that to a swift end, and on the \u2013 what we need to do to rebuild that.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And Don McGrath, PA, Press Association.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, following your meeting with President Xi, do you think that he believes that conflict with the West, with the U.S., is now less likely than it was before?\nAnd to the foreign secretary, will you be planning to visit China yourself in the coming months?\nAnd just one other small follow-up.\u00a0 Do you think China should be invited to the artificial intelligence summit and the prime minister summit in the coming months as well?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, just as the foreign secretary said, I can\u2019t put thoughts into President Xi\u2019s mind or anyone else\u2019s mind.\u00a0 So I\u2019m certainly not speaking for him, so you\u2019d have to ask him that question.\nWhat I can say is this.\u00a0 I think both countries see the importance of trying to bring more stability to the relationship, and certainly the United States is committed to responsibly managing the relationship, because failure to do that risks misunderstanding, miscalculation, and as I said, risks the competition entering into conflict, which is in no one\u2019s interest.\nMy sense from the long meetings that we had in China over this weekend, including the meeting with President Xi again, is that China also sees the utility and importance of having greater stability.\u00a0 But a lot of work remains to be done, and of course there are very profound, very significant differences that we have to continue to manage through.\nWe were very clear that we will stand up resolutely for our interests and our values, and we had many very, very candid exchanges about places where we have real differences when it comes to our own interests, our own values, which happen to be the same ones that our friends have here but also many other countries around the world.\nBut it\u2019s also incumbent upon us to communicate clearly.\u00a0 I could not agree more with what the foreign secretary just said about the imperative of engagement.\u00a0 In fact, it would be irresponsible not to engage: irresponsible because it makes more likely the possibility of misunderstandings, miscalculations and thus conflict.\u00a0 It makes it virtually impossible for us to work to advance many of the interests that we have.\nWe had important conversations, for example, in our case not only about some detained Americans in China but also about the scourge of fentanyl, which is killing more Americans between 18 to 49 than anything else, where we hope that China can play a positive, cooperative role with us and other countries in getting a better handle on that.\u00a0 So those are just a couple of examples \u2013 never mind standing up for human rights \u2013 where engagement is absolutely vital.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Well, briefly just to add to the broader points that Secretary Blinken has made about the importance of engagement, in my Mansion House speech I highlighted that engagement was one of the three pillars of UK\u2019s foreign policy towards China, including domestic protections, including building strong friendships and alliances in the region and beyond.\u00a0 A big part of the engagement is, of course, face-to-face.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had face-to-face meetings with Chinese officials, and of course I\u2019m looking at the options of a potential visit, but there are no details at this stage.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 And time for one more question from Will Mauldin,\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for having this, Mr. Foreign Secretary.\u00a0 First, for Secretary Blinken, we reported that China is preparing a military training facility in Cuba, and was just wondering that \u2013 the readout of the meetings that we\u2019re \u2013 you just attended when were in Beijing said that you discussed \u2013 the two sides discussed China\u2019s intelligence activities in Cuba.\u00a0 But I\u2019m wondering:\u00a0 Did you discuss with Xi Jinping their military activities in Cuba and whether that would \u2013 that kind of action, either in the North America, waters around North America or the waters around China, would \u2013 could affect the d\u00e9tente that has emerged recently between the U.S. and China?\nAnd then for Mr. Foreign Secretary, I just want to expand on the BBC\u2019s question.\u00a0 Beyond the Chelsea funds, and does the UK Government \u2013 regardless of whatever consensus is reached in coming days, does the UK Government favor using the funds of sanctioned oligarchs to help rebuild Ukraine?\nAnd then also just curious whether in your conversations my colleague, Evan Gershkovich, came up, whom I got to know, my friend and colleague, as \u2013 when he was a resident of London before he was detained in Russia.\u00a0 Has that come up between you, and do you have any thoughts about how to get Evan back or how to deal with people whose \u2013 whose careers or lives are in danger in Russia?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Will.\u00a0 Yes, I made very clear that we would have deep concerns about PRC intelligence or military activities in Cuba.\u00a0 Since the start of this administration, we have engaged a number of countries where we\u2019ve seen consideration of having some kind of presence by China \u2013 intelligence, military \u2013 and we\u2019ve engaged in a number of diplomatic efforts in that regard.\u00a0 And I think they\u2019ve had some success in slowing down these efforts.\u00a0 This is something we\u2019re going to be monitoring very, very closely, and we\u2019ve been very clear about that.\u00a0 And we will protect our homeland; we will protect our interests.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY CLEVERLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 On the situation with regards to the rebuilding of Ukraine, as I have said, we recognize that governments have a role to play, we feel the private sector has a role to play.\u00a0 But I think there is a very strong principle of natural justice whereby a significant \u2013 perhaps even the majority \u2013 burden for the rebuilding should sit on the shoulders of those who have either been responsible for funding or facilitated this brutal, full\u2011scale invasion of Ukraine.\nEarlier on this week \u2013 yesterday in fact \u2013 the UK passed secondary legislation which meant that we can continue to freeze sanctioned assets until reparations are made by those individuals whose assets have been sanctioned.\u00a0 It follows that simple premise that you break it, you bought it.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s absolutely appropriate that those who have in whatever way facilitated this invasion bear the responsibility for making good on the reconstruction effort.\nWith regard to Evan, actually this was an issue that came up on my most recent visit to Washington.\u00a0 I spoke extensively at the UK\u2019s embassy in Washington in front of an assembled reception of journalists.\u00a0 The UK\u2019s position on press freedom and the protection of journalists is longstanding, and I very much reflect that today.\u00a0 The way nations treat journalists is the canary in the mine to the way they treat citizens more broadly.\u00a0 Where journalists are free to scrutinize, criticize, publicize, that shows a healthy society.\u00a0 Where journalists are murdered, abducted, or indefinitely imprisoned, it is a very, very concerning marker.\u00a0 Sadly, the situation in Russia, we know is not a benign environment for journalists and truthtellers, and the UK\u2019s position on the protection of journalists remains absolutely unwavering.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, gentleman.\u00a0 Thank you very much for your time.\n\n"}, {"url":

BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good evening.\u00a0 Slow news day, huh?\nI want to begin by expressing my gratitude to Ambassador Burns, to our entire Mission China, with whom I\u2019ve had an opportunity to spend time over the past couple of days.\u00a0 This team serves at one of the most important posts in the world at a critical moment, and I could not be prouder of how they represent our country.\nOver the past two-and-a-half years, the United States has taken a series of purposeful, strategic steps \u2013 both at home and abroad \u2013 to strengthen our country and our standing around the world.\nWe\u2019ve made historic investments in our infrastructure, technology, industrial capacity, competitiveness.\u00a0 We\u2019ve deepened our engagement and alignment with allies and partners around the world in ways that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.\nThat\u2019s the backdrop for the relationship between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2013 one of the most consequential in the world.\u00a0 Both the United States and China have an obligation to manage this relationship responsibly.\u00a0 Doing so serves the best interests of the United States, of China, indeed, of the world.\nWe are clear-eyed about the challenges posed by the PRC.\u00a0 The United States will advance a vision for the future that we share with so many others: a free, open, stable, and prosperous world with countries upholding and updating the rules-based order that has for years safeguarded peace and security globally.\nTo shape that future, we start with diplomacy \u2013 including with China.\u00a0 I came to Beijing to strengthen high-level challenges of communication, to make clear our positions and intentions in areas of disagreement, and to explore areas where we might work together when our interests align on shared transnational challenges.\u00a0 And we did all of that.\nHere in Beijing, I had an important conversation with President Xi Jinping.\u00a0 And I had candid, substantive, and constructive discussions with my counterparts Director Wang Yi and State Councilor Qin Gang.\u00a0 I appreciate the hospitality extended by our hosts.\nIn every meeting, I stressed that direct engagement and sustained communication at senior levels is the best way to responsibly manage our differences and ensure that competition does not veer into conflict.\u00a0 And I heard the same from my Chinese counterparts.\u00a0 We both agree on the need to stabilize our relationship.\nDuring those meetings, we had a robust conversation about regional and global challenges.\u00a0 That includes Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 I reiterated that we would welcome China playing a constructive role along with other nations to work toward a just peace, based on the principles of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 We also spoke about North Korea\u2019s increasingly reckless actions and rhetoric.\u00a0 All members of the international community have an interest in encouraging the DPRK to act responsibly, to stop launching missiles, to start engaging on its nuclear program.\u00a0 And China is in a unique position to press Pyongyang to engage in dialogue and to end its dangerous behavior.\nI raised U.S. concerns \u2013 shared by a growing number of countries \u2013 about the PRC\u2019s provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait, as well as in the South and East China Seas.\u00a0 On Taiwan, I reiterated the longstanding U.S. \u201cone China\u201d policy.\u00a0 That policy has not changed.\u00a0 It\u2019s guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiqu\u00e9s, the Six Assurances.\u00a0 We do not support Taiwan independence.\u00a0 We remain opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo by either side.\u00a0 We continue to expect the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences.\u00a0 We remain committed to meeting our responsibilities under the Taiwan Relations Act, including making sure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself.\u00a0 We also spoke about a range of bilateral issues, including continuing to develop principles to guide our relationship, as discussed by President Biden and President Xi in Bali late last year.\nWe exchanged views on our respective economic policies, including our concerns about China\u2019s unfair treatment of U.S. companies.\u00a0 During my meeting today with U.S. business leaders, who are operating in China, I heard about the problems that U.S. businesses are facing \u2013 including recent punitive actions against American firms.\u00a0 I also heard that U.S. companies want to continue and indeed grow their businesses here.\u00a0 And so, in my meetings, I sought to clarify any misperceptions or misunderstandings about our approach.\nThere is a profound difference, for the United States and for many other countries, between de-risking and decoupling.\u00a0 Our countries traded more over the last year \u2013 in fact, more than ever over the last year \u2013 nearly $700 billion.\u00a0 Healthy and robust economic engagement benefits both the United States and China.\u00a0 And as Secretary Yellen testified before Congress last week, it would be, as she put it, disastrous for us to decouple and stop all trade and investment with China.\nWe are for de-risking and diversifying.\u00a0 That means investing in our own capacities and in secure, resilient supply chains; pushing for level playing fields for our workers and our companies; defending against harmful trade practice; and protecting our critical technologies so that they aren\u2019t used against us.\u00a0 I made clear that we\u2019ll continue to take targeted actions that are necessary to protect U.S. national security.\nIn my meetings, I also discussed human rights.\u00a0 The United States and the international community remain deeply concerned about PRC human rights violations, including in Xinjiang, in Tibet, and Hong Kong.\u00a0 I also specifically raised wrongfully detained U.S. citizens and those facing exit bans.\u00a0 There is no higher priority for me than the safety and well-being of U.S. citizens overseas, and I\u2019ll continue to work intensively to secure their release and their safe return home.\nAs we work to address our differences, the United States is prepared to cooperate with China in areas where we have mutual interests, including climate, macroeconomic stability, public health, food security, counternarcotics.\nOn food security, we believe China can play a key role in alleviating global food insecurity.\u00a0 I underscore the importance of supporting a long-term expansion of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has facilitated the export of almost 32 million tons of grain from Ukraine; with approximately 18 million tons going to developing countries.\u00a0 A long-term expansion is critical for avoiding food shortages in the some of the poorest, most food-insecure countries in the world, as well as price surges.\nI raised as a priority the issue of synthetic opioids and fentanyl, a crisis in the United States.\u00a0 Fentanyl is the number-one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49.\u00a0 I made clear that we need much greater cooperation to address this critical issue.\u00a0 We agreed to explore setting up a working group or joint effort so that we can shut off the flow of precursor chemicals, which helped fuel this crisis and a growing number of deaths.\nFinally, we discussed the importance of strengthening people-to-people exchanges between students, scholars, business travelers.\u00a0 That benefits our citizens, our economies, and our relationship.\u00a0 Today, I had an opportunity to meet with an impressive group of alumni from those exchange programs.\u00a0 In my meetings, we discussed enhancing educational exchanges and we committed to work to increase direct flights between our countries.\nTo continue dialogue on these and other important issues, I would expect additional visits by senior U.S. officials to China over the coming weeks.\u00a0 And we welcome further visits by Chinese officials to the United States.\u00a0 To that end, I invited State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang to visit Washington, and he agreed to come at a mutually suitable time.\nA little later this evening, I leave for London to attend the Ukraine Recovery Conference, and I\u2019ll also have an opportunity there to brief allies and partners on this visit and to continue to strengthen our alignment.\nWe have no illusions about the challenges of managing this relationship.\u00a0 There are many issues on which we profoundly, even vehemently disagree.\u00a0 We will always take the best course of action to advance the interests of the American people.\u00a0 But the United States has a long history of successfully managing complicated, consequential relationships through diplomacy.\u00a0 It\u2019s the responsibility of both countries to find a path forward \u2013 and it\u2019s in both our interests, and the interests of the world, that we do so.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll take a few questions.\u00a0 The first question goes to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 China has accused the U.S. of economic containment over the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to limit Beijing\u2019s access to key technology, including semiconductors, as you mentioned.\u00a0 Are you worried that the future U.S. moves in that area will derail the current efforts to stabilize ties with China, and might force the Chinese to take retaliatory measures, perhaps, in other areas of the relationship?\nAnd after your talks here in China, secondly, what\u2019s your impression of the top leadership\u2019s stance on Ukraine, whether they are still likely to provide, eventually, lethal aid to Russia?\u00a0 Or are they at all interested in using their influence with Vladimir Putin to bring about a diplomatic solution to the conflict?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much, Iain.\u00a0 So, on the first part of the question, one of the important things for me to do on this trip was to disabuse our Chinese hosts of the notion that we are seeking to economically contain them.\u00a0 We\u2019re not.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said, we are not about decoupling; we\u2019re about de-risking and diversifying.\nAnd here\u2019s what I mean by that.\u00a0 First, when it comes to decoupling or economic containment, I think the facts simply belie that proposition.\u00a0 As I mentioned, our trade relationship reached the highest number that it\u2019s ever hit last year \u2013 about $700 billion in trade.\u00a0 American foreign direct investment in China has reached levels that we haven\u2019t seen since 2014.\u00a0 Parenthetically, we\u2019ve got about 300,000 Chinese students studying in the United States.\u00a0 We have many American companies that I met with, or at least their representatives here, including the Chamber of Commerce, that continue to be very interested to do business here \u2013 and it\u2019s profoundly in our interest.\nI also noted to our hosts that China\u2019s broad economic success is also in our interest.\u00a0 We have done a remarkable job rebounding from COVID and having a growing economy \u2013 very low unemployment, tremendous investments in our future.\u00a0 But we also benefit tremendously when there is growth and progress in other countries \u2013 especially of one of the world\u2019s largest economies, when it comes to China.\u00a0 So, it simply would not be in our interest to seek to decouple.\u00a0 And as you \u2013 as I mentioned and as you heard Secretary Yellen say to Congress just a few days ago, in fact, it would be disastrous.\nHowever, what is clearly in our interest is making sure that certain specific technologies that China may be using to, for example:\u00a0 advance its very opaque nuclear weapons program, to build hypersonic missiles, to use technology that may have repressive purposes \u2013 it\u2019s not in our interest to provide that technology to China.\u00a0 And I also made that very clear.\u00a0 So, the actions that we\u2019re taking, that we\u2019ve already taken, and as necessary that we\u2019ll continue to take are narrowly focused, carefully tailored to advance and protect our national security.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s a very important distinction.\nNow, we\u2019re also not the only ones doing that.\u00a0 In fact, the phrase of the day, \u201cde-risk, not decouple,\u201d was actually put forward by the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen.\u00a0 And it reflects very well the approach that many countries are taking, both because of the importance of sustaining economic relations \u2013 trade and investment with China, but also because of concerns about some of the things that China is doing with the technology that\u2019s getting to them.\u00a0 So, I spent some time making sure that we were very clear about what we\u2019re doing as well as what we\u2019re not doing.\nWith regard to lethal aid to Russia for use in Ukraine, we and other countries have received assurances from China that it is not and will not provide lethal assistance to Russia for use in Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0 We appreciate that, and we have not seen any evidence that contradicts that.\u00a0 What we do have ongoing concerns about, though, are Chinese firms, companies, that may be providing technology that Russia can use to advance its aggression in Ukraine. \u00a0And we have asked the Chinese Government to be very vigilant about that.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 The next question goes to Marcelo Ninio with O Globo.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I have a question about the BRICS countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa.\u00a0 And last year, China has been within special importance to the BRICS, and even though the government says it\u2019s not an anti-China and U.S. bloc, many people see it this way.\u00a0 The last development gave some reason for people to think like that.\u00a0 There was claims from the U.S. that South Africa is giving weapons to Russia.\u00a0 China wants to expand the BRICS.\u00a0 There is almost 20 countries already lining up to join the BRICS, mostly from the Global South.\u00a0 And my president, President Lula, here in China said that \u2013 criticized very strongly the dominance of the dollar in the world economy.\u00a0 So, the question is:\u00a0 How does the U.S. Government sees the BRICS?\u00a0 Does it see it as a China-led challenge to the West and to the United States?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first, as a general proposition, we have long stood for the proposition that countries should be able to freely associate with other countries in any groupings that they want.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we stand very strongly for and have defended for a long, long time.\nWhen it comes to the BRICS, we\u2019re deeply engaged with its leading members.\u00a0 In fact, this week Prime Minister Modi of India will be in Washington for a state visit.\u00a0 And of course we welcomed President Lula to Washington several months ago, where he had a very productive and constructive meeting with President Biden.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re engaged across the board with members of the BRICS, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 For the next question, Nike Ching with Voice of America.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Good evening, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good evening.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I hope you make more news from this news conference.\u00a0 On Taiwan, how was Taiwan discussed in your 35 minutes meeting with the Chinese President Xi Jinping?\u00a0 U.S. officials have said that military conflict in the Taiwan Strait will be, quote, a global concern.\u00a0 Taiwan will have a presidential election in 2024.\u00a0 Should a democratic election be a pretext to any military escalation in the Taiwan Strait?\u00a0 How did you \u2013 how do you respond to China\u2019s position that Taiwan is an internal issue \u2013 that is not an American concern and upon which where there is no room for compromise?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 From the very beginning of our normalization of relations with China, going back to the three communiques many years ago, fundamental to us, in that, is the understanding that any differences regarding Taiwan will be resolved peacefully.\u00a0 That is foundational to how we understand our relationship.\nAnd for the past almost five decades, this is an issue that China and the United States have managed responsibly.\u00a0 We remain committed to our \u201cone China\u201d policy with the three communiques, the Taiwan Relations Act, the six assurances.\u00a0 We do not support Taiwan\u2019s independence.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made clear that we oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo by either side.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been clear and consistent in our policy, and it\u2019s very important that we preserve the status quo that has helped maintain peace and stability across the strait for decades.\u00a0 So, I reiterated that to our Chinese counterparts.\u00a0 President Biden has also made that repeatedly clear in his engagements with China.\nAt the same time, we and many others have deep concerns about some of the provocative actions that China has taken in recent years, going back to 2016.\u00a0 And the reason that this is a concern for so many countries, not just the United States, is that were there to be a crisis over Taiwan, the likelihood is that that would produce an economic crisis that could affect quite literally the entire world.\u00a0 Fifty percent of commercial container traffic goes through the Taiwan Strait every day.\u00a0 Seventy percent of semiconductors are manufactured on Taiwan.\u00a0 If as a result of a crisis that was taken offline, it would have dramatic consequences for virtually every country around the world, which is, again, why there has been rising concern about some of the provocative actions that China has taken.\u00a0 I also made that very clear.\nPresident Biden believes strongly that one of the successful aspects of our relationship with China, going back five decades, has been the responsible management of the Taiwan question.\u00a0 We continue to believe that that\u2019s essential.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 The next question goes to Ni Xiaowen with Phoenix TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m from Phoenix TV.\u00a0 We know for some time now the United States has been pushing dialogue with China.\u00a0 At the same time, we saw the United States has included some Chinese companies to its entity list and restricted CHIPS Act \u2013 chips exports to China and plan to limit investment in high-tech sector.\u00a0 And China believes the United States is both seeking dialogue and the same time containing China.\u00a0 So, I want to ask how will U.S. address these concerns and to show sincerity to communicate?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, as I noted, this was actually an important part of the conversations that we had.\u00a0 And as I suggested to our colleague a few minutes ago, it was important to me that we make clear the very clear differences between allegations that we\u2019re trying to contain China and decouple economically, as opposed to what we\u2019re actually doing \u2013 which is, as I\u2019ve said, de-risking and also diversifying when it comes to our supply chains.\nAs I mentioned, the economic relationship with China is vitally important; and also, when it\u2019s fair, a very positive thing for countries around the world.\u00a0 And at a time when countries are trying to rebound from COVID, something the United States has done very successfully, we want to see growth, we want to see success, in every part of the world, including, of course, in the major economies like China.\u00a0 It\u2019s in our interest.\u00a0 But at the same time, as I said, it\u2019s not in our interest to provide technology to China that could be used against us.\u00a0 And at a time when it\u2019s engaged in a buildup of its nuclear weapons program in a very opaque way, when it\u2019s producing hypersonic missiles, when it\u2019s using technology for repressive purposes against its own people, how is it in our interest to provide those specific technologies to China?\u00a0 And other countries feel the same way.\nSo, what this is about, again, is not trying to cut off, eliminate, hinder economic relations.\u00a0 On the contrary, we think that they should be strengthened but in a way that looks out for our workers, that looks out for our companies.\u00a0 And I heard many concerns about that today.\u00a0 But at the same time, we can, we will, and we must take steps necessary to protect our national security.\u00a0 If the shoe were on the other foot, I have no doubt that China would do exactly the same thing.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 And the final question goes to Kylie Atwood with CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I just want to follow up on one comment you made earlier, and then I have two questions in classic fashion here.\nYou said that you have received assurances \u2013 or you said the United States has received assurances from China that they will not provide lethal aid to Russia.\u00a0 Were those assurances specifically made to you today?\u00a0 And do you believe that is a final decision on behalf of Chinese leadership given the U.S. has said that they are considering providing lethal aid to Russia in the past?\nMy second question:\u00a0 Did your Chinese counterparts agree to set up a crisis communications channel or military-to-military channel of communications that both sides could reliably use if they agreed to it?\u00a0 When will those channels be set up?\nAnd then generally, can you say that U.S.-China relations are in a better place today than they were before your visit?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 So, with regard to assurances on providing lethal assistance to Russia for use in Ukraine, this is not \u2013 this is not new today.\u00a0 This is something that China has said in recent weeks and has repeatedly said \u2013 not only to us, but to many other countries that have raised this concern \u2013 that they are not and will not provide lethal assistance to Russia for use in Ukraine.\u00a0 And that\u2019s an important commitment, an important policy.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve not seen anything right now to contradict that.\u00a0 But what we are concerned about is private companies in China that may be providing assistance, in some cases dual use, in some cases clearly directed at enhancing Russia\u2019s military capacity in Ukraine.\u00a0 That is a concern, and it\u2019s something that I pointed out to our Chinese counterparts and urged that they be vigilant in policing that.\nWith regard to crisis communications and military-to-military channels, this is also something that I raised repeatedly during this trip.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s absolutely vital that we have these kind of communications, military to military.\u00a0 That imperative, I think, was only underscored by recent incidents that we saw in the air and on the seas.\u00a0 And at this moment, China has not agreed to move forward with that.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s an issue that we have to keep working on.\u00a0 It is very important that we restore those channels.\u00a0 If we agree that we have a responsibility to manage this relationship responsibly, if we agree that it\u2019s in our mutual interests to make sure that the competitive aspects of the relationship don\u2019t veer into conflict, then surely we can agree and see the need for making sure that the channels of communication that we\u2019ve both said are necessary to do that include military-to-military channels.\nSo this is something that we\u2019re going to keep working on, and as I said, there\u2019s no immediate progress, but it is a continued priority for us.\nFinally, with regard to the trip itself, look, it was clear coming in that the relationship was at a point of instability, and both sides recognized the need to work to stabilize it.\u00a0 And specifically, we believe that it\u2019s important to, as I said, establish better lines of communication, open channels of communication, both to address misperceptions, miscalculations, to ensure that that competition doesn\u2019t veer into conflict.\u00a0 And we were able not only today and yesterday to move back to those kinds of communications, but also I think we can anticipate in the weeks ahead visits by other senior officials \u2013 Chinese officials coming to the United States for that purpose.\nSecond, it was important to use this visit for purposes of stabilizing the relationship to be able to directly raise, face to face, issues of concern, places where we have profound differences.\u00a0 Those disagreements are pretty well-known.\u00a0 There are bilateral challenges; there are global issues, regional security issues, values, human rights.\u00a0 And we did, in great detail and at some length, raise them, discuss them; and that is also beneficial \u2013 to make sure that we have clarity between us on these differences, clarity on intent.\nFinally, this was an opportunity to explore areas where we might cooperate in the interests of our own people, in the interests of people around the world \u2013 on climate, on global economic stability, on global health, on fentanyl, as I mentioned \u2013 on exchanges, actually, between our people.\nSo, I think on \u2013 in terms of those objectives that we set for this trip \u2013 establishing open communications channels, directly raising issues of concern, exploring cooperation in places where it\u2019s in our mutual interest to do so \u2013 we did all of that on this trip.\u00a0 But progress is hard.\u00a0 It takes time.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not the product of one visit, one trip, one conversation.\u00a0 My hope and expectation is: we will have better communications, better engagement going forward.\u00a0 That\u2019s certainly not going to solve every problem between us.\u00a0 Far from it.\u00a0 But it is critical to doing what we both agree is necessary, and that is responsibly managing the relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s in the interests of the United States to do that.\u00a0 It\u2019s in the interests of China to do that.\u00a0 It\u2019s in the interests of the world.\u00a0 And I think we took a positive step in that direction over the last two days.\nThank you.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Why should the U.S. engage in continued talks over the coming weeks, if China won\u2019t engage with you on setting those military-to-military channels of communication?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Because, as we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019re not going to have success on every issue between us on any given day, but in a whole variety of areas \u2013 on the terms that we set for this trip, we have made progress and we are moving forward.\u00a0 But again, I want to emphasize none of this gets solved, resolved with one visit, one trip, one conversation.\u00a0 It\u2019s a process.\u00a0 And my hope and expectation is that we\u2019re more engaged in that.\nAt the end of the day, the best way that we can advance our interests, stand up for our values, and make sure that we are very clear about our intent \u2013 the best way to do that is through direct engagement, through diplomacy, and that\u2019s my responsibility.\nThe meetings that we had, I thought, were very candid, very in-depth, and in places constructive, and in other places we have a lot more work to do.\nMR MILLER: \u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Yes, 12:02, so good afternoon.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 I don\u2019t have my watch.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Take it on faith.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re on \u2013 as always, on the same time.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 On the same time, always.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So Vivian, Foreign Minister, it\u2019s wonderful to have you here at the State Department.\u00a0 We have actually worked closely together since the last time I was in government, and I value the conversations we\u2019ve had over many years.\u00a0 And one of the things that I can say very clearly is that every time I have an opportunity to spend time with the foreign minister I learn something, and I am grateful for that.\nSingapore is for the United States a true partner.\u00a0 And having the opportunity today to discuss so many issues that bring us together regionally \u2013 bilaterally in the first instance, regionally, but also globally was very, very beneficial.\u00a0 But if I could, Vivian, let me just begin with a few words about my upcoming visit to the People\u2019s Republic of China since we\u2019re leaving tonight on that trip.\nWe look forward to having a series of meetings with senior officials in Beijing, building on the engagements that we\u2019ve had with the PRC since President Biden and President Xi met in Bali late last year.\u00a0 And to summarize it, the trip has three objectives.\u00a0 First, to establish open and empowered communications so that our two countries responsibly manage our relationship, including by discussing challenges, by addressing misperceptions, and avoiding miscalculations.\nSecond, to advance U.S. interests and values and those we share with allies and partners around the world, including speaking directly and candidly about our very real concerns on a range of issues.\u00a0 And third, to explore the potential for cooperation on transnational challenges \u2013 global economic stability, illicit synthetic drugs, climate, global health \u2013 where our countries\u2019 interests intersect and the rest of the world expects us to cooperate.\nIntense competition requires sustained diplomacy to ensure that competition does not veer into confrontation or conflict.\u00a0 And again, that is what the world expects of both the United States and China.\nNow, our friends in Singapore and Southeast Asia more broadly are essential to realizing what is a shared vision for a free and open, a prosperous, a secure, connected, a resilient Indo-Pacific, where people, where goods, where ideas can travel freely, where rules are applied fairly and transparently.\u00a0 And indeed, for six decades now the Strategic Partnership between the United States and Singapore, rooted in respect for the rules-based international order, has helped strengthen peace and stability in the region and around the world.\nI reaffirmed to the foreign minister that ASEAN is at the heart of our Indo-Pacific Strategy.\u00a0 The United States supports ASEAN\u2019s centrality, and we see a considerable convergence between our own Indo-Pacific Strategy and ASEAN\u2019s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, epitomized by a shared belief in inclusive economic growth, transparency, and the rule of law.\u00a0 Vivian and I discussed Russian and the ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 Singapore has consistently stood up in enacting sanctions that are taking a toll on Russia\u2019s war machine.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to support Ukraine as we work toward a just and lasting peace, one based on the principles that I laid out recently in Helsinki.\nRespect for human rights and self-determination are also being challenged in Burma, where the military\u2019s coup and the brutal crackdown continues to harm civilians, to deprive them of their right to choose their own path, and threatens regional stability.\u00a0 We appreciate Singapore and ASEAN\u2019s critical role in seeking a peaceful solution.\u00a0 The United States will continue to impose strong sanctions against those perpetrating atrocities.\u00a0 We welcome Singapore\u2019s partnership in maintaining the necessary economic pressure.\nOur two countries are also seizing new opportunities to work together from space and cyber to supply chain resiliency to clean energy.\u00a0 We spent some time talking about that.\u00a0 As part of the Green Shipping Challenge launched at COP27 last year, Singapore recently announced an MOU with the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to upgrade digital infrastructure and to reduce emissions.\u00a0 We\u2019re partnering to advance our clean energy across ASEAN, including the ASEAN power grid, which will facilitate renewable energy development and deployment throughout the region and help Singapore transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.\u00a0 And as part of our expanded U.S.-Singapore climate change partnership, we\u2019re announcing today new and enhanced areas of cooperation from reducing deforestation to encouraging energy-efficient buildings.\nAll this collaboration is rooted in one of our strongest bilateral relationships in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 American companies \u2013 we talked about this as well \u2013 are the largest source of foreign direct investment in Singapore.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to grow our economies even faster and even fairer through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, of which Singapore was an early and enthusiastic supporter.\u00a0 Singapore is also a critical security partner, hosting American ships and aircraft, sending pilots to train in the skies above Arizona and Idaho.\nAnd for evidence of our robust people-to-people ties, one need look only for example at Singapore\u2019s cabinet, where over half the ministers, including Prime Minister Lee, have studied in the United States.\u00a0 President Yacob is also a distinguished alum of the State Department\u2019s International Visitors Leadership Program, proving that we have a pretty good eye for talent. (Laughter.)\u00a0 Recently, the Prime Minister urged the people of Singapore, and I quote, \u201cTo think boldly, to aim high, to seek far.\u201d\u00a0 Those are wise and powerful words, and I look forward to that spirit continuing to guide the close partnership between Singapore and the United States.\nVivian.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Tony.\u00a0 It\u2019s always special to meet you here.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve been meeting regularly for about seven years, including in different incarnations.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s right.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0But \u2013 and so I will confess to being biased, but I think the United States is very blessed to have the ultimate, consummate diplomat in you, and more so at these very testing, trying, and challenging times.\u00a0 So it\u2019s an honor to be here, and thank you for the opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues just now.\nWe first reaffirmed the excellent, longstanding, close, stable relationship between the United States and Singapore, and I should add our shared commitment to a rules-based international order, and the fact that it was the United States seven, eight decades ago which in fact envisioned, underwrote, and supported this rules-based international order. \u00a0And even now as we go through challenging times, I think we need to reaffirm the importance of such a system.\nWe also covered a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues.\u00a0 I think on the bilateral front everyone knows that we\u2019ve got a very robust, economic relationship.\u00a0 And of course, we are in that special category which is defined as a major security cooperation partner of the United States.\u00a0 But we haven\u2019t stood still.\u00a0 We\u2019re also expanding into new frontiers.\u00a0 You\u2019ve just mentioned the updated United States-Singapore Climate Partnership, and this will focus on collaboration in five areas, including regional energy transition in Southeast Asia and also low and zero emission solutions.\u00a0 So watch this space.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot happening.\nWe are also working in other areas like cybersecurity, all the more pertinent now with the challenges that we are facing.\u00a0 And also we \u2013 we also signed the Artemis Accords last year, so that\u2019s another whole new frontier for collaboration.\nI mentioned just now that in fact for 33 years we\u2019ve had the Memorandum of Understanding regarding the United States use of our facilities, both naval and aviation.\u00a0 Again, that has been a symbol of our belief that the United States strategic presence and contribution to our part of the world has provided stability, has provided opportunity, and helped to underwrite the peace which we should never take for granted.\nSingapore is home today to over 5,700 United States companies, and I also made the point that the United States investments in Singapore exceed what the United States has invested in Japan, China, and ROK combined.\u00a0 If you consider how small Singapore is, that statistic becomes all the more remarkable.\nOn the other side of that same equation, Singapore\u2019s investments into the United States and U.S. exports to Singapore in fact support more than 2,000 \u2013 250,000 jobs in America itself.\u00a0 So I know it\u2019s not just about trade for its own sake but also in terms of jobs and opportunities for people on both sides.\nI also wanted to commend the very active regional engagement under President Biden\u2019s administration and with your shepherding the efforts in our part of the world.\u00a0 The fact that President Biden attended the ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh last year and the President also hosted the ASEAN-U.S. Special Summit in Washington in May last year, that sent a very strong signal of engagement.\u00a0 And we also elevated the ASEAN-U.S. relations to a comprehensive Strategic Partnership last year; and it\u2019s not just a formal words but the real substance, the real deal.\nWe also look forward to working with you \u2013 and you mentioned it just now \u2013 to align the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And we hope that there will be further discussions, hopefully when the President and you can visit our part of the world for the ASEAN meetings, the EAS Summit, the ASEAN-U.S. Summit as well, either here or in our part of the world in the near future.\nSo I think the point is we do want to reaffirm the importance, the critical importance, of the U.S. anchoring your strategic engagement in our part of the world.\u00a0 And I made the point that there is in fact a deep reservoir of goodwill and trust, and you have many partners in the Asia Pacific.\u00a0 Maybe others may not be as explicit as we are in saying how welcome you are, but I give you the assurance that everyone wants to see you engaged in our part of the world.\nThe IPEF, which we also discussed, is another strong reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to the economic agenda in Southeast Asia and \u2013 no, in fact the Asia Pacific.\u00a0 We welcome the substantial conclusion of the negotiations on the second pillar of the IPEF, and this focuses on supply chains.\u00a0 And we hope that the remaining pillars of the IPEF will include meaningful provisions that will lead to concrete benefits and even greater regional integration.\nFinally, I know you\u2019ve got a big visit coming up; I believe you\u2019re leaving tonight.\u00a0 And I wanted to say that we commend your efforts.\u00a0 This is a very important and critical moment, not just for the United States and China but, indeed, the rest of the world will be watching.\u00a0 So we hope and believe that you will be able to manage the differences, but more important, establish open channels of communication, build mutual trust and understanding, and I wish you smooth sailing and a successful visit ahead.\nSo thank you again for hosting me.\u00a0 Thank you for this chance to, as always, have very open, candid, sincere discussions, and I wish you all the very best.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions.\u00a0 First one goes to Simon Lewis with Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First, to the foreign minister, Dr. Balakrishnan, the Secretary mentioned that Myanmar came up in your discussions.\u00a0 I wondered if I could ask you for Singapore\u2019s position on an initiative by the caretaker government in Thailand to re-engage with Myanmar\u2019s military junta and reportedly inviting the junta back into ASEAN meetings.\u00a0 Is that something that Singapore would support?\u00a0 And I\u2019d also be interested in your response to the recent report by the UN special rapporteur on Myanmar, on human rights in Myanmar, who identified $254 million worth of goods that have come through Singaporean entities to the Myanmar military.\u00a0 So interested in your response to that.\nAnd for the Secretary, I would also be interested in your view on whether ASEAN nations, including Singapore \u2013 also Thailand \u2013 should be doing more to stop the violence in Myanmar.\u00a0 And then specifically on Thailand, I wondered if we could get your view on efforts to form a new government there.\u00a0 Are you concerned about the Thai military trying to cling onto power despite the clear \u2013 pretty clear results of the election?\nAnd just an additional one because it\u2019s breaking news.\u00a0 President Putin has said that tactical nuclear weapons have been deployed to Belarus.\u00a0 Secretary, what\u2019s the U.S. response to that, and are there consequences for Russia and Belarus?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 Well, thank you.\u00a0 I think I counted at least three questions.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Let me get back to first principles.\u00a0 We condemn the coup in Myanmar and the ongoing violence against civilians, the instability in the country, the setback to national reconciliation, and the enormous impact on the economy.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it\u2019s now more than two years.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t seen any signs of improvement.\u00a0 From an ASEAN perspective, we have the Five-Point Consensus, and we haven\u2019t seen any significant progress in fulfilling the Five-Point Consensus.\nSo we believe it would be premature to re-engage with the junta at a summit level or even at a foreign minister level and, in fact, our leaders at the recent ASEAN summit reaffirmed this position.\u00a0 Having said that, the ASEAN chair, Indonesia, is engaging across a wide spectrum of stakeholders, and the key point is this.\u00a0 You do need everyone ultimately to sit down and negotiate.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how long it will take.\u00a0 The last time, it took 25 years for some form of democratic transition to occur in Myanmar; I hope it won\u2019t take that long.\nBut it\u2019s very important for the rest of us, whilst we are in favor of reconciliation, we\u2019re in favor of more dialogue, we obviously want to make sure that the level of violence goes down.\u00a0 And certainly from Singapore\u2019s perspective, our policy is that we should all do our best to make sure arms, or even dual-use items which can be used to inflict harm and injury on civilians, should be proscribed.\nI noted Tom Andrews\u2019 report, and one line in it is worth quoting.\u00a0 And he said that, \u201cThere are no indications that the Government of Singapore has approved, or is involved in, the shipment of arms and associated materials to the Myanmar military,\u201d unquote.\u00a0 But more important, we\u2019re also engaging Tom Andrews, because any specific information which he has access to and which we can use for investigations or, if need be, to prosecute companies or entities which are breaching our laws and our policies and arms and dual use \u2013 rest assured, we will get to the bottom of it.\nBut the bigger question is when will peace come back \u2013 Tony, I\u2019m afraid I remain pessimistic.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 You can sign my name onto every word of what the foreign minister just said, including, unfortunately, the pessimism that he expressed at the end, which we share.\u00a0 But everything that the minister said I ascribe to as well.\u00a0 We are very focused in supporting ASEAN efforts to move forward toward a resolution that ends the violence, that frees people in jail, that puts Burma back on a democratic path.\u00a0 The Five-Point Consensus that the junta signed onto has not been, to say \u2013 to state the obvious, advanced, much less met.\nAnd it\u2019s very important that we continue, all of us, to sustain the appropriate pressure on the junta and look for ways, of course, to engage the opposition in Burma and find every possible avenue to advance Burma\u2019s return to their democratic path, to an end to the violence, the freedom of people who\u2019ve been unjustly imprisoned.\u00a0 And in all of these efforts, we are working \u2013 the United States and Singapore \u2013 very closely together, both through ASEAN but also on a bilateral basis.\nWith regard to Thailand, I\u2019d simply say that our full expectation is that the government will be formed pursuant to the laws of Thailand.\u00a0 That is our expectation.\u00a0 That\u2019s the expectation of people in Thailand as well.\nWith regard to the reports about Belarus, we\u2019ve seen comments that were made in the last few hours.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation very closely and very carefully.\u00a0 We have no reason to adjust our own nuclear posture.\u00a0 We don\u2019t see any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 The President said again this week that we remain committed to the defense of NATO \u2013 every inch of its territory \u2013 so that is our north star and we\u2019re very focused on that.\nI would just note that one of President Putin\u2019s claims for starting his brutal invasion of Ukraine \u2013 one of the many rationales he gave at various points \u2013 was, ostensibly, to prevent the threat of Ukraine reacquiring the nuclear weapons that it gave up when the Soviet Union dissolved and Ukraine voluntarily gave up the weapons it inherited, along with Belarus and Kazakhstan.\u00a0 So it would be rather ironic, among many other things, for President Putin to now be talking about putting nuclear weapons on the territory of a neighboring state \u2013 again, including a state that gave up the nuclear weapons that it inherited when the Soviet Union dissolved.\nAnd as for Belarus itself, this is just another example of Lukashenka making irresponsible, provocative choices to cede control of Belarus\u2019s sovereignty against the will of the Belarusian people.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Next question goes to Nirmal Ghosh with\u00a0The Straits Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Minister, you have spoken about the new frontiers in the relationship with the United States.\u00a0 Could you elaborate a bit on that?\u00a0 You mentioned the climate partnership, cyber security, and so forth \u2013 a few more specifics, if you could share.\nAnd secondly, as has been mentioned, a lot of the world is watching the Secretary\u2019s forthcoming visit to China.\u00a0 I wonder if you could give us a Singapore and/or Southeast Asian view of U.S.-China relations.\u00a0 And Mr. Secretary, if you could also speak to that latter part about\u00a0\u2013 again, about ASEAN centrality and how it all fits into the Indo-Pacific Strategy with China.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 Well, thank you, Nirmal.\u00a0 I used to be the minister of environment before this incarnation, so I was heavily involved with the final negotiations for the Paris Agreement.\u00a0 One observation which I will make is that we would not have arrived at the agreement in Paris if it hadn\u2019t been for the confluence of strategic and environmental interests of the United States and China, and I can tell you that from direct experience.\u00a0 And in a\u00a0sense, that\u2019s why tonight\u2019s trip is so important, because there are many global, planetary issues\u00a0\u2013 climate, pandemics, even cyber security \u2013 which require the United States and China to work off the same page and be key pillars for a global system which will help increase resilience to threats to welfare, health, and prosperity for people all over the world.\nSo you go with our full support.\u00a0 But having said that, speaking now, as a diplomat, I want to make this plea:\u00a0 Please don\u2019t put too much weight on poor Tony\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The fact is diplomats need time and space and sometimes just some quiet time to engage in some honest-to-goodness conversations without having to put out a tweet every hour or two.\u00a0 The trip is essential, but not sufficient.\u00a0 There are fundamental differences in outlook, in values.\u00a0 And it takes time for mutual respect and strategic trust to be built in.\u00a0 So it\u2019s important, but I\u2019m also making clear I hope people don\u2019t have excessive expectations on that front.\nOn your question about the new frontiers, I already mentioned the climate partnership.\u00a0 And there are five focal areas under that partnership, which include the regional energy transition; second, low- and zero-emission technologies and solutions, the \u2013 nature-based solutions and carbon markets; and fifth, urban decarbonization, resilience, and capacity-building.\u00a0 And even in all these areas, you can see that there\u2019s obvious opportunities for synergy and cooperation between the United States and Singapore, not just for our own sake but in our region as well.\u00a0 I mentioned the Artemis Accords, so outer space is certainly another frontier.\u00a0 And of course we\u2019ve been working very closely, especially in the last couple of years, on cyber security, because that is a clear and present frontier where there\u2019s both risk and opportunity.\u00a0 So watch this space.\u00a0 Tony?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m, as always, tempted to say, \u201cWhat he said,\u201d \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 because once again, I think the foreign minister has captured it very, very well on all fronts.\u00a0 Look, with regard to ASEAN, I simply want to note and emphasize something I noted before.\u00a0 If you look at our own Indo-Pacific Strategy, and you then look at the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, the coincidence of these approaches, these strategies, these visions is very, very strong, very, very high.\nAnd that speaks to why we do put a premium on ASEAN centrality and why, as Vivian pointed out, starting with President Biden, we have had significant engagement, re-engagement with ASEAN over the last two and a half years.\u00a0 Economic growth \u2013 inclusive economic growth \u2013 transparency, the rule of law, but also work on discrete issues and areas that have a real impact on the lives of people in the region as well as in the United States, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s global health.\u00a0 All of these are front and center in what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 And one of the things that we talked about today is \u2013 we just spent some time talking about Burma.\u00a0 And of course that tends, in ASEAN meetings and U.S.-ASEAN engagement, maybe that tends to get the headlines, and it\u2019s hugely important.\nBut if you look at the agenda that we\u2019re actually pursuing, both at the meetings that we have and then day-in, day-out, it\u2019s a very broad universe of issues, of subjects, all of which really go to the needs, the aspirations, the hopes of people in the ASEAN region and in the United States.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Next question \u2014\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0So watch what we do, not just what we say, and you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s a full range of activities for the United States and its engagement with ASEAN.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Next question goes to Jennifer Hansler with CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, on Iran, how would you characterize the ongoing indirect talks with Tehran? \u00a0Would you say that you\u2019re optimistic that an understanding can be reached between the two sides on constraining Iran\u2019s growing nuclear program?\u00a0 And then the Omani foreign minister said earlier this week that he believes the two sides are close on a deal for the detainees.\u00a0 Do you agree with that characterization?\nAnd then moving on to the China detainee issue, are you committed to raising the case of Kai Li, Mark Swidan, and David Lin in your meetings in Beijing?\u00a0 And more broadly, to both you, Mr.\u00a0Secretary and Mr. Foreign Minister, are you optimistic \u2013 given what you said about this not being sufficient, are you optimistic that this will lead the way to continued meetings, continued dialogues between the U.S. and China, including on the military-to-military front?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Great.\u00a0 Thanks, Jennifer.\u00a0 With regard to Iran, some of the reports that we\u2019ve seen about an agreement on nuclear matters or, for that matter, on detainees are simply not accurate and not true.\nOn the nuclear side of the equation, we are determined to ensure that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 We remain convinced that the best way to do that is through diplomacy.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t taken any option off the table.\u00a0 You\u2019ve heard that clearly from the President.\u00a0 But we continue to believe that diplomacy would be the most effective path forward, but there is no agreement, and reports to the contrary or simply inaccurate.\nWhen it comes to our detained citizens in Iran, nothing would please me more than to be able to say that we have an agreement that secures their release.\u00a0 But that, too, would not be accurate.\u00a0 It\u2019s something we continue to work on intensely on a regular basis, and that\u2019s separate and apart from any conversations we have on nuclear matters.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not in a position to say that we have an agreement.\nWith regard to the visit, two things.\u00a0 One, yes, I will be raising the detainees.\u00a0 This has been an ongoing conversation with the PRC and something that, for me, is always at the top of my list \u2013 that is, looking out for the security and well-being of Americans around the world, including those who are being detained in one way or another, including arbitrarily.\nMore broadly, what we\u2019re working to do on this trip is to really carry forward what President Biden and President Xi agreed to in Bali at the end of last year, which was to establish sustained, regular lines of communication at senior levels across our governments precisely so that we can make sure that we are communicating as clearly as possible to avoid, as best possible, misunderstandings and miscommunications.\u00a0 Because if we want to make sure, as we do, that the competition that we have with China doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, the place you start is with communicating.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ll see what comes from this visit, but this is directly in response to what the two presidents agreed in Bali last November.\nAnd as to what comes next, let\u2019s see how the visit goes.\u00a0 I think Vivian said it very well.\u00a0 This is an important but, in a sense, insufficient step because there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u00a0 I\u2019d note as well that even as we\u2019re trying to make sure, through better communications, that the competition doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, we\u2019re also looking at areas where we might cooperate in the interests of the American people, in the interests of China and its people, but also in the interests of people around the world.\u00a0 One of the clear demand signals that that we get, including from our close friends and partners, is that both the United States and the PRC will responsibly manage this relationship and look for areas where our cooperation might produce results that benefit not only our own people but people around the world, including in the region.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll be looking at that as well.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, the only thing I can add there is perhaps a perspective from Southeast Asia.\u00a0 First, if you look 100 years down the road, we see both China and the United States being a clear presence for the century and beyond.\u00a0 Second, we see the United States remaining a Pacific partner and power and stakeholder.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want you to go away.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And we\u2019re not.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0\u00a0Good.\u00a0 Third, if you look at the challenges confronting the world right now \u2013 and we\u2019ve enumerated climate, pandemics, cyber, opportunities in outer space \u2013 now more than ever, we will need \u2013 even as the world transits into a multipolar world, now more than ever, we need a rules-based multilateral system with institutions and processes fit for purpose, updated where necessary.\u00a0 And again, this requires the United States and China to achieve a modus vivendi.\nSo this trip is important, it\u2019s essential, but it doesn\u2019t stop there.\u00a0 And I think Tony knows the views of all of us in Southeast Asia: the more you travel and engage, the better.\u00a0 And as I said, I am biased because I \u2013 he\u2019s a friend, and I can think of no better diplomat at this point in time, in his cool, rational, emollient way, to deal with some very fundamental differences.\u00a0 Because the two societies \u2013 and here we speak from experience.\u00a0 China and the U.S. are not going to converge and become one identical entity.\u00a0 And the challenge for all of us, both mentally, emotionally, and diplomatically, is to hold sometimes contrarian thoughts in one mind.\nAnd this is the challenge of the century.\u00a0 Fifty years ago when Henry Kissinger went to Beijing, it completely reordered the strategic furniture in the globe.\u00a0 We are coming close to a point when this will be necessary again.\u00a0 So we all watch with interest and concern and some optimism \u2013 because as diplomats we all have to be optimistic, otherwise you will not keep trying.\u00a0 So let\u2019s support these efforts and let\u2019s see where you \u2013 where you\u2019ll take it.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0For the final question, Benji Hyer with Feature Story News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you both.\u00a0 Here on behalf of Channel NewsAsia today, CNA.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard Washington and Singapore\u2019s position on U.S.-China relations.\u00a0 I wanted to ask your perspective on ties between Russia and China.\u00a0 How much is the \u2013 what they call the friendship with no limits between Moscow and Beijing a concern for the U.S. Secretary of State and foreign minister for the Indo-Pacific and ASEAN?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ve heard us speak to this on a number of occasions in recent months, and it entirely depends on the practical manifestations of that partnership or that friendship.\u00a0 I\u2019ll let China and Russia address how they view their partnership, but we\u2019ve been very clear, for example, about the importance of countries not providing Russia with the kind of assistance that it can use to advance its aggression in Ukraine.\nEqually we\u2019ve been open and welcoming of efforts, initiatives of countries \u2013 including, for example, China \u2013 to try to play a positive role in diplomacy that can advance a just and durable peace in Ukraine.\u00a0 As it happens right now, there are, I think, representatives from six or seven African countries who are in Ukraine also trying to advance that proposition.\u00a0 I would note the terrible irony of the fact that while they\u2019re in Kyiv, more missiles from Russian rain down on the Ukrainian capital, but I\u2019ll leave that to others to underscore that particular irony.\nBut as with \u2013 again, as with many countries, we want to ensure that no one is adding fuel to this fire Russia is making.\u00a0 And if countries by the same token can play a positive, productive role, including China, in trying to find a path to a just and durable peace, that\u2019s something we welcome as well.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BALAKRISHNAN:\u00a0 Well, Singapore is a tiny city-state.\u00a0 We\u2019ve only been independent for almost 58 years, so I hope you understand from our perspective the UN Charter, international law, and the precepts of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity are sacrosanct for us.\u00a0 We have no other alternative.\u00a0 And therefore, for us this invasion is something which we had to take a stand on, and we have.\u00a0 And we \u2013 that\u2019s expressed in our votes in the General Assembly and also in some specific sanctions that we have taken against Russia.\u00a0 And I \u2013 it\u2019s something which we don\u2019t do routinely or lightly, but it\u2019s an expression of how strongly we feel on this matter.\nI can\u2019t speak for China, but I would say that at least in their interactions with us \u2013 and also in their public statements \u2013 China also has affirmed the importance of territorial integrity, independence, and sovereignty.\u00a0 And like Tony, I also hope that their efforts will bear fruit.\u00a0 And we really have to pray for peace because we know that at the end of the day you will end up at the negotiating table.\u00a0 But right now, blood is being shed and lives are being lost for perhaps marginal leverage on the negotiating table.\u00a0 And as humanitarians, all of us must feel the pain and the tragedy of this situation.\u00a0 And I think we all want peace.\u00a0 When it\u2019ll be achieved, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But we all want peace.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-maldivian-foreign-minister-abdulla-shahid-before-their-meeting/", "title":

welcome.\u00a0 My name is Cindy Dyer.\u00a0 I\u2019m the Ambassador-At-Large for the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons here at the Department of State.\u00a0 And I have the honor of kicking off today\u2019s ceremony.\u00a0 Thank you all so much for joining us.\nI know it has been a few years since we could gather such a crowd in person for this ceremony, and it is such a pleasure to see so many friends and colleagues.\u00a0 I\u2019m especially excited that three of my predecessors are here, Ambassadors Luis CdeBaca, Susan Coppedge, and John Richmond.\nToday\u2019s program will consist of the following.\u00a0 First, Secretary Blinken will offer remarks on this year\u2019s report.\u00a0 Then we will honor eight outstanding Trafficking In Persons Report Heroes for their extraordinary dedication to combatting human trafficking.\u00a0 We will also hear briefly from one of the heroes who will speak on behalf of this year\u2019s honorees.\u00a0 Finally, I will offer my own closing remarks.\u00a0 After the ceremony, we hope you will find some time to visit state.gov to access this year\u2019s report online.\nWe are so grateful to you, Secretary Blinken, for joining us today to release the 2023 Trafficking in Persons Report.\u00a0 Thank you for your continuous work elevating the issue of human trafficking in your meetings around the world and here at home, as well as chairing the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.\u00a0 We are proud to serve under your leadership as we all work together to advance efforts to combat human trafficking.\nLadies and gentlemen, the Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 And just to reiterate what Cindy said, it is so wonderful to see you all here at the State Department.\nToday, the State Department is releasing the 2023 Trafficking in Persons Report.\u00a0 This report provides a comprehensive, objective assessment of 188 countries and territories \u2013 including the United States.\u00a0 Its purpose is to showcase successful efforts to prevent trafficking, to identify areas where countries are falling short and have more work to do, and ultimately \u2013 ultimately \u2013 to eliminate trafficking altogether.\nThe United States is committed to combatting human trafficking because it represents an attack on human rights and freedoms.\u00a0 It violates the universal right of every person to have autonomy over their own life and actions.\u00a0 Today, more than 27 million people around the world are denied that right.\nTrafficking harms our societies: weakening the rule of law, corrupting supply chains, exploiting workers, fueling violence.\u00a0 And it disproportionately impacts traditionally marginalized groups: women, LGBTQI+ individuals, persons with disabilities, ethnic and religious minorities.\nIn his first year in office, President Biden released an updated National Action Plan to ensure that our policy response is keeping pace with what is an evolving challenge.\u00a0 Earlier this year, as the ambassador noted, I chaired a meeting of the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, where we reviewed steps that we\u2019ve taken to implement the plan: prohibiting the importation of goods made with forced labor; imposing financial sanctions on those that knowingly profit from that labor; integrating racial equity into our antitrafficking work; strengthening our efforts to counter online sexual exploitation and abuse of children.\nThe TIP Report is a central part of the United States Government\u2019s antitrafficking work, and it reflects the efforts of so many people in this room today \u2013 and countless others both in Washington and around the world.\nAnd that starts with the leadership of Ambassador Dyer and her team at the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, as well as colleagues that we have in our embassies around the world, whose work to interview survivors, to gather information, to conduct factchecking is at the very foundation of the report.\u00a0 Bipartisan efforts in Congress, where there is an ironclad commitment and strong partnership to end trafficking \u2013 including Representative Chris Smith, who\u2019s been a longtime champion and who\u2019s here with us today, and I thank you for your presence and thank you for your leadership over so many years.\u00a0 And members of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking and the Human Trafficking Expert Consultant Network \u2013 their insights, their ideas are indispensable to shaping and evaluating our policy and programs.\nAnd maybe most significantly, most importantly, we\u2019re grateful to the survivors whose courage, whose resilience, and whose perspectives inspire and inform all of our work.\nFinally, a very warm welcome to our eight TIP Report Heroes who are with us today \u2013 you\u2019ll hear a little bit more about them shortly \u2013 journalists, activists, prosecutors, lawmakers, each of whom shares a commitment to stopping trafficking in all of its forms.\nThis year\u2019s report shows a picture of steady progress around the world, with dozens of countries making significant strides in preventing trafficking, in protecting survivors, in prosecuting those who carry out this crime.\nIn Seychelles, the national government offered enhanced training to airport staff and police officers to better spot trafficking.\u00a0 The government also instituted new policies to screen vulnerable populations, like migrants at transit points, for trafficking indicators.\u00a0 That\u2019s helped them identify more victims than ever before and convict a record number of traffickers.\nHong Kong launched a new hotline to help trafficking victims report fraudulent overseas employment scams and to get help.\u00a0 In its first month, that hotline received hundreds of calls, leading to several investigations.\nIn Denmark, authorities led a renewed focus on \u2013 and committed additional resources to \u2013 combatting human trafficking, identifying more victims, prosecuting and convicting more traffickers.\nSo that\u2019s the good news, and these are just examples of it.\u00a0 The report also highlights a number of concerning trends.\nThe first is the continued expansion of forced labor.\u00a0 As the pandemic disrupted supply chains around the world and spiked demand in certain industries, like PPE production, exploitative employers used a host of tactics to take advantage of lower-paid and more vulnerable workers.\nThe second is the rise in labor trafficking using online scams, which have proliferated as more of the world gains access to the internet.\u00a0 The pandemic supercharged this trend.\u00a0 Traffickers capitalized on widespread unemployment to recruit victims with fake job listings and then forced them to run international scams.\nThird, the report exposes the risks facing an often-overlooked segment of trafficking victims: boys and young men.\u00a0 According to a recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2004 and 2020 the percentage of boys identified as victims of human trafficking rose five-fold.\nNow for years, there\u2019s been a widely held \u2013 but incorrect \u2013 belief that trafficking affects exclusively female victims.\u00a0 This false perception has had some, quite frankly, devastating and tangible consequences, with far few support services typically allocated to male victims of trafficking.\nThe reality is that any person, regardless of sex, regardless of gender identity, can be targeted by human traffickers.\u00a0 And so governments, civil society, the private sector \u2013 all of us have to develop resources for all populations, including male victims.\nWhen President Biden released his National Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, he said, and I quote, \u201cWe can accomplish far more working in partnership than we [can] working alone.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s true for the work between governments, between the federal and local officials, and with and between civil society and the private sector.\nWe see that in North Macedonia, where the government partnered with social workers, with NGO staff, with psychologists, with law enforcement to launch mobile teams that identify the majority of trafficking victims in the country.\u00a0 This program has been so effective that several other countries in the Balkans either plan to, or already have, implemented the very same model.\nWe see it in the work of the Issara Institute.\u00a0 That\u2019s an NGO that\u2019s worked hand-in-hand with private sector to help hundreds of thousands of workers learn about their rights and seek remediation when labor abuses occur.\nWe see it in Argentina, where leaders from the federal government regularly meet with representatives from across the country\u2019s 24 jurisdictions, to coordinate their efforts and raise one another\u2019s ambition, including by committing to offer long-term housing to survivors of trafficking.\nFor an issue that\u2019s as complex and as constantly evolving as this one, we simply need all hands on deck.\u00a0 We need law enforcement working to prosecute traffickers.\u00a0 We need social workers providing trauma-informed care to the victims.\u00a0 We need advocates holding governments accountable.\u00a0 We need communities coming together to support the survivors.\u00a0 In many ways, this room reflects that need and reflects that community.\nWe are so grateful to you for the partnership that you\u2019ve shown, sharing expertise, sharing ideas, building and strengthening networks with us.\u00a0 And what I want to share with you today is simply this: the United States is committed to standing with you, and once and for all, ending human trafficking.\nThank you all very much.\u00a0\u00a0 Cindy, back to you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR DYER:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, for those inspiring words.\u00a0 I am now delighted to turn our attention to celebrating the 2023 TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Please join me as we recognize and honor this year\u2019s eight TIP Report Heroes:\nFirst, Pureza Lopes Loyola from\u00a0Brazil \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of her unwavering advocacy on behalf of herself, her son, and others who have experienced forced labor, including through firsthand documentation of evidence and testimony to illustrate the severity and proliferation of exploitative conditions in rural Brazil, which spurred a national movement and prompted the Brazilian Government to establish mobile labor inspection units to increase identification of victims.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd second, Mech Dara from Cambodia in recognition \u2013 (applause) \u2013 of his courageous reporting on human trafficking for the purpose of forced criminality in Cambodia, which led to greater public awareness of and improvement in the Cambodian Government\u2019s anti-trafficking response.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMrs. Iman Al-Sailawi and Mr. Basim Abdulrazzaq Jebur from Iraq \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of their leadership and innovation in establishing FATE, Iraq\u2019s first NGO dedicated to ending human trafficking, which has helped release and support hundreds of individuals, including children and foreign nationals, from dangerous work conditions, forced labor, and sexual exploitation.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEvon Benson-Idahosa from Nigeria \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of her continued commitment to empower and elevate the voices of survivors of sex trafficking through her organization\u2019s transformative programs that address root causes of human trafficking, and her advocacy work with various levels of the Nigerian Government to improve anti-trafficking policy and legislation. (Applause.)\nZaheer Ahmed from Pakistan \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of his pivotal leadership in the application and modernization of anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling laws in Pakistan, the formulation and implementation of a national action plan to combat these crimes, and the improvement of coordination and cooperation efforts between law enforcement and civil society organizations.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPaola Hittscher from Peru \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of her powerful use of innovative partnerships with the Peruvian navy, national police, and civil society to advance the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking cases in the Loreto region of Peru despite a challenging environment of limited funding, security concerns, and limited state presence.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEumelis Moya Goitte from Venezuela \u2013 (applause) \u2013 in recognition of her courageous work to investigate and document human trafficking crimes affecting marginalized indigenous communities that are hard to reach and frequently living under the control of illegal armed groups, drawing international attention to human trafficking crimes in Venezuela\u2019s mining sector, and providing support for international recommendations to prevent human trafficking of vulnerable populations.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you.\u00a0 And now we will hear from one of the 2023 TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Please join me in welcoming R. Evon Benson-Idahosa from Nigeria.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS BENSON-IDAHOSA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Dyer. \u00a0I\u2019m honored to stand before you as a representative of so many who do this work of justice, of reconciliation, most without recognition but with the same tenacity and compassion that each of us being recognized today do.\nEach of these heroes \u2013 Pureza, Mech, Iman and Basim, Zaheer, Paola, and Eumelis \u2013 exemplify courage in the moment in history where more than 27 million people are victimized by the evil that is human trafficking.\u00a0 Thank you to each of you, and to all of you who fortify our arms, for leading the change.\nI also stand before you on behalf of millions of African women whose bodies have been legislated upon, weaponized, but especially on behalf of Faith, a young Nigerian woman whose last words to me in September of 2016 were, \u201cAuntie, I\u2019m dying.\u201d\u00a0 Those three words still echo in my mind and serve as the impetus for why we at Pathfinders, the NGO I founded to protect survivors and prevent the sex trafficking of Nigerian women at home and abroad, continue to do this work.\u00a0 You see, Faith was trafficked from our hometown in Benin City to Libya, and then to Europe, where she involuntarily serviced the underbelly of the European sex industry until her body was literally consumed to death.\u00a0 No one should ever be utilized as a product for consumption.\nFaith\u2019s story represents the reality of thousands of victims annually who are waiting for those of us with access and power and privilege to muster the social and economic courage to do for others what we do for ourselves.\u00a0 As visionaries who see the world as it should be, not as it is, the new face of our response requires a fundamental shift in consciousness that prioritizes reconciliation and promotes an integrated, intersectional, and interdependent methodology.\nYou see, I\u2019m not naive to ignore the geopolitical factors \u2013 the self-interest, the economic realities \u2013 that have culminated in global divides that separate developing from the developed, that use the word \u201cglobal\u201d to demarcate North from South, and both in love and in war other them and hypocritically center us.\u00a0 Nor do I profess to have all the answers to the hard, inconvenient truths that allow for the proliferation of trafficking, that destabilize governments in the pursuit of national interest, that strongarm countries into a legacy of imperialism.\nBut what I do know is that we can all bear witness to the import of human trafficking on our collective suffering and the erosion of our conscience, universal aspirations, and inherent rights and dignity.\u00a0 And so today I offer considerations that are visible in plain sight, considerations that reframe these complex narratives and underscore the reality that one\u2019s interests, rights, and dignities are best preserved when those of others are equally preserved.\u00a0 Both postures are not diametrically opposed.\nTo world leaders who have the power to disrupt trafficking, systemic failures of national and international governments that prioritize profit over people, arbitrary rules over good conscience, can no longer be countenanced.\u00a0 We cannot in good conscience foster a world where vulnerabilities are abused and \u2013 or systemically condoned and exploited.\u00a0 World leaders must consistently reach across the borders and political divides, not to embrace those for whom seats at the table have been intentionally curated, but to invite and make room for those who have consistently been missing from it.\nThose who are the most impacted by the problems that human trafficking and its related geopolitical underbelly have created \u2013 i.e. survivors and local communities \u2013 are whose voices must now be consistently centered.\u00a0 The new face of this movement must democratize and shift power, reconcile, if you will, that power back to those who are seemingly powerless so that they too can take responsibility to birth innovative solutions.\u00a0 World leaders must envisage partnerships that are laced with compassion and empathy, with the understanding that structural transformation demands a tenacious commitment to our collective long-term vision.\nTo survivors and stakeholders who work tirelessly to restore dignity to those from whom it has been violently obliterated, we must enlarge our work from speaking truth to power to also speaking truth to the seemingly powerless \u2013 our local communities.\u00a0 We must unapologetically take up our space as global leaders who, because of our lived experience and expertise, not only deserve a seat at the table but understand that we can create additional, more inclusive tables that diversify and center our voices.\nAnd finally, on a micro level \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and finally, on a micro level, we must each commit to doing the small daily actions that exemplify love \u2013 offering a cup of water to the thirsty, taking only that which you need, abandoning intellectual dishonesty that denies our own complicity in injustice, choosing kindness over indifference and the collective good over individual advancement.\u00a0 That is how we reconcile the world.\u00a0 It is how we choose a world that extols the values that we contend guard our collective conscience and, as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \u201cembody an audacious faith in the future of mankind.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0E se.\u00a0 Thank you for listening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR DYER:\u00a0 Now that\u2019s a hard act to follow.\u00a0 Next year, I\u2019m going to speak first.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you, Evon, for sharing that important message on behalf of all of this year\u2019s heroes.\u00a0 Let\u2019s give this amazing group of leaders another round of applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt is such an honor to celebrate your important work.\u00a0 We are thrilled to be partnering again with our colleagues in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to provide an International Visitors Leadership Program, an IVLP for short, for several of our TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Through the IVLP, our TIP Report Heroes will have the opportunity to meaningfully engage with Americans here in Washington, D.C., Boston, and Miami, who are also working to eliminate human trafficking and support survivors.\u00a0 So we are excited to not just honor you today, but to work together to share best practices and engage.\nToday we are releasing the 2023 Trafficking in Persons Report.\u00a0 The TIP Report is an essential tool in the world\u2019s fight against human trafficking.\u00a0 It not only serves as a central reference point for the status of anti-trafficking efforts in each country, including the United States, but it also highlights the best practices and helps disseminate them.\nThis year we chose to highlight the importance of partnerships in addressing human trafficking.\u00a0 I know firsthand the power of partnerships.\u00a0 Starting out as a local prosecutor in Dallas, Texas, I could see how our response to trafficking situations would be immensely improved if we all had relevant actors \u2013 all the relevant actors together in the same room, preferably with chips and hot sauce.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I joined Dallas County\u2019s very first interagency task force on human trafficking.\u00a0 I have carried that lesson throughout my career, partnering with NGOs to provide guidance as grassroots activists around the world worked to implement or strengthen anti-trafficking legislation in their various communities.\nOver the last 30 years, I have seen the immense benefits of elevating the voices and perspectives of survivors.\u00a0 Survivors can play an important role in shaping policies and programs to ensure that they are survivor-centered and responsive to the needs and experience of survivors.\u00a0 By partnering with survivors, we can promote anti-trafficking efforts grounded in the realities of those who have been most directly impacted by this issue.\nThe need for partnerships starts within our own governments.\u00a0 We need all our various agencies to collaborate to make our work more effective and impactful.\u00a0 This year\u2019s report highlights the progress made in one country, the Comoros, when they established a national committee to enhance interministerial coordination on anti-trafficking efforts.\u00a0 Through this interagency cooperation, they were able to identify more victims, investigate more trafficking crimes, and refer all victims to services.\nStrong partnerships between countries can also address the vulnerability of migrants, refugees, and international job seekers to human traffickers.\u00a0 We saw this in Europe when EU governments banded together to proactively protect Ukrainian refugees to prevent trafficking among them as they fled from Russia\u2019s illegal, full-scale invasion.\u00a0 And in Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines have worked together to assist trafficking victims lured by cybercrime syndicates into cyber-scam operations.\nPartnerships are also critical because they allow us to harness the diverse expertise of different organizations to tackle trafficking in novel ways.\u00a0 At its core, human trafficking is a financially motivated crime.\u00a0 This report highlights how one partnership between PayPal and Polaris in the United States interrupts traffickers\u2019 cash flows and enables parallel prosecutions for financial crimes.\u00a0 Deeper partnerships between financial institutions and law enforcement can better identify the financial trail of human traffickers, allowing law enforcement to collect more evidence to aid prosecutions and lessen the burden on survivors having to testify.\nFinance Against Slavery And Trafficking, or FAST, developed by UN University and financed by Australia, is another great partnership.\u00a0 FAST is leveraging the use of technology to provide a free e-learning training tool for Southeast Asian government officials working on financial regulation, intelligence, and investigation to understand human trafficking, how it is connected to the financial sector, and what they can do to identify and interrupt it.\nAnd we know traffickers are always looking to exploit new vulnerabilities, from conflicts to climate change to the digital world, so we need to continually be building partnerships with new stakeholders.\u00a0 New partnerships between NGOs, governments, law enforcement, survivors, and technology companies can help counter some of these new vulnerabilities.\u00a0 The OSCE and Thomson Reuters used social media and Uber for their Be Safe campaign, reaching hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees about the warning signs of human trafficking.\nAnother great partnership, the Tech Against Trafficking initiative harnesses the expertise of companies and other stakeholders to accelerate technology solutions to combat human trafficking.\u00a0 Through the Accelerator program, tech companies provide mentorship, education, and greater network access to assist anti-trafficking NGOs to pilot or scale up initiatives, such as generating synthetic data to better share and analyze case information responsibly while protecting victim privacy.\nSurvivors are some of our most important partners.\u00a0 Their lived experience can inform our programs and policies, ensuring we maintain a trauma-informed and victim-centered approach.\u00a0 More countries than ever are seeing the benefits of partnering with survivors to enhance their anti-trafficking work.\u00a0 Israel last year established an advisory committee, including two survivors, to help address forced labor issues, while Australia and Canada committed to survivor engagement in their national action plans.\nHere at home, the U.S. Government continues to pursue partnerships to advance our anti-trafficking work.\u00a0 We are enhancing intergovernmental cooperation with the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, regularly bringing together 20 agencies to review and refine our federal anti-trafficking strategies.\u00a0 We are incorporating recommendations of survivors into our policymaking and programs at the highest levels, and working further to integrate survivors into all that we do, including through the work of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking.\u00a0 We are partnering with neighboring countries to reduce the risk of migrants falling prey to human traffickers, and we are championing partnerships with technology companies and financial institutions to better prosecute traffickers, protect victims, and prevent trafficking in the first place.\nAs we close, I want to draw our attention back to the individuals.\u00a0 Behind these pages of statistics and trends and tier rankings are millions of adults and children who are in trafficking situations and depend on our collective efforts.\u00a0 We owe it to them to work together to hold perpetrators accountable, to partner with survivors, to make sure our responses are trauma-informed and victim-centered, and ultimately, to address the underlying factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking.\u00a0 The report offers many recommendations and best practices that are critical steps our government and governments around the world can take to build a world free of human trafficking.\nI\u2019m going to take a page out of a Evon\u2019s book, who quoted the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, who also once said, \u201cThe ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people, but the silence over that by the good people.\u201d\u00a0 It is so humbling and inspiring to be in a room full to the brim with good people who refuse to be silent.\nThank you so much for your steadfast service to others and for joining us today.\u00a0 Please remember to go to state.gov to check out this year\u2019s full report online.\u00a0 The cards and bookmarks you have received at today\u2019s event have a QR code you can scan to reach the website.\u00a0 Thank you for coming.\u00a0 Thank you all.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinken-and-nato-secretary-general-jens-stoltenberg-before-their-meeting/", "title":

say I\u2019ve never really gotten used to people standing up when I enter a room.\u00a0 I always say look, if you really need the exercise, go ahead.\u00a0 And I\u2019m honored to be here tonight as Scott Nathan\u2019s opening act.\u00a0 I know you\u2019re looking forward to hearing from Scott.\nBut on a serious note, let me first begin by expressing again the deepest condolences of the United States to the victims of the terrible train crash in Odisha just a week or so ago.\u00a0 I had an opportunity to speak to my friend Foreign Minister Jaishankar when we \u2013 just shortly after the accident, and just to convey to him how much it had resonated here in the United States as we saw the images and to let him know that we stand with the people of India as they recover from this human tragedy.\nEd, thank you for your incredibly generous words \u2013 overly generous words \u2013 but especially for your leadership.\u00a0 This could not be, as I\u2019ll get into in a few moments, a more critical, a more vital time for our business communities, our private sectors to be working together, and your leadership in helping to make that happen is more important than ever.\nTo my friend Ambassador Sandhu, thank you for your remarkable work in advancing the relationship between our countries and between our people.\u00a0 Now, I know your relatively new counterpart in India.\u00a0 Ambassador Eric Garcetti has hit the ground at a full sprint trying to catch up with you.\u00a0 And maybe more important, your teams are working together, coming up with exciting new ways to further the partnership between our countries.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t be more pleased that both India and the United States have remarkable representatives in each other\u2019s countries at this time.\nAnd to my colleague and friend Ambassador Keshap, I\u2019m not only grateful for your work here, but for decades of service to your country at the State Department, including as charg\u00e9 in India during the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 I had an opportunity to make one of my first trips in this job to India at that time and saw the remarkable work that Atul was doing to lead our mission in a very challenging moment, but also to see in that moment the truly extraordinary partnership between India and the United States as we came to each other\u2019s assistance during some of the more challenging moments of COVID for each of our countries.\nAnd of course, last but not least, thank you to the entire U.S.-India Business Council for all that you do to connect our businesses, to try to foster more innovation, to expand opportunities in both of our countries.\nSo we are here almost literally on the eve of what we believe will be a historic state visit by Prime Minister Modi \u2013 one that will further solidify what President Biden has called the \u201cdefining relationship\u201d of the 21st century.\nNow, this is not something that the President came to yesterday.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had the immense privilege and pleasure of working for the President for more than 20 years, going back to his time as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u00a0 And from that time, I know the premium he\u2019s attached to the relationship between our countries and the vision that he\u2019s had for the centrality, the importance, of that relationship.\nThe road that we\u2019ve traveled over the last 25 years has been quite extraordinary, and I think it\u2019s a testament to the importance that we attach to the relationship that it\u2019s a road that has gone through multiple administrations, Democrat and Republican.\u00a0 We continue to move further down the road of strengthening the partnership between our countries.\nWe saw that in the final years of the Clinton administration, through the Bush administration, the Obama administration, the Trump administration, and now the Biden administration.\u00a0 Simply put, we see this defining relationship as a unique connection between the world\u2019s oldest and largest democracies, with a special obligation now to demonstrate that our governments can deliver for and empower all of our citizens.\nWe see all of this in the deep bonds between our people who participate in exchange programs, stream shows like Padma Lakshmi\u2019s Top Chef \u2013 I know there are a few folks in the audience who do that \u2013 but maybe most important here in the United States an Indian American diaspora over 4 million strong and growing stronger every day.\nWe see the importance of the partnership in a shared commitment to address regional and global challenges \u2013 promoting health security, working with our Quad partners to build a free, open, secure, prosperous Indo-Pacific where people, where goods, where ideas can travel freely and rules are applied fairly.\u00a0 I have witnessed India\u2019s constructive leadership on these issues up close these last two and a half years, and I see it in their ambitious agenda at this year\u2019s G20; in our new I2U2 group with India, with Israel, with the UAE, the United States; and in probably more than a dozen meetings that I\u2019ve had with my counterpart, my colleague, my friend, Foreign Minister Jaishankar.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had the opportunity now to make several trips to India in this job, including one in March where I actually took an auto-rickshaw ride that probably gave my security detail a little bit of concern.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But we made it through.\nBut the reason this evening is so important is our conviction that at the heart of the strategic relationship between our countries are economic ties.\u00a0 And under the leadership of President Biden and Prime Minister Modi and private sector leaders in this room tonight and beyond, it is growing stronger by the day.\nLast year, as you all know, trade between our nations reached a record $191 billion, making the United States the largest trading partner for India.\u00a0 American companies have now invested at least $54 billion in India, from manufacturing to telecommunications.\u00a0 In the United States, Indian companies have invested over $40 billion in IT, in pharmaceuticals, and more, supporting 425,000 jobs from California to Georgia.\u00a0 Just this February, Air India announced the historic purchase of more than 200 Boeing aircraft, which will support an estimated 1 million-plus jobs across 44 of the United States.\nBoth the U.S. and India are making transformative investments in our own countries to build our own strength \u2013 President Biden\u2019s $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, followed after that by the CHIPS Act, and as well the Inflation Reduction Act; Prime Minister Modi\u2019s 100 trillion rupee infrastructure plan.\u00a0 All of this will make our economies more productive and more attractive for investors.\u00a0 And India has joined three pillars of our new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework \u2013 committing to build more resilient supply chains, to seize clean energy opportunities, and to combat corruption and other challenges that undermine the efforts of our governments.\nTogether, we\u2019re helping to shape the innovations of the future, but not just the innovations themselves, also \u2013 and this is so critical \u2013 the norms, the standards, and rules that govern them, from artificial intelligence to quantum computing.\u00a0 In January, this council co-hosted a roundtable where our two governments inaugurated a new initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies.\u00a0 We\u2019re elevating and expanding the strategic technology partnership between governments, but also between businesses, between academic institutions in both our countries \u2013 because we believe how technology is designed, how it is used should be informed by democratic values and respect for human rights.\nCentral to all of this cooperation is diversifying and deepening our supply chains with trusted countries, while also reducing strategic dependencies.\u00a0 My friend and colleague Secretary of Commerce Raimondo and her counterpart Minister Goyal recently established a partnership to make our semiconductor supply chains more resilient.\u00a0 In Tamil Nadu, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation \u2013 and you\u2019ll hear from Scott in a little while \u2013 provided $500 million to help a leading American company build a solar manufacturing facility.\u00a0 This project will power roughly 30 million lightbulbs in homes, in schools, in businesses across India; it will create over a thousand jobs for Indians and Americans; and maybe most significantly, it will shift a key component of our clean energy supply chains to a close partner.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we mean when we say we are building more resilient, more diversified supply chains.\nFinally, we are investing in our people.\u00a0 The U.S. and India\u2019s education systems have produced the leaders of some of our most iconic companies \u2013 from Google to InfoSys to \u2013 not to mention former Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, who is now of course the new president of the World Bank and onetime president of the USIBC.\u00a0 Indian Americans have created a third \u2013 a third \u2013 of all immigrant-founded startups in the United States.\u00a0 Think about that for a minute.\u00a0 That is extraordinarily powerful.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd maybe most significant for the future \u2013 for the future of ties between our countries \u2013 we have more than 200,000 Indians studying in American universities, making India the second-largest source of international students in the United States, and we want to continue encouraging that remarkable dynamism.\u00a0 This is how you build the bridges of the future.\nAt Howard University last year, when Foreign Minister Jaishankar was visiting, the two of us went there together and we announced an Education and Skills Development Working Group to try to address skills gaps, to promote vocational training, to spur entrepreneurship in our countries.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s investing and inventing new technologies, whether it\u2019s combating the climate crisis, whether it\u2019s helping to build more inclusive economies, I have tremendous confidence that the rising generation of Indians, the rising generation of Americans will take the relationship between us to new heights.\u00a0 And in doing that they will not only benefit our countries, they will benefit the entire world.\nNow, we know that India and the United States are big, complicated countries.\u00a0 We certainly have work to do to advance transparency, to promote market access, to strengthen our democracies, to unleash the full potential of our people.\nBut the trajectory of this partnership is unmistakable, and it is filled with promise.\u00a0 It\u2019s being written in places like North Carolina, where our growing engagement is benefiting both our countries.\u00a0 The Tar Heel State has become a hub for Indian investment, with tech companies like HCL creating 2,400 jobs, training American high schoolers for IT careers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Charlotte-based Honeywell is employing 13,000 people from Kolkata to Mumbai, making safer airplanes, making energy-efficient buildings.\u00a0 Duke University has established a presence in Bangalore, strengthening academic and research exchanges between our people.\u00a0 Commenting on this explosion of U.S.-India commercial activity, one North Carolina entrepreneur from Gujarat observed, and I quote, \u201cThis could not have happened 15 years ago.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s an important comment, because it puts a fine point on the fact that the evolution in this relationship just over the past couple of decades has been extraordinary.\u00a0 And in the day-in/day-out, it\u2019s easy sometimes to lose sight of that.\u00a0 It\u2019s also why a moment like this evening and a moment like next week is so important.\u00a0 It\u2019s an opportunity to put where we are, where we\u2019ve come from, and where we\u2019re going in perspective.\u00a0 And so I couldn\u2019t be more pleased to actually kick off tonight the upcoming state visit with all of you.\u00a0 This is really what our growing relationship is all about, and so much of it goes to the tremendous work that all of you are facilitating.\nI talked about that we couldn\u2019t imagine this 15 years ago.\u00a0 What I\u2019m now trying to imagine and what I know you\u2019re all working on \u2013 not only imagining but bringing to life \u2013 is what this is going to look like 15 years from now or 50 years from now, and all the benefits that it will bring to Indians and Americans alike.\nThank you for all you\u2019re doing to make this real, to make this vibrant, to make this exciting for both of our countries.\u00a0 You\u2019re at the heart of one of the most extraordinary relationships in the world.\u00a0 I can\u2019t thank you enough for all the work that you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

#AfghanEvac Coalition\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "National Museum of American Diplomacy", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "June 12, 2023", "content": "\n\nMS TEKACH:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon and thank you for joining us here today at the National Museum of American Diplomacy to recognize the extraordinary efforts of hundreds of dedicated volunteers elemental to the unique and unprecedented collaboration and partnership between the United States Department of State and the #AfghanEvac Coalition.\nMy name is Mara Tekach.\u00a0 I am the coordinator for Afghan relocation efforts at \u2013 in the department\u2019s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs.\u00a0 Since October 2022, I have had the great privilege of managing State\u2019s operations to relocate eligible Afghans to the United States and the honor to work alongside all of you in this incredible effort toward the shared goal of keeping the promise we made to Afghan allies.\u00a0 What makes this effort so unique?\u00a0 It is the heartfelt support of volunteers like you and the hard work that is embodied in the #AfghanEvac Coalition.\u00a0 Our partnership is the cornerstone of our mutual success.\nI would like to extend our deep thanks to Secretary Blinken for how highly he places the priority of keeping our promises to our Afghan allies.\u00a0 Thank you to our other honored guests for taking the time to join us for this ceremony to recognize this vital partnership and its vital work: Under Secretary John Bass, Ambassador Timmy Davis, Assistant Secretary Rena Bitter, Assistant Secretary Don Lu, NSC Chief of Staff Curtis Ried, and Congressman Zach Nunn.\u00a0 You embody the incredible interdepartmental and interagency collaboration that makes this undertaking succeed.\nCARE staff and #AfghanEvac engage in a disciplined partnership.\u00a0 We meet biweekly like clockwork to exchange critical information, discuss operations, provide feedback, and find solutions to the goal of relocating and resettling Afghans.\u00a0 Your insights and ideas, often delivered to us by the kinetic Shawn VanDiver \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and thoughtful March Bishop give us, your government counterparts, constructive material with which to target actions more precisely and to move more nimbly.\u00a0 And lest we get too caught up in procedure and process, Shawn, we know your friendly but spirited reproach is not far away, keeping us on our toes.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nWe at CARE welcome the feedback that helps us monitor progress and encourages us to move faster and smarter.\u00a0 Our partnership with the #AfghanEvac Coalition gives us a single conduit through which to collaborate with more than 200 organizations.\u00a0 This rare efficiency allows CARE to maximize our focus on operations.\u00a0 As CARE\u2019s operations scale up, go wide, and drill down, as we work with #AfghanEvac to relocate more Afghans faster, we share each success together with dedicated public-facing comrades in arms.\nThanks to you, we are trimming the bureaucracy.\u00a0 A few examples: the elimination of the DS-157 as a step in the SIV application has streamlined that process; better systems have been put in place for assisting individuals through our platforms in less time, a change which will also benefit other refugee populations around the world; and a pathway for the reunification of separated families, with the creation of the famous DS-4317.\n#AfghanEvac had a hand in all of those successes and so many more, and lives have been changed as a result.\u00a0 We are grateful for your continued partnership.\u00a0 CARE is so proud not just to be working to relocate Afghans, but also to be working with so many talented Afghans whose presence on our team makes us stronger \u2013 like Yalda Rezayee, whose hard work and organization over the last weeks helped make this very event possible; and Farid Afghanzai, whose thoughtful analysis enables us to have a more thorough understanding of crucial issues on the ground.\u00a0 There are many other Afghans who have joined CARE and help keep us on track and moving forward.\u00a0 Thank you all, and thank you as well to the entire CARE team, who bring their diligence, talent, and heart every day to assist our Afghan allies.\nWinston Churchill said that where there is resolute purpose, great strides are made.\u00a0 I am so glad all of you could be here, both present and watching at home, on a day we honor our shared solidarity, pride, and resolute purpose.\u00a0 Together we have made great strides and are poised for even more.\nNow I\u2019d like to invite the kinetic Shawn VanDiver \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 to say a few words. \u00a0(Applause.)\nMR VANDIVER:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKinetic\u201d is quite a descriptor.\u00a0 Thank you, Mara.\u00a0 It has been an incredible honor to work with you and the entire team at CARE.\u00a0 Under your leadership, we have accomplished so much more than I think people would have said was even possible; some would have said it\u2019s impossible.\u00a0 Thank you also to my friends and colleagues from #AfghanEvac and all of our coalition members who traveled here today from all over the country to celebrate this work that we\u2019ve been doing together for so long.\u00a0 Thank you to everyone within government who took the time to be here and recognize the importance of this work and this collaboration.\nEveryone here looks pretty great considering we\u2019ve been on Kabul time for two years, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Look, the State Department impacts lives all over the world every day, changing the course of history with its work.\u00a0 And we\u2019re standing in a place where many of those amazing achievements are featured and honored through museum displays.\u00a0 One day, I believe that this work that we\u2019re doing together will be remembered for time immemorial in rooms just like this, but not yet.\u00a0 There is still so much more to be done, and I am grateful to be here today to reaffirm that we will continue to do this vital work together.\n#AfghanEvac was born when my buddy Lucky texted me from a mountaintop in Urgun, eight hours outside of Kabul.\u00a0 He told me that he was out of ammunition and believed he wasn\u2019t going to make it.\u00a0 He asked me to fulfill his final request and to get his wife and children out of Afghanistan and back to San Diego.\u00a0 I promised him that I would try, just as so many volunteers in this room and in this space were making similar promises at that same time.\u00a0 This effort continues nearly two years later because an unprecedented, diverse cross section of America stood up to help thousands of others.\nWe\u2019ve got everyone from veterans and frontline civilians to a children\u2019s book author, corporate executives, a member of Congress, and former senior U.S. government officials among our ranks.\u00a0 This is a shared experience of folks putting their lives on hold and pushing themselves to the limit for people half a world away.\u00a0 This is the story of America, of immigration and diversity and people of different beliefs and backgrounds coming together with a common purpose and bridging divides, closing the gaps that exist between citizens and their government, between the U.S. and Afghanistan, closing the gap between an Afghan family escaping persecution and that family finding a safe home here in the U.S. or anywhere else in the world.\nLike Lucky, who against all odds made it out of Kabul \u2013 and with just a little bit of help he and his family made it out.\u00a0 He\u2019s here with us today, and he exemplifies the story of the Afghan allies that we\u2019re working so hard to assist.\u00a0 Lucky lives in Texas now and is the owner of Afghan markets there and in Oklahoma.\u00a0 He has applied for U.S. citizenship, and when he takes the oath to become a citizen, our country will be stronger and better for it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd so this is also the story of creating new Americans, of creating generational change.\u00a0 Lucky may have been the inspiration for #AfghanEvac, but this effort has continued because of the determination of the hundreds and likely thousands of everyday Americans \u2013 like all of you\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in and out of government and civil society who believe in the promise of America.\u00a0 This partnership that we are recognizing today is an amazing feat of civic engagement.\u00a0 It is the very definition of democracy.\nAnd that idea, the idea of collaborating with the private sector on this, began in a small room right here in this building back in September 2021 with JP Feldmayer and now-Ambassador Timmy Davis, enabled by State Department Chief of Staff Suzy George and Under Secretary John Bass.\u00a0 They recognized government could not take on this daunting challenge alone.\u00a0 And their expeditionary approach allowed us to chart a new path forward.\u00a0 People from all walks of life have joined together with our State Department to live our values, and the result has shaped the course of world events.\nI want to recognize our #AfghanEvac team who represent all 50 states and several countries working together to help honor our allies.\u00a0 There are folks who break down barriers.\u00a0 We have people who started as #AfghanEvac volunteers and now work at State.\u00a0 March Bishop, Chuck Rush, and more recently Jessica Bradley Rushing \u2014 like many of you, their lives can be broken down into two distinct eras: before and after the fall of Kabul.\u00a0 They came into the bureaucracy of federal government and blazed trails, finding new and creative ways to solve longstanding problems.\u00a0 And look, I know that many in this room would agree with me when I say that they are nothing short of American heroes.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMany of the people in this room have been with #AfghanEvac since day one, like Joe Saboe from Team America, whose team led intel briefs back in August of 2021; and Maggie Feldman-Piltch from Operation Eagle, who I met because a member of Congress sent me a text after the airport fell with her phone number, and that\u2019s it.\u00a0 I dropped into yet another chat, bringing the number to about 15 separate, disconnected groups that I was involved in, like so many of you, all working in silos on the same issue, which inspired us to establish the coordination calls and led to the coalition that we have today.\nWe have folks in our team that represent the most vulnerable among us with their expertise and their ideas as well as their own identities.\u00a0 People from the Hazara community like Mahnaz Akbari who commanded the first female tactical platoon with Afghan Special Forces and has been working to help relocate her sisters-in-arms still in Afghanistan all while getting support for those she helped get here to the U.S.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nOur team also includes other Afghan women like Naheed Farid, who served as a member of parliament from Herat and has been fighting tooth and nail for Afghan women since she arrived.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe have people who keep us as a coalition focused on the challenges at hand, like Angela and Jordan, who are all over P-1 and P-2 issues.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We have folks that help the helpers like Kate Kay, who created our Resilience Duty Officer Program.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we have a lot of noisy people.\u00a0 I mean not me, but definitely others.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But we have so many quiet operators getting things done behind the scenes, like Judy and Leannne.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThis is a team of doers.\u00a0 Very few coalition members get paid for this.\u00a0 Everyone has sacrificed for this and all of our lives have been changed by this.\u00a0 There are so many who couldn\u2019t be with here with us today and are just as worthy of recognition as anyone else here.\u00a0 There are space constraints.\u00a0 Some couldn\u2019t make it due to day jobs, finances, or the circumstances of life.\nWe\u2019ve also \u2013 we\u2019ve lost allies with whom we\u2019ve worked during this effort as well as some of our volunteers.\u00a0 Those losses have impacted each of us.\u00a0 And I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the great sacrifice that our loved ones have made.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve thrown ourselves into this work, our friends and families have given up precious time with us, and they certainly deserve our gratitude.\nI am blown away by the tenacity, the determination, and the patriotism of folks here, and not just our volunteers.\u00a0 Our government partners here at State and across the interagency, the allies that we are trying to help, and certainly the incredible coalition of folks here in this room. \u00a0This is a group made to build bridges and break down walls.\nI want to recognize the partnership that we\u2019re renewing today, which is a testament to this department and its leadership.\u00a0 To Secretary Blinken and Under Secretary Bass, to your willingness to do things differently, to your willingness to bridge the gap between the government and the people \u2013 it has been a whole-of-government collaboration, and we would never have seen such success without the efforts of folks like Curtis Ried and Jacqui Pilch and so many others on the NSC team, as well as Adam, Emily, Jason, Becky, and Lisa, and so many others from across the various departments and agencies that we work with.\nThe progress that we have made together is real.\u00a0 We have seen extraordinary successes, and that feeling we get every time we get a get a text or a call from someone we\u2019ve worked with getting on a flight is unmatched.\nUSRAP case processing has been revolutionized at CAS, going from 18 months or more down to 30 or 60 days.\u00a0 This has since expanded to 12 locations around the world.\u00a0 The SIV process has been streamlined, and we\u2019re working on more changes to further decrease those processing times.\u00a0 We are collaborating across the interagency to align communications, increase the frequency of messaging, and ensure we are reducing uncertainty at every opportunity.\nThere is no doubt that this work is historic.\u00a0 But before we call it history, we have to finish the job.\u00a0 So here\u2019s my message to the decision makers in the room:\u00a0 There remain places in the world, including here in the U.S., where Afghans are languishing awaiting permanence.\u00a0 Throughput and capacity for relocations continue to improve, but we have not yet hit our goals. We must move faster and process more people.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe must further streamline the SIV process, and the efficiencies in USRAP case processing must be implemented globally.\u00a0 Afghans in the refugee track need more attention, and at-risk populations must be prioritized.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWell, but sir, we\u2019ve got a laundry list.\u00a0 It\u2019s my only opportunity.\nWe must continue to work with allies and partner nations to find solutions to these issues in a way that emphasizes the dignity and humanity of those in need.\u00a0 Resettlement agencies need additional resources.\u00a0 Time and again, our colleagues are bridging the gap between what resettlement agencies can provide and what our new neighbors actually need for a warm welcome.\nAnd while there will always be a need for civil society to bridge the gap between government and people, for our democracy to deliver we need government to help us shrink the gap.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here today.\u00a0 We are demonstrating the American promise in action and renewing our commitment to the work ahead.\u00a0 We are building bridges and solidifying this partnership, and we are saying to our Afghan friends you are not forgotten, we are here and we are working together today and into the future to bridge the gaps, close the divides, and keep the promise.\nThe war in Afghanistan began in the wake of 9/11, a tragedy which unified the nation.\u00a0 And this work started just eight months after January 6th, when the bitter divides present in our country were more prevalent than ever and threatened our democracy.\u00a0 This team \u2013 both volunteers and government partners alike \u2013 and the work that we continue to accomplish together represents the kind of incredible outcomes that we can achieve when we shed our differences and unify toward a common goal.\nThank you for having us all here, thank you for recognizing these incredible volunteers, and thank you for renewing this partnership.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI think you\u2019re up.\nMS TEKACH:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Shawn.\u00a0 Now, I would like to invite to the stage a leader who has put the strength of the entire State Department behind this humanitarian effort, Secretary Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, thank you, everyone, and good afternoon.\u00a0 First, it seems apparent that there\u2019s been a name change today, and Shawn\u2019s new first name is \u201cKinetic.\u201d (Laughter). We\u2019ll try to formalize that with the appropriate authorities in the days ahead.\u00a0 But Mara, first of all, thank you for kicking us off.\u00a0 Thank you for sharing so much of the remarkable work that\u2019s been done, but especially thank you for helping to lead this effort, to fulfill the commitment that President Biden and I have made to Afghans who stood with us over so many years.\nShawn \u201cKinetic,\u201d \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 thank you for bringing us together today, but especially for your extraordinary leadership of the #AfghanEvac Coalition.\u00a0 Now, virtually every one of us in this room in some fashion or another has been on the receiving end of Shawn\u2019s tenacious advocacy.\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s another possible first name: Tenacious.\u00a0 But I can say this:\u00a0 Our Afghan partners are deeply, deeply fortunate to have you in their corner, and we\u2019re grateful to have Shawn as a partner.\nTo everyone else who is here \u2013 Members of Congress, including Representative Nunn \u2013 leaders from across this department who\u2019ve been playing key roles in this relocation effort, including our Ambassador to Qatar Timmy Davis (applause), to the entire CARE team, to our Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena Bitter, who has done remarkable work, to John Bass, who has his heart and soul in this effort, and so many other colleagues \u2013 and especially, especially to our #AfghanEvac Coalition volunteers joining us from around the country \u2013 some in this room today, some virtually.\nNow, as you heard from Shawn, it\u2019s actually very fitting that we\u2019re meeting in this particular place, the National Museum of American Diplomacy.\u00a0 It honors the contributions of generations of diplomats and aid workers, locally employed staff, civil society partners throughout our history, including in Afghanistan.\u00a0 There\u2019s actually a Great Seal emblem from the U.S. Consulate in Herat \u2013 a plaque remembering Anne Smedinghoff, an extraordinary Foreign Service officer who gave her life while delivering books to a school in Zabul Province \u2013 and a collection of the very books that she and her colleagues were delivering on that day.\nThese items are a reminder not only of the contributions of our diplomats, but also \u2013 also of the courage and sacrifice of our servicemembers over two decades in Afghanistan.\u00a0 Their professionalism was on extraordinary display during the evacuation, when they put their lives on the line to help bring more than 120,000 people to safety \u2013 American citizens, Afghan partners, citizens of partner countries.\u00a0 Thirteen American heroes gave their lives in that operation.\u00a0 We honor them and all who served in Afghanistan for their truly extraordinary service.\nWhen President Biden brought an end to America\u2019s longest conflict, he made a commitment that the United States would continue to relocate and resettle our Afghan partners.\u00a0 We are determined \u2013 I am determined \u2013 to fulfill that pledge, just as this group is.\u00a0 And together that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 What began as a 6:30 a.m. call between seven groups in August of 2021 has now evolved into a coalition of more than 200 groups \u2013 thousands of volunteers.\nMany of you are veterans.\u00a0 Catalina Gasper was deployed to Afghanistan from 2018 to 2019.\u00a0 She worked closely with Shams, a facility manager on her compound.\u00a0 And after Kabul fell, Catalina helped evacuate Shams and other SIV applicants.\u00a0 Shams, his wife, his two young children are now here with us in Virginia.\u00a0 He and Catalina still get together regularly to share a meal.\nOthers in this coalition are Afghans drawn to serve their fellow Afghans.\u00a0 Samad served in Embassy Kabul from 2012 to 2014, where he helped coordinate development programs for USAID.\u00a0 He came to Arlington, Virginia as an SIV in 2014.\u00a0 In August 2021, he volunteered his Dari and Pashto skills to help guide our Afghan partners to rendezvous sites in Kabul.\u00a0 Now, as a volunteer at the #AfghanEvac Coalition, he helps newly arrived Afghans by sharing his own experience and answering their questions about resettling in the United States.\nAnd many in the coalition are Americans who had never even set foot in Afghanistan\u00a0\u2013 teachers, humanitarian workers, firefighters, other citizens, who wanted to help their fellow human beings in a time of need.\u00a0 Danielle Cosgrove, a former protection officer for the UN Refugee Agency, remotely helped eligible Afghans safely pass through the gates at Hamid Karzai International Airport and get onto planes that were heading to safety.\nFor Catalina, for Samad, for Danielle, who are here with us today \u2013 for so many of you in this room \u2013 this wasn\u2019t a question of whether you would help, but how.\u00a0 You\u2019ve risen to the challenge with incredible integrity and persistence at every step along the way.\nAnd quite honestly, it\u2019s your expertise, it\u2019s your ideas, it\u2019s your local networks that have made all the difference, that have been invaluable in this effort \u2013 and we\u2019ve relied on this partnership for every step of the process.\u00a0 And we heard a little bit about what has been such an effective public-private partnership in this instance, maybe the most effective that I\u2019ve seen, and a big part of that is our partners pushing us, prodding us, trying to not only break down institutional barriers, but to just break down walls in our own thinking to make sure that we were testing every idea, every option to make this move better, move faster, move forward more effectively.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nOur diplomats worked around the clock with you to coordinate the initial evacuation, and our CARE team \u2013 strengthened by the #AfghanEvac Coalition members who chose to contribute their talents to the State Department full-time \u2013 Chuck, March, Jessica \u2013 has continued to partner with you to relocate and resettle our partners in the United States.\nAnd what this comes down to is to the extent that we\u2019ve been effective \u2013 and I believe, as Shawn does, that we have \u2013 it\u2019s because we worked together in common cause, in common enterprise, with community of purpose and community of action.\u00a0 And that really is a model for what public-private partnerships can be.\nSo thanks to the leadership that we\u2019ve seen, thanks to our state and local partners, thanks to the generosity of our fellow citizens, we\u2019ve relocated more than 24,000 Afghans to the United States and third countries since September 2021.\u00a0 Overall \u2013 (applause) \u2013 overall, we have relocated more than 97,000 Afghans to the United States \u2013 Afghans who are going to school, who are starting new jobs, who are settling into their communities.\u00a0 And as Shawn so rightly put it, the next generation of Americans, of our renewal, of our country, of our future \u2013 most of us in this room are Americans by accident of birth; they are Americans by choice and they will be our future as well.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nFinally, because this is so important:\u00a0 For all the success that we\u2019ve had, as you\u2019ve heard both of my colleagues say, this job is not yet done.\u00a0 The Memorandum of Understanding that we will shortly sign will allow us to keep sharing information with one another, to coordinate our outreach to additional civil society partners, to guide our ongoing efforts to find more, and better, ways to serve our Afghan partners \u2013 both those already here, and those yet to come \u2013 and keep pace with their evolving needs.\nI think what inspires all of us is we talked about some of the numbers just a minute ago.\u00a0 They\u2019re impressive.\u00a0 But we know that behind each and every one of those numbers is a real person, a real life, a real story.\u00a0 A mother, a father, a sister, a brother.\u00a0 A son, a daughter.\u00a0 And because of what you\u2019ve done, because of what you\u2019re doing, those stories will continue.\u00a0 They won\u2019t be interrupted.\u00a0 And I hope at the very least that each and every one of you who\u2019s been involved will take that with you.\u00a0 Of all the things that one has the opportunity to do in life, few things are more meaningful, more powerful, than the opportunity that we have to come to the assistance of our fellow human beings and to make a real difference in making sure that their stories continue, that their contributions continue.\u00a0 That\u2019s what you\u2019ve done.\u00a0 That\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re determined to keep doing until we finish the job.\nShawn, you\u2019ve described the #AfghanEvac Coalition as, and I quote, \u201cthe most American thing [that] I\u2019ve been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 And looking out at all of you, I know exactly what you mean.\u00a0 You all show what America is when we\u2019re at our best: a compassionate country, full of big-hearted people from different backgrounds, different beliefs \u2013 but all ready to drop everything and work together, work as one team, to help other people.\u00a0 A country that honors its tradition of providing refuge to those who need it.\nAs Secretary of State, but mostly as a fellow American: thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your service.\nMara, over to you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS TEKACH:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Now we have the privilege of presenting six letters of thanks to individual volunteers whose dedication and ongoing efforts have made such a difference for so many.\u00a0 But to all the #AfghanEvac volunteers here and to those who couldn\u2019t join us here today, we say thank you.\u00a0 While a few volunteers are receiving their letters in person today, additional letters will be sent to #AfghanEvac volunteers following this ceremony.\u00a0 We thank you for your hard work, your compassion, and your tenacity.\nWhen I call your name, please come up to the stage so Secretary Blinken can present you with your letter.\nAbdul Manan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nCatalina Gasper.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMaggie Feldman-Piltch.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSamad

Let me begin by extending my condolences for the passing of former Prime Minister Berlusconi.\u00a0 Mr. Minister, we\u2019re thinking of you, we\u2019re thinking of the Italian people at this time.\nI am so glad to be able to welcome my friend Antonio to the State Department for the first time as foreign minister.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen each other repeatedly around the world, including just a couple of weeks ago in Oslo for the NATO ministerial, and today we picked up where we left off in an ongoing conversation, building on the close alliance that we share and the longstanding ties between our nations.\nWe, of course, discussed Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 We admire Prime Minister Meloni\u2019s strong, principled leadership.\u00a0 Earlier this year in Irpin, the prime minister signed a Ukrainian flag with the words \u201cat your side,\u201d and that\u2019s a very powerful description of the solidarity that all of us are showing for Ukraine.\nItaly has stepped up in powerful ways, not only with military assistance, but supplying generators, electrical equipment to keep Ukraine\u2019s power grid up in the face of Russian attacks on that grid; millions of dollars \u2013 tens of millions of dollars in humanitarian assistance from medicine to blankets.\u00a0 And, of course, Italy has welcomed more than 170,000 Ukrainian refugees into what is already the largest Ukrainian community in Western Europe.\u00a0 Our two countries will continue to support efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.\nOur Italian allies are, of course, vital to the stability to NATO\u2019s southern flank, and I thanked the minister for Italy\u2019s leadership in supporting peace and security in North Africa.\u00a0 In Tunisia, Italy has played an invaluable role in urging the Tunisian Government to implement durable solutions to the country\u2019s political and economic challenges.\u00a0 In Libya, we\u2019ve worked very closely together to support the UN-led process to find a path toward free and fair elections.\u00a0 Italy is making major investments in Libya\u2019s oil and gas industry that will deliver economic benefits to both shores of the Mediterranean.\nItaly\u2019s actions have also embodied the growing strategic convergence across the Atlantic with the European Union, within NATO, and among the G7.\u00a0 Italy is a source of stability not only in the Mediterranean but also in Sub-Saharan Africa, and we greatly value Italy\u2019s growing strategic partnership with countries like Japan and India as we work to promote a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific.\nAs Italy prepares to assume the presidency of the G7 next year, we look forward to Italy\u2019s continued leadership on issues of global consequence where we\u2019ve been spending a lot of our time together \u2013 tackling the climate crisis, combating terrorism, safeguarding democracy, building food security, building global health security.\u00a0 All of these issues are front and center in our common agenda.\nWhat makes our close partnership so productive across these many issues are, of course, the remarkable, enduring bonds between our people: ties of shared history, shared values; some 18 million Americans who claim Italian ancestry, including our First Lady Jill Biden \u2013 all of which helps explain why American visitors are returning to Italy in record numbers after the pandemic.\nSo on behalf of the United States, let me just say to our good friends, our close partners, our close allies, thank you.\u00a0 We are so grateful for the work that we\u2019re doing together around the world.\u00a0 In many ways, it\u2019s more meaningful than ever.\u00a0 The challenges are tremendous, the opportunities are real, and because of that partnership \u2013 notably the partnership between our countries is more important than it\u2019s ever been.\nThank you, my friend, and over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Tony.\u00a0 Allow me to speak in my mother tongue, in Italian.\u00a0 (Via interpreter) First of all, I\u2019d like to thank Antony Blinken for the flexibility he showed today at a time that is very challenging for me, for Italy.\u00a0 He accepted to modify our program and to move up this meeting so that I could be allowed to go back to Italy.\u00a0 I am deeply grateful for that.\u00a0 I see this as one more gesture of friendship towards Italy, and I also want to thank him for the condolences that he expressed for our loss of Silvio Berlusconi.\u00a0 And being here today for me is a way to honor his memory because he considered the United States to be Italy\u2019s best friend and he never missed an opportunity to thank all of the young American soldiers who have fallen to defend freedom and democracy in Italy and in Europe.\u00a0 And when before Congress, he said, \u201cWhen I look at the flag of the United States, I don\u2019t see just the flag of a country who\u2019s a friend, but I see a message of democracy and freedom all over the world.\u201d\nThat\u2019s \u2013 these are in the foundations upon which the friendship between Italy and the U.S. are based.\u00a0 I\u2019m here to restate today our strategic solidarity, which is not connected just to what is happening at the time.\u00a0 This is a longstanding relationship based on the many Italians that have come to America and who are today the children and grandchildren of other Italians.\u00a0 This bond is very strong and very solid.\u00a0 It is political, it is strategic, and it is based on a joint vision about freedom and democracy.\nOver the course of our meeting, we agreed on all of the big issues, starting from the most dramatic ones, such as the war in the Ukraine.\u00a0 We all want peace but peace must be a just peace.\u00a0 It must be a peace that restates international rule of law and allows freedom to a people that were the victim of invasion.\u00a0 We agreed on the kind of work that can be performed in the Balkans, where we are part of the Quint format, and we can restore these and we can favor the entrance of countries that are candidates to become part of the European Union.\u00a0 We want the Ukraine to be a future member of the European Union.\nWe agreed on the action to be implemented to support peace and stability in the area of the Mediterranean, including Tunisia, which for us in Italy is a priority.\u00a0 I have explained to my friend Antony what the Italian Government is doing to achieve stability.\u00a0 We found agreement on the actions to be taken in the Middle East and North Africa, in the Indo-Pacific area.\u00a0 Italy is in favor of maintaining the status quo in that region.\u00a0 I also stated once again to Antony that Italy, with this government, intends to keep its positions.\u00a0 It will be a stable country.\u00a0 It will be a loyal country, serious, credible, and reliable.\nAnd soon there will be the visit of the Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, who will meet President Biden in order to strengthen even more the relationship between Italy and the United States, which are two countries that are brothers for us.\u00a0 This transatlantic relationship, based on a common vision of NATO and trade exchanges that are very solid, this will allow us to solve any issue that might happen, and we will do so as friends.\u00a0 And under an economic point of view, we are in total agreement.\u00a0 We are two industrialized countries.\u00a0 We know what the issues with raw materials are.\u00a0 And in Africa we can work in this direction as well together in order to make sure that the market, especially for raw materials, is not dominated by others.\nTherefore, there is perfect agreement.\u00a0 There is an action towards common purposes.\u00a0 And I am very satisfied of my meeting with the Secretary of State of the United States.\u00a0 I want to thank him for the showing of affection that he had towards me and towards the Berlusconi family and towards Italy.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Four questions.\u00a0 The first one goes to Shannon Crawford with ABC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 As Ukraine begins its counteroffensive, its military reports that it\u2019s up against a massive uptick of drones on the battlefield, and more and more reports suggest that some of these drones, or at least some of their key parts, are coming from China.\u00a0 Now, my question to you both is: Do you assess that China is ramping up its material support for Russia?\u00a0 And Mr. Secretary, will you bring this up when you are in Beijing, and also will you raise China\u2019s efforts to spy on the U.S. from Cuba while you\u2019re there?\nAnd second, Mr. Secretary, we saw another American arrested in Moscow over the weekend.\u00a0 Do you have any updates on those case \u2013 on that case, rather \u2013 that you can share?\u00a0 And more broadly, does this administration\u2019s willingness to engage in negotiations over detentions encourage these type of provocative arrests?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Let me \u2013 let me start with the second question first.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been seeking to learn more about the apparent detention of Travis Leake, and we are working to be not only in touch with him, to have consular access, but also with his family.\u00a0 My number one priority as Secretary of State is the safety and security of Americans abroad, and this is \u2013 this is no exception.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working to gather information to understand exactly what happened, and of course we will be very focused on this.\nLook, generally speaking, there is always a balance to be found in working to secure the release of Americans who are being arbitrarily detained, which we\u2019ve done very successfully over the last couple of years, bringing Americans home from many different places with, of course, concerns about whether any actions we take might further incentivize countries to engage in this practice.\u00a0 But that\u2019s why, even as we\u2019ve been doing this, we\u2019ve been imposing penalties, imposing sanctions, including under the Robert Levinson Act, to disincentivize countries from engaging in this practice.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re working more and more closely together with other countries that unfortunately are similarly situated to us and having been the victims of the arbitrary detention of their citizens to make it clear to countries that do this that there will be a price to be paid.\nBut it is a balance.\u00a0 I believe we can do both things at the same time.\u00a0 At the same time, the countries that engage in this practice ultimately are simply going to further isolate themselves as people from around the world will have to really think twice, think three times, about whether they want to travel to any of these countries when there\u2019s a risk that they will be arbitrarily detained and used as a pawn in some kind of political issue that that country may have with us or with many other countries around the world.\nAnd that ultimately is going to be very self-defeating for countries that have an interest in maintaining contacts, remaining \u2013 maintaining relations, having economic connectivity with the world.\u00a0 They will be isolating themselves.\u00a0 But we work on this virtually every single day and we work to make sure that we get the balance right.\nWith regard to drones in Ukraine that are being used by Russia, we\u2019ve been very focused on this, particularly the concern that drones coming from Iran are being used in Ukraine.\u00a0 We have seen that over many months, both to attack civilians, to attack civilian infrastructure.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been very focused on trying to disrupt those efforts and the provision of those drones.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been on this for some time.\nWe\u2019ve shared concerns in the past with counterparts in China about the possibility that the provision of weapons to Russia for Ukraine is something that they might be considering.\u00a0 To date, we\u2019ve not seen that line crossed.\u00a0 At the same time, we have concerns about private companies engaged in the provision of technologies, including dual-use technologies.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that\u2019s of much \u2013 an issue.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve brought up in the past, and I know we\u2019ll continue to bring up going forward if that remains a concern.\nWith regard to Cuba, when this administration took office in January 2021, we were briefed on a number of sensitive efforts by Beijing around the world to expand their overseas logistics, basing, collection infrastructure, to allow them to project and sustain military power at the greater distance.\u00a0 They were considering a number of sites around the world for that expansion, including intelligence collection facilities for intelligence collection in Cuba.\u00a0 In fact, based on the information we have, the PRC conducted an upgrade of its intelligence collection facilities in Cuba in 2019.\nIt was our assessment that despite awareness of the basing efforts and some attempts to address the challenge in the past administration, we weren\u2019t making enough progress on this issue and we needed a more direct approach.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what President Biden instructed his team to do to address the challenge.\u00a0 And within months of getting that instruction from the President, that\u2019s exactly what we did.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been executing on that approach quietly, carefully, but in our judgment, with results ever since.\u00a0 I can\u2019t get into every step that we\u2019ve taken, but the strategy begins with diplomacy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve engaged governments that are considering hosting PRC bases at high levels.\u00a0 We\u2019ve exchanged information with them.\u00a0 Our experts assess that our diplomatic efforts have slowed down this effort by the PRC.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very carefully monitoring and, as I said, taking steps to counter.\u00a0 We remain confident that we are able to meet all of our security commitments both at home and in the region.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0(Via interpreter) As far as China is concerned, I believe that a country that submitted a number of points to build peace cannot and should not provide any kind of support to a country such as Russia that violated international law.\u00a0 Therefore, I believe that China\u2019s commitment should be aimed not at strengthening Russia but, on the other hand, to favor peace.\u00a0 Therefore, I hope that it will go in that direction.\nRegarding Cuba, Cuba is a fundamental area, or country in a strategic area.\u00a0 This is an appeal that I launch to the Cuban regime, and that is to free many political prisoners.\u00a0 And in that case as well we must defend, first and foremost, human rights, especially also about Iran.\u00a0 Sending drones to the Russian Federation must be stopped.\u00a0 Those who want peace cannot contribute to support those who violated international law and invaded a free and democratic country.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Massimo Gaggi with Corriere della Sera.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you for having us.\u00a0 And to both of you, Tunisia is the top of an iceberg of a deep crisis in Africa.\u00a0 Given that a plan to stabilize this continent is essential for Europe and, frankly, for our democracies, do you see room for a pragmatic approach to avoid the default of Tunisia given that \u2013 the reservations of IMF, as far as I understand, are more based on market economy issues more than on human rights issues.\nAnd if I may, specifically to you, Mr. Secretary:\u00a0 Do you have any memories specifically on Silvio Berlusconi that was recently criticized for his position on Ukraine, but that I remember that long ago he was a bridge to keep Putin very close to NATO and also to allow Mr. Erdogan to be as integrated as possible in the European Union?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m\u00a0 happy to start, Antonio, if there\u2019s anything you want to add of course.\u00a0 On Tunisia, we very much share the concern that Italy has and that other partners have about the economic situation in Tunisia, as well as \u2013 as well as political challenges.\u00a0 And very much appreciate the work that\u2019s being done, including by the delegation led by Prime Minister Meloni and also the President of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen to visit and to see if there\u2019s a way forward.\nWe very much would welcome the Tunisian Government presenting a revised reform plan to the IMF and for the IMF to be able to act on the plan presented.\u00a0 But these are sovereign decisions.\u00a0 This is a sovereign decision for Tunisia; it\u2019s not a decision for us or anyone else to make.\u00a0 But it\u2019s clear that Tunisia needs additional assistance if it is going to avoid falling off the proverbial economic cliff.\u00a0 And what the EU and Italy have done, I think, is an important step, but something more comprehensive \u2013 that in our judgment the IMF can best provide \u2013 would be important to actually helping Tunisia get on a sustainable and positive path.\u00a0 But the decisions that are involved really are decisions for Tunisia to make, but we would very much support finding some way forward because it\u2019s important for Tunisia, but it\u2019s also, I think, important for the region.\u00a0 It\u2019s important \u2013 it\u2019s important for Europe, and we have a stake as well in Tunisia\u2019s success.\nAfter the Arab Spring, Tunisia was one of the most important bright spots in its trajectory \u2013 something that I had the opportunity to be involved in when I was last in government.\u00a0 And so we want to see Tunisia succeed, and we want to find ways to provide the support necessary for its success.\u00a0 But fundamentally, the government in Tunisia has to make decisions about how it wants to proceed, and we would hope that there\u2019s a practical way forward that we can find with, as necessary, appropriate flexibility.\u00a0 And of course we\u2019re in very close contact, coordination with the Government of Italy as well as with other partners in Europe on this.\u00a0 We have the same objective.\nAnd then finally, with regard to Prime Minister Berlusconi, I must say I never had the opportunity to meet him or to work with him.\u00a0 He was obviously a tremendously significant figure in the life of Italy \u2013 in the political life, in the public life of the country.\u00a0 Many American administrations worked with him over the years.\u00a0 And for me, not having known him, I simply want to extend my condolences to his family, because let\u2019s not \u2013 never forget in these situations, the people who are affected first and foremost is the family \u2013 but also to the Italian people for their loss.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 On Tunisia, I informed the secretary-general on a trip of Prime Minister Meloni to Tunisia we want to achieve good solutions.\u00a0 We want to pave the way for an agreement.\u00a0 Of course, for us, we need to be pragmatic \u2013 to talk, to talk, to talk with the Tunisians for achieving an agreement between Tunisia, the European Union, Italy, also Monetary Fund, and for this also the position of the United States is very, very important.\u00a0 But we need to work step by step.\u00a0 The idea of the Italian is to put money \u2013 the first step of money, then reforms; without reforms, not the second step.\nBut we need to talk, we need to achieve good solution for the stability, because the stability of Tunisia, as the stability of Libya, is crucial for the stability of the Mediterranean region.\u00a0 Italy is strongly engaged on this.\u00a0 We will work in contact with our European friends but also our American friends for achieving good results for \u2013 in favor of the stability, peace, against illegal immigration, against terrorism.\u00a0 All together, this is a priority for everybody.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Next question, Zeba Warsi with PBS NewsHour.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 First to you both on Sweden\u2019s bid to join NATO, Mr. Secretary, you called T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s newly appointed foreign minister and emphasized the need for Sweden to be a part of NATO.\u00a0 Sweden has announced that it will extradite self \u2013 a self-proclaimed PKK supporter.\u00a0 Do you believe that will satisfy President Erdogan, or rather\u00a0T\u00fcrkiye, to clear the path for Sweden to join NATO ahead of the NATO Summit?\nAnd secondly, on the Dnieper dam disaster, do you have an update to share with us based on intelligence reports?\u00a0 Can you say with absolute certainty that the Russians were behind it?\u00a0 And more broadly, what kind of an impact has that had on the ongoing counteroffensive?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 On Sweden and NATO, a few things.\u00a0 First, as we\u2019ve said all along, if you look in the context of history, if you look at this historically, the process for both Finland and Sweden has been very rapid, and appropriately so given the fact that both countries have been longtime partners of NATO, among the strongest democracies in the world, members of the European Union.\u00a0 And of course, the challenge posed to European security by Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine makes the matter even more urgent.\nAs I also said, it\u2019s a process, and it\u2019s appropriate that during that process every member of the Alliance be able to raise any concerns or issues that it might have.\u00a0 That\u2019s especially true because a big part of being a member of NATO is the Article 5 commitment for each member to come to the defense of any other member if they are the subject of aggression.\nSo that process has worked, and in the course of it T\u00fcrkiye was able to raise some concerns that it had.\u00a0 Finland and Sweden have both addressed those concerns, and in our judgment, addressed them appropriately and effectively.\u00a0 There is I think scheduled for later this week another meeting between T\u00fcrkiye, Sweden, NATO to look at where things are.\u00a0 But in our judgment and, as important, in the judgment of virtually every other Ally in NATO \u2013 and Antonio and I were just at a meeting with our colleagues a couple of weeks ago \u2013 each and every one expressed the conviction that now is the time for Sweden to formally join the Alliance, for the accession process to be complete.\u00a0 And that\u2019s certainly the judgment of the United States.\u00a0 So our expectation is that this will happen by the time of the Vilnius Summit in July, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to see take place over the coming weeks.\nOn the dam, we don\u2019t have any further information on exactly what happened.\u00a0 We do know that it\u2019s having catastrophic effects on Ukrainians, and that\u2019s in and of itself a terrible thing, magnified, of course, by the fact that this is happening in the midst of Russia\u2019s broader aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t have any further information on exactly what caused the dam to collapse.\u00a0 Of course, Russia started this war.\u00a0 Russia is \u2013 was actually in control of the dam, and we\u2019ve seen the results affecting so many Ukrainians.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0 Italy is strongly in favor NATO for membership for Sweden.\u00a0 We would work for achieving this goal with other NATO members.\u00a0 I want to have Sweden full member during the Vilnius meeting.\u00a0 We will work for achieving this goal.\nOn the other point, we don\u2019t have clear information for this.\u00a0 It\u2019s much better to stay in silence, of course.\u00a0 We want to protect the civil population.\u00a0 We need to help the civil population.\u00a0 Also, Zaporizhzhia region is very dangerous for the same proposal during the meeting of the United Nation assembly to have a free zone around Zaporizhzhia, supporting the action of Mr. Grossi, general director of atomic agency of the United Nations.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 Final question goes to Andrea Gerli with RAI TG1 TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank.\u00a0 For both of you, Minister Tajani and Secretary Blinken, how do you evaluate what\u2019s happening on the ground in Ukraine with a counteroffensive, and where would \u2013 where could it lead eventually?\nAnd another question:\u00a0 What are the next steps of the cooperation between Ukraine and NATO?\u00a0 I\u2019m thinking about the next summit.\u00a0 And is it possible that Ukraine joins NATO \u2013 well, a de facto joint partnership, not the (inaudible)?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TAJANI:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I believe that we must follow a process that had been started a few years ago in order to have the Ukraine become an operational member of NATO.\u00a0 I believe that a substantial first step that can lead into this direction would be that of establishing a sort of NATO council with Ukraine that can see the involvement of\u00a0Ukraine also in terms of information sharing and political information at NATO level.\u00a0 And this could be a first step towards entering NATO by the Ukraine.\nRegarding the counteroffensive, I hope that it can help to make steps towards peace, because we all want peace.\u00a0 We are helping Ukraine because we want peace.\u00a0 Because if we did not help the Ukraine, Ukraine would be invaded and we would have a threat that is much greater towards Europe, and Georgia, Moldova, and many other countries would be at great risk.\u00a0 Therefore, we\u2019re doing this to defend freedom and democracy.\u00a0 But we do want peace.\u00a0 So if this counteroffensive is useful to have the Russians retreat back from the Ukraine, well, this will give freedom back to Ukraine.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0On the counteroffensive, these are, of course, early days, so much too soon to say exactly where this is going.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s important to note that, as a result of more than 50 countries coming together in support of Ukraine, and particularly the courage and tenacity of Ukraine\u2019s military and its people, we\u2019re confident that they will continue to have success in what they\u2019re trying to achieve, which is to take back the land that\u2019s been seized from them by Russia.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important to note that, in terms of what President Putin was trying to achieve in Ukraine, it\u2019s already been a strategic failure, because the objective that Putin had \u2013 that he stated himself \u2013 was to erase Ukraine from the map, to eliminate its independence, and to absorb Ukraine, in one fashion or another, into Russia.\u00a0 That has failed and it cannot succeed.\nBut it remains the case that Russia has illegally seized almost 20 percent of Ukraine\u2019s territory.\u00a0 And we both want \u2013 Italy, the United States \u2013 in fact, the Ukrainian people more than anyone \u2013 want peace, but it needs to be a just and durable peace.\u00a0 And by just, we mean a peace that basically reflects the principles of the United Nations Charter, including on territorial integrity and sovereignty.\u00a0 And by durable, we mean a peace that doesn\u2019t simply leave things in a place where Russia can rest, rearm, and re-attack six months later, a year later, two years later.\u00a0 So this is what we\u2019re working toward.\nUkraine\u2019s success in the counter offensive would do two things.\u00a0 It would strengthen its position at any negotiating table that emerges, and it may have the effect as well of actually causing Putin to finally focus on negotiating an end to the war that he started.\u00a0 And in that sense, it can actually bring peace closer, not put it further away.\u00a0 So we will continue to do two things \u2013 and we\u2019re determined in this \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to maximize our support to Ukraine now so that it can have success on the battlefield, but also our enduring support is critical, support for Ukraine so that it can build up over time a strong deterrent and defense capacity for its military so that in the future, if Russia tries to pursue another aggression, it has the chance to deter that and, if necessary, effectively defend against it; but also to support its economy, to support its integration with the European Union where Italy is a leading voice; and of course, the ongoing process of democratic reform.\nThese two things \u2013 its military strength and its economic and democratic strength \u2013 these are the critical things that Ukraine needs to succeed not only to survive, but to thrive going forward.\u00a0 And it also sends a very strong message to President Putin that, to the extent he believes that he will outlast Ukraine, that he will outlast our countries, he\u2019s wrong; and that we\u2019re committed to Ukraine not just in the moment, but for the long term as well.\u00a0 And that gets me to the NATO Summit.\u00a0 I think \u2013 without getting ahead of ourselves, I think what you can expect to see at the NATO Summit is a robust package of both political and practical support for Ukraine going forward.\nAnd this too, I think, will send a very strong message to President Putin that he can\u2019t simply try to outlast any of us, that we\u2019re all here to stay, we\u2019re determined.\u00a0 The Ukrainian people, we, all want peace, but again, it has to be just, it has to be durable.\u00a0 And if and when Russia is prepared to engage on that basis, we\u2019ll all be prepared to do that.\u00a0 But what we\u2019ve seen to date is that it\u2019s not prepared to do that.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, everyone.\n\n"},

interpreter) press conference for the minister of foreign affairs of Saudi Arabia and also Mr. Antony Blinken, the minister of foreign affairs from the USA.\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) In the name of God, we shall start.\u00a0 Hello, everyone.\u00a0 Greetings to you.\u00a0 First of all, I would like to welcome His Excellency Mr. Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State of the U.S.\u00a0 I would like also to welcome all of the observers and our distinguished guests today.\u00a0 I would like also to welcome Togo as our newest member amongst the 86 members of the global coalition, which is the biggest of its kind against terrorism.\nIn our meeting, we spoke about the liberated areas in Iraq and Syria, and we reiterated the priorities and the continuity of our efforts and endeavors in that direction, and to prevent further spread of the \u2013 of ISIS and prevent financing from reaching ISIS.\u00a0 And we have capitalized all of the efforts made by countries against ISIS.\u00a0 We spoke about the fight against armed militias and terrorist groups in west of Africa and the African region in general, which are spreading panic in Africa.\u00a0 And we have also focused on the importance of the role played by the global coalition against terrorism (inaudible) the Sahel countries but (inaudible) reiterate again as the threat of terrorism against Africa and that we are working on further cooperation in the face of this challenge.\nWe would like also to reiterate that we need to focus our work more in Afghanistan so that Afghanistan cannot be a safe haven again for terrorist groups.\u00a0 We need to work together on common challenges and provide the right environment for the \u00a0\u2013 the repatriation of IDPs to Iraq and Syria, and to also recover the citizens or the diaspora in other countries.\nAnd we have been working with countries that rejected to retrieve their nationals and are keeping this burden on the affected countries and areas and did not delve into rehabilitation.\u00a0 However, it \u2013 we recommended is that the relevant countries should work on retrieving those nationals and working on their rehabilitation instead of leaving them in the affected areas and affected countries where the burden of handling them will be on them.\nWe are also \u2013 were also focused on the different manners of multilateral collaboration within the framework of the global coalition, and we are going to continue, of course, in enriching the collaboration between us and the U.S.\nAnd in the end, I would like to say that terrorism in all of its forms should never be associated with a specific religion or a specific race or ethnicity and should not result in any segregation or discrimination against any racial group.\u00a0 And Muslims should not be harassed because of their religion, for instance.\u00a0 And this is, of course, relevant and true for all other ethnicities.\nNow, I give the floor to His Excellency the secretary general, Mr. Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, first of all, Foreign Minister Faisal, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your hospitality, thank you for bringing all of our regional and global partners together here in Riyadh.\nWhen President Biden traveled to Jeddah last summer, he affirmed the importance of the Middle East to the long-term security and economic interests of the United States.\u00a0 And he made clear that we\u2019re committed to continuing and deepening our partnerships in the region.\u00a0 Together, we can drive real progress for all our people, not only to address the challenges or crises of the moment, but to chart an affirmative vision for our shared future.\nOver the last few days, we have advanced that progress on several fronts, working with our Saudi partners, working with the Gulf Cooperation Council, working today with the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\nThe foreign minister and I just finished a productive meeting of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS.\u00a0 The United States very much appreciates the leadership of Saudi Arabia not only in hosting this meeting, but for its contributions \u2013 constant contributions and crucial contributions \u2013 day-in, day-out to our mission.\u00a0 While our coalition has taken back the territory that ISIS once controlled and inflicted severe losses on its leadership, ISIS nonetheless remains an active threat.\nThis ministerial that we just had focused on several key areas of need.\u00a0 Those include stabilizing areas liberated from ISIS so that the group can\u2019t exploit poor security, economic, or humanitarian conditions that leave people desperate; and also, as you heard from the foreign minister, repatriating foreign terrorist fighters and their families from al-Hol and other displaced persons camps.\u00a0 We\u2019re also working to keep pace with evolving threats, including ISIS\u2019s expanding efforts across sub-Saharan Africa and ISIS-Khorasan.\u00a0 Our 86-member coalition leaves this ministerial better focused and equipped to continue the mission to eradicate ISIS.\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia, both as bilateral partners and through the GCC, are working closely together to address several other challenges in the region.\nIn Yemen, when President Biden took office, war was raging.\u00a0 The country was experiencing the arguably the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.\u00a0 Now we\u2019re working intensively with Saudi Arabia and other partners to further consolidate what has been a 14-month long truce that we helped to achieve.\u00a0 This was a central issue in my discussions with the Saudi crown prince and the foreign minister, and today I had an opportunity as well to meet with Yemen\u2019s President al-Alimi to discuss the path forward.\nOur objectives are a durable ceasefire and an inclusive, Yemeni-led process mediated by the UN \u2013 one that meets Yemenis\u2019 calls for justice, for accountability, for redress for abuses, and ultimately leads to a political resolution of differences in Yemen.\u00a0 Our Special Envoy Tim Lenderking will continue to work with the parties and partners in the region in the days and weeks ahead to resolve issues standing in the way of a lasting peace.\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia, together with the GCC, are also focused on Iran\u2019s destabilizing influence in the region, including its support for terrorism and violent militia groups, the seizure of tankers transiting international waters, and nuclear escalation.\u00a0 The United States continues to believe that diplomacy, backed by economic pressure, by deterrence, and by strong defense cooperation, is the best way to avoid counter these dangerous actions.\u00a0 We support efforts by Saudi Arabia to de-escalate tension and stabilize relations.\nThe United States and our Gulf partners are working closely on the crisis in Sudan.\u00a0 Our two countries \u2013 the United States and Saudi Arabia \u2013 have been leading an intensive diplomatic campaign to get the two sides to agree to and comply with a ceasefire and to allow humanitarian assistance to reach the people of Sudan.\u00a0 We will keep working toward a durable cessation of hostilities and the swift formation of a civilian-led transitional government together with our partners in the Gulf and Africa and with the United Nations.\nI also discussed with GCC partners increasing our joint efforts to combat illicit synthetic drugs like Captagon, which is having a devastating impact on young people throughout this region, just as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are doing the same in the United States.\u00a0 This partnership will be an important part of our diplomacy to strengthen global cooperation on the growing challenge posed by illicit synthetic drugs.\nAlongside my GCC and D-ISIS engagements, I also met with the Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister Mekonnen to review the ongoing implementation of the November 2 Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.\u00a0 That agreement ended the horrific crisis in Tigray.\u00a0 For peace to endure, the parties must acknowledge the atrocities committed and pursue accountability together with reconciliation.\u00a0 The United States will continue to partner with Ethiopia as it builds a credible transitional justice process to break the cycle of ethnic and political violence that has gripped Ethiopia and prevented it from reaching its potential for far too long.\nThe U.S. partnership with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf extends far beyond addressing challenges and crises in the region.\u00a0 It is critical for expanding opportunity and driving progress for our people and for people around the world.\nThrough the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, the United States and Saudi Arabia are working together to deliver quality, sustainable infrastructure to benefit people in low and middle-income countries.\nWe\u2019re expanding digital connectivity, including by using new mobile telecommunications technology like open, cloud-based radio access networks that are both secure and affordable.\nWe\u2019re combating the climate crisis and accelerating the region\u2019s clean energy transition through our bilateral Partnership Framework for Advancing Clean Energy that we signed last summer and that can unlock new solar, green hydrogen, and other renewable energy investments.\nA key part of our strategy to advance a more prosperous, stable, and secure region is regional integration and de-escalation.\u00a0 The Gulf is more connected then ever \u2013 both as a region and with countries in the broader Middle East, including Israel.\u00a0 The United States will continue to play an integral role in deepening and expanding normalization.\nAs President Biden said in Jeddah, universal rights and freedoms \u2013 and the protections they bring \u2013 are a core priority for the United States.\u00a0 And the U.S.-Saudi partnership can be deepened by progress on human rights.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we strongly welcome and support historic steps to increase women\u2019s participation in public life in the workforce, to expand interfaith tolerance, among other reforms in the country\u2019s ambitious modernization agenda.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll continue to keep human rights firmly fixed on our bilateral agenda \u2013 a point I made clear in our meetings this week.\nLast week, U.S. and Saudi astronauts returned to Earth after spending ten days together on a mission to the International Space Station.\u00a0 That mission included Rayyanah Barnawi, the first female Arab astronaut to ever go to space.\u00a0 In her first message from space, Rayyanah predicted that \u201cthe future is very bright.\u201d\u00a0 To that, I say: let\u2019s make it so, together.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: \u00a0(In Arabic.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0(Via Interpreter) (Inaudible) these challenges or \u2013 that are represented by the actions of Daesh brought the Kingdom to chair the particular group under the state minister of \u2013 Secretary of State of (inaudible) the United States.\u00a0 And I have already qualified the meeting as a meeting that lasts for hours, where we discuss many files.\u00a0 Actually, we reviewed these files in detail, and we shall continue to do so along with our brothers, the Americans.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nThe Kingdom actually joined the group in its firm belief in our partnership with the African continent, which we consider as a source \u2013 a particular source of particular importance of cooperation and coordination with the various African states, which all have links with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nWe are copartners in development, and we feel our responsibility to preserve the achievements of those countries and particularly our common action in the face of the challenges for the stability of the continent.\u00a0 And this will reflect on the stability and security of the Kingdom itself and its neighbors.\u00a0 We feel the shared responsibility towards the African states that need capacities and (inaudible) in this area.\u00a0 And we have always stood up against Daesh in Syria and Iraq as a collective international community with the full cooperation and coordination.\u00a0 We shall continue to do so in supporting all international efforts in this sphere.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Really, I can only reiterate what the foreign minister has said.\u00a0 And, again, just as a reminder, this coalition \u2013 that is now 86 countries and organization strong, by our count is the largest coalition in the world \u2013 has had remarkable success since 2014 in taking back the territory that Daesh had seized in Iraq and Syria, in eliminating its senior leadership, and in minimizing the threat.\u00a0 But the threat remains.\u00a0 And beyond that, it is moving to other places, notably to parts of Africa, which is why we\u2019ve had to focus today and in our coalition on some of the challenges being faced by African partners, notably in the Sahel and in West Africa.\nSo what\u2019s notable about the coalition is the fact that it adapts.\u00a0 It\u2019s flexible.\u00a0 And even as we keep the focus on Iraq and Syria to make sure that the Daesh threat doesn\u2019t re-emerge in a meaningful way, we also have to make sure that we\u2019re focused on areas where it may be more active.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve noted, right now that\u2019s in Africa, and that\u2019s why we have the focus of this coalition on Africa, in full partnership with African countries.\nLast thing to mention.\u00a0 What is very notable from our discussions, today and in the all the work that we\u2019ve been doing on this, is the imperative of having a comprehensive approach.\u00a0 Security is a necessary but insufficient element of dealing with the challenge posed by Daesh.\u00a0 And we heard, from partner after partner, the imperative of dealing with the concerns, the needs of marginalized communities, bringing economic opportunities, making sure that there is good governance and a transparent political approach.\u00a0 All of these things are critical to having success against Daesh, preventing it from recruiting and expanding in other places.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 The second question for Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, gentlemen.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, Your Highness, is Saudi Arabia seeking U.S. support to develop its own civil nuclear program in exchange for normalizing ties with Israel, like it\u2019s been reported?\u00a0 And would you say that that is a nonnegotiable condition for you to normalize?\nAnd then separately, Saudi Arabia in recent years has carried out many reforms, but rights groups also report increased repression.\u00a0 What is your response to that?\u00a0 And how big of a pressure do you face from your American counterparts on this issue?\nMr. Secretary, you discussed with Saudi Crown Prince the normalization issue.\u00a0 What progress can you report?\u00a0 How feasible is such a deal, given concerns that it might accelerate an arms deal, arms race with Iran?\u00a0 And on human rights issues, I\u2019m wondering if you were able to receive any assurances from the Crown Prince towards the release of political prisoners and any U.S. citizens who are subject to travel bans.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, on the issue of nuclear cooperation, it\u2019s no secret that we are developing our domestic, civilian nuclear program.\u00a0 We would very much prefer to be able to have the U.S. as one of the bidders for that program.\u00a0 There are others that are bidding, and obviously we would like to build our program with the best technology in the world, and that will require a certain agreement to be in place.\u00a0 We have differences of opinion, so we\u2019re working on finding a mechanism for us to be able to work together on civilian nuclear technology.\u00a0 But we intend to move forward on that program.\nNormalization, I have said before and it\u2019s quite clear that we believe that normalization is in the interest of the region, that it would bring significant benefits to all.\u00a0 But without finding a pathway to peace for the Palestinian people, without addressing that challenge, any normalization will have limited benefits.\u00a0 And therefore, I think we should continue to focus on finding a pathway towards a two-state solution, on finding a pathway towards giving the Palestinians dignity and justice.\u00a0 And I think the U.S. has a similar view, that it\u2019s important to continue on those efforts.\nYou asked about human rights.\u00a0 You asked about reform.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s well known that we have gone through significant reform progress in the Kingdom.\u00a0 What we do in the Kingdom, we do based on our assessment of what\u2019s in the best interest of our country, and it\u2019s driven really by the needs and desires of the Saudi people.\nYou have had a few days here.\u00a0 I hope you have been able to see the significant changes happening in the Kingdom.\u00a0 However, we are always open to having a dialogue with our friends, but we don\u2019t respond to pressure.\u00a0 When we do anything, we do it in our own interests.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t think that anybody believes that pressure is useful or helpful, and therefore that\u2019s not something that we are going to even consider.\nBut the priority, as I said, is achieving the goals that we have for our country.\u00a0 We are very focused on building a pathway towards a sustainable prosperity for the Saudi people.\u00a0 And I encourage you and anyone who has an interest and has a curiosity about it to spend some time in the Kingdom, to interact with the people of the Kingdom, and make your own judgment and your own assessment.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Humeyra.\u00a0 On the normalization question, first \u2013 as you know \u2013 we fully support Israel\u2019s integration into the Middle East.\u00a0 And from day one, we have been working, both to deepen some of the existing agreements and also expand them to other countries.\u00a0 That includes Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 I think this would be a very important step forward, and it would certainly be a priority \u2013 and is a priority \u2013 for us.\u00a0 Integration is good for the region, for all concerned, and we will continue to pursue it.\u00a0 We discussed it here, and we will continue to work at it, to advance it in the days, weeks, and months ahead.\nOn the question of U.S. citizens and human rights more broadly, let me just say this.\u00a0 First, human rights are always on the agenda for the United States.\u00a0 It\u2019s who we are.\u00a0 And indeed, I discussed human rights in our meetings with our Saudi counterparts over the past few days, and also made clear that progress on human rights strengthens our relationship.\u00a0 We will continue to underscore, both publicly and privately, the importance that we place on human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThere\u2019s something else that\u2019s very important, and the foreign minister alluded to it.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia has embarked on a major effort, a historic effort to modernize its economy, to modernize its society.\u00a0 And part of that is going to be attracting to Saudi Arabia the best talent from around the world to visit, to pursue education, to invest, to partner, to work alongside Saudis.\u00a0 In our judgment, Vision 2030, as this initiative is called, will be a much more successful effort if Saudi Arabia is the most attractive place possible for people around the world to come to.\u00a0 And so I think it\u2019s on its own merits and in Saudi Arabia\u2019s interests to continue to pursue this modernization, including the expansion of human rights.\nWith regard to American citizens, as you know, and as you\u2019ve heard me say many times, the welfare, the security of American citizens everywhere around the world is my number-one priority and responsibility.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the focus of the Department of State as well.\u00a0 We continue to advocate on behalf of individuals to the greatest extent possible.\u00a0 I had the opportunity to raise specific cases.\u00a0 And beyond that, I won\u2019t go into details.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Sky News, (inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) First question may be addressed to His Highness, His Royal Highness Prince.\u00a0 With all the efforts carried out, undertaken by Saudi Arabia \u2013 the efforts to conclude all these agreements regarding this \u2013 the Saudi territories.\nMr. Blinken, you said this morning that you do not want Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists.\u00a0 So how can you reconcile this and with the withdrawal of America from Afghanistan, which has opened the floor for terrorists, likes of which took place this morning in Afghanistan with many victims?\u00a0 So how can you reconcile?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) With regard to Afghanistan, I would like to express our heartfelt thanks for the good care and attention that we have had from the American side.\nIn dealing with the situation in Sudan, we have achieved a certain success.\u00a0 It has not been a complete success because the parties did not commit fully to the agreement.\u00a0 We shall do everything possible to alleviate the situation in Sudan and to reach agreements between the concerned parties.\u00a0 There are various legal issues that are underway; we may reach additional mechanism that would help us resolve the situation and to penalize any party that may deviate.\nAnd we address our talk once again to our brother in Sudan, all of them, to spare the blood of the Sudanese and that we may work together to address this crisis through dialogue, away from armament, for that will not lead to any positive results.\u00a0 It will only result in further victims.\u00a0 Let\u2019s therefore move towards dialogue and towards dealing with the situation in peaceful manners such as to spare the citizens the dangers of such crises.\u00a0 I am fully confident that our brothers in Sudan will rise up to the responsibility and respond positively to spare the citizens further demolitions and further hardships.\u00a0 We shall rely on our brothers in America and all other partners to move towards that solution.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to Afghanistan, we\u2019ve made clear and we\u2019ve demonstrated since ending America\u2019s longest war that we would continue to be focused on our core national security interest in preventing the resurgence of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, and if necessary, taking action to deal with it.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve demonstrated quite clearly in recent months our ability to do just that, including eliminating a senior leader of al-Qaida, who was resident in Afghanistan.\u00a0 In addition, we\u2019re working with partners, with neighbors to strengthen the capacity to deal with any terrorism that may be located in Afghanistan and emanating from there.\nAt the same time, of course, the Taliban is an implacable enemy of ISIS-Khorasan and is itself taking action against that group.\u00a0 But regardless of that, we\u2019ve been very clear, and as I said, we\u2019ve demonstrated our ongoing enduring capacity to take necessary actions to protect our security against any terrorism that may be emanating from Afghanistan.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) the last question.\u00a0 Yes, you have the floor.\n(In English) Al-Monitor, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Foreign Minister, has America\u2019s reduced military footprint in the region created opportunities for China to forge deeper relationships with Saudi Arabia and others?\u00a0 And second, critics of Syria\u2019s regional reintegration say Bashar al-Assad has done nothing to merit it.\u00a0 Does Saudi Arabia \u2013 sorry, did Saudi Arabia set any conditions in exchange for a serious return to the Arab fold?\u00a0 And Mr. Secretary, do you fear that China is seen as a more reliable partner in the region than the U.S.?\u00a0 And on Syria, the U.S. has asked countries who normalize to get something in exchange from Assad for their re-engagement.\u00a0 Do you have any evidence that normalization has yet resulted in any meaningful concessions?\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0 So China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u00a0 China is our largest trading partner.\u00a0 So naturally, there is a lot of interaction and intersection with China.\u00a0 China is an important partner for the kingdom and most countries in the region, and I think that partnership has given us and China significant benefits.\u00a0 And that cooperation is likely to grow just because of China\u2019s economic impact in the region and beyond is likely to grow as its economy continues to grow.\nBut we still have a robust security partnership with the U.S.\u00a0 That security partnership is refreshed on an almost daily basis.\u00a0 We have military exercises that are almost constantly going on, so we have cooperation, intelligence-sharing, et cetera, as we see in the effort in Sudan, as we see in what we\u2019re doing together in Yemen.\u00a0 The partnership with the U.S. remains robust and strong, especially in those areas.\nSo I don\u2019t ascribe to this zero-sum game.\u00a0 I think we are all capable of having multiple partnerships and multiple engagements, and the U.S. does the same in many instances. \u00a0So I am not caught up in this really negative view of this.\u00a0 I think we can \u2013 we can actually build a partnership that crosses these borders.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ve heard statements also from the U.S. about a desire to find pathways to better cooperation, even with China.\u00a0 So I think the \u2013 we can only encourage that, because we see the future in cooperation, we see the future in collaboration, and that means between everybody.\nOn Syria, it\u2019s very important that we understand the context.\u00a0 The context is that the status quo was not working and was generating an ever-increasing burden on countries of the region and on the people of Syria.\u00a0 Regardless of what one thinks about Bashar al-Assad, we \u2013 the only pathway to resolving the humanitarian challenges that we face in the aftermath of the Syrian crisis is to find a pathway to addressing the main issues, and for our perspective, the humanitarian are the main concern.\u00a0 How do we ensure that there is a safe pathway for refugees to return?\u00a0 How do we ensure that there is some political reconciliation?\u00a0 How do we address the issue of drugs?\u00a0 All of these things require a dialogue with Damascus.\nAnd you will have seen the statement issued after our meeting in Amman, which we held before the return to the Arab League, in which Syria made very clear commitments on all of those fronts to work with us to address them in a way that meets the expectations not just of us in the region, but of the international community.\u00a0 And we are now going to pursue those commitments made by Damascus.\nIn the end, we have to think about the humanitarian issue.\u00a0 We have to think about the people of Syria and how do we alleviate the situation that they\u2019re living in.\u00a0 And we believe that this is the best pathway forward.\u00a0 The other efforts that had been ongoing have shown no progress for many years and only increased the difficulty of the situation.\u00a0 I mean, if you look at Lebanon, which is already in a very, very difficult economic situation, they cannot carry this burden of two million Syrian refugees for much longer.\u00a0 And in order to avoid a situation where they are at risk, we need to find a way for them to return safely.\nSo we believe that this path can deliver results where others have not, and we will work very closely with the U.S. and others to ensure that that is within the expectations of the international community, including in line with the United Nations Security Council resolutions that are relevant to the situation.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So with regard to China, I would give almost the identical answer to the foreign minister.\nFirst, our engagement in the region, our partnerships in the region, our work in the region is not about any other country.\u00a0 It\u2019s about these partnerships and the benefits that we can bring by working together \u2013 benefits we can bring to our people, benefits in many cases that we can bring to people around the world \u2013 and I described some of those earlier.\nAt the same time and more specifically, with regard to China, we\u2019ve also been very clear we\u2019re not asking anyone to choose between the United States and China.\u00a0 We are simply trying to demonstrate the benefits of our partnership and the affirmative agenda that we bring in what we\u2019re trying to do.\u00a0 In everything that I\u2019ve heard over the last two-and-a-half years and over the last three days from partners throughout the region \u2013 again, many of whom were here in Riyadh \u2013 the United States remains the number one partner of choice for, I think, most countries in the region.\nWith regard to Syria, again, no secret that we did not think that Syria merited readmission to the Arab League, but at the same time, we also see that we have the same goals when it comes to what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u00a0 Now, our position has been very clear:\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to be in the business of normalizing relations with Assad, with that regime.\u00a0 It has not earned that step toward recognition, toward acceptance.\u00a0 But because the goals are very much the same, I think moving forward, and, as the foreign minister described, we\u2019ll see if we can achieve some progress.\nWe all want to reach a solution in Syria that\u2019s consistent with the key United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254.\u00a0 We want to expand humanitarian access for the people of Syria.\u00a0 We want to ensure, of course, that ISIS can\u2019t re-emerge.\u00a0 We want safe conditions for the eventual return of refugees.\u00a0 We want to counter Captagon trafficking, which is doing so much damage in the region.\u00a0 We want to reduce Iranian influence.\nSo what we\u2019ve heard and what you just heard again from the foreign minister is the intent of our partners to use direct engagement with the Assad regime to further demand progress in these areas and other areas over the coming months.\u00a0 Now, I have to admit we are skeptical of Assad\u2019s willingness to take the necessary steps, but we\u2019re aligned with our partners here on what those steps are and on the ultimate objectives.\nFOREIGN MINISTER AL SAUD:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n(Via interpreter) This will conclude this press conference, so thank you, Your Highnesses, and all the participants.\n(In English) Thank you so much for joining us here in Riyadh.\n\n"}, {"url":

In appreciation of the efforts of our brothers in Iraq, the Kingdom has contributed to financing reconstruction projects in Iraq.\nWe also extend our thanks and appreciation to the working groups of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS terrorist organization for their efforts in combating ISIS and preventing its spread.\nI am pleased to announce that the Kingdom has joined the presidency of the Coalition\u2019s Africa Focus Group, to confront the dangers of ISIS, joining the United States, Morocco, Italy, and Niger. I also welcome the establishment of a focus group concerned with combating ISIS in Khorasan Province in Afghanistan, as this group will constitute a focus for limiting the presence and spread of the terrorist organization in those areas.\nYour Highnesses, and Excellencies.\u00a0 As the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes fighting ideology through ideas, uprooting the scourge of terrorism from its roots, and rejecting hatred and extremism, the Kingdom has established several centers to combat terrorism and extremist ideas. The most important of which is the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, Etidal, which aims to combat extremist ideology and its messages, spread the principles of tolerance, promote a culture of moderation, combat activities and limit their effects, and provide media campaigns to mitigate the media influence of ISIS, in cooperation with our partners at the regional and international levels.\nDear attendees, we must all work to block any opportunity that this organization can exploit to co-opt and recruit new followers. Therefore, I call on the Defeat ISIS Action Group to focus, during its campaigns, on combating everything that would insult religious symbols and sanctities, deliberate provocative actions, and all practices that destabilize security and stability that ISIS and extremist groups may exploit to implement their propaganda, at a time when the world needs to work together to reject extremism, while spreading the values of dialogue and tolerance.\nOur battle against extremism and terrorism requires additional efforts to win minds and hearts, not only through media, cultural and educational tools with their supreme importance, but also by presenting a live practical model for a better future based on tolerance, openness, sustainable development, and prosperity, which is embodied in the vision of the Kingdom, vision 2030, where our sons and daughters create the future and celebrate life. They are the goals of the vision, and they are also the pillars of achieving it.\nIn conclusion, thank you all for coming and participating in this meeting, through which we hope to contribute to achieving security, stability, and prosperity to build a great future for our future generations. Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Faisal, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you for hosting us today and thank you \u2013 and thanks to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its significant contributions to our shared work to defeat ISIS as a founding member of this coalition and through its leadership today.\u00a0 And it\u2019s so good to see so many colleagues here with us in Riyadh.\nSince we came together in 2014, our coalition has grown into an 86-member force, bringing together countries and organizations from every part of the world.\nTogether, we have achieved the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. \u00a0We\u2019ve taken out or captured its leadership. \u00a0We\u2019ve prevented large-scale attacks. \u00a0And we\u2019ve invested billions in stabilizing liberated areas and rebuilding the region.\nOur progress is a testament to the strength of this coalition \u2013 and the courage of our partners on the ground.\nBut for all our progress, the fight is not yet done. \u00a0So today, I\u2019d like to briefly focus on what we see as the most urgent areas for focus to achieve the enduring defeat of ISIS.\nFirst: stabilization assistance across Iraq and Syria. \u00a0Poor security and humanitarian conditions, lack of economic opportunity \u2013 these are the fuel for the kind of desperation on which ISIS feeds and recruits. \u00a0So we have to stay as committed to our stabilization goals as we\u2019ve been to our military campaign that resulted in the victory on the battlefield.\nToday, we\u2019re announcing a funding goal for the Stabilization Pledge Drive of just over $601 million \u2013 and I\u2019m announcing that the United States is committing $148.7 million to that fund. \u00a0This support will meet critical needs that Syrians and Iraqis themselves have identified, addressing vulnerabilities previously exploited by ISIS, closing gaps in local needs, including for essential services, education, community reintegration, accountability for crimes.\nSecond: repatriations of foreign terrorist fighters and their family members. \u00a0Repatriation is critical to reducing the populations of both displaced persons camps, like al-Hol, and detention centers holding nearly 10,000 ISIS fighters, 2,000 of whom are from countries other than Syria and Iraq.\nFailure to repatriate foreign terrorist fighters risks the possibility that they could again take up arms and attempt to restore ISIS\u2019s so-called \u201ccaliphate,\u201d terrorize communities that we\u2019re working to stabilize and rebuild, and potentially threaten our homelands.\nAl-Hol currently hosts 50,000 displaced persons, most of whom are women and children, half of whom are under the age of 12. \u00a0Some of these children know nothing other than life in al-Hol. \u00a0Leaving these children in camps condemns them to lives marked by danger, the denial of basic health care, the denial of education \u2013 the denial of hope. \u00a0So even as we prioritize addressing the serious security and humanitarian needs at al-Hol and other camps, we know that repatriation is the only durable solution.\nWe are, fortunately, making some progress. \u00a0Last year, more foreign nationals were repatriated from northeast Syria than in the previous two years combined. \u00a0So far in 2023, 14 countries have repatriated over 2,000 of their nationals \u2013 including hundreds of children who are now able to have a new chance at life.\nWe\u2019re grateful to the many countries who have stepped up: the Iraqi Government, which since 2021 has led the way, bringing home nearly 5,000 of its nationals from northeast Syria, including hundreds of fighters; countries, including in Central Asia, which have brought home many of their nationals; Kuwait, which serves as a critical transit hub for these repatriations.\nThe United States stands ready to assist with repatriation, providing diplomatic and logistical assistance, as well as aiding with rehabilitation, reintegration, and, where applicable, investigation and efforts to ensure accountability through prosecution.\nOur third area of focus as a coalition must be keeping pace with the evolving threat. \u00a0The security situation throughout the Sahel and much of West Africa has deteriorated significantly over the past several years. \u00a0(Inaudible) farmers ambushed in North Kivu province. \u00a0Today, Africa is home to nearly half of global terrorism deaths.\nOur Africa Focus Group \u2013 joined today by the newest member of the coalition, Togo \u2013 is helping crystalize our focus on the terrorist threat in the region. \u00a0That was very much on display in Niamey, where 38 coalition members and observers recently came together to boost regional collaboration, including by endorsing the Focus Group Action Plan.\u00a0 That will strengthen border security, collect biometrics of terrorists, counter ISIS propaganda and financing, and more. \u00a0The United States is supporting these efforts \u2013 and has just pledged $130 million to enhance civilian counterterrorism capacity in sub-Saharan Africa, including over $22 million for partnerships with Coastal West Africa.\nAt the same time, we remain vigilant against the evolving threat posed by ISIS-Khorasan. \u00a0All of us are determined to see to it that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists. \u00a0I\u2019m grateful to the United Kingdom for its work on this front. \u00a0The United States is bolstering our collective efforts with over $30 million in new counterterrorism programming for Central Asia, coming on top of $50 million we\u2019ve invested in capacity building for the region.\nFinally, we remain focused on cutting off ISIS\u2019s ability to raise and move funds across multiple jurisdictions, including the General Directorate of Provinces. \u00a0Today, I\u2019m announcing the designation of two ISIS GDP leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists \u2013 the Iraq-based Bilad al-Rafidayn Office emir and a Sahel-based al-Furqan Office senior leader.\nThe global community \u2013 so much of it represented here today \u2013 faces no shortage of security challenges. \u00a0Recent years have demonstrated the progress that we can achieve with steadfast determination. \u00a0I\u2019m confident that today will advance the collective commitment to defeat ISIS and finally eliminate the scourge of terrorism around the world.\nThank you very much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-before-the-foreign-ministers-meeting-of-the-gulf-cooperation-council/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "June 5, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Please, take a seat.\nWonderful to be with all of you today.\u00a0 Michael, my friend, thank you for that introduction.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to you and grateful to my longtime friend, Howard Kohr, for inviting me back to AIPAC.\nNow, I have to admit \u2013 (applause) \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 As I was talking with Michael and Howard and the other senior leadership of AIPAC a moment ago, I said my lifelong ambition has already been fulfilled by AIPAC because a few years ago \u2013 some of you may have been there \u2013 I got to appear in the Dallas Cowboys football stadium on a jumbotron.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Never thought that would happen.\u00a0 It\u2019s thanks to you.\n(Applause.)\nSo I am honored to be here with hundreds of fellow friends of Israel from across our country.\nIt\u2019s great to be with colleagues from the Hill.\u00a0 I know that it\u2019s \u2013 during the course of the day and maybe even this morning, Chairman Menendez, Senator Barrasso, Chairman Diaz-Balart, Congresswoman Wasserman-Schultz, among others \u2013 representing the continued bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.\nLast month, we marked 75 years since the founding of the State of Israel.\n(Applause.)\nToday \u2013 today \u2013 we celebrate 75 years of the U.S.-Israeli partnership.\n(Applause.)\nNow, you all know this very well.\u00a0 That partnership touches on every aspect of our lives, from security to business, from energy to public health.\u00a0 Our ties have not only delivered for one another but for countries around the world \u2013 making deserts bloom, developing the clean energy technologies of the future, producing vaccines, charting the future of space exploration, and so much more.\u00a0 And the depth and breadth of that partnership between our governments is matched only by the strength of the ties between our peoples.\nThis partnership between the United States and Israel is indispensable.\u00a0 But it was not inevitable.\u00a0\u00a0 As Israel prepared to declare its independence, many members of President Truman\u2019s cabinet, including the secretary of state, counseled against recognizing Israel, convinced that an independent Jewish state could not survive \u2013 that it wasn\u2019t economically viable, that it lacked the natural resources to serve as the Jewish homeland, that it couldn\u2019t bear an influx of immigrants, that it simply faced too many security threats.\nNot everyone thought that way.\u00a0 My grandfather, Maurice Blinken, who founded the American Palestine Institute after the Second World War, initiated a report before independence that argued that a Jewish state was indeed possible \u2013 that it would in fact be easier to \u201csupport two million Jews than the present 600,000.\u201d\u00a0 That report helped convince many skeptics, including within the United States Government.\nOthers in the country similarly had faith in Israel\u2019s future and found the courage to speak out against the prevailing wisdom \u2013 public servants like White House Counsel Clark Clifford, who argued that Israel could be the first democratic government in the Middle East; everyday Americans like Missouri businessman Eddie Jacobson, who convinced the President to meet with Chaim Weizmann; and, of course, President Truman himself.\nPresident Truman never wavered in his decision to extend recognition to the new Jewish state.\u00a0 He said, and I quote, \u201cI had faith in Israel even before it was established.\u00a0 I knew it was based on the love of freedom, which has been the guiding star of the Jewish people since the days of Moses\u2026I believe that it had a glorious future before it, not just as a sovereign nation but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.\u201d\nToday, our partnership remains rooted in those shared ideals and that shared history.\u00a0 But its success depends on our commitment, not just to tending it, but renewing that bond \u2013 and recommitting to the democratic values that are at its heart \u2013 and to do that each and every day.\nSo today what I\u2019d like to do is talk to you a little bit about what our administration is doing to strengthen the relationship between our countries at what is a historic moment for both of our countries and the world.\u00a0 And it\u2019s easy to throw about words like \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201cunprecedented,\u201d but as President Biden says, we are genuinely living through an inflection point, a point that comes around every six or seven generations, where the changes are so profound around the world that we have to find ways to navigate those changes together, and to do it effectively.\nNow, we have to start from this.\u00a0 The U.S.-Israel relationship is underwritten by the United States\u2019 commitment to Israel\u2019s security.\u00a0 That commitment is non-negotiable; it is ironclad.\n(Applause.)\nWe are \u2013 we are providing $3.3 billion in foreign military financing to Israel each year.\u00a0 On top of that, Israel receives $500 million in funding for missile defense.\u00a0 Tens of millions more for new counter-drone and anti-tunneling technologies.\u00a0 That is in keeping with the 2016 memorandum of understanding negotiated by the Obama-Biden administration \u2013 and it is more than at any point in the history of our relationship.\u00a0 We\u2019re also delivering an additional $1 billion in funding to replenish supplies for Israel\u2019s Iron Dome, the missile defense system that we developed together and that has saved countless lives.\n(Applause.)\nAll of this \u2013 all of this has been secured in partnership with our Congress, with bipartisan support.\nWe\u2019re also expanding our joint military exercises that improve how our forces work together seamlessly.\u00a0 This year, we have more joint exercises scheduled than at any point in our history.\u00a0 We\u2019re also conducting joint research and development on advanced military capabilities, working together on cutting-edge defense systems, including Israel\u2019s new laser-focused Iron Beam.\nThis robust support continues to be critical in maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge, buttressing its ability to defend itself, and to advancing our national interests.\u00a0 America is more secure when Israel is strong.\n(Applause.)\nAs we support Israel\u2019s defense, we are also pushing back, as you\u2019ve heard, on the consistent, constant efforts to delegitimize Israel \u2013 which are aimed at undermining or isolating Israel\u2019s rightful place on the international stage.\u00a0 Now, we fully, deeply respect the right of all to freedom of expression \u2013 and indeed, every single day, we are actively defending that and promoting that around the world.\nAt the same time, we continue to reject the global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement for unfairly singling out Israel.\n(Applause.)\nWe are vigorously pushing back against anti-Israel efforts to exclude and target it at the UN Security Council, the Human Rights Council, and other forums around the world.\nAnd we\u2019re combatting antisemitism, which we know fuels and intersects with hatred towards Israel.\u00a0 It is one of the oldest and worst scourges in our societies.\u00a0 It needs to be called out, it needs to be condemned, and it needs to be defeated everywhere in the world.\n(Applause.)\nLast month, together with Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combatting Antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt, the President released the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, to beat back the rising tide of hate that we see around the world and, yes, in our own country.\nNow, we\u2019re clear-eyed about the many dangers that Israel faces in all of their forms.\u00a0 But there is no danger that Israel faces that is graver than the one posed by the Iranian regime.\nThat regime routinely threatens to wipe Israel off the map.\u00a0 It continues to provide weapons to terrorists and proxies like Hizballah and Hamas, who reject Israel\u2019s right to exist.\u00a0 It exports its aggression throughout \u2013 and even beyond \u2013 the region, including by arming Russian forces with drones that are being used to kill Ukrainian civilians and destroy its infrastructure.\u00a0 And in turn, Russia is providing sophisticated weaponry to Iran.\nThe pattern of hostile behavior underscores a clear imperative, which you heard from Michael: Iran cannot and will not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.\n(Applause.)\nWe continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to verifiably, effectively, and sustainably prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 In parallel, economic pressure and deterrence reinforce our diplomacy.\u00a0 If Iran rejects the path of diplomacy, then \u2013 as President Biden has repeatedly made clear \u2013 all options are on the table to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\n(Applause.)\nThis three-pronged approach \u2013 diplomacy, economic pressure, deterrence, which also includes strengthening Israel\u2019s miliary capabilities \u2013 has bipartisan support, and it puts us in the strongest possible position to address the Iranian nuclear threat, just as we take on the many other challenges posed by the Iranian regime.\nThe United States is advancing Israel\u2019s security \u2013 and our own \u2013 in another critical way: by working to deepen Israel\u2019s relationships with its neighbors, to advance our goal of regional integration and de-escalation.\nIsrael\u2019s further integration in the region contributes to a more stable, a more secure, and more prosperous region \u2013 and a more secure Israel.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden has made it a cornerstone of his Middle East policy.\nWe will soon create a new position to further our diplomacy and engagement with governments, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, all working toward a more peaceful and a more connected region in order to achieve significant historic progress to deepen and broaden the Abraham Accords, building on the work of the Trump administration.\nLast year I joined foreign ministers from Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates in Sde Boker, the home of David Ben-Gurion.\u00a0 That summit led to the creation of, as you\u2019ve heard, the Negev Forum, building again on the Abraham Accords and building on existing relationships between Israel and some of its neighbors.\u00a0 That forum is a regional framework that facilitates cooperation not only between governments but also with businesses, with entrepreneurs, civil society, young people, on key issues that actually matter in the lives of people throughout the Middle East \u2013 food security, water technology, clean energy, tourism, health care, education, regional security.\nEarlier this year the working groups from that forum convened for the first time in Abu Dhabi, and that proved to be the largest gathering of Israeli and Arab governmental officials since the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference, all of this unthinkable just a few years ago.\u00a0 And we are now working hard behind the scenes, leading with diplomacy to continue the momentum.\nThere\u2019s also been concrete progress elsewhere in the region.\u00a0 If you look back just over the past year, Saudi Arabia and Oman unlocked their airspace to civilian flights to and from Israel.\n(Applause.)\nFollowing intense mediation by the United States, Israel and Lebanon completed a historic agreement last fall to establish their permanent maritime boundary, something that had been long in the works.\u00a0 That in turn lowered the prospect of conflict and also created a greater path for greater energy security in the region.\nWe\u2019re helping Israel and Jordan, together with the UAE, implement Project Prosperity, to collaborate on water and energy security, which is on track to launch by this year\u2019s COP28.\nAnd we convened new coalitions like I2U2, which brings together India, Israel, the UAE, the United States to solve fundamental challenges facing our people, starting with food and energy security.\u00a0 That initiative is literally the product of a dinner conversation between my Israeli and Emirati counterparts.\u00a0 We had this idea.\u00a0 We got on the phone.\u00a0 We had the idea on a Friday; by Tuesday, we were on a videoconference with our Indian counterpart.\u00a0 This project was launched, and ultimately the leaders of all the countries worked together to move it forward.\nWe\u2019re also supporting Israel in its work to deepen relations beyond the region, including in the Eastern Mediterranean and with the 3.1[1]\u00a0grouping of Israel, Greece, the Republic of Cyprus, focused on intensifying cooperation in energy, economic growth, climate action, emergency preparedness, counterterrorism.\u00a0 And we are working to accelerate all of this progress.\nThe United States has a real national security interest in promoting normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n(Applause.)\nWe believe that we can and indeed we must play an integral role in advancing it.\u00a0 Now, we have no illusions that this can be done quickly or easily.\u00a0 But we remain committed to working toward this outcome, including on the trip I\u2019m about to take this week to Jeddah and Riyadh for engagements with our Saudi and Gulf counterparts.\nA more integrated, prosperous, stable region serves the interests of Israel.\u00a0 It serves the interests of our regional partners.\u00a0 It serves the United States.\u00a0 But integration and normalization efforts are not a substitute for progress between Israelis and Palestinians, nor should they come at its expense.\u00a0 Israel\u2019s deepened relationships with its partners can and should advance the well-being of the Palestinian people and the prospects for a two-state solution.\nAs the President said on his recent trip to Israel and the West Bank last summer, a two-state solution \u2013 based on the 1967 lines, with mutually agreed swaps \u2013 remains the best way to achieve our goal of Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace, with equal measures of security, freedom, justice, opportunity, and dignity.\nIsrael was founded \u2013 our partnership was built \u2013 on democratic values, which include equal access by all people to their rights.\u00a0 And a two-state solution is vital to preserving Israel\u2019s identity as a Jewish and democratic state.\nNow, it\u2019s no secret that, today, the prospects of a two-state solution can feel remote.\u00a0 But we are committed to working with partners and with the parties to at least maintain a horizon of hope.\nIn the immediate term, that means de-escalation, refraining from unilateral measures that increase tensions, that strengthen security cooperation to counter violence, and that improve daily life for the Palestinian people.\nThat\u2019s what our diplomacy has been about at regional meetings in Aqaba and Sharm El-Sheikh, and with the help and support of Israel\u2019s longstanding partners, Jordan and Egypt.\u00a0 This work requires both parties to uphold commitments that they\u2019ve made, including at those recent meetings.\nThese talks represent critical steps to try to stem the violence, and hopefully to rebuild frayed ties and begin the real diplomatic work necessary to resolve this conflict.\nPreserving a horizon of hope also means that we have to continue to reject \u2013 unequivocally \u2013 any actions taken by any party that undermine the prospects of a two-state solution.\u00a0 That includes acts of terrorism, payments to terrorists in prison, violence against civilians, incitement to violence.\nOver the past several years, we\u2019ve seen a rising tide of horrific violence that\u2019s tragically and senselessly resulted in the loss of life of scores of civilians on both sides.\u00a0 That violence must end; its perpetrators must face equal justice under the law.\u00a0 The recent acts of terrorism \u2013 including nearly 1,000 rocket attacks launched toward Israel over just three days, some of them targeting Jerusalem \u2013 demonstrate the daily threat under which Israelis are forced to live.\u00a0 The fatal event at the border with Egypt \u2013 which resulted in the deaths of three Israeli soldiers \u2013 is another tragic reminder of these daily dangers.\nSettlement expansion clearly presents an obstacle to the horizon of hope that we seek.\u00a0 Likewise, any move toward annexation of the West Bank, de facto or de jure, disruption of the historic status quo at the holy sites, the continuing demolitions of homes and the evictions of families that have lived in those homes for generations damage prospects for two states.\u00a0 They also undermine the basic daily dignity to which all people are entitled.\nIt\u2019s not enough, of course, to simply discourage sides from taking steps that set back the prospect of two states.\u00a0 We need to show people what the future we\u2019re working toward actually looks like.\nThat\u2019s why, since day one, we have focused on re-engaging the Palestinian people and working to rebuild trust.\nWe\u2019re investing more resources in building understanding between the two sides at the grassroots level to help build peace from the bottom up, including through the Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act.\nWe\u2019re also working with the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority to encourage political, economic, and security reforms that can lay the foundation for a stable, democratic Palestinian state alongside a State of Israel with secure, recognized borders.\u00a0 Ultimately, a two-state solution can only be achieved through direct negotiation between the parties.\nPreserving a horizon of hope also means holding firm to the values that have anchored the friendship between the United States and Israel across countless administrations in both of our countries.\nWe\u2019ll continue to work with the Israeli Government to advance our shared values.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to express our support for core democratic principles, including a separation of powers, checks and balances, and the equal administration of justice for all citizens of Israel. We will speak honestly and respectfully with our Israeli friends, as partners always should and as we always do.\u00a0 As Israeli leaders and citizens debate these issues, we welcome efforts to find consensus on any reforms.\u00a0 That\u2019s simply the best way to make sure that they\u2019re embraced and that they endure.\nAt the end of his presidency, Harry Truman set out his vision for Israel.\u00a0 And he said, and I quote, \u201cI hope that we shall soon see the day when Israel and her neighbors will sit down at the peace table and will reach a full settlement of all [of] their differences so that our friends in the Near East, Arabs and Israelis alike, may enter together upon a new partnership\u201d for their mutual advantage and the advantage of all people.\nToday, our commitment to that future endures.\u00a0 It\u2019s reinforced every day by men and women who believe in it, who are willing to do the hard work to make it a reality, who look at the future that others believe is impossible, and instead see something that they believe is inevitable.\nI\u2019m grateful to AIPAC, to each and every one of you, who are working to make real this better future.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful, as always, for the opportunity to speak to you today.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Applause.)\n\n[1]\u00a03+1\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-norwegian-foreign-minister-anniken-huitfeldt-before-their-meeting-3/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 So let me first say what a pleasure it is to be in Oslo for the first time in my capacity as Secretary of State and also wonderful to be in this absolutely magnificent museum.\u00a0 The only regret is that we don\u2019t have a little bit more time to spend here.\u00a0\nI very much want to thank Norway for the incredibly warm welcome and for hosting this informal NATO ministerial meeting.\u00a0 As a founding member of NATO and the eyes and ears of the Alliance on the northern flank, Norway is a critical partner and critical to transatlantic security.\u00a0 And we just saw that again last week when the USS\u00a0Gerald Ford,\u00a0the world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier, arrived in Oslo for training exercises.\nHere in Secretary General Stoltenberg\u2019s hometown, let me also say how grateful I am to Jens for his remarkable leadership of our Alliance these past few years \u2013 truly a crucial moment for the Alliance.\u00a0 Jens has brought a remarkably strong and steady hand to NATO, and as a result \u2013 no small measure, thanks to his leadership \u2013 NATO is facing the future stronger, bigger, and more united than ever.\nWe had a very productive discussion today to prepare for the NATO Summit in Vilnius that will take place next month.\u00a0 We focused on advancing our unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s brutal aggression.\u00a0 As we look to Vilnius, we remain dedicated to the principles underpinning our Alliance, including, of course, Article 5 and our shared commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory.\u00a0\nWe continue to strengthen and modernize the Alliance as we head to Vilnius.\u00a0 On April 4th, of course, we welcome Finland as our 31st Ally, adding another first-rate military and enhancing our presence in the High North and the Black Sea[1].\u00a0 We\u2019re continuing to work to complete the accession process for Sweden, another very strong and capable partner, and we fully anticipate doing so by the time the leaders meet in Vilnius.\u00a0 These additions will make both Finland and Sweden safer and make NATO stronger.\u00a0 And our defensive Alliance is and always will keep its door open to new members.\nWe appreciate the efforts of Allies, like Norway, who\u2019ve made concrete plans to meet the Wales Pledge and spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense.\u00a0 And we look forward to coming out of Vilnius with a strengthened pledge to provide the resources necessary to improve the readiness of our militaries, increase our resilience, and keep pace with emerging challenges like cyber defense and climate security.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re also deepening our coordination with key partners in the Indo-Pacific, building on our shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0\nAs the people of Ukraine demonstrate incredible courage and sacrifice, the United States, the European Union, and countries around the world continue to support their fight to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity and the right to choose their own path.\u00a0 Together, we have committed billions of dollars in security assistance, including our recent pledge to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 aircraft, which Norway is also considering.\u00a0 We\u2019ve imposed severe sanctions on Russia\u2019s economy and war machine.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing vital humanitarian, economic, and energy assistance.\u00a0\nNorway has been an essential partner in this effort from day one.\u00a0 Going back to February of 2022, Norway has provided more than $2.3 billion in support of Ukraine \u2013 including air defenses and other weapons \u2013 and has pledged now $7.5 billion in aid over the next five years.\u00a0 As Europe\u2019s leading supplier of natural gas, Norway has been instrumental in helping Europe transition away from Russian energy, which the United States remains committed to supporting.\u00a0 And the people of Norway have welcomed some 43,000 Ukrainian refugees, who are finding new homes and even learning Norwegian.\u00a0\nIn today\u2019s discussion, many Allies also expressed concern about increased tensions in northern Kosovo and strongly condemned the recent attacks on KFOR troops, and we\u2019re thinking today of our Italian and Hungarian colleagues who were injured in that attack.\u00a0 We call on the Governments of Kosovo and Serbia to take immediate steps to de-escalate tensions and renew efforts to implement the EU-led normalization agreements.\u00a0 We support the process of Euro-Atlantic integration for Kosovo and for Serbia, but the current escalation hinders \u2013 rather than helps \u2013 the efforts to move in that direction.\u00a0\nIn addition to our informal NATO ministerial, I appreciated very much the chance to meet with Prime Minister St\u00f8re yesterday evening, and I\u2019ll be meeting shortly with my friend and colleague, the foreign minister, to discuss the very robust bilateral relationship between our countries, which is growing from strength.\u00a0\nLast year, a new supplementary Defense Cooperation Agreement entered into force, modernizing how our militaries collaborate.\u00a0\nNorway is leading the world in advancing clean energy technologies, with electric vehicles now making up 80 percent of new cars sold here over the last year.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue partnering with Norway to combat the climate crisis, from reducing deforestation to making shipping greener.\nAnd of course, our countries are Arctic allies.\u00a0 I look forward to discussing with the foreign minister Norway\u2019s assumption of the chair of the Arctic Council.\u00a0 We\u2019re eager to work with likeminded allies to advance our vision of a peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative Arctic.\u00a0\nTo deepen our own engagement in the High North, I\u2019m announcing today that the United States will be opening an American Presence Post in Troms\u00f8 \u2013 our northernmost diplomatic mission and only such facility above the Arctic Circle.\u00a0\nSo I very much appreciated the opportunity to discuss these efforts with both our Norwegian and NATO Allies.\u00a0 We covered a lot of ground today in preparation for Vilnius.\u00a0 And I think based on the discussions today, we can anticipate a very productive summit when our leaders meet in July.\u00a0 With that, happy to take some questions.\u00a0\nMR MILLER:\u00a0 First question is for Shaun Tandon with AFP.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Can I follow up on a couple of things you just said?\u00a0 You said that the door remains open to Ukraine.\u00a0 Here in the talks leading up to the Vilnius Summit, what political commitments do you think NATO should give to Ukraine, if any, at this point, in addition to the military aid?\u00a0 Excuse me.\u00a0\nAnd on the issue of Kosovo, you mentioned the call to de-escalate tensions.\u00a0 You\u2019ve criticized the leaders in Pristina for the actions that they\u2019ve taken.\u00a0 How much leverage does the United States or do other NATO members have over those decisions?\u00a0 And how do you assess the role of Belgrade and Moscow in this?\u00a0\nAnd with your indulgence, can I just briefly ask about the situation in Sudan?\u00a0 You have the breakdown of the talks there, the army withdrawing.\u00a0 Are you optimistic at all of talks restarting or a peace process restarting at some point?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thanks very much, Shaun.\u00a0 So with regard to Ukraine, I think, based on the discussions today, the first thing I\u2019d say is that at Vilnius, when the leaders meet for the summit, we and our friends in Ukraine can anticipate a very robust package of both political and practical support.\u00a0 Everyone here stands behind the Bucharest commitment.\u00a0 That hasn\u2019t changed.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused intensely on what we can do to strengthen even more the relationship between Ukraine and NATO and to continue to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards, interoperability.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019ll see that be a feature of the Summit in Vilnius, as well as strengthening the political relationship between NATO and Ukraine.\u00a0 So again, I\u2019d anticipate, based on discussions today, that there will be a strong package of support.\nNow, what we were doing today is not decisional.\u00a0 This was really an opportunity on the eve \u2013 almost the eve \u2013 of the summit to compare notes and to make sure that when we get to the summit we do so in a way that\u2019s characterized our entire approach to the crisis in Ukraine and to Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, and that is united together and moving forward.\u00a0 So you\u2019ll see that both in terms of support for Ukraine; you\u2019ll see that in terms of our ongoing commitment to strengthen our own Alliance to make sure that it is properly postured for any Russian aggression; and I think you\u2019ll also see that in NATO looking at a whole series of other challenges, many of which we\u2019ve focused on addressing, including with our new Strategic Concept.\u00a0\nWith regard to Kosovo, the escalation there and the actions taken there move both Kosovo and Serbia in the wrong direction, because the answer that we\u2019re looking for is de-escalation, avoiding any unilateral actions, and returning to this normalization process and the EU-led effort that is what promises both of them a future of integration in the Euro-Atlantic community.\u00a0 And in a sense, when we\u2019re talking about leverage, that\u2019s it.\u00a0 That, I think, meets clearly the aspirations of people in both countries. \u00a0If either country is taking steps that actually make that a more distant prospect, that\u2019s actually not going to serve the interests of their people.\nWe\u2019ve been very clear in our concerns about some of the recent actions that were taken.\u00a0 We\u2019ve said that directly to the leaders involved, including Prime Minister Kurti.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking for both to act responsibly going forward.\nSudan, we have been very much engaged \u2013 and I\u2019ve been very much engaged \u2013 in trying to get a ceasefire.\u00a0 We did \u2013 very imperfect.\u00a0 We got it extended a few times.\u00a0 We did see the provision of humanitarian assistance moving forward.\u00a0 But it has been incredibly imperfect and incredibly fragile, and now we\u2019re seeing actions \u2013 again, by both sides \u2013 in clear violation of the commitments they\u2019ve made in terms of the ceasefire.\u00a0 So that also is not the right direction to be heading, and it\u2019s certainly not what\u2019s in the interests of the people of Sudan.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll continue to be engaged.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re also looking at steps that we can take to make clear our views on any leaders who are moving Sudan in the wrong direction, including by perpetuating the violence and by violating the ceasefires that they\u2019ve actually committed to.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now.\nMR MILLER: \u00a0Mattia Bagnoli with ANSA.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr.\u00a0 Secretary, for the opportunity.\u00a0 I want to go back to Kosovo for a second, please.\u00a0 Regarding the rising tensions that we are seeing over there, NATO has already announced an increase in its presence.\u00a0 And is the U.S. also ready to deploy more troops at Bondsteel base?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So the United States already has forces there as part of the existing -mission.\u00a0 The plus-up \u2013 we have several hundred forces as part of the KFOR mission.\u00a0 The plus-up that was announced by NATO I don\u2019t think will involve additional U.S. forces.\u00a0 But as I said, there are already U.S. forces as part of the KFOR mission.\u00a0 There are now an additional roughly 700 troops who will be added to the approximately, I think, 4,000 or so who are already there.\u00a0\nBut again, the most important thing is for the parties themselves to de-escalate, to stop engaging in unilateral actions, and to return to the EU-led dialogue.\u00a0 That is the path forward.\u00a0 That is what we are strongly urging both parties to do.\u00a0 That\u2019s very much our expectation for what we\u2019ll see in the in the days and weeks ahead.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0The next question is from Will Mauldin with\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I wanted to follow up on Shaun\u2019s question and ask, based on the conversations that you heard at the informal meeting \u2013 a group of \u2013 the majority of NATO countries, their foreign affairs committee chairman wrote today saying that there should be a clear path toward membership for Ukraine and a strong security guarantee.\u00a0 Is that something that\u2019s consistent with what you heard in the room or is there still a deep divide between those who want NATO membership for Ukraine and those who don\u2019t?\u00a0\nAnd then following up on where you said practical support for Ukraine, would that be some kind of scheduled weapons delivery or assistance long term, something like the U.S. provides for Israel or were you referring to something else?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well first, I think it\u2019s, again, very clear from today\u2019s discussion that every Ally stands by Bucharest.\u00a0 There is no division on that proposition.\u00a0 NATO is a consensus-driven organization, so any steps that we take have to be taken by consensus of all 31 countries who are currently members of the Alliance.\u00a0 As I said, when we\u2019re \u2013 when we\u2019re looking at Vilnius, our focus is twofold.\u00a0 First, we have an immediate focus, both through NATO but also on a individual basis, with the now more than 50 countries that have been supporting Ukraine, an immediate focus on maximizing our support in Ukraine \u2013 for Ukraine as it engages in a counteroffensive to take back its territory seized from it by Russia over the last year and a quarter.\u00a0\nAt the same time, we\u2019re also focused on helping Ukraine build up its medium\u2011 to long-term deterrence and defense capacity so that if and when the current aggression settles, Ukraine has the full capacity to deter and, if necessary, defend against future aggression.\u00a0 And NATO has a role in that in terms of the work that it can do to help bring Ukraine up to NATO standards in its planning, in its interoperability with NATO.\u00a0 And then individual countries are playing a role in that and will be playing a role in that, including by providing not only the immediate support to Ukraine, but also longer-term support so that, again, over time, Ukraine can fully build up its deterrent and defense capacity.\u00a0 We talked about all of that today.\u00a0 We of course have been engaged in that \u2013 in those discussions directly with Ukraine, other countries have as well, and I think you\u2019ll see a lot of that coming together in the weeks ahead.\u00a0\nBut the NATO piece of this is, as I said, strengthening the political relationship between Ukraine and NATO.\u00a0 I think the secretary general talked about some of the elements of that.\u00a0 But again, I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of the summit itself because, ultimately, these are decisions that the leaders have to make and finalize \u2013 but also, as I said, very practical support, including the work that NATO will do to help bring Ukraine fully up to NATO standards.\u00a0\nSo all of that will be coming forward in the next weeks.\u00a0 And as I said, my full expectation is there\u2019ll be a very strong package of support on both the political side and the practical side when the leaders get together in Vilnius.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0And the path towards NATO accession that the chairman mentioned, is that something that that was on the table today or that you could agreement on?\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0This was part of our discussion today, and I think we\u2019ll now have an opportunity, everyone will have an opportunity to discuss that back home with our respective leaders.\u00a0 And I fully anticipate that will be part of the conversation at Vilnius.\u00a0 But again, I\u2019m also confident the result in Vilnius will be a robust package of political and practical support for Ukraine.\nMR MILLER:\u00a0\u00a0Final question goes to Vilde Wikan with\u00a0Aftenposten.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, with increased tensions with Russia and Sweden and Finland joining NATO, has the Nordic region become more important for the United States?\u00a0 And can you elaborate a little bit on what the American Presence Post in Troms\u00f8 will entail?\u00a0 And can we also expect more American military presence in our area and in the High North?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, when it comes to Norway, when it comes to Finland, when it comes to Sweden, we of course have longstanding relationships, bilateral relationships, with all three countries that we very, very much appreciate.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019ve seen over the years we\u2019ve been working in a variety of ways with all three countries when it comes not just to security but to trying to deal with challenges both in Europe and in the region, but also well beyond, to include the Arctic but also to include global challenges \u2013 food security, energy security, global health, et cetera.\u00a0\nSo those partnerships have been vital for a long time.\u00a0 But now we have the development that Finland has joined Norway as a NATO Ally and Sweden will soon do the same thing.\u00a0 So that only enhances and strengthens the incredibly strong foundation that we\u2019ve had.\u00a0 For us, the Presence Post in Troms\u00f8 is really an ability to have a diplomatic footprint above the Arctic Circle, and as I said, it\u2019s the first one that we\u2019ve been able to have.\u00a0 Our entire approach is to make sure that the Arctic remains an area of peaceful cooperation.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the things that, especially in a world that is evermore challenged, that it\u2019s also evermore vital to preserve.\u00a0 And we\u2019re determined to do that.\nWe engage with indigenous peoples in the region.\u00a0 We\u2019re very focused, of course, with our partners on dealing with many of the challenges of climate change, natural resources, and, fundamentally, working together to make sure that the region remains peaceful.\u00a0 And I think having a diplomatic presence further north will only enable \u2013 further enable and enhance those efforts.\nBut again, when it comes to the three countries, we\u2019re building on a base of very strong bilateral partnerships and soon having all three as Allies in NATO.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks very much.\n\n\n[1]\u00a0Baltic Sea\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-nato-secretary-general-jens-stoltenberg-after-their-meeting/", "title":

So we don\u2019t have much time.\u00a0 We\u2019ll jump directly into the questions, so who wants to start?\u00a0 Yes, please, go ahead, Johan.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to start off with asking each one of you to make a brief statement about the outcome of this meeting.\u00a0 And Mr. Secretary Blinken, could I have your comment on whether you find it troublesome that European Union and the U.S. have slightly different approaches in terms of trading with China?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, happy to start.\u00a0 Briefly, also picking up on that, first, this is now the fourth meeting of the Trade and Technology Council between the United States and the European Union.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve demonstrated throughout that we are focused on and actually making progress on addressing the most urgent challenges that our countries face, and doing it in a very collaborative and productive way.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been focused on building sustainable, resilient, diversified supply chains, something we know, after COVID, is particularly critical.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on collaborating \u2013 on making sure that critical minerals, which will be powering our economies going forward, are readily available and that we\u2019re collaborating on sharing information and working together to invest in them.\nWe have remarkable convergence, actually, when it comes to our approach on the major challenges we face, whether it\u2019s dealing with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, including some of the export controls that we\u2019ve collaborated on, including dealing with some of the challenges posed by China.\u00a0 And again, from our conversations and discussions, the word that comes to mind most is convergence.\u00a0 Together we\u2019ve been working on things like investment screening mechanisms, on coordinating, on export controls, on working, as I said, on diversifying supply chains, on dealing with some of nonmarket practices that we see.\nBut we start from exactly the same approach, which is that none of us are looking for confrontation, none of us are looking for a Cold War, and none of us are looking for decoupling.\u00a0 On the contrary, we all benefit from trade and investment with China.\u00a0 But, as opposed to decoupling, we are focused on de-risking.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve heard the same language coming from leaders on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 that is, being very clear-eyed about some of the challenges the relationship poses.\u00a0 And the TTC, in a very practical way, is focused on addressing them, and I think you\u2019ll see that in the conclusions of this meeting as well as the work that we\u2019re doing.\nFinally, I would say, and I\u2019ll let my colleagues address this as well, we\u2019re intensely focused on what we can do together to address both the opportunities and challenges posed by emerging technology.\u00a0 We had a very intensive and, I think, productive discussion on artificial intelligence today, including generative AI.\u00a0 I think we share a conviction that the TTC has an important role to play in helping establish voluntary codes of conduct that would be open to all likeminded countries, particularly because there\u2019s almost always a gap when new technologies emerge between the time at which those technologies emerge and have an impact on people and the time it takes for governments and institutions to figure out how to legislate or regulate about them.\nAnd we feel the fierce urgency of now, particularly when it comes to generative AI.\u00a0 And so \u2013 and I\u2019ll let my colleagues address this as well \u2013 one of the things we focused our conversation on today is how we can use the TTC to help advance, at least in the near term, voluntary codes of conduct that need to be open to a wide universe of countries so that we can mitigate some of the potential downsides and amplify the upsides of this extraordinary technology.\nMS VESTAGER:\u00a0 Maybe just to start off with a question of trades, in the European Union we\u2019re in the process of establishing an economic security strategy.\u00a0 The commission will table our approach mid-June for the European Council to discuss.\u00a0 And I think we see very much eye to eye on a number of these issues.\u00a0 For instance, when it comes to coercion, we have the anti-coercion instrument.\u00a0 This, of course, is part of the strategy, as well as export controls, so that we can, indeed, identify risks, deal with them, and then trade for the rest of it.\nImportant results: protecting children, minors, online \u2013 really important that we know that they are safe, but also that they are empowered.\u00a0 And I think we got a very good balance, because of course kids will be online, but they should be safe from harm.\u00a0 They should be safe from targeted advertising, and here we made a lot of progress.\nOn enabling researchers to get the necessary data to follow what is ongoing, we think that we can have the specifics already by Christmastime now we have the agreement in principle.\nAnd as of now, we need accountable artificial intelligence.\u00a0 Generative AI is a complete gamechanger.\u00a0 Of course we have had AI now for a very long time.\u00a0 It is used in many, many places.\u00a0 But generative AI is something new.\u00a0 You have had it at your fingertips.\u00a0 You\u2019ve seen colleagues using it for writing their articles.\u00a0 You have seen other colleagues using it for their research.\u00a0 Everyone knows that this is a powerful thing.\nSo within the next weeks we will advance a draft of an AI code of conduct, of course, also taking industry input, taking input from independents, and then, of course, invite colleagues to sign up for the drafting in order to have very, very soon a final proposal for a code of conduct for industry to commit to voluntarily.\u00a0 Because we have different legislative procedures, it will take two, three years at best before that would come into effect, and we\u2019re talking about a technological acceleration that is beyond belief.\u00a0 And here we think it\u2019s really important that citizens can see that democracies can deliver \u2013 of course, in legislation, but also in bridging the now and the legislative impact, and to do that in the broadest possible circle with our friends in Canada, in the UK, in Japan, in India, bringing as many on board as possible.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 The only thing that I would add, very briefly and in answer to your question about China, is to pick up on Secretary Blinken\u2019s comment of convergence.\u00a0 And the reason there\u2019s convergence is because our interests are aligned.\u00a0 Of course, the EU and the member-states will have to make their own decisions, as will the United States, as to what\u2019s in their best interest.\u00a0 But spending two days talking to our colleagues here, our interests are aligned as it relates to China, as it relates to having safeguards around AI, as it relates to promoting responsible innovation.\nAnd so I thought this was a very productive couple of days, one of the most \u2013 it\u2019s our fourth.\u00a0 Not surprisingly, as we all get to know each other a little bit better, develop even more trust, I think it\u2019s been among the most productive and some of the richest discussions.\u00a0 And I have no doubt that what will follow from this meeting will be some really concrete outcomes around responsible safeguards for artificial intelligence, better coordination around semiconductors and our semiconductor strategy, and just general convergence as we realize our interests are aligned and we continue to work together.\nMR DOMBROVSKIS:\u00a0 Well, on the trade side, I would emphasize our discussions on transatlantic initiatives on sustainable trade.\u00a0 And the concrete deliverable in this TTC is that we have agreed on a concrete work program to focus on and to really generally work towards this green transatlantic marketplace.\nWe just finished our stakeholders event, and it must be said that this message was coming also very clearly from the stakeholders, that they are expecting us to work together on the green transition.\u00a0 And we also agreed to instill new energy in our work on trade-facilitating measures, to look how we can advance in areas like conformity assessment, use of these tools for trade facilitation, and other steps in this area.\nThen we had extensive discussions on economic security.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken already mentioned our work on export controls, where our cooperation in TTC helped quite a bit, including to be able to quickly move on our export controls against Russia in context of its aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a broader question.\u00a0 We were also discussing economic coercion concerns coming from nonmarket economies and practices because we share many of those concerns.\u00a0 So obviously we need to discuss and coordinate our approaches, because then we are more efficient in our response.\u00a0 Thank you.\nAMBASSADOR TAI:\u00a0 And finally, I don\u2019t think I know you, so I suspect you\u2019re not a trade reporter.\u00a0 The only reason why I suspect you\u2019re not a trade reporter is because the way you put your question, I think, reveals that if you cover trade you will know that the U.S. and the EU have slightly \u2013 and more than slightly \u2013 different approaches to trade just across the board.\u00a0 And that is just an aspect of who we are, and it\u2019s always been true.\nBut that hasn\u2019t gotten in the way of our being powerfully influential partners in building the post-World War II economic world order.\u00a0 And at this point in time as well, this inflection point that President Biden identifies, it is not going to stop us.\u00a0 In fact, we will continue to build on that partnership to drive a new world economic order that drives a race to the top, that really takes our shared vision and values for the kind of world that we want our workers, our people, our children, our businesses to be able to thrive in.\u00a0 And I think that the TTC is a perfect manifestation of that vision at work.\nMS VESTAGER:\u00a0 Can I \u2013 just I\u2019m \u2013 because this is \u2013 we\u2019re all looking for proof of concept of the TTC.\u00a0 And the charger is proof of concept, because we now have a common standard for the mega-charging.\u00a0 So heavy-duty electrical vehicles \u2013 now we have the charging standards ready for infrastructure rollout here in Europe, over in the U.S.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very tangible, and we\u2019ve been addressing the question of standards from the very first TTC, and now you see that it\u2019s really working.\nAnd one of the reasons why it\u2019s really working is that we have the stakeholder community to support us, to challenge us, to ask us to be relevant for them and for their business on both sides of the Atlantic, and for the NGO community for the social partners, actually, to give us the necessary input.\u00a0 And I think that has been very, very true at this TTC as well.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 That was a long question, so we don\u2019t have much time left.\u00a0 If you allow, one last question.\u00a0 Yes, okay.\u00a0 Missy, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Missy Ryan,\u00a0Washington Post.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I\u2019d like to ask you a question about U.S.-China relations.\u00a0 And Secretary Raimondo and Ambassador Tai, if you want to add anything from where you sit, too, that would be great.\u00a0 But Secretary Blinken, the Pentagon issued a statement yesterday about what it said was a dangerous interaction between a U.S. jet and Chinese military plane, the second in six months.\u00a0 China has also lashed out at the United States over reports that it had rebuffed requests for meetings with Secretary Austin.\u00a0 And there have been a series of mutual accusations regarding commercial and trade practices in the last week.\nHow do you see all of this in the context of the Biden administration\u2019s hope for getting the bilateral relationship back in a better place, potentially rescheduling your visit?\u00a0 And more generally, how do you do the cooperate piece of your compete, cooperate, contest strategy when these things keep happening?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Missy.\u00a0 First, with regard to the planes, our planes were flying in international airspace on a routine mission.\u00a0 The Chinese pilot took dangerous action in approaching the plane very, very closely.\u00a0 There have been a series of these actions directed not just at us but at other countries in recent months.\nBut I think it only underscores why it is so important that we have regular, open lines of communication, including \u2013 by the way \u2013 between our defense ministers.\u00a0 It\u2019s regrettable that the meeting that Secretary Austin sought did not go forward with his Chinese counterpart.\u00a0 But for us, for President Biden, this underscores why it\u2019s so important that across the government, at the most senior levels, we are regularly engaged.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what President Biden sought to do when he met with President Xi Jinping in Bali last year and what they agreed to do and what we hope that we can back to, because it\u2019s clearly in the interest of both countries.\nThe most dangerous thing is not to communicate and, as a result, to have a misunderstanding, a miscommunication.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve said repeatedly, while we have a real competition with China, we also want to make sure that doesn\u2019t veer into conflict.\u00a0 And the most important starting point for that are regular lines of communication.\u00a0 It\u2019s also, by the way, what I think the world is looking for us to do.\nWhat I hear around the world is countries looking to the United States, Europe, China to manage the relationship that we have responsibly, and we very much seek to do that.\u00a0 We hope our Chinese counterparts will want to do the same so that, at the very least, we can avoid any unnecessary problems and, yes, hopefully build areas of cooperation where it\u2019s in our mutual interest \u2013 and where there\u2019s a demand signal as well from the world \u2013 that we work together.\u00a0 Some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about through the TTC would require, as well, cooperation and collaboration with China as well as with other major countries.\u00a0 We look to do that, and we hope we\u2019ll be able to proceed.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I would just add to that point of opening a dialogue.\u00a0 I had a productive meeting Thursday of last week in person with Minister Wang, the commerce secretary, who came to D.C.\u00a0 And it was a candid, direct, productive exchange where we tackled head on some of our issues related to economic coercion and other irritants, but also where we agreed to keep the channel of communication open in the hope that increased dialogue would lead to de-escalation of tension and an ability to solve problems.\nAMBASSADOR TAI:\u00a0\u00a0And I\u2019d like to recenter the conversation here at the TTC on the U.S. and EU relationship, speaking of channels of communication and how important it is to a vibrant bilateral relationship.\u00a0 Valdis and I committed to each other at the beginning of this year that, to keep the global steel and aluminum arrangement negotiations on track, that we would meet every month this year to ensure that our teams are on track to produce.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve kept that promise.\u00a0 And in fact, I just wanted to preview for you, Valdis and I are not just seeing each other this week here in Sweden.\u00a0 We will be seeing each other next week as well in person.\u00a0 And I just want to underscore the ambition that underlies this relationship across all the areas that you see represented by the different principals on the stage right now.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Unfortunately, we have to conclude because there is no time left.\u00a0 Thank you everybody for being here, and thank you to the principals for a very successful meeting today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-fourth-u-s-eu-trade-and-technology-council-stakeholders-engagement/", "title":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Lule\u00e5 Culture House", "location": "Lule\u00e5, Sweden", "date": "May 31, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 At the risk of repetition, I think you\u2019ll hear me in violent agreement with my friends and colleagues.\u00a0 But the first thing I want to say is this: It is so critical to us that not only are we having this stakeholders meeting, but that everything we do is infused with the views, the perspectives, the experience of stakeholders.\u00a0 It\u2019s a critical part of the TTC.\nOne of the things I think we\u2019ve learned \u2013 those of us who have been in government for some time now, including myself \u2013 is that more than ever before if we do not have stakeholders with us on the takeoff of every big issue, they\u2019re probably not going to be there on the landing, and what we do is not going to be sustainable.\u00a0 So we place tremendous value on having all of you here \u2013 but not just today, every day \u2013 as we\u2019re working through these challenges.\u00a0 And whether you traveled here in person, whether you\u2019re actually with us virtually today in some fashion, or many who are sharing their views in writing, thank you, thank you, thank you.\u00a0 Because it\u2019s an integral part of this process that we\u2019ve established.\nAnd I also want to give a special shoutout to the students among us here today.\u00a0 It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to say that what we\u2019re doing, what we\u2019re working on, will shape the future that you inherit, but there\u2019s another part of that, which is you need \u2013 and we\u2019re counting on you \u2013 to help us do that shaping.\u00a0 This is not simply something that we\u2019re doing now but we\u2019re eventually going to hand off to you.\u00a0 It\u2019s vitally important that your voices, your views, your perspectives be included.\u00a0 By definition, every new generation has a new way at looking at the challenges that any \u2013 that we\u2019re facing at any particular time and none of us have the monopoly on ideas, never mind good ideas.\u00a0 So your engagement\u2019s critical.\u00a0 And again, it\u2019s not just thinking about the future; it\u2019s actual the present, the now, where we really want that engagement.\nWorking together I think we share the same objective and that is to build a clean infrastructure and develop clean technologies for the future.\u00a0 This has the obvious imperative of addressing the climate challenge.\u00a0 It also \u2013 I think we\u2019re convinced \u2013 has the tremendous benefit of actually building new economies for the future that are going to be, or certainly can be, powerfully beneficial to all of the constituent elements of those economies, whether it\u2019s our workforce, whether it\u2019s our companies, whether it\u2019s our societies as a whole.\u00a0 Now, none of this happens automatically, none of it\u2019s easy, and we know that there are huge challenges in getting from here to there.\u00a0 But we\u2019re equally convinced that if we are able to do this together, we actually can succeed and can do this effectively.\nSome of us just came from a G7 meeting a few weeks ago, where on one level the good news is that the G7 countries, if you look at them, have each made commitments that, if fulfilled \u2013 and that\u2019s a big if \u2013 would keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the sort of good news.\u00a0 The less good news is the same cannot be said of the G20 and the same cannot be said if you go out even beyond the G20.\u00a0 So even in just making sure that we have the appropriate ambitions, again, the G7 is in a pretty good place, but we need to build out from there and that was some of the work that we actually were doing at the G7.\nSo we have a shared goal.\u00a0 We need to make sure that everyone is adapting and adopting the plans necessary to reach it, but then of course that\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 We actually have to implement it, and that\u2019s really where we know the challenge lies.\u00a0 But again, I think if we\u2019re able to not only have the vision necessary but actually convince all of our constituents that we can \u2013 all of us \u2013 wind up in a better place, we can get there.\nThe governments and private sectors have an enormous challenge in actually advancing a fair and efficient clean energy transition at the scale and pace that\u2019s needed to achieve the goals.\u00a0 So it is bringing us up to scale and then, of course, it\u2019s moving quickly on.\u00a0 We all know that the decisions and the actions that we take over the next seven years, the remainder of this decade, are going to determine whether or not we\u2019re able to reach the goals that many of us have set for halfway through the century \u2013 2050.\nOne other thing I just wanted to emphasize \u2013 and it\u2019s something that Valdis and Katherine also touched on \u2013 when we\u2019re looking at this question of fairness, we want to ensure not only a level playing field\u00a0\u2013 as vital and as important as that is \u2013 we\u2019re also working through the TTC, including \u2013 for example, via the semiconductor early warning system that we\u2019ve established through the Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue that you\u2019ve heard alluded to \u2013 to try to build sustainable, resilient supply chains that are free, for example, from forced labor, and immune from economic coercion.\u00a0 Those are vital aspects of the future, too, and we have strong constituencies that are insisting that we move in that direction.\nWe also use the TTC to actually elevate environmental, social, and government standards as we build diverse, sustainable, and secure supply chains.\u00a0 Ultimately what we\u2019re about, if we do things right, is creating a race to the top, not a race to the bottom.\u00a0 And if it\u2019s a race to the top that everyone participates in, no matter where they\u2019re from, no matter which country they are, that\u2019s a good thing, and that\u2019s what we want to encourage.\nAs you heard Valdis say as well, it\u2019s so vitally important that we coordinate together through the TTC to make sure that, for example, some of the incentives that we\u2019re putting in place to create that race to the top are properly coordinated and don\u2019t actually inadvertently create some kind of zero sum game race to the bottom.\u00a0 On both sides of the Atlantic, we have now unleashed incredibly powerful incentives to try to drive innovation and complement and spur private sector investment, but we\u2019ve got to do it in a way, again, that is complementary.\u00a0 So the incentives dialogue that we\u2019ve established that was announced by President Biden and Commission President von der Leyen back in March not only ensures that the incentive programs are mutually reinforcing but it also facilitates sharing information and also joint action to address the non-market practices that some are engaged in, including China.\nFinally, all of this is very resource intensive, but money is not the only challenge that we face.\u00a0 There are other issues that are vitally important that we discussed, all of us together, that are obstacles in the way of faster deployment of clean technology at a scale, so that we can actually make a difference.\u00a0 Developing new clean technologies like solid-state batteries of the future, hydrogen and other clean fuels, carbon-capture technologies \u2013 all of these require a whole ecosystem of support beyond simply the financial resources or subsidies that may come along.\u00a0 Creating the technological industrial base on both sides of the Atlantic requires all of us to engage, to do more, and especially to listen to each other, to make the necessary adjustments.\u00a0 Because some of this, it\u2019s so new that there\u2019s trial and error involved.\u00a0 It\u2019s iterative, and we\u2019re going to make mistakes.\u00a0 We have to adjust it.\nAnd we\u2019re taking big bets on ultimately our most important asset, and that\u2019s the innovators and investors, some of whom are in the audience today, who are really fundamentally going to drive all of this progress.\u00a0 Governments, ultimately, I think have to be about facilitating, catalyzing, sometimes simply getting out of the way, as well as making sure that, to the best of our ability, the standards that we set for ourselves that society ultimately wants and demands, that we\u2019re safeguarding those as well.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a challenging balancing act.\nSo again, I\u2019m really grateful for the fact that we brought everyone here together.\u00a0 I want to thank you for kicking us off.\u00a0 And I think most of us are just eager to listen to our colleagues.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-swedish-prime-minister-ulf-kristersson-at-a-joint-press-availability/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson at a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Lule\u00e5 Military Airbase", "location": "Lule\u00e5, Sweden", "date": "May 30, 2023", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Most welcome to this press conference, and most welcome to Lule\u00e5, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0\u00a0 Lule\u00e5 is the place.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0 Right now, we are, as we all know, at F 21, an air force wing in northern Sweden, and while we are here, the Arctic Challenge Exercise, the ACE, is taking place at F 21 as well.\u00a0 Both Swedish-made Gripen fighters and American-made F-16s can be seen operating in the air during the ACE.\nThe north of Sweden is geographically very important for the Swedish armed forces as it provides strategic depth for us and for our neighboring countries.\u00a0 The Russian border is actually a six-and-a-half-hour drive from here.\u00a0 Filling the territorial gap in the north will be one of Sweden\u2019s many security contributions to NATO when we join the Alliance.\nOn that note, let me express my deep appreciation for the United States support for Sweden\u2019s NATO accession.\u00a0 That means a lot to us.\u00a0 We have applied for NATO membership because we realize we need to defend freedom and democracy together, but also because we want to bring our own capabilities to common use.\u00a0 As a member, Sweden will be a security provider to the entire Alliance.\nDuring our meeting, the Secretary and I have, of course, discussed the most acute security threat to our part of the world, Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 For Sweden and for the Swedish EU presidency, supporting Ukraine is a top priority.\u00a0 I\u2019m very grateful for and impressed by the strong U.S. commitment and the U.S. leadership of this big operation.\u00a0 It really proves the importance of transatlantic cooperation.\nWe also discussed the challenges and opportunities from new technology, issues that also will be discussed between the EU and the U.S. in the Trade and Technology Council taking place in Lule\u00e5 today and tomorrow.\u00a0 Green transition, innovation, and the tech industry, including 6G, are areas where two nations like Sweden and the U.S. have very many common interests, and common concerns as well, and we should and we could work even closer together.\nIn northern Sweden, we show in practice how innovation and growth and green transition can go hand-in-hand.\u00a0 Here Sweden has unique natural resources, rare earth metals, and by tradition, cheap, reliable, and fossil-free electricity, not least thanks to hydro power.\nIn January this year, it was announced that Europe\u2019s largest deposit for rare earth metals is in Kiruna, just some 350 kilometers from here.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty close, if you ask the locals.\u00a0 And it shows that Sweden has a bright future as a mining nation \u2013 increasingly important, again, for the green transition.\nI\u2019m happy to conclude that the relations between Sweden and the United States are very strong, with plenty of potential for deepening cooperation both as bilateral partners and as future NATO Allies.\nOver to you, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, Prime Minister, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you for the very, very good meeting that we had.\u00a0 Thank you for your wonderful hospitality here.\u00a0 I am grateful to be here to be with you and also our colleagues from the European Union as we engage in the fourth round of the Trade and Technology Council meetings that will start, actually, tonight with dinner, but then in full force tomorrow.\nBut we\u2019re in Sweden, and then on to Norway and to Finland, at a critical time for our countries and our people \u2013 a time of historic strategic convergence between the United States and partners across Europe.\u00a0 And I think \u2013 without speaking for you, Prime Minister, I think we both have that shared assessment of this convergence on the most important issues of our time.\nThe United States and Sweden are working more closely together than ever on a wide variety of shared interests: Ukraine, Sweden\u2019s NATO accession, our bilateral security partnership, and indeed, here in Lule\u00e5, as you heard, Sweden just hosted the Arctic Challenge Exercise 23, joined by the United States and NATO; the climate crisis, where Sweden is a leading partner in the First Movers Coalition, something we saw firsthand today; and our efforts to ensure that the Arctic remains a region free from conflict, where nations act responsibly and in accordance with international law, and economic development and investment take place in a sustainable, secure, and transparent manner.\nTomorrow, as noted, we are going to build on the progress that we\u2019ve made as the Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, the U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, and I join our European Union counterparts for the fourth meeting of the U.S.-EU TTC, the Trade and Technology Council.\u00a0 It is very fitting that we meet here in Lule\u00e5.\u00a0 This city is a model for so much of the work that we\u2019ve been doing and we\u2019ve been focused on through the TTC, from eliminating emissions in carbon-intensive industries to reducing our dependencies on unreliable or autocratic countries for the minerals that are used for products essential to our prosperity and security.\nOver the past two years, the TTC has enabled the United States and the European Union, which together make up nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s GDP, to align and shape a collective, affirmative economic and technological future that advances the values that we share, that bolsters our competitiveness, and that delivers tangible results for the people that we represent on both sides of the Atlantic.\nAt tomorrow\u2019s meeting, we\u2019ll focus on how to ensure that new and emerging technologies \u2013 as you heard from the prime minister \u2013 like AI, like quantum, like 6G enhance our competitive edge, benefit our citizens, and uphold democratic principles. \u00a0We\u2019ll continue to work on our supply chains and on accelerating the green transition, a great example of which we saw earlier today.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also discuss our joint efforts to address economic coercion and non-market economic policies and practices.\nThe work that we\u2019ve done over the past two years, including on export controls, has been critical to our efforts to ensure that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine remains a strategic failure.\u00a0 Tomorrow, we\u2019ll announce new actions that build on the export controls on the technology that\u2019s found in Iranian drones used to target Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure, to counter Russian misinformation and disinformation, to protect human rights defenders online.\nThen Foreign Minister Billstr\u00f6m and I will both travel to Oslo for the NATO Foreign Ministers meeting.\u00a0 As we prepare for the Leaders\u2019 Summit in Vilnius, we\u2019re continuing to make sure that our Alliance is stronger, more united, and better positioned to navigate a changing environment \u2013 from Putin\u2019s aggression in Europe, to the PRC challenge, to risks in space and cyberspace.\nSweden again and again has proven its commitment to NATO \u2013 to its values, to its mission, to its members.\u00a0 A strong, vibrant democracy with highly capable forces that have been working shoulder-to-shoulder with NATO members for years, for decades, it is fully dedicated to upholding the commitments that underpin our Alliance, including Article 5.\nBy joining NATO, Sweden undertakes a commitment to the security of every other Ally.\u00a0 No one should doubt that commitment, and, of course, every other Ally will be committed to Sweden\u2019s security.\u00a0 We will continue to work to complete Sweden\u2019s accession by the time our leaders gather in Vilnius for the NATO Summit.\nJust days after President Putin invaded Ukraine, Sweden moved swiftly to provide assistance \u2013 the first time it\u2019s delivered lethal assistance since it came to Finland\u2019s aid in the Winter War going back to 1939.\u00a0 Sweden has provided approximately $2 billion in military, humanitarian, and economic support to Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s welcomed nearly 50,000 refugees from Ukraine, providing pathways not only to have access to public services but also to work, to study, which they want to do so they can contribute to their communities here and, ultimately, to their communities back home in Ukraine.\nAnd in its role as EU \u2013 president of the Council of the EU, Sweden has overseen the EU\u2019s 10th sanctions package, launched on the one-year anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion.\u00a0 It\u2019s also overseen a landmark agreement to jointly procure ammunition for Ukraine and has set up a process to investigate how frozen Russian assets can be used to rebuild the country.\nSo, Mr. Prime Minister, on so many fronts, as we were discussing, in challenging times, the most important thing is to have close allies, close partners, close friends.\u00a0 The United States could not ask for a closer partner and friend and, soon, closer Ally than Sweden.\nThank you.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you, and we\u2019ll open up for a few questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with the Swedish television, Johan Pisoni.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary Blinken, what do you make of the fact that there are still two countries blocking the Swedish NATO application?\u00a0 And is the U.S. willing to add more pressure to these countries in order to speed up the process?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So the accession process is just that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a process.\u00a0 And in fact, if you look at this in historic terms, it\u2019s removed \u2013 it\u2019s moved remarkably rapidly with Finland\u2019s accession and, very soon, Sweden\u2019s accession.\u00a0 Through that process, individual members of the Alliance can bring up issues of concern to them, and, of course, T\u00fcrkiye has done that over the last months.\u00a0 And I think it has rightly focused attention on some of its security concerns that both Sweden and Finland have taken remarkable steps to address, important ones.\nSo I think it\u2019s to T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s credit that it\u2019s been able to focus all of the Alliance on some of these concerns, but it\u2019s to Sweden\u2019s credit as well as Finland\u2019s credit that they\u2019ve taken concrete action to address those concerns.\u00a0 From the perspective of the United States, the time is now to finalize Sweden\u2019s accession.\u00a0 Again, it\u2019s taken very significant steps to address very legitimate concerns, and I think in terms of its own qualifications for membership, from day one it was qualified precisely because it\u2019s been such a long-time partner for NATO; of course, the European Union; and with values that are fundamentally the same.\nSo we look forward to this process being completed in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 We have no doubt that it can be, and it should be, and we expect it to be.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Okay, next question goes to Missy Ryan.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Okay, hi.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Missy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019d also like to ask about the Sweden NATO accession issue.\u00a0 First, for you, Mr.\u00a0 Prime Minister, have you or any of your advisers been in touch with the Turkish Government since \u2013 with Erdogan or his team since the \u2013 his re-election?\u00a0 And do you have any indications that T\u00fcrkiye is now ready to approve Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO, or are they asking you to take additional steps?\u00a0 And I know your government has spoken extensively about the benefits that NATO accession will bring to both Sweden and NATO, but what do you think it says about NATO and its ability to provide a strong deterrent that one or two members of NATO have the ability to hold up the enlargement for over a year?\nAnd then for you, Mr. Secretary, President Biden yesterday suggested that there could be some sort of arrangement linking Turkish approval of the Swedish accession bid to the provision of F\u201116s to T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 Do you have any indications that T\u00fcrkiye will now relent on Sweden\u2019s NATO accession now that the election is over, and do you have any indications that key lawmakers in the United States will now support supplying T\u00fcrkiye with F-16s.\u00a0 And then also on the Turkish election, forgive me, given the track record of Erdogan\u2019s government regarding rule of law, democracy, and inclusivity, are you concerned that conditions around those things might deteriorate further in T\u00fcrkiye following the election since arguably he might see that as a valid \u2013 see the results of the election as a validation of his approach? \u00a0Thanks.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first, of course, obviously, we have had several contacts also after the election runoff last Sunday, so we have \u2013 we are in constant contact with our Turkish counterpart on this specific issue, of course.\u00a0 So \u2013 and just to reiterate what I\u2019ve said before, I mean, we have always known that \u2013 two things.\u00a0 One is we have a memorandum, we are fulfilling it, and the very final part of that is actually being put into force June 1st \u2013 that is the day after tomorrow \u2013 when the new piece of legislation, actually, in counterterrorism \u2013 and that is an important step.\u00a0 And thereby, we have done what we told the \u2013 our Turkish friends and within the framework of the trilateral memorandum \u2013 very, very important.\u00a0 And we acknowledged the fact that they have good reasons to have had concerns on how other countries helped them to protect themselves.\nBut on the other side, or at the same time, we have always recognized the fact that every NATO Ally has to make its own decision, and only T\u00fcrkiye can make T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s decisions, and we fully respect that.\u00a0 So that\u2019s basically it.\u00a0 And now we wait for them to make their decision.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And Missy, to your question, first let me just say it is appropriate that every Ally have a clear say in the admission of new members or the accession of new members, because it comes down to Article 5.\u00a0 Each member is making a solemn commitment to every other member that it will join in coming to their defense if they are the victims of aggression.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s important that every member have its say in this process.\u00a0 And as I said earlier, by historic terms, this has moved remarkably rapidly, and we believe it needs to come to a conclusion now.\nWith regard to Sweden\u2019s accession and the F-16s, these are distinct issues.\u00a0 Both, though, are vital, in our judgment, to European security.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already been clear about why it\u2019s profoundly in the interest of the Alliance and the United States to have Sweden as a formal Ally in NATO.\u00a0 And as I said, we expect that process to be completed in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 But we know that our Alliance will be stronger and we will be better off when that process is finalized.\u00a0 And so we urge both T\u00fcrkiye and Hungary, which has also not yet ratified, to ratify the accession as quickly as possible.\u00a0 There is no reason for any further time; Sweden is ready now.\u00a0 That decision should be \u2013 should move forward now.\nWith regard to the F-16s, our administration has been very clear:\u00a0 We believe it\u2019s important that T\u00fcrkiye have the F-16s or the F-16 upgrades, as a critical member of the NATO Alliance, to make sure that they are operating at the highest standards of the Alliance, that they\u2019re fully interoperable with every other Ally.\u00a0 This, too, is in the interest of the United States, and it\u2019s why we brought this forward for consideration.\nIt\u2019s equally true that there are members of Congress who feel strongly, and while we are not linking the two issues \u2013 when I say we, I mean the Biden administration \u2013 some members of Congress are.\u00a0 They are linking Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO to the moving forward on the F\u201116s.\u00a0 Congress is a fully equal and independent branch of government.\u00a0 Their voice and their vote in any such decisions, of course, is critical.\u00a0 But from our perspective, we believe that both should go forward and should go forward as quickly as possible, that is to say, Sweden\u2019s accession and moving forward on the F-16 package.\u00a0 More broadly, as always, we\u2019re focused on the actions of any given government, of any given partner, not on hypotheticals about what they may or may not do in the future.\u00a0 We will remain focused on their actions.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 Next question goes to TT News Agency.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary, first of all, welcome to Sweden.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Just a follow-up on the NATO question.\u00a0 The NATO meeting in Vilnius is only six weeks away.\u00a0 What would you say the odds are, the chances are that you will see Sweden as a member of NATO before the meeting takes place?\u00a0 And sort of a follow-up on that, if the process will be further delayed, would that \u2013 what might \u2013 what might the consequences be for Sweden as well as for NATO?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a bet on this or are you thinking of putting something \u2013 (laughter) \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t have any inside information that I could or would share.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Look, as I said, we believe the time is now, and there is no reason for not moving forward and \u2013 as I said before.\u00a0 And as the prime minister has expressed very eloquently, T\u00fcrkiye has raised important and legitimate concerns.\u00a0 Sweden and Finland both addressed those concerns, and so the time to move forward is now.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to see that happen before the Vilnius Summit.\u00a0 But again, I can\u2019t put and won\u2019t put odds on it.\nWhat I can say is this:\u00a0 We and our Allies are both committed to and well-positioned to help Sweden address its security needs irrespective of whether accession happens tomorrow or in two weeks or in a few weeks after that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been clear that we will not tolerate any aggression against Sweden no matter its actual status.\nSecretary of Defense Austin was here recently, and I think he very clearly reaffirmed that point.\u00a0 We have a deep existing partnership that is literally being exercised, as the prime minister said, right now through Arctic Challenge 23.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s further evidence of the fact that we are working extremely closely together and as partners and, soon, formal Allies.\u00a0 We\u2019re ready for any contingency.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Great.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do a final question from\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 Kim.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\u00a0 Kim Mackrael from\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 For Secretary Blinken, can you speak to how close you think the U.S. and European approaches to China are right now?\u00a0 What do you hope to see from Europe in addressing concerns about non-market practices and export controls?\u00a0 And also, how big do you think the gap is between what the EU talks about in terms of de-risking and what is often referred to with the U.S. about decoupling with China?\u00a0 And sorry, if I can also put a question to the prime minster?\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s just one question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Just \u2013 for the prime minister \u2013 it\u2019s on the same topic.\u00a0 It seems there\u2019s significant debate from member-states over how to redefine Europe\u2019s relationship with China.\u00a0 So what\u2019s your view on the commission\u2019s proposal for outbound investment screening, and how likely do you think it is that member-states will see some agreement on moving forward with that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 So I think \u2013 and the prime minister and I had an opportunity to discuss this at some length \u2013 for both the United States and Europe, and indeed for countries in all parts of the world, the relationship with China is among the most consequential, is one of the most \u2013 as well as one of the most complex that we have.\nAnd we\u2019ve been very clear about what we\u2019re for and also what we\u2019re not for, and we are not looking for a new cold war.\u00a0 We are not looking to contain China.\u00a0 We are looking to make sure that we are upholding our interests and our values in that relationship and that we\u2019re managing it responsibly.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s a demand signal from countries around the world that both China and the United States manage the relationship responsibly, that we take every reasonable step to make sure that the competition that we\u2019re in does not veer into conflict.\nAnd one of the reasons that President Biden and President Xi agreed when they met in Bali last year to strengthen our lines of communication was precisely to that end, as well as seeing if, when it\u2019s in our mutual interest and in the interest of others, there are areas where we can actually strengthen cooperation.\u00a0 In my 30 years or so of doing this, I have not seen a time, actually, when there is greater convergence between the United States and Europe, as well as with key partners in Asia, on the approach to China.\u00a0 I think you see that reflected in what key leaders in Europe are saying, including just today, the prime minister discussing this issue \u2013 but I\u2019ll let him speak for himself \u2013 the work that we\u2019re doing with the EU through the Trade and Technology Council \u2013 the recent speech by President von der Leyen, which I think could very much have been an expression of our own policy.\nAnd when you look at it, I think what you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is that increasing convergence.\u00a0 Both the United States and Europe, I think, believe that, again, this relationship is an important one, one that we seek to sustain, but with our eyes wide open.\u00a0 And so both the United States and Europe are not in favor of decoupling, but we are in favor of de-risking.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve heard that from the leadership on both sides of the Atlantic.\nBut not only have you heard that, you\u2019ve actually seen that in practice through the Trade and Technology Council, as well as other work that we\u2019re doing with the European Union.\u00a0 You\u2019re seeing country after country put in place investment screening mechanisms, not for the purpose of stopping Chinese investment, but for making sure that in discrete areas, industries, companies, geographic areas where that investment could pose a challenge or \u2013 to our security, we have the appropriate mechanisms in place.\u00a0 We\u2019re now talking about, as well in very discrete ways, looking at outward investment to make sure that it\u2019s not going to support developments in China that could pose a threat to our security.\nWe\u2019re working more closely together than ever on building supply chain diversification and resilience, with the EU putting in place early warning systems to disruptions in the supply chain, as well as diversifying them.\u00a0 Again, we\u2019re coming together to do that.\u00a0 You see it as well in the collaboration that we\u2019ve had on export controls, not for the purpose of cutting off trade with or supplies to China of technology, but, again, in very discrete areas, where that technology may go to, for example, help China develop what is an opaque nuclear weapons program or other things that could pose a threat to our security or challenges to our values like surveillance technology.\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re taking appropriate measures there.\nAnd when it comes to nonmarket economic practices, there, too, the United States and Europe are increasingly aligned.\u00a0 And that\u2019s important because individually, if we\u2019re trying to get China to change some of the unfair practices that it\u2019s engaged in, the United States is about 20 percent of the world\u2019s economy; Europe\u2019s about 20 percent of the world\u2019s economy.\u00a0 When we combine and address these issues together, all of a sudden we\u2019re almost 50 percent of the world\u2019s economy, and that\u2019s a little bit harder for China to ignore when it comes to trying to change some of the practices they\u2019re engaged in.\nSo I think we\u2019re seeing that it\u2019s profoundly in the mutual interest of both Europe and the United States to be aligned in our approach, as it is for key countries in Asia.\u00a0 We just came from a G7 meeting where Japan and Korea were both present.\u00a0 I think you\u2019ve seen a similar alignment, a similar convergence, in the approach that we\u2019re taking to China there as well.\u00a0 And again, I refer you to the words of key leaders in Europe, as well as some of the key documents and strategies that Europe has put out.\u00a0 They are almost entirely coincident with our own approach.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0 Well, basically I very much agree with Secretary Blinken\u2019s kind of basic approach and \u2013 to this matter, very much so.\u00a0 And as you might know, the very final European Council meeting during the Swedish presidency will be, of course, as always, about Ukraine \u2013 always \u2013 but also on the key issue of relation to China.\u00a0 So that\u2019s our kind of final part we are preparing.\nIt happens to be \u2013 I just came to here from the Stockholm China Forum, the German Marshall Fund\u2019s annual meeting on China, and I gave \u2013 I tried to outline how we see the principal approach to \u2013 perhaps just two remarks.\u00a0 One is Europe needs to unite and stick to the unity on how to have a common approach to China.\u00a0 It is simply the fact that 27 countries need to stick together to have the clout and to have the power and (inaudible).\nAnd second, transatlantic cooperation is key in this area as well, I would say.\u00a0 And that has sometimes been questioned, as you know.\u00a0 And I would say that those now saying that \u2013 or asking themselves, does Europe need to choose, as it goes, between the U.S. and China, they simply ask themselves the wrong question.\u00a0 We should instead unite in a principally anchored idea on how an open world should act, how we reduce dependency, how we de-risk, regardless if China want to be de-risked or not, and try to be as open as possible, taking our own security concerns into account.\nI think the U.S. has been a few years ahead of Europe, but I think very many countries now realize this is not the time for naivete.\u00a0 It\u2019s not the time to stop communicating and cooperating with China either.\u00a0 Decoupling is not the answer, but to have a serious common approach to this matter I think would be.\nSo my short answer:\u00a0 Yeah, I think there is a beginning convergence going on, which I would appreciate very, very much.\u00a0 And if Sweden can be helpful in that process, I would be very proud of that.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Great.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you so much for everyone for coming.\nPRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}]
