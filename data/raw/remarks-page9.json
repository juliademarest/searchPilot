We have fought side by side on numerous battlefields because our way of life, our deeply held beliefs, and our democratic values were threatened.\n(In English) And most recently we\u2019ve decided, again, to stand together to help our Ukrainian friends defend themselves against the aggression of their neighbor.\u00a0 Vladimir Putin has demonstrated time and again that he will stop at nothing to consolidate his power and continue his war of aggression.\u00a0 As the fight continues, we must maintain or resolve to keep Ukrainians safe, armed, and \u2013 as winter approaches \u2013 warm.\n(In French via interpreter) Secretary Blinken and I also discussed the situation in Haiti.\u00a0 This is a thing we are very concerned about.\u00a0 We recently discussed the crises that Haiti is facing at the Summit of the OAS, and we\u2019ve worked together to deliver vehicles purchased by the Haitian Government for their police force.\u00a0 We currently have a team of Canadian officials on the ground in Haiti that are assessing the humanitarian security crisis and finding ways to resolve it.\u00a0 In the immediate term, we must see a humanitarian truce to restore the supply of fuel, water, and food.\u00a0 This will allow the Haitian people to meet their basic needs and allow hospitals to respond to the ongoing cholera outbreak.\nIt was also critical that we sanction that gangs that are fueling the violence on the island, and we both welcome the steps taken by the UN Security Council to impose sanctions.\u00a0 We must keep the pressure on.\u00a0 Canada will continue to monitor the situation closely, and we will help where we can and try to support Haitian led solutions.\n(In English) We had an opportunity to discuss the ongoing situation in Iran.\u00a0 Canada salutes all Iranian who are fighting against tyranny, and we stand with the women and girls who are bravely defying the regime.\u00a0 The message is simple: women rights are human rights.\u00a0 We have a moral obligation to support the brave women of Iran and hold those persecuting them accountable.\nSecretary Blinken and I also discussed our efforts to strengthen international peace and security, including through deepened engagement in the Indo\u2011Pacific region.\u00a0 The United States and Canada are indeed Pacific nations, but we are both connected to our Pacific partners through more than just our shared coastline.\u00a0 We are joined through deep people\u2011to\u2011people ties and a vision for a free, open, and inclusive Indo\u2011Pacific.\u00a0 We both believe in deepening our diplomatic and economic ties as well as strengthening the resiliency of our global supply chain.\nToday, we agreed to hold the first Canada-U.S. Strategic Dialogue on the Indo-Pacific to further align our approaches.\u00a0 And to further economic cooperation in the region, I am pleased to announce that Canada will seek membership to the Indo\u2011Pacific Economic Framework which is commonly known as IPEF.\nSecretary Blinken and I discussed the topic of Arctic security.\u00a0 As regimes with expansionist ambitions with little regard for the rules that govern international behavior are turning their eyes towards the north, we have a responsibility to ramp up our Arctic engagement.\u00a0 Of course, we welcome the United States\u2019 recent Arctic strategy, and I am glad to announce that Canada will host the next round of the Canada-U.S. Arctic Dialogue.\u00a0 There we will advance long term planning to deepen our already strong collaboration in the region.\n(In French via interpreter) The Arctic is undoubtedly the next big geopolitical issue, and Canada intends to be a leader on this issue.\u00a0 This is something we are doing for our security and to fight climate change, as well as to defend the rules that govern our states.\n(In English.) This week marks my first year as foreign minister of Canada.\u00a0 I had to hit the ground running.\u00a0 I would say sprinting.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sprinting.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Sprinting really.\u00a0 In that time we have the chance \u2013 we had the chance to see each other in Washington obviously, but at NATO, at the G7, at the G20, at the OAS, at the UN \u2013 basically around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to have you here.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Merci beaucoup.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0M\u00e9lanie, thank you so much for the incredibly warm reception, the wonderful hospitality, and also \u2013 and maybe most importantly \u2013 the very productive and important conversation that we had with our teams just a short while ago.\u00a0 And that will continue over the next couple of days.\n(In French via interpreter) I\u2019m really delighted to be in Canada.\n(In English) This is actually, I mentioned, my second visit to Canada in this capacity. The first one was a virtual visit in February of our first year.\u00a0 But as I\u2019ve said, nothing can substitute for actually being here in person.\nAs the foreign minister said, we were together in Washington just a few weeks ago.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been together in places all around the world, and I think it speaks \u2013 our own collaboration speaks to the closeness of the Canadian-U.S. relationship and the ground that we had to cover today, and as I said, that\u2019ll continue.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much ground, it just speaks to both the breadth of that relationship as well as the depth of the collaboration that we had.\u00a0 On virtually every issue that matters to our people, the United States and Canada are working together.\nWe discussed, as M\u00e9lanie said, our continued unwavering support for Ukraine as it faces this ongoing aggression from President Putin\u2019s Russia.\u00a0 We applaud Canada\u2019s recent announcement of more than $34 million in new military aid to Ukraine, including artillery, satellite communication services, and winter gear for the soldiers.\u00a0 Canada and the United States will continue working with dozens of partner nations to get Ukraine\u2019s brave defenders what they need to keep fighting for their territory seized by Russia and to keep fighting for their people, strengthening our position on the battlefield and ultimately at any negotiating table that emerges.\nCanada has also committed more than $320 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and welcomed more than 104,000 Ukrainians to Canada through an emergency visa program that allows Ukrainians to come here for up to three years, during which time they can work and their children can go to school and study.\u00a0 Communities from Newfoundland and Labrador to Yukon are supporting this effort, including members of the Ukrainian diaspora that I met earlier today at Caf\u00e9 Ukraine, a community center where volunteers are doing everything from organizing social gatherings and concerts to making newly-arrived families feel a little bit less isolated, helping them find jobs, providing even art therapy for trauma survivors \u2013 all of that for free.\nM\u00e9lanie and I were joined there by Deputy Prime Minister Freeland, whose mother, of course, was born to Ukrainian refugees at a U.S. Army-run refugee camp in Germany.\u00a0 The story of her family \u2013 like my own \u2013 is testament to the long history of people in our nations serving the countries that once provided them refuge.\nThe generosity toward displaced Ukrainians is part of a long tradition of Canadians opening their arms to people in need time and again.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done that with approximately 23,000 Afghan refugees since the Taliban takeover in August of 2021.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done that with more than a million refugees worldwide going back to the 1980s.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite remarkable and something that speaks volumes for Canada around the world.\nMany of the refugees are sponsored by families, by universities, by faith groups and other citizens through a private sponsorship program that Canada launched more than four decades ago that\u2019s helped more than 327,000 refugees build new lives in this country and become a model for the world.\u00a0 We are going to soon pilot a program in the United States very much like it, and it\u2019s been inspired by what Canada has done, where American communities are eager to play a similar role.\nIn addition to our assistance to Ukraine, Canada and the U.S. are also supporting our allies and partners across the Atlantic as they head into winter with heavy energy costs.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together through the G7, we\u2019re also doing it bilaterally, to help mitigate Russian-driven supply disruptions.\u00a0 And we\u2019re accelerating the transition toward renewable energy and away from the dependence on Russia and other unreliable governments.\nThe same goes for other vital inputs in our supply chains.\u00a0 From critical minerals to microchips, we need to be able to source and to make essential products closer to home.\u00a0 That will not only make us more reliable in delivering for our people, but also more competitive in the 21st century economy.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s tax credit for electric vehicles that are made in North America, which President Biden signed into law in August, and creates incentives for Americans to buy vehicles made in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\u00a0 Tomorrow, I am visiting a lithium battery recycling facility operated by the Canadian company Lithion, which is partnering with General Motors to increase our supply of batteries that power these vehicles, and also bring down their costs.\nThis is not a one-off.\u00a0 U.S.-Canada cooperation is deepening at every step of the battery value chain, from mining to production to recycling, benefitting communities on both sides of our border.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we saw in the recent announcement by Ontario-based company Li-Cycle that will invest $485 million in expanding a battery recycling facility in Rochester, New York, \u00a0creating over 200 good-paying jobs.\nThis cooperation is good for both our nations\u2019 competitiveness.\u00a0 It\u2019s good for Canadian and American workers.\u00a0 And it\u2019s good for our planet.\u00a0 And it\u2019s something we\u2019re aiming to replicate across other supply chains.\nThat\u2019s far from the only way that we\u2019re partnering to boost our competitiveness.\u00a0 Let me just mention quickly a couple of things, and we talked about these as well.\nWe will continue to work with Canada to advance the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, to drive our hemisphere\u2019s inclusive economic growth.\nAnd the foreign minister reiterated Canada\u2019s interest in joining the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 As you just heard, we support Canada \u2013 a fellow Pacific nation \u2013 joining this framework.\u00a0 In the coming months, we will consult closely with other IPEF members on the development of a process for considering new members, because it\u2019s not a decision the United States can make unilaterally, but we would welcome Canada\u2019s participation.\nM\u00e9lanie and I also discussed other parts of the world beyond Ukraine, where we\u2019re working together to tackle fundamental challenges to international law and to the United Nations Charter.\nWe\u2019re working together to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its vicious crackdown on brave young women who continue to come out into the streets to demand their rights, more than 40 days now after the killing of Mahsa Amini.\u00a0 We fully support the statement that Minister Joly and 11 other women foreign ministers from around the world issued condemning the regime\u2019s repression.\nThe Iranian regime has also provided the Kremlin with drones and assisted Russia in their use \u2013drones that are being used to kill Ukrainian civilians and destroy the infrastructure they rely on for electricity, for water, for heat.\u00a0 It\u2019s appalling, and Canada and the United States will keep working with our allies and partners to expose, to deter, and to counter Iran\u2019s provision of these weapons.\nWe support Canada\u2019s efforts to rally countries around the world in ending the unlawful practice of detaining innocent individuals and using them as political pawns.\u00a0 Both of our countries have suffered from this.\u00a0 We\u2019re working and we will be acting together to deal with it.\nAnd we talked about shared challenges in our region, including in Haiti, as you heard from M\u00e9lanie.\u00a0 We agree that between deepening food and fuel shortages, the growing cholera outbreak, and gangs blockading ports and terrorizing civilians, the situation is simply unsustainable.\nWe appreciate Canada\u2019s leadership in creating the UN Basket Fund to strengthen citizen security and law enforcement, and in airlifting vital security-related equipment to the Haitian Government last week \u2013 efforts in which the United States has been a proud partner.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to work together to rally international support around helping the Haitian people find a way forward \u2013 from the sanctions adopted unanimously last week by the Security Council against the leaders of gangs and the patrons that direct and profit from them, to other measures aimed at improving security for Haitians.\nAs fellow Arctic nations, as M\u00e9lanie mentioned, and shared stewards of the North American Arctic, we see how climate change is rapidly transforming the region.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re working together to create an Arctic that is more sustainable, peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative, as is reflected in the updated U.S. National Strategy for the Arctic Region that we recently released.\nSo we face a set of complex challenges.\u00a0 But we have the immense good fortune of having a neighbor in Canada that not only shares our interests, but our respect for human rights, our commitment to democracy, our belief that all our people should have equal opportunities to reach their full potential.\u00a0 It\u2019s why we make such a good team.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to taking our relationship and our cooperation to even higher levels.\nI simply couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner in Canada and I certainly could not ask for a better partner in its foreign minister, my friend and my colleague, M\u00e9lanie Joly.\u00a0 So thank you for having us here today.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Merci,\u00a0Tony.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\u00a0\u00a0(In French.)\u00a0 We\u2019ll now be beginning the question-and-answer session.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be taking two questions from Canadian media and two questions from American media.\u00a0 (In French.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 (In French) \u2013 I will ask in French \u2013 (in French).\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Madam Joly, the agreement on \u2013 the Safe Third Country Agreement \u2013 what do you have to say about that?\u00a0 And for Secretary Blinken, are you satisfied with the actual \u2013 with the current agreement?\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you, Christian.\u00a0 Obviously, border security is very important for us and we need to ensure that asylum seekers are treated with compassion.\u00a0 This is an issue that I discussed with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 We have a bilateral agreement on this issue.\u00a0 It is the Safe Third Country Agreement, and those negotiations are ongoing.\u00a0 Of course, our goal is to be able to cooperate with the U.S. on this issue.\n(In English) So indeed, the security at the border is extremely important and we need to make sure that asylum seekers are also dealt with compassion.\u00a0 It is a bilateral agreement that unites the U.S. and Canada on this very question.\u00a0 This issue was raised by me to Secretary Blinken and negotiations are underway, and we\u2019ll make sure that these negotiations are fruitful.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Little to add.\u00a0 As the foreign minister said, yes, this is something we discussed and we\u2019ll continue to discuss.\nLet me just say more broadly, to put this also in some perspective, we are facing a historic migration challenge around the world.\u00a0 We have more people on the move, displaced from their homes, than at any time in recorded history \u2013 more than a hundred million people now.\u00a0 And of course, in our own hemisphere, the hemisphere that we share, that\u2019s also very much the case.\u00a0 And whether it is Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Haitians, Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, we see people on the move throughout the hemisphere.\u00a0 And this is a challenge that has to be addressed and met by the countries of origin, the countries of transit, and the countries of destination.\u00a0 And we have to do it more effectively together.\nPut simply, there needs to be a greater sense of shared responsibility for dealing with migration challenges.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what came out of the Summit of the Americas with the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration.\u00a0 And Canada and the United States are helping to lead those efforts.\nSo across the board, this is something that we\u2019re working on very closely together, in all of its manifestations.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll work through any particular challenges that we have to.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Before I ask my second question, could you answer in French, perhaps?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 English, but \u2013 that\u2019s all right.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I think you have a great accent in French.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Christian, he doesn\u2019t have an accent in French.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, concerning NEXUS and the NEXUS pass, what do the U.S. and Canada need to do to get through that impasse?\u00a0 And Ms. Joly, what do you think of the possibility that some NEXUS officials might be armed at the border?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So NEXUS \u2013 this is something else that was discussed in our meeting and we\u2019re both determined to work through it.\u00a0 We both feel strongly that the most powerful bond we have is in the ability of Canadians and Americans alike to move back and forth to our respective countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s what connects us every single day.\nSo we\u2019re committed and determined to work through this.\u00a0 We want to see the backlog it\u2019s created be addressed.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working very hard ourselves, putting in additional personnel and resources in the United States to work through the backlog, and we want to and need to resolve this particular issue so that we can go at 100 percent, 110 percent, both to deal with the backlog and to make sure that we\u2019re doing everything possible to facilitate movement between our two countries.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So indeed, we need to make sure that Canadians that want to have access to a NEXUS card or used to have access to a NEXUS card and want it \u2013 want a new one are able to.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why we are looking actively at how to address the backlog and to address services being rendered, and meanwhile working on our own bilateral relationship when it comes to security at the border.\nSo we\u2019re in solution mode, and we\u2019ll find a solution.\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced.\n(Via interpreter) As the Secretary of State mentioned, we want to make sure that any Canadian who has a NEXUS card or who wants to renew one will be able to do so.\u00a0 We are working together to find solutions to deal with the backlog.\u00a0 What is the French word for that? \u00a0Arri\u00e9r\u00e9,\u00a0yes, the backlog.\u00a0 Thank you to the journalist for answering my question.\nIn any case, we\u2019re dealing with working on that backlog, reducing the backlog, and being able to provide services while pursuing our discussions on the issue of border security.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 We\u2019ll go to the next question, from American media this time around.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Leon Bruneau \u2013\u00a0bonjour \u2013 de\u00a0l\u2019Agence French-Presse.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Bonjour.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0American (inaudible).\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nA question for both of you.\u00a0 You said you talked about Haiti in your discussions.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of talk about potential setting up a security force, or some sort of security force, a police force with some military elements for Haiti.\u00a0 And at the same time \u2013 and I understand it\u2019s a very difficult situation, but at the same time, given past experiences, we don\u2019t see any country really standing up and willing to lead this force, if that is even a good idea, given that in Haiti it may not be so well accepted.\nSo my question for the Secretary is:\u00a0 First of all, do you think that this force, the idea of a force, security force, is a good idea?\u00a0 And who would lead that force, since the United States has said that they would not do so?\u00a0 You said you would support it but you would not lead it.\n(Via interpreter) And to you, Madam Minister, would Canada be ready to lead this force?\u00a0 And if yes, under which conditions?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 First, taking a step back on this as well, we have to look at the big \u2013 the big picture in Haiti and the challenges that the Haitian people face and that we need to help them address.\u00a0 And we know that between human-made and natural-made challenges, Haiti has more than its hands full.\u00a0 We now have a cholera outbreak, on top of everything else, that is very serious.\nBut in order to actually get to a place where we can genuinely help Haitians with the assistance that they need and also make sure that they can be on the path to elections to get to a new government over time, the knot that really has to be broken in the first instance is concerning security, because Haiti now faces a situation where gangs dominate important space in Port-au-Prince, the capital, as well as in other parts of Haiti, preventing assistance from getting through \u2013 everything from food and fuel and water \u2013 by blocking critical ports, critical fuel facilities, and also creating an environment in which people cannot move freely about, which would certainly make an election down the road impossible.\nSo our countries have been working very closely together to do a few things to try to cut this insecurity knot and deal with the gang problem.\u00a0 One is to support the Haitian National Police, including with equipment, with advice, and just recently, as you know, Canada provided armored vehicles to the Haitian National Police with our collaboration.\u00a0 At the same time, we are trying to break the nexus between these gangs and some of the political actors who are financing them and directing them, and that goes to the sanctions that were recently put forward at the United Nations as well as sanctions we\u2019re doing on our own basis to try to get at those who are supporting and directing the gangs.\nHaving said all that, I think it\u2019s a shared view that more likely needs to be done for the national police in support of them to allow them to get a real grip on security and to take back these parts of the capital that the gangs have been dominating.\u00a0 So there is now a second draft resolution in the works at the United Nations after the initial resolution on sanctions that would authorize a non-UN international assistance mission to improve the security situation and enable the flow of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Haiti.\u00a0 And so what we\u2019ve been talking about is what might that look like, what would it need, and we\u2019ve both been talking to a variety of countries to gauge their interest and willingness to participate in that.\nSo that\u2019s the conversation we\u2019re having, but I think we \u2013 and I appreciate very much the fact that Canada has just sent or announced that it\u2019s sending an assessment team to Haiti to look at what would actually be required in terms of supporting the police.\u00a0 But the purpose of any such mission would be to support the Haitian National Police in doing their jobs to make sure that the state once again actually controls the country, not gangs that right now are one of the biggest problems that we face in actually being able to move forward and help Haiti.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So to follow up on that, first and foremost, I think it\u2019s important to remind ourselves that Haiti is facing a triple crisis, the first one being a security crisis.\u00a0 The Varreux Terminal needs to be unblocked.\u00a0 It is fundamental that Haiti be able to supply itself with gas and as well as with clean water, because as Secretary Blinken mentioned, there is an outbreak of cholera right now.\u00a0 So the second also crisis that Haiti is facing is a humanitarian one, and we definitely need to support Haiti to make sure that \u2013 and bring the international community to support Haiti facing this important crisis.\nAnd finally I would say it is also of equal importance to address the political crisis, because there needs to be fair elections happening, and we need to make sure that the environment for these elections to happen is the right one.\u00a0 But to do that we need to address the security and humanitarian issue.\u00a0 So that is why Canada sent an assessment mission.\u00a0 I confirmed it this morning.\u00a0 The goal is to be able to have information coming from the team that is right now in Haiti on these three crises.\nWe\u2019ve said it many times:\u00a0 We will always support solutions that are by and for Haitians, because we believe in the fact that solutions are better when, of course, they\u2019re taken by them and that we support them.\u00a0 That is also why we\u2019re having conversations with the United States on this issue.\u00a0 That\u2019s also why I had a long conversation with the head of the African Union, who is in town, Moussa Faki, this morning about the issue, and also that I had conversations with my CARICOM colleagues, because we need to make sure that it is, yes, Canada and U.S. collaborating with the Haitians, but also with many other countries.\u00a0 At the end of the day we need to make sure that there is strong legitimacy for this approach, and Canada will always be there to support Haiti.\nI think one of the things that we haven\u2019t done, when it comes to Haiti in the past, over the decades of Canada being involved in Haiti, is really sanctioning the people that are at the core of the financing of these gangs, and we need to make sure that we have a strong approach when it comes to sanctioning.\u00a0 And we are working with the U.S., along our United Nations partners, because obviously this conversation is happening at the UN Security Council.\u00a0 There was an important resolution also that was \u2013 that was taken by the UN Security Council on sanctions, and particularly targeting the head of the gangs, which is a so-called \u201cBarbecue.\u201d\u00a0 And we want to make sure that Canada follows suit on this, but the conversation regarding sanction is well and alive, and we need to make sure that the people that are benefiting from the violence in the streets of Port-au-Prince are held accountable.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Our next question will be from Canadian media, and just a reminder that we request that your question be asked in a single interaction.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Mercedes Stephenson, Global News.\u00a0 Thank you for taking our questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and Minister Joly, you were just discussing Haiti.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering, Secretary Blinken, when you came here, if you were hoping for a commitment from Canada to lead this mission and if that is something you would still like to see.\u00a0 And Minister Joly, what the range of options are \u2013 because it will be partially determined by what we\u2019re capable of, which comes to my follow up.\nSecretary Blinken, how does the United States feel about Canada\u2019s current levels of defense and foreign affairs spending?\u00a0 We have a chief of defense staff who has said we can\u2019t do more than the essential.\u00a0 The Canadian Government announced $5 billion they said was new spending for NORAD.\u00a0 It turned out that was recycled.\u00a0 And we\u2019re under enormous pressure to be able to perform even the basic capabilities.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if that concerns the United States, and Minister Joly, if that\u2019s a frustration for you in trying to fulfill your job with Canada\u2019s (inaudible).\u00a0\u00a0Et en fran\u00e7ais,\u00a0as well, please.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Happy to start.\u00a0 So on Haiti, if you look at the draft resolution, that\u2019s before the Security Council right now, the second resolution, it is looking for and asking for countries to provide contributions and personnel of equipment, of other resources for a potential mission, one that would be very limited in scope, limited in time, and in support, as the foreign minister said, of the Haitian National Police, because the purpose is to reinforce their capacity to finally get a grip on the security situation and to deal with the problem of gangs dominating certain critical parts of Port-au-Prince in particular.\nSo we\u2019re talking between us, but also, as M\u00e9lanie said, with many other countries about who might be willing to participate in such a mission, as well as who will lead it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s an ongoing conversation that we\u2019re both having and having with others.\u00a0 So this is a work in progress and we\u2019re continuing to pursue it.\nWith regard to defense spending, I\u2019d say a couple of things.\u00a0 First, Canada\u2019s making extraordinary contributions every single day, particularly as we see with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and the work as well as the very important material support that Canada is providing to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves.\u00a0 And we just saw another significant provision of support, as well as very significant humanitarian assistance both in Ukraine itself, as well as, of course, all of the support that Canada is giving to so many Ukrainians who have come to Canada.\nMore broadly than that, though, we as allies have been working together in NATO for years to continue to strengthen our contributions to our common defense.\u00a0 We had the recent NATO Summit in which we\u2019re working closely on a new Strategic Concept, which will require resources.\u00a0 We have a common commitment that we\u2019ve made many years ago at the Wales Summit to spending a certain percentage of our GDP on defense for countries.\u00a0 This is a work in progress.\u00a0 We\u2019re all making efforts to meet both the commitment it was made in 2014, but also to take into account so much that has changed since 2014.\u00a0 And that requires us, I believe all, to do more to provide for our common security.\nWe took steps at NATO in the face of the Russian aggression to strengthen NATO itself, including on the eastern flank.\u00a0 Canada\u2019s played an important part of that.\u00a0 But I think as we\u2019re talking about this now, we\u2019re looking at new challenges that weren\u2019t even there in 2014 when we all made these commitments to NATO and to our defense spending.\u00a0 So I think we all have to find ways to resource them properly, and that\u2019s part of our conversation.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 So on Haiti, Mercedes, so we have provided $40 million since the beginning of this year for the Haitian police.\u00a0 And we historically have very much been involved in creating their training and really making sure to empower them on the ground.\u00a0 What we\u2019re seeing right now is there is more help needed and the Haitian police need to be able to handle the gangs, which is not the case at this point.\u00a0 And so that\u2019s why the assessment team is in Haiti right now to see what\u2019s the level of organization of the Haitian police and what\u2019s the security situation.\u00a0 What does the Haitian Government has in terms of tools to deal with the gangs that are funded?\nAnd so that is why we\u2019re looking at different options, but we want to make sure that we have the right assessment.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve said it many times \u2013 it needs to be by and for Haitians.\u00a0 So we will be working with Haitians themselves, and we need to work also with many countries around the world to deal with this issue.\nAnd so I think that Canada has always been a very, very good friend to Haiti.\u00a0 We have a strong relationship.\u00a0 Our police forces have strong relationship with Haiti also because they\u2019ve been there in the 19th, at the beginning of the 2000s, and we want to maintain them.\u00a0\u00a0 And more than ever, Haiti needs us.\u00a0 And so of course we will play a role.\nIn terms of military investments and being able to do my job, I think \u2013 looking back at the last year, I think it\u2019s been a very busy year.\u00a0 And I think that we can be proud of Canada\u2019s leadership in the world on many issues, from indeed Haiti but also looking at what we\u2019re doing to support women in Iran right now or, obviously, everything we\u2019ve done on the question of Ukraine.\u00a0 On the question of Ukraine, we\u2019ve spent and invested more than $3.5 billion at this point at all levels.\u00a0 We\u2019re one of the countries that is investing the most per capita.\nWe also are leading, like Tony said, on the eastern flank of Europe, the NATO Latvian forces.\u00a0 And I\u2019m coming up with an Indo-Pacific strategy, and the goal is definitely for Canada to play a bigger role in the region.\u00a0 But as you know, Minister Anand, our defense minister, has a defense policy review to undergo, and so I\u2019m convinced that she\u2019ll show great leadership on this issue.\nSo you want me to say that\u00a0en fran\u00e7ais?\u00a0 Okay.\n(Via interpreter) So, of course, when it comes to Haiti, we have long been involved in creating training for the Haitian police, including through their academy.\u00a0 And this is curricula that was developed through the \u201990s and the 2000s in Canada.\u00a0 Canada has long been a very close friend of Haiti, and our objective has always been to improve and deepen that friendship.\u00a0 No decision will be taken without the involvement of the Haitians themselves.\u00a0 I have always said any solutions must be by and for Haitians because, of course, this is all for them.\u00a0 It is the Haitian people who are suffering now, and they\u2019re the ones who need to be helped.\nWe\u2019ve worked with the Americans and other countries in the region to ensure that we deal with the humanitarian, economic, and political crises there.\u00a0 And something else that\u2019s quite important now is that there currently is an assessment mission there on the ground, and the goal of the mission is to understand what is the state of the police force in Haiti and what is the current security situation.\nWhen it comes to defense, well, we\u2019ve invested over $3.5 billion in the Ukraine crisis since the beginning of the year.\u00a0 We\u2019re also leading NATO forces in Lithuania, and we\u2019re starting to play a greater role in the Indo-Pacific as well.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and myself have had good discussions concerning defense investments, and Minister Anand is currently reviewing the national defense policy, so I\u2019m convinced that that will end in a solution.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(In French.)\u00a0 We\u2019ll now be taking our last question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, Jennifer Hansler from CNN.\u00a0 Thank you so much for taking our questions.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, President Putin today praised the Saudi crown prince and said Russia would look to deepen its relations with Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Will this factor into the U.S.\u2019s response to the OPEC decision?\u00a0 And when can we expect to see the first repercussions for that decision?\nAnd then to both of the ministers, Russia has suggested it could let the Black Sea grain deal expire.\u00a0 Are there any concessions that the U.S. and Canada would consider in order to facilitate the extension of that deal?\nAnd how specifically do you deter Iran from providing drones to Russia, and given the pace of these drone attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, are you confident that the U.S. and Canadian support can be robust and quick enough for Ukraine to keep its heat on and its critical services this winter?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Now would you ask it in French as well?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah, sadly only speak Spanish.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0(Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, one of the reasons that we were very disappointed in the OPEC+ and Saudi decision to decrease production was precisely because of the potential impact it would have on oil prices, not only affecting consumers in our respective countries but potentially lining President Putin pockets at the time when he continues to pursue the aggression against Ukraine \u2013 indeed, in many ways, doubling and tripling down on it with the mobilization, the annexation, the loose talk about nuclear weapons, and now the horrific assault on Ukraine\u2019s basic infrastructure: trying to turn the lights out, turn the power off, turn the heat off for the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 So anything that assists that is profoundly wrong and profoundly objectionable.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s worth noting that Saudi Arabia supported the resolution that came before the United Nations General Assembly, where 143 countries condemned the purported annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia.\u00a0 And just recently, Saudi Arabia came forward with, I believe, more than $400 million in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.\u00a0 Both very positive decisions that that we\u2019ve taken note of.\nAs we\u2019ve said, the relationship with Saudi Arabia has been built up over many years, many decades through many administrations, on a bipartisan basis.\u00a0 We will look at this, as we are, methodically and with deliberation for the purpose of making sure that it is working to advance our interests.\u00a0 That\u2019s the objective.\u00a0 And we have a multiplicity of interests when it comes to the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 And as we\u2019re looking at this, we\u2019re \u2013 we want to make sure that, as I said, those interests are being advanced and supported.\nWhen it comes to the grain agreement, first, remember none of this should have been necessary in the first place, because the only reason we had to get this grain agreement is because Russia invaded Ukraine and then blockaded its ports, denying the entire world the benefits of the Ukrainian breadbasket.\u00a0 Thanks to terrific work by the United Nations, by the secretary-general, with the support of Turkey, an agreement was reached where Russia stopped the end of the blockade of Odesa and a process was put in place to allow Ukrainian grain and food products to flow out to the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s been a tremendous benefit.\u00a0 More than nine million metric tons of grain have gotten out through the Odesa ports.\u00a0 Two-thirds of that has gone to the Global South, to countries in Africa and Asia and elsewhere, who desperately needed it.\u00a0 It\u2019s had a very positive impact in lowering prices that\u2019s benefited everyone around the world.\nSo the idea that Russia would now say, ah, it doesn\u2019t want to continue, it wants to turn it off, I think will be met with great anger by countries around the world who are benefiting from Ukrainian grain.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s profoundly in everyone\u2019s interests to make sure that this grain can continue to move out of Ukraine, and certainly we will do everything we can to sustain the agreement.\u00a0 But I think a decision by Russia to discontinue this agreement would the met with deep concern from countries around the world, especially in the Global South.\nWith regard to Iran and the drones that it\u2019s providing to Russia, that Russia is using to kill innocent Ukrainians and to try to destroy the infrastructure of Ukraine, we\u2019ve been warning about this going back many months.\u00a0 Starting in July, we raised concerns that Iran was thinking about providing these drones to Russia.\u00a0 Since well before the Russian aggression, we\u2019ve been going after the Iranian drone networks, the UAV networks.\u00a0 We sanctioned them well over a year ago.\u00a0 We just sanctioned them again a few weeks ago.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to break up these networks.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions, to disrupt this trade, as well as, of course, to help the Iranian \u2013 the Ukrainians, excuse me, harden their own defenses.\nBut I think, again, the fact that Iran is doing this is something that virtually the entire world will find profoundly objectionable.\u00a0 It\u2019s also evidence of the fact that the sanctions that we\u2019ve imposed on Russia, all of us, and the export controls, are having a powerful impact because Russia is unable to produce parts for its own equipment, to manufacture its own equipment, and it\u2019s having to turn to whatever corner of the world it can find to try to get things to continue its aggression.\u00a0 So we are looking very hard at what can be done to stop this, but the first thing is it\u2019s very visible to the entire world.\u00a0 And I think the world is not going to countenance this relationship and the supply of these weapons to Russia.\nFinally, we just proceeded with, I think, our 24th drawdown of defense equipment for Ukraine.\u00a0 As I said, the Canadians have recently contributed additional systems to the Ukrainians.\u00a0 We have a process in place that Secretary of Defense Austin is leading.\u00a0 It was started in Ramstein, Germany, where we\u2019re coordinating the efforts of dozens of countries to make sure that Ukraine continues to get what it needs to defend itself.\u00a0 And this has been an evolving picture over time.\u00a0 As the nature of the aggression has changed, moved to different places, using different means, we\u2019ve adjusted, and we\u2019ll continue to do that, as I said, to make sure that the Ukrainians have what they need.\nThere\u2019s a profound commitment that we have \u2013 but not just the United States and Canada, dozens of countries have \u2013 to make sure that Ukraine continues to get what it needs to defend itself and to take back the territory that was seized from it by Russia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 On the UN grain deal, I must say that I just had a conversation this morning with the head of the African Union, which was very concerned as well that this deal will not be continuing to be supported by Russia.\u00a0 So I think we can really work with many countries around the world \u2013 definitely the U.S. and us, but also working with African countries and Middle Eastern countries that are depending from this important grain deal.\u00a0 And we will continue to voice that support to that deal at the UN through our ambassador.\nI think also that it is equally important for us as a very important grain producer to continue to provide the world with our own grains and food.\u00a0 We\u2019ve increased also massively our support to the World Food Programme; we\u2019re now the fourth biggest donor in the world.\u00a0 And my job is to make sure that, working with the minister of international development, we shed light on the question of food security.\u00a0 We will be going to the G7 next week \u2013 Tony and I \u2013 and definitely as this G7 will be particularly focused on the needs of Africa, we will be looking at how we can continue to support the UN grain deal, but at the same time that we can address the issue of the food crisis.\nAnd finally on the question of Iran, we look forward to working with the U.S. on shedding light on Iran\u2019s involvement in Ukraine and making sure that they\u2019re held accountable.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already, as mentioned, hosted a female foreign minister meeting \u2013 nearly 17 of them were present \u2013 and we also launched a very important declaration to support women in Iran that are fighting for women rights.\u00a0 But I think that the issue of Iran being involved in Ukraine and supporting Russia brings the Iranian regime\u2019s \u2013 how can I say \u2013 inhumanity to another level.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why we will make sure that we hold them accountable.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(In French.)\u00a0 This ends press conference for today.\u00a0 Thank you all for being here.\n\n"}, {"url":

but two, we\u2019ve been able to support them in that effort.\u00a0 And from day one \u2013 as M\u00e9lanie said, even before day one, the United States and Canada working together helped prepare for the rising storm that we saw and then try to make sure that Ukrainians get what they need to fend off the aggression and retake their land.\u00a0 But also making sure that those Ukrainians who left had a place to go and were welcomed with open arms.\nAnd what we see here in this caf\u00e9 is really wonderful because it gives a sense of community to people who have just had to leave everything behind.\u00a0 It creates networks for them to make sure that they can adjust and adapt to their new home, at least for now.\u00a0 I think most people want to go back to the home that they left, and hopefully that\u2019ll happen as soon as possible.\u00a0 But meanwhile the fact that they\u2019re so warmly and generously welcomed in Canada makes all the difference in the world.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0And we want to thank Yaroslav, and \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 (inaudible), and Anton, and all of them \u2014\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Marusia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 \u2014 yes, as well \u2013 for your work here, and we\u2019re proud of the work you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 And this is just Canada, so welcome here.\nMS GARBUTT:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s what we do.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0We welcome people very well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nMS GARBUTT:\u00a0\u00a0We do.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, tout le monde.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, tout le monde\u00a0(inaudible).\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-at-a-diwali-reception/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

they\u2019ve shared sweets; they\u2019ve given thanks through\u00a0pooja; they\u2019ve lit sparklers.\u00a0 All around the world, from the streets of New Delhi, to the parks of Kuala Lumpur, to right down the street at the White House, people have gathered to share in the simple joy of being around friends and family.\u00a0 And through it all, they have each reaffirmed their commitment to bringing light to their communities.\nThat final obligation of spreading light is maybe more important than it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 So even as we celebrate tonight, we remember those around the world who are not able to freely celebrate their cultural and religious holidays.\nEven in the face of challenges \u2013 especially in the face of challenges \u2013 the State Department will continue to support freedom of belief and celebrate religious diversity around the world.\nAs you heard Rashad mention a few moments ago, religious freedom is a fundamental American value, and supporting it is a priority for President Biden.\u00a0 It\u2019s also an invaluable part of the United States diplomacy, because it actually helps us build bonds with other nations and with peoples around the world.\nOne way that we show our support for religious diversity is through helping to preserve vital pieces of cultural heritage around the world.\u00a0 Through efforts like the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, we\u2019re helping to restore damaged historic buildings; we\u2019re helping to recover lost or stolen cultural objects, like paintings and sculptures.\u00a0 Just this past February, our colleagues at the Mission in Australia, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Indian law enforcement agents, recovered a 500-year-old stolen statue of Hanuman, a Hindu deity, and returned it to the Indian Government.\nAnother way that we demonstrate our support for religious freedom is through celebrations like this one, which is one of many happening across the State Department.\u00a0 For example, in our embassy in Abu Dhabi, guests last week decorated a\u00a0rungolee\u00a0in the main entrance, while at Embassy New Delhi, local staff, community members showcased traditional dances.\nEach of these efforts \u2013 each bond that we build between ourselves and other countries \u2013 makes it easier to collaborate on so many of the pressing issues of our time.\u00a0 And here, too, not surprisingly, our engagement with faith communities is a vital part of our work in our embassies and consulates all around the world.\nFor example, diplomats in our mission to India regularly visit temples,\u00a0stupas,\u00a0gurdwaras\u00a0\u2013 both to promote our shared value of pluralism and religious tolerance, and to partner together on common challenges.\u00a0 And over the past two years, Mission Delhi \u2013 across community members in the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, and Buddhist faiths, among others \u2013 have hosted vaccination drives in places of worship around the country as part of the overall effort to help more than 25 million Indians get their COVID-19 vaccines.\nMany of you are already partners in this work.\u00a0 As members of the diplomatic, religious, and civil society communities, you\u2019re playing an invaluable role in helping to connect us with local populations abroad, and by pushing us to do more to support religious freedom around the world.\nPlease keep it up.\u00a0 We need your energy.\u00a0 We need your initiative.\u00a0 We need your knowledge.\u00a0 We need your expertise.\u00a0 We need all of that if we\u2019re going to continue building mutual respect and understanding, if we\u2019re going to continue expanding religious freedom, and ultimately, if we are going to ensure that light triumphs over darkness.\nWe\u2019ll celebrate that triumph in just a few moments with the lighting of the\u00a0diya.\u00a0 For now, thank you, thank you to everybody for being here tonight, for joining in this celebration, for the community that you have formed together, and for the work that you\u2019re doing not just in this day and on this happy occasion, but every single day to advance the values and the light that we want to spread.\u00a0 Happy Diwali, everyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDoctor, over to you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-israeli-president-isaac-herzog-before-their-meeting-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

And we\u2019re building bridges\u00a0\u2013 in STEM, between our people, between all of our countries.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing that through all of you.\nAs this program now enters its second decade, we\u2019re also expanding its reach.\u00a0 We\u2019ll spread to new parts of our own country, the United States, as well as new regions of the world, starting with the Balkans.\u00a0 We\u2019ll create additional opportunities for collaboration between alums and mentors.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue supporting younger generations of women in STEM.\nSo what I\u2019d like to leave you with is this encouragement, that you continue engaging with the program not just now, not just in the months ahead, but in the years ahead, because we couldn\u2019t be prouder to be your partners and because this has to be a living, growing, expanding, evolving thing.\u00a0 And you\u2019re the ones who can make it be exactly that.\nAs important as five weeks may be, what\u2019s even more important is what follows from it.\u00a0 And again, these connections that you\u2019ve made, these networks that you\u2019re building, that to me is the power of TechWomen.\u00a0 That\u2019s what makes it something that will carry us, carry you, carry our societies far into the future.\nWe know\u00a0\u2013 because we\u2019ve seen it already in the time that the program has existed\u00a0\u2013 we know that you\u2019re going to keep doing remarkable work, not only in your fields but also to support other women.\u00a0 More than 90 percent of the TechWomen alumna who\u2019ve been surveyed have said that they\u2019ve actually gone on to mentor women in their countries.\u00a0 So I hope you\u2019ll continue to build on that tradition, too.\u00a0 Carrying it forward, paying it forward, that\u2019s also the power of TechWomen.\nMy last thought is this.\u00a0 You\u2019ve already heard about some remarkable projects that have come out of this session.\u00a0 But I really can\u2019t wait\u00a0\u2013 we can\u2019t wait\u00a0\u2013 to see all that you\u2019re going to do in the years ahead, that you\u2019re going to do together, that you\u2019re going to do for the betterment of your countries, of your societies, of the world and the planet that we share.\u00a0 This is\u00a0\u2013 you are\u00a0\u2013 the hope that we have for our common future.\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t be prouder to be working with you.\u00a0 Thank you so very much.

Blinken and French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna at a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Benjamin Franklin Room", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "October 21, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0Bonjour, tout le monde.\n(Via interpreter) Catherine, I\u2019m delighted to host you here at the State Department and in Washington.\nIt\u2019s a true pleasure to have my friend and colleague, Catherine Colonna, the French Foreign Minister here in Washington and at the State Department.\u00a0 This is actually the first time that we\u2019ve had the honor of hosting our French colleagues and Catherine here in Washington, despite the fact that we have been closely collaborating over these past five months everywhere from Brussels to Bali, most recently at the United Nations Security Council in the course of a ministerial that the foreign minister presided over on Ukraine.\nOn virtually every issue that matters to our nations and matters to much of the world, I couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner, the United States couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner.\u00a0 And that was reflected in, as usual, the very productive conversation and meeting that we had today.\u00a0 We discussed our united and unwavering response to President Putin\u2019s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 In recent days, we\u2019ve witnessed Moscow\u2019s widespread strikes on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine \u2013 many carried out using drones supplied by Iran.\u00a0 These strikes have a clear goal: to make the Ukrainian people suffer.\u00a0 And the damage they\u2019re inflicting will make it harder for Ukrainians to heat their homes, find safe water to drink, access the electricity that they need to run everything from stores to hospitals to public transportation.\nPresident Putin thinks that these attacks will somehow break the will of Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Instead, he is only deepening their resolve to defend their country.\u00a0 Moscow can knock out the lights across Ukraine, but it cannot, it will not, extinguish the Ukrainian spirit.\nPresident Putin thought he could divide the transatlantic alliance.\u00a0 Instead, he\u2019s brought us even closer together.\u00a0 The United States is working closely with France and other European allies to help make the decisive shift away from dependence on Russian energy.\u00a0 That means developing more diverse, more reliable, more sustainable sources over the long term and helping our friends get through a winter with heavy energy costs.\u00a0 As I assured the foreign minister today, we are not leaving any of our friends out in the cold.\nPresident Putin thought that he could wear down global support for Ukraine.\u00a0 Instead, countries in every region recognize that when the Kremlin tries to redraw the borders of its neighbor by force, it threatens the rules that underpin security and stability for all nations in every corner of the Earth.\u00a0 That is why 143 countries recently voted at the United Nations to condemn Russia\u2019s sham referenda and reject any attempt to annex Ukrainian territory.\nPresident Putin\u2019s declaration of martial law in parts of Ukraine that Russia purports to annex is just his latest attempt to dress up crimes in the language of law.\u00a0 His move also reveals the lie at the heart of Russia\u2019s purported annexation: if 99 percent of people in these parts of Ukraine want to be part of Russia, why does President Putin have to impose martial law to control them?\nThe foreign minister and I spoke about how we can continue to provide robust support for Ukraine\u2019s efforts to defend itself and to deliver vital humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people while also continuing to raise the costs on President Putin and his enablers for their actions.\u00a0 And we reaffirmed our commitment to meaningful diplomacy that can bring an end to the war, even as Moscow continues to demonstrate through its escalatory actions that its claim to be open to diplomacy is as hollow as it\u2019s been since President Putin lost \u2013 launched his invasion in February.\nWe applaud France\u2019s security assistance to Ukraine, including President Macron\u2019s recent announcement of a 100 million euro fund to help supply Kyiv with weapons.\u00a0 France is also host to more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, including thousands who have been welcomed into French households.\nOf course, our cooperation and our conversation extended far beyond Ukraine today.\u00a0 We\u2019re working closely together to rally international coalitions to meet global challenges which no nation or even group of nations can solve alone.\u00a0 That includes our joint efforts to combat the climate crisis.\u00a0 Next week, we\u2019ll hold the second annual high-level meeting of the U.S.\u2011France Clean Energy Partnership, which is ramping up our renewable energy production.\nWe\u2019re stalwart partners in strengthening global health security, as was evident in France\u2019s pledge of nearly $1.6 billion at last month\u2019s Global Fund Seventh Replenishment Conference, which President Biden committed to work with our Congress to contribute $6 billion to that fund.\u00a0 This is the international fund that has done so much over so many years to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, saving literally millions and millions of lives.\u00a0 Our contributions, the United States and France, the two \u2013 to the two largest contributions of any two countries \u2013 will allow us to keep making great strides against HIV/AIDS, against malaria, and against tuberculosis.\nWe\u2019re also working together to advance a free and open Indo\u2011Pacific where all nations can choose their own paths free from coercion.\u00a0 And I thank the minister for France\u2019s support in the negotiations that the governments of Israel and Lebanon reached, a historic agreement to establish a permanent maritime boundary between their two countries.\u00a0 This cooperation and coordination between France and the United States was instrumental in reaching this agreement.\nOur relationship is the embodiment of the approach in the United Nations \u2013 excuse me, the United States new National Security Strategy, which is rooted in strengthening our alliances and our partnerships, finding new ways to weave them together, and working together to shape a more open, secure, and prosperous world.\nThe state visit by President Macron in December, the first that President Biden will host during this administration, is both a testament to our unique friendship and the chance to continue to deepen it.\u00a0 I\u2019m very much looking forward to working with Catherine in the leadup to the visit and long after.\nWith that, Catherine, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0M. Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat, dear Antony, thank you very much for your warm welcome and for our meeting today, the first in Washington, as you rightly cite.\u00a0 As some of you may know, I\u2019ve happily served as a young diplomat in D.C. some time ago, let\u2019s say.\u00a0 Let me turn to French since the Secretary of State is an accomplished French speaker.\n(Via interpreter) Secretary of State, dear Tony, this visit is taking place at a decisive time.\u00a0 Almost eight months ago, Russia brought war back to the European continent by invading illegally Ukraine.\u00a0 It is by doing so threatening our collective security, breaching the fundamental principles of the Charter of the UN and as well as its own commitments, and day after day a trampling upon the laws of war and international humanitarian law given the crimes he perpetrates.\nThe international order we built collectively is being attacked.\u00a0 It is therefore not a regional stake.\u00a0 That war concerns us all as the Kremlin is blackmailing the world on energy, food, and in addition to its attacks against the very same principle that allow the states, the members of the international community, to live together, like I\u2019ve said before.\nThis is the reason why we, France, the United States, our allies, our partners made the choice to provide our staunch support to Ukraine by mobilizing all of our levers \u2013 political, economic, financial, humanitarian, and military.\u00a0 We said it on a number of occasions, and let me repeat it here:\u00a0 We will stand by Ukraine as long as necessary, because such is the interest of Europe, such is the interest of the United States, and such is very simply the interest of the world, which Russia is seeking to divide by expanding its imperialist and colonial ambitions.\nWe find strength and efficiency in our unity.\u00a0 The United States once again was here at the historical moment standing by its European friends who share the same democratic values, standing in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian Armed Forces to allow them to resist, and as we\u2019ve seen for a few weeks to even counterattack.\nAnd I would like to mention not just our unity but also another outstanding unity and underline the fact that the European reaction was historical, because confronted with an unprecedented challenge, the European Union was able to use, and quickly so, its full economic, diplomatic, and military strength.\u00a0 We quickly \u2013 very quickly \u2013 mobilized all of our instruments to hinder the Russian war effort.\u00a0 We enacted sanctions, individual sectorial sanctions, massive ones, 48 hours after the invasion, and seven times in a row since then.\nGiven that we even adopted a next package of sanctions, and on Monday, together with my colleagues of the European Union, we also decided to already work on another set of sanctions in case they were necessary.\nAnd together with the Europeans we also decided to gradually put an end to all energy dependency vis-\u00e0-vis Russia which was structural and which we fundamentally revised.\u00a0 As recalled by President Macron, the example of gas is very telling given that the European dependency dropped from 40 to 7 percent dependency vis-\u00e0-vis Russia for the \u2013 the decision taken at the Versailles summit in March.\u00a0 So within a few months we were able to adapt.\nAs you know, the embargo on coal has been in place since August.\u00a0 The one on oil is coming and will be fully in place on the 5th of December.\u00a0 And these measures are efficient, and please allow me to say because sometimes we hear that they are not.\u00a0 It is part of the propaganda by Moscow.\u00a0 But the Russian economy is impacted, already in recession this year, and we\u2019ll be back to where it were in 2000 within two years.\u00a0 So already 20 years lost and already some major part of the industrial Russian sectors in difficulty \u2013 armament, aeronautics, and automobile \u2014 so the sanctions are producing, having an impact.\nFrom a military point of view I would like to say as well that the European action is very \u2013 is determined, and President Macron recently announced to President Zelenskyy that we would step up our military assistance, delivering some new equipment.\u00a0 And you\u2019re probably aware that we are delivering artillery missiles, munitions, as well as a light tanks. \u00a0We also decided to train at least 2,000\u00a0Ukrainian soldiers in France, and we are developing cooperation in the field of intelligence, which will also be stepped up and will go further.\nSo we are doing our part, as needed, and we also provide humanitarian assistance and working on emergency reconstruction, and that will be more necessary than ever as winter approaches.\u00a0 We need to help the Ukrainian people to continue to hold on good, and we see that the Russians are targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine.\nWe are also welcoming and hosting \u2013 even though France is father \u2013 is at the west, but we have millions of Ukrainian refugees who are welcome in France and Europe.\u00a0 The kids can go to school.\u00a0 We mainly receive women and children.\u00a0 Ukrainians can work in Europe.\u00a0 It is a matter of solidarity, and we are honoring it.\u00a0 We\u2019re also providing an economic and financial assistance in the thousands of\u00a0\u2013 billions of Euros provided both by the European Union and member states individually.\nWe\u2019re also providing some concrete support when it comes to the fight against impunity.\u00a0 At the end of September, we were together at the UN Security Council for the first meeting at a ministerial level since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, dealing with the Russian\u00a0\u2013 the Ukrainian issue, and in particular, the fight against impunity.\u00a0 It was necessary to do so.\u00a0 And what we heard very much showed that Russia is very isolated. \u00a0I discussed with the Secretary of State we are providing our support to the International Criminal Court and to the Ukrainian courts so that those who perpetrate crimes in Ukraine are prosecuted as shall be because there will be no peace without justice.\nFrance also is supporting Ukraine, standing by its allies, European allies and within NATO.\u00a0 We resolutely contribute to strengthening the deterrence and defense posture of the east flank, standing by the side of our Baltic, Romanian, and Polish friends, and by deploying some additional troops, some land and air forces.\u00a0 And the European Union itself already released 3\u00a0billion euros, and we are now at 3.5 billion euros for the\u00a0\u2013 to the decision taken on Monday so that the\u00a0\u2013 what we call the European peace facility can provide Ukraine with what it takes to defend itself.\u00a0 It\u2019s basically some delivery of military equipment.\nIt is in these circumstances where\u00a0\u2013 and it will probably still be the case in the long run\u00a0\u2013 that I came, dear Tony, to talk about our bilateral relationship, and in order to prepare as well the state visit of President Macron very soon, in early December, thanks to the invitation extended by President Biden.\u00a0 And I understand that it is the first state visit organized by this administration, so please allow me to say that it is an honor which means a lot, both for my president and my country.\u00a0 The president said it once again when I saw him on Wednesday to prepare for my visit to Washington, D.C.\nSo we are together preparing for this visit in early December, and we intend to use it to show how vivid our alliance is, the oldest alliance, as is customary to often say.\u00a0 We will be working, of course, on implementing the roadmap, defined just a year ago by both our presidents in Rome in the margin of the G20 meeting in the space of energy\u00a0\u2013 in the areas of space and energy, which are strategic sectors for both our countries.\u00a0 And more than ever, we want to build on this new impulse and resolutely move forward in order to meet the challenges around the world.\u00a0 Some of them I\u2019ve just mentioned, but so many others we need to deal with: climate, energy, the Indo-Pacific, the Sahel, or the fight against terrorism.\nSo I believe that on all of these issues, discussions enable us to show that once again there was an outstanding convergence of views.\u00a0 We see each other often, very often, even though I do not so often come to D.C.\u00a0 And to conclude, the new National Security Strategy that was published this week here in the United States only shows that we share some very close analysis and recommendations.\u00a0 So in this context, we believe that this state visit will once again enable us to show how close we are, how willing we are to work together to meet all of these challenges.\nSo once again, Secretary of State, dear Tony, thank you for your warm welcome, thank you for our discussion earlier today, and thank you for all of the good work we have been doing for quite a while and as our countries have been doing for a long term since General Lafayette, George Washington, or Benjamin Franklin.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll say he is watching us and keeping a friendly eye on us.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll now take questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Kylie Atwood of CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Happy afternoon, and thank you guys for taking some questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, two questions, one on Iran and one on Russia.\nWe have heard U.S. officials in recent days be very clear in saying that reviving the Iran nuclear deal isn\u2019t a focus for the United States right now.\u00a0 But is it even possible to salvage that deal?\u00a0 Is the United States willing to strike a deal with the Iranian regime after the death of female Iranian protesters and after Iranian weapons shipments to Russia?\u00a0 And Minister Colonna, the same question to you on the French perspective on that.\u00a0 Is it still in the realm of possibility that France wants to revive the Iran nuclear deal?\nSecond question, on Russia and diplomacy.\u00a0 This week the Russian ambassador here in Washington spoke about a quiet channel of diplomacy that was used around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis to avoid a nuclear conflict.\u00a0 Then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the Russian ambassador here were leading that channel.\u00a0 Has the Biden administration studied that model and considered how to replicate something similar to that going forward to try and trigger a diplomatic path out of this war?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, thanks very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start and then turn it over to Catherine.\nFirst, with regard to Iran broadly, the JCPOA in particular.\u00a0 Look, right now the eyes of the world are on the protests in Iran, the extraordinary courage of young Iranians, especially women, who are standing up at great personal risk for their basic rights, for their basic freedoms, and encountering once again the brutal repression of their government.\u00a0 And as you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps in recent weeks in solidarity with them, in support of them, in support of every Iranian who simply wants the freedom to express their views and to have their voices heard.\nWe\u2019ve taken \u2013 we\u2019ve issued sanctions against the so-called morality police that are the ones who, among other things, are responsible for the death of Mahsa Amini, and of course we\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure, to the best of our ability, that through technology, Iranians can continue to communicate with one another and with the outside world.\u00a0 And that goes to the work that we did to make sure that we had a license in place that allows technology companies as best they can to get the necessary communications technology to Iranians.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where I think the world\u2019s focus is.\nHaving said that, with regard to the JCPOA, two things.\u00a0 First, there\u2019s no imminent agreement, and there\u2019s no imminent agreement because the Iranians continue to inject extraneous issues into the discussions about the JCPOA.\u00a0 And as long as they continue to do that, there is no possibility, no prospect for an agreement.\u00a0 We continue to believe that a diplomatic resolution to the challenge posed by Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains the best way forward, and we continue to be determined that Iran never acquire a nuclear weapon or the capacity to build one, including the fissile material necessary to fuel one.\nThe JCPOA, when it was in existence, was successful in putting Iran\u2019s program \u2013 its nuclear program \u2013 into a box.\u00a0 And unfortunately, in leaving that agreement, it\u2019s allowed Iran to get out of the box that it was in in terms of its nuclear program.\u00a0 We continue to have an interest in seeing that program put back in the box.\u00a0 We continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to do that.\u00a0 But in this moment there is no prospect for an agreement \u2013 again, because Iran continues to inject extraneous issues into the conversations that we\u2019ve had.\u00a0 And the European Union, our partners \u2013 France, Germany, the United Kingdom \u2013 are all in the same place when it comes to that.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say on this:\u00a0 With or without a deal \u2013 and this was true when the deal was in effect; it\u2019s been true since the deal has no longer been in effect \u2013 with or without it, we will continue to take every step necessary to deal with Iran\u2019s activities, Iran\u2019s aggression, whether it\u2019s in the Middle East or beyond.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeing that now with the provision of UAVs to Russia to help it continue its aggression against the Ukrainian people.\nWith regard to Russia and diplomacy, before I turn it to Catherine, we have been very clear that whenever we have something that it\u2019s important to communicate to the Russians, we\u2019ll do it, and we\u2019ve done it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had occasion to speak to Foreign Minister Lavrov on specific issues that were important to our own security.\u00a0 Other colleagues \u2013 including the Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor \u2013 have communicated with their counterparts, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.\nWhen it comes to diplomacy to end the war, it depends entirely on whether Russia gets to a place where it\u2019s actually interested in stopping the aggression that it started, and we\u2019ve seen no evidence of that in this moment.\u00a0 On the contrary, we see Russia doubling and tripling down on its aggression: in the last month, the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of Russians; horrifically, cannon fodder that Putin is trying to throw into the war.\u00a0 For the 300,000 Russians that had purportedly been mobilized, more than that number have fled the country to avoid having to go to Ukraine.\nSecond, of course, this effort to have the sham referenda and then annex Ukrainian territory, which was rejected by virtually the entire world, 143 countries; now, a horrific bombing campaign against critical civilian infrastructure, against \u2013 as Catherine said \u2013 the facilities across the country that are trying to generate electricity and power for the country to keep the lights on, to keep people warm during the winter \u2013 brutalizing the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 So every indication is that, far from being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy, President Putin continues to push in the opposite direction.\u00a0 The fundamental problem he has is that not only are the Ukrainian people extraordinarily courageous and resilient, they\u2019re also very successful in not only repelling the aggression but taking their land back.\nAnd it all comes down to what I\u2019ve been saying for some time, which is that, with the assistance that we\u2019ve been providing, with the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people, the fundamental difference maker is that Ukrainians are fighting for their country, for their land, for their future.\u00a0 Russia is not.\u00a0 The sooner President Putin understands that and comes to that conclusion, the sooner we\u2019ll be able to end this war.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMR. PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Kylie, we need \u2013 we need to go on to the Foreign Minister, please.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0We \u2013 we\u2019ll \u2013 we consider and will consider every means to advance diplomacy if we see an opening to advance it by whatever means.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019ll always look at it.\u00a0 But as I said, in this moment, Russia shows no signs of being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy by any means.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your question regarding Iran.\u00a0 I say we\u2019re pretty much aligned on this one as well.\u00a0 Let me switch to French on the JCPOA.\n(Via interpreter) Regarding the JCPOA, the Secretary of State responded in detail.\u00a0 A proposal was made to Iran, so that is some very long negotiations.\u00a0 The proposal aims at dealing with the Iranian nuclear situation, which is serious \u2013 very serious.\u00a0 This proposal has not so far been approved by Iran even though we told them there would be no better offer on the table and that it is for \u2013 it belongs to Iran to take a decision and to accept this offer if they can.\u00a0 And President Macron went as far as meeting President Raisi in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York to find out about his mindset.\u00a0 And unfortunately, we could only acknowledge that Iran at the moment was not willing to accept this proposal.\u00a0 So it is for this country to make a decision.\nSecond, and like the Secretary of State, I would like to say how concerned we all by the violence that is being used by the Iranian authorities against demonstrators, people who demonstrate peacefully so \u2013 on a number of occasions.\u00a0 And quickly we condemn this brutal repression against demonstrators.\u00a0 We also recalled the fundamental right of citizens to demonstrate peacefully, to peacefully express their opinion.\u00a0 We also demanded all citizens to be set free.\u00a0 There are a number of French citizens being held in Iran and others.\u00a0 We took a number of sanctions on behalf of the European Union against those responsible for the repression.\nSo that\u2019s been done, and more recently this week, given the support provided by Iran to the criminal action of Russia in Ukraine by way of kamikaze UAVs that were used again only a few days ago, we have at a ministerial level adopted some additional sanctions \u2013 and they are now enforced \u2013 sanctions against those responsible for these armament programs.\nAnd let me say that these UAVs that were used once again this week \u2013 against the civilian \u2013 civil infrastructures and civilians in Ukraine \u2013 this is not only in breach of the commitments by Iran in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolution, but it is also a war crime because they\u2019re targeting civilians.\u00a0 So this is the reason why we took sanctions.\nMR. PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0S\u00e9bastien Blanc, AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I have two questions, one for each of you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, there are currently tensions between France and Germany.\u00a0 Britain is in turmoil.\u00a0 We have a new prime minister in Italy with a coalition who is \u2013 who disagrees on Ukraine.\u00a0 Are you worried about a lack \u2013 a possible lack of cohesion within Europe at a time when cohesion is very much needed against Russia?\n(Via interpreter) And\u00a0Madame la Ministre, is France going to send a military force or a police force to Haiti, as requested by Prime Minister Ariel Henry?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Everything I\u2019m seeing is the exact opposite of a lack of cohesion.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re showing tremendous solidarity, we\u2019re showing tremendous coordination, tremendous cooperation in everything that we\u2019re doing together to support Ukraine, to continue to put pressure on Russia, as well as to shore up our own alliance, NATO \u2013 defensive alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that in the actions that the EU has just taken, including additional sanctions.\u00a0 We see it in the support that just a week ago more than 40 countries came together through the Ramstein process to continue the coordination in supplying weaponry to Ukraine to allow it to defend itself and to take back its territory.\u00a0 We see it in the assistance that the European Union now is providing directly to Ukraine, including direct budgetary support that will help them get through this economic challenge that they\u2019re facing largely because of the Russian aggression.\nSo everything I\u2019m seeing, both in terms of my own conversations and, importantly, the President\u2019s conversations with his counterpart, as well as in the action that\u2019s being taken, speaks to incredibly strong cohesion, solidarity, commitment to this common effort to help Ukraine defend itself, to stand up not only for Ukrainians against this aggression, but to stand up for the very principles that are at the heart of the United Nations Charter and that are important for countries everywhere around the world \u2013 the basic idea that one country can\u2019t change the borders of another by force, that it can\u2019t simply seize the land it wants or eliminate the independence or sovereignty of a country just because its leader so decides.\nTogether, Europe, the United States are standing strong in defense of those basic principles, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s important not just to our own countries but to countries around the world.\u00a0 And it was further manifested by the fact that with a resolution that was led by the European Union at the UN General Assembly just a week ago, 143 countries stood up together in opposition to what Russia is doing in Ukraine.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you, sir.\u00a0 We support the search for stability for Haiti, a country which is once again plunged into violence and poverty still, and we are well aware of the seriousness of the situation which is in the hands of criminal gangs which are only worsening the situation.\u00a0 So in this respect I would like to commend the adoption today at the Security Council of a unanimous resolution, and it is also interesting when we consider \u2013 when we look at the situation of the global order.\u00a0 So I would like to also commend the efforts deployed by the United States for the adoption and \u2013 the quick adoption of this resolution.\nIf an international support force to the police were to be set up, France would contribute probably materially, even though we still \u2013 by way of equipment we will still have to work on the details.\u00a0 But what is important in the moment is that we continue to deploy efforts at the United Nations for such a force to be deployed.\u00a0 At the moment we\u2019re not yet where we should be to contribute to resolving the problem of Haiti.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Missy Ryan,\u00a0Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thank you.\u00a0 You both mentioned the assistance that France is providing to Ukraine.\u00a0 However, there are some in the U.S. Congress who are increasingly voicing concerns about the fact that the United States is giving so much more economic and military aid to Ukraine than many of its major allies or than all of its major allies in Europe, while countries like France, in turn, are giving less proportionally than countries \u2013 smaller European countries like Estonia.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, do you think that countries \u2013 larger European countries like France and Germany \u2013 should be increasing their contributions to Ukraine?\nAnd also for you, Mr. Secretary, last week President Macron in an interview said that France would not use nuclear weapons in retaliation for a potential Russian nuclear strike on Ukraine.\u00a0 Do you think it\u2019s a good idea to preemptively take that off the table?\nAnd for you, Madam Minster, can you tell us how President Macron\u2019s comments ruling out nuclear retaliation makes France and Europe safer?\u00a0 And do you think there should be a way to take into account the significant contributions that France and other European countries have made in taking in and taking care of Ukrainian refugees to help people in the United States, for example, understand how the contributions may not be what they seem to be on the face of them?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Missy.\u00a0 With regard to assistance to Ukraine, first, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are making together an extraordinary collective effort.\u00a0 And again, you see that in the security assistance that\u2019s being provided by Europe and by the United States alike.\u00a0 You see it in the economic assistance; you see it in the humanitarian assistance that\u2019s being provided.\u00a0 And if you break it down and add it up, Europe is doing extraordinary things.\u00a0 I just mentioned that this week we saw the European Union moving forward with direct budgetary support in the billions of dollars for the Ukrainian Government, something that we\u2019ve been doing over the summer, but it\u2019s very important and very timely that Europe is now picking up this baton, very important to Ukraine as it tries to get through the winter and get through the months ahead.\nSimilarly, when it comes to the defense support to Ukraine, I could cite what France has done and continues to do, which is absolutely vital to the Ukrainians being able to defend themselves and take back territory.\u00a0 That continues; we talked about it today.\u00a0 And the same thing on the humanitarian support.\u00a0 It\u2019s also true that there are literally millions of Ukrainian refugees in Europe being welcomed by a whole variety of European countries \u2013 the kids going to school, the parents being able to work and getting support.\u00a0 That\u2019s significant; that has to be added to the equation.\u00a0 So this is a collective responsibility that we are undertaking collectively, and one of the things that we\u2019re working on virtually every day is making sure that we\u2019re coordinated, making sure we\u2019re being responsive to the needs, and doing it together.\u00a0 So I\u2019ve been impressed with the \u2013 this collective effort.\u00a0 And based on our conversations and based on conversations with other European colleagues, I have no doubt that that will continue.\nWhen it comes to nuclear weapons, two things.\u00a0 There has been loose talk coming from President Putin and from other Russians about this.\u00a0 It\u2019s the height of irresponsibility, particularly coming from a member of the United Nations Security Council.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we look at very carefully and that we take very seriously given what Russia has already done in Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ve to date seen no reason to change our own nuclear posture, but we will track it very carefully.\u00a0 And let me just say for our part \u2013 I\u2019m not going to speak for France or for anyone else \u2013 we\u2019ve communicated very clearly, very directly to Russia the consequences for any use of a nuclear weapon.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I shall continue with this first topic before moving on to the refugees.\u00a0 Madam, echoing what the Secretary of State just said, when one talks about nuclear weapons, one should talk with genuine measurement, if not prudence.\u00a0 So once again I would like to say that we\u2019re calling upon Russia to act as a responsible power.\u00a0 It is a nuclear power and accordingly it has some specific responsibility: nuclear weapons of deterrence.\u00a0 And I think one we recall \u2013 once we recall that nuclear weapons are weapons of deterrence, it says it all.\u00a0 As to the French doctrine recalled by the president of France, that is \u2013 this is the one.\nMadam, you also asked about the fact that Europe is welcoming millions and millions of refugees from Ukraine, usually women and children.\u00a0 They are being well \u2013 I believe they\u2019re well received.\u00a0 And by hosting them, well, it is a matter of solidarity, it is a matter of humanity.\u00a0 So of course it comes at a cost, but it is normal.\u00a0 And I believe when it was assessed that it is costing some 17 of 18 million euros already, and it will continue.\u00a0 But the \u2013 we will need \u2013 the member states shall continue to support to maintain this effort, but I will not use that as an argument.\u00a0 We should speak about the facts, and like the Secretary of State said, France, the European Union in itself, its member states all sharing \u2013 now shouldering their responsibility.\u00a0 They\u2019re already contributing thousands of millions \u2013 billions of euros to microeconomic support, financial support, humanitarian support, et cetera, not to mention the welcoming the refugees, as I just said.\nAnd one last word.\u00a0 Let us not play in the hands of the Russians.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been incredibly united and they bring \u2013 this is our strength.\u00a0 And I would like to call upon each and every one to say that we stand together to defend the principles of international law, according to which an order based on the rules shall not be challenged the way it is being by Russia.\u00a0 We shall clearly say what is at stake.\u00a0 It is not just the fate of Ukraine or the security of the European continent.\u00a0 It is a matter relevant to all and every single country around the world.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Keely Sullivan, France 2.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Thank you, Minister Colonna, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, if I may, I would actually like to ask you a question in French.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Allons-y.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Okay, okay.\u00a0 (Via interpreter.) I would like to ask about a statement that came out of the White House yesterday, according to which there are some Iranian military present in Crimea supporting the Russians with a number of UAV strikes in Ukraine.\u00a0 Do you consider some new sanctions by the United States or some parallel response?\u00a0 And Madam as well, Madam Minister, further to the sanctions approved by the European Union, do you consider something else further to the statement that came out of the White House?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (In French.)\n(In English) First, we\u2019ve been warning going back to July about Iranian plans to provide UAVs to Russia for use in Ukraine, so this is something that we have been seeing in the works and now we\u2019re seeing in reality.\u00a0 Back in September, a month ago, the Russians moved UAVs that they acquired from Iran into Crimea to use against the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 And, as we\u2019ve said, Russian military personnel in Crimea have been piloting these Iranian UAVs, using them to conduct kinetic strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv just in recent days and against all sorts of civilian infrastructure and civilians themselves.\u00a0 That\u2019s truly deplorable.\u00a0 And yes, we also see Iranian military personnel on the ground in Crimea who are assisting Russia in these operations.\u00a0 We believe that Russia\u2019s received dozens of these UAVs so far from Iran, with more potentially in the works.\nBut beyond consistently warning about this, going back well before the Russian aggression, we\u2019ve been taking action against the provision of UAVs by Iran to anyone that\u2019s using them in an aggressive and dangerous way, whether it\u2019s in Yemen, whether it\u2019s in Iraq, whether it\u2019s potentially against Israel, and other countries.\u00a0 We\u2019ve sanctioned the entities that we can find that are involved with this.\u00a0 There are UAV networks, including sanctions going back to last October.\u00a0 We are interdicting the illicit traffic in arms, including UAVs, wherever we can see them, find them, and interdict them.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that in coordination and cooperation with other countries.\u00a0 And we\u2019re continuing to build up the defenses of our partners, including in Ukraine, against the use of UAVs or any other kinds of weapon systems that Iran may be engaged in.\nSo this is a day-in, day-out effort.\u00a0 It goes back a long time.\u00a0 But it\u2019s now spread to Ukraine through Russia, and we\u2019re determined to stand against it wherever it\u2019s happening.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter.) Thank you, madam. As to the sanctions, like I said, we already adopted eight series of sanctions against the Russian war machine and warmongers, and the sanctions will be stepped up if necessary.\u00a0 And I was saying as well that on Monday, we decided to start working on what could be done if it were necessary.\nBut your question was in relation to Iran, and here again let me recall what we said before.\u00a0 The European Union itself took sanctions against those responsible for repression in Iran, and more recently this week, sanctions against Iran due to the delivery of military equipment to Russia used against Ukraine in breach of the commitments taken by Iran and its commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the international community.\u00a0 There is a UN Security Council resolution that prohibits that, and also for being the accomplice of the war crimes committed, perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine.\nSo these sanctions were decided at a political level on Monday.\u00a0 They were finalized yesterday.\u00a0 And they are legally in force as from today.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-opening-of-a-new-philadelphia-passport-agency-and-at-a-u-s-citizenship-and-immigration-services-naturalization-ceremony/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Because of your work, this facility will soon be able to process more than 150,000 passports every year.\u00a0 And joining in this effort are individuals, people like Julia Nixon, who has processed passports in Philadelphia for nearly four decades \u2013 starting at a time when she was required to physically paste the photographs inside passports with glue.\u00a0 Things have changed just a little bit since then. (Laughter.)\u00a0 Julia, thank you for your service.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nI want to take advantage of this moment just to do a little further advertising because the State Department is also undertaking other initiatives \u2013 redesigning our passports with stronger security features to deter fraud; making our policies more inclusive so that all people can travel with documents that truly reflect their identities.\nWe\u2019re joined by several family members, as well, of Representative Nix, after whom this facility is named.\u00a0 The son of a former slave, he was the first black person to be elected to represent the city of Philadelphia in Congress; he served the city\u2019s residents from 1956 to 1979.\u00a0 During that time, he served on multiple committees, including Post Office and Civil Service Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\u00a0 So this really connects that beautifully because this facility, which began as a post office connecting Americans to each other as well as to the wider world, now a Passport Agency connecting Americans to the world around them.\nCongressman Nix, as a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, pushed for passage of the landmark legislation on civil rights, including introducing a measure to end racial discrimination in the Armed Forces, and later supporting key voting rights legislation.\u00a0 Across each of these efforts, he tried to make a country that hadn\u2019t always treated him equally a little bit more equal.\nTo the Nix family here today \u2013 grandsons Robert Nix III, Michael, Tony, great grandson Jalen, as well as their own families: we\u2019re honored to have you join us today, join us in recognizing and appreciating the extraordinary legacy of Congressman Nix, his contributions not just to this city, but to our country.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThrough his actions, Representative Nix worked to make sure that the first three words of our Constitution \u2013 a phrase that I suspect everyone in this group knows pretty well by now from your naturalization test \u2013 \u201cWe the People\u201d \u2013 extended their promise to more Americans.\u00a0 And throughout his life, he dedicated himself to the idea that the story of America is one of growth, of inclusion, of constant renewal from within.\nEach and every one of you here today embodies that renewal.\u00a0 This is what makes our country strong.\u00a0 You arrived in America from almost every corner of the world, vastly different backgrounds, different perspectives, different journeys.\nAs a journalist in Belarus, Hanna, who\u2019s here with us today, worked with activists to cover human rights violations that were happening in Belarus.\u00a0 She was persecuted for her work; she escaped to the United States.\u00a0 Today, she and her husband, a registered nurse from Macedonia, are proud homeowners in Delaware next door.\nJimmy, trained as a civil engineer in Honduras, came to the United States when the company that he was working for transferred him here to Philadelphia.\u00a0 His work was so indispensable that the company eventually petitioned for him to stay in the United States.\u00a0 He now lives in Delaware with his wife, Melissa, who teaches Spanish at a private school.\nSung came to the United States to attend graduate school, after which he planned to return home to South Korea to become a software engineer.\u00a0 Along the way, he fell in love with another immigrant: his future wife, who came from China to study in the United States.\u00a0 They now live with their two children, ages nine and five, just outside of Philadelphia.\nThe urge to do better for yourself, to do better for your family, to be part of something bigger than any one person or family, that\u2019s something that shaped my life as well.\nMy grandfather, my father\u2019s father, Maurice Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing pogroms at the turn of the last century in Russia.\nMy stepmother, Vera Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing the communists in her native Hungary.\nAnd my late stepfather, Samuel Pisar, ultimately found a home in America after enduring the horrors of the Holocaust.\u00a0 He was liberated from concentration camps by an American GI.\u00a0 He repaid the gift by dedicating his own life to advocating for human rights, and trying to find common ground among former adversaries.\nIn 1961, he became a citizen of the United States, and here\u2019s what he used to say to me and to other members of our family.\u00a0 \u201cYou,\u201d pointing to me, \u201cyou are an American by happy accident of birth.\u00a0 I am an American by choice.\u201d\nEach of you has made that same choice.\u00a0 And with that decision comes a responsibility borne by every generation of immigrants that have come before you: that of being a citizen, of contributing your ideas, your talent, your energy to your communities.\u00a0 You are now partners in the great unfinished work of making this country better for more of its people \u2013 especially those who will come after you.\nThroughout our nation\u2019s history, we have been enriched time and again by the contributions of immigrants and their children.\nThey influence everything from the art that expands our horizons, to the scientific advancements that move us forward, to the food that we enjoy every single day.\u00a0 In fact, earlier today we made a pit stop by Federal Donuts \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 just a few blocks away.\u00a0 I got a chance to sample a few of the chef\u2019s remarkable achievements \u2013 I even helped to make one\u00a0\u2013 influenced in his case by his Israeli background.\u00a0 Another powerful example of our melting pot.\nImmigrants, as we know, have launched world-renowned companies from Apple to Google, AT&T and Pfizer.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been a key source of our national competitiveness.\u00a0 I was in Silicon Valley just a couple of days ago.\u00a0 More than half of the billion-dollar companies produced in Silicon Valley were founded by an immigrant.\nIn my own department, the State Department, those with immigrant roots are leading vital parts of our foreign policy every single day.\nUzra Zeya, whose family immigrated from India to the United States in the 1960s.\u00a0 She now helps uphold human rights around the world as our Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights.\nJulieta Noyes, whose parents fled repression in Cuba.\u00a0 She now helps support persecuted and vulnerable people around the world as our Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.\nAnd Sarah Majzoub, whose parents immigrated from Lebanon, established a successful architectural firm in the United States.\u00a0 She\u2019s now one of my closest aides in my office; she\u2019s a crucial part of making sure that I\u2019m as well-prepared as I can be each and every day.\nSimply put, we could not do American diplomacy without them and without so many other colleagues, who started someplace else and are now here as Americans.\u00a0 And we wouldn\u2019t want to.\u00a0 Our foreign policy is stronger, it\u2019s more effective, because of their service.\u00a0 We come from the most diverse country on Earth.\u00a0 We\u2019re operating in a world that\u2019s incredibly diverse.\u00a0 By definition, this diversity is the source of our strength, and if we\u2019re not making full use of it, we\u2019re shortchanging ourselves.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working every day to make sure that we are making full use of our diversity.\nHere at this Passport Agency in Philadelphia, there\u2019s a mural called The Seeker, by Philadelphia-based artist Michelle Angela Ortiz, who we\u2019re fortunate to have with us today.\u00a0 And I saw her a little bit earlier.\nIt depicts three large circles. \u00a0I hope you get a chance to see it.\u00a0 The first two circles show a host of memories: a girl reconnecting with her grandmother in Korea; a wedding in Jamaica; postcards from Panama, among many others.\nAnd then the third circle shows a young woman, \u201cthe seeker,\u201d who\u2019s looking at these memories\u00a0\u2013 which reflect a tiny sampling of the many experiences that the immigrants carry with them from a past land \u2013 looking at these memories as she forges her path in the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s an experience that binds so many of us together in this country.\u00a0 Here \u2013 as the paper that she\u2019s holding in her hands reads \u2013 we become \u201cout of many, one.\u201d\nSo I hope that you too carry your past with pride, that you share your experiences from your home countries with your new communities.\u00a0 The diverse tapestry of this country is enriched by these perspectives, these experiences, by your citizenship, by your very being.\nSo finally and simply put, I want to say thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for choosing us.\u00a0 Thank you for making that choice.\u00a0 On behalf of the American people, let me be one of the first lucky people to say:\u00a0 Welcome home, my fellow Americans.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Applause.)\nMR SPALTER:\u00a0 All right, good afternoon.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Good afternoon.\nMR SPALTER:\u00a0 Twenty-four candidates from 17 countries came here today to pledge allegiance to the United States of America.\u00a0 Candidates, I will now call the names of your country of nationality.\u00a0 I ask that you please stand and remain standing until all countries have been called.\nAlbania.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBelarus.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBhutan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Bhutan?\nMR SPALTER:\u00a0 Bhutan.\u00a0 There you go.\nChina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nGuinea.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHonduras.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIraq.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nJamaica.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nLiberia.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNepal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe Philippines.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nRussia.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSouth Korea.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTrinidad and Tobago.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTunisia.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUkraine.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd Uzbekistan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nGood afternoon, Secretary Blinken.

This was a post office before \u2013 as Philadelphia\u2019s (inaudible) post office, before it became now the passport agency.

Borlaug International Dialogue", "location": "Des Moines, Iowa", "date": "October 18, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDR. CARY FOWLER: Thank you, Barbara. It\u2019s such an honor to be with all of you today in this place on this day. Years ago, I attended a lecture by Jack Harlan. Dr. Harlan was a geneticist. He was a plant explorer. He was an agricultural historian. Worked at the University of Illinois most of his career.\nAnd the lecture was entitled Self-Perception and The Origins of Agriculture. I\u2019ll never forget it. His point was that how you believe agriculture began has a lot to do with who you are with the perch you occupy in life.\nIf you are an academic you might be tempted to think, well, agriculture must have been invented or discovered by some particularly clever person about 12,000 years ago. If you were very religiously inclined, you would think well, it was a gift from the gods. In most religions, in fact, have a story to explain the origins of Agriculture.\nLikewise today, I think how we understand the current global food crisis and certainly the solutions that we tout, these have to do with who we are and what perch we occupy. If your only tool is a hammer, you will\u2013 you know how that ends.\nSo, I\u2019m certainly as vulnerable to myopia as anyone, I realized that. I realized that the current crisis is as Barbara mentioned, multi-causal. There\u2019s COVID. There\u2019s climate. There\u2019s conflict. But there are also a lot of other things, very high fuel prices, a fertilizer situation, export bans, low, by historical standpoints, grain stockpiles, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut I cannot personally shake the belief that on the list of the 5, or list of the top 10 most important challenges that we face in regards to food security. That climate is 1, 3, 5. When I became executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust back in 2005, I remember saying at my very first staff meeting that this was a climate change organization. I think they thought I was a crazy at that time. But it was a climate change organization because climate changes everything.\nLast month was the 453rd consecutive month in which the global average temperature for that month exceeded the 20th century average. 453 consecutive months of above average temperatures. Of course, higher average temperatures are not the only thing that\u2019s happening with climate change. We\u2019re having more extremes. We\u2019re having longer periods of hot weather.\nAnd this is causing species to migrate. And so, we\u2019re in the midst of seeing new and unique combinations of species in the field\u2013 in agricultural fields around the world. We\u2019re going to have some surprises. They\u2019re not all going to be good ones.\nTake a look at this histogram just briefly. The blue bars there representing a historical distribution of average growing season temperatures in Zambia. The legend is a little bit missing for the red bars. But the red bars are the projection for what will happen between 2040 and 2060.\nAnd what you\u2019ll notice, and I\u2019ll draw your attention to is where they overlap. What this means is that in the future, the best growing seasons of the future will closely resemble the worst of the past. Let that sink in. If you go out in time a little bit further, you\u2019ll see how they actually, almost completely diverge.\nThis is the type of situation that we are going to be dealing with in the future. And I think that the assumption that we can somehow look into the rearview mirror for guidance about the future and that crop production is going to magically continue its historic upward trend. Why?\nBecause well, of course, we need it to.\nThis assumption has really outlived its usefulness. Should we worry about maize and wheat and rice and soy? Absolutely. But these are the crops that are attracting and have attracted historically the most research funding. So, I\u2019m worried about everything else as well about the not so minor, minor crops. These are what you might call orphan crops. They\u2019re orphan crops because they have a lot of potential, but we haven\u2019t been investing in them.\nRoots and tubers, fruits and vegetables, the minor millets, teff, on and on. The crops that are so vitally important for nutrition if you think about nutrition as being more than calories. For many of these crops, there are very few plant breeders. For some crops like yams, for example, there are probably fewer than 10 plant breeders in the entire world. And a lot of crops, perhaps half of the crops that are grown today, have never had a single Mendelian trained plant breeder working on them throughout agricultural history.\nSo, we justifiably I think will focus on how many people do yams feed. But increasingly, I think what we have to ask ourselves is, how many people do yams depend on. And in this case, it\u2019s not many.\nSo how is it that crops evolve? Well, they\u2019re domesticated. Think about that word, domicile, domestic. They\u2019ve entered the home. Their future is literally in our hands. Their adaptation is in our hands.\nThey adapt by formal plant breeding and/or by farmers making selections based on diversity, or they don\u2019t adapt at all. So, we may want to learn a little bit from our own history in the United States. After all, when wheat came to the United States from the Near East, when soy came from Asia, when potatoes migrated northward from the Andes, when sorghum came from Africa, think about it.\nWhen all of these crops first came to the United States, they were experiencing climate change from their native habitats. How did they evolve? How was it that they came to be grown under over such vast acreages in the United States? The answer lies in the selection that farmers made with the diversity that our own government provided them potentially particularly back in the 1800s.\nI will go backwards here for a second. Yeah. So, I think that aside from the top five crops that we have in the world today, basically all of our crops are orphan crops in the countries in which they\u2019re grown. Ideally, I think what we should be doing is to identify the crops that are or could be most important for nutrition. We should be assessing how climate change will affect them. And then with this foundation, we should be ramping up to help those crops, those domesticated crops, those crops in our hands to cope with the climate change that\u2019s on our doorstep right now.\nWe luckily have great resources in the gene banks around the world. We have perhaps 1.5 million to 2 million unique samples of crop diversity that wait to be explored and exploited for the challenge that lies ahead with climate change. Now, in closing, I want to take you back into history a little bit and I want to mention three incredibly important things that happened in a single year in the 1800s, and that year is 1859.\nThe first thing that happened was that in 1859, Edwin Drake drilled the first commercial oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania. The second thing that happened, happened at the hands of this man named John Tyndall in the UK. John Tyndall in the laboratory discovered and proved that CO2 traps heat. And thus, he in a sense discovered the greenhouse effect that was about to be created by the first slide that I showed you about the drilling of oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania.\nAnd the third thing, of course, was the publication in 1859 of Charles Darwin\u2019s book \u201cOn the Origin of Species by Natural Selection\u201d. Darwin put together four basic steps or ingredients that you have to have for evolution, otherwise known as adaptation. We \u2013 he understood that there was inheritance, and that there was diversity. The first chapter of \u201cOrigin of Species\u201d is called variation under domestication. It was about agricultural crops and domesticated species.\nIf you have inheritance which we do, if you have diversity and if you have natural selection working on that diversity, then over time you have adaptation. Well, we still have inheritance, we do have diversity, we still have natural selection, but we don\u2019t have a lot of is time at the moment. And that\u2019s where-we come in.\nThe first two of these events from 1859 presaged the crisis of climate change and food security. The third points to a solution that we have yet fully to grasp. And that solution at least in part and here\u2019s where I acknowledge my own myopia has to do with crop diversity.\nThe very ending of origin of Species by Darwin in his last paragraph he sums up the book and his feelings about what he has uncovered. That last paragraph is to me, it\u2019s like a Bach cantata. It is rich and it is exquisite. And I want to read that last paragraph to you in closing.\nDarwin says, \u201cThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one\u2013 and that, while this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed laws of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.\u201d My friends, I submit to you that this is what we need to keep alive if we hope to have food security in a climate changing world. Thank you.\nBARBARA STINSON: Have a seat.\nDR. FOWLER: OK. Thank you. Pretty warming.\nBARBARA STINSON: We have a few more minutes. So, we\u2019re going to continue the conversation just a bit. Thank you so much for your comments and perspective that you bring in global crop diversity, coming to this position now at the State Department. Just say a little bit about your position as Special Envoy to Global Food Security, it\u2019s a recent appointment. And what is on your agenda as you proceed these especially in these first few months.\nDR. FOWLER: OK. Well, if you were to read the job description that I finally found in the global food security strategy, I don\u2019t want you to look at it because you\u2019ll blame me for anything going wrong.\nBARBARA STINSON: OK. Fair enough.\nDR. FOWLER: It\u2019s a humbling position. It\u2019s\u2013 it is the\u2013 I guess the highest ranking position at the State Department dealing with global food security. So we have a lot to do with diplomacy issues, with coordination, and collaboration with other departments and agencies.\nI think what\u2013 what I have wanted to bring to the position, however, is a more long term view. There is obviously a great deal of attention that gets focused on the immediate humanitarian side of the food crisis. And I don\u2019t begrudge people working on that at all.\nBut I think we have to realize that the humanitarian need is going to overwhelm us unless we put into place the kinds of programs that will help ramp up agricultural production. So people\u2013 countries around the world can be more self-sufficient. So, we\u2019re very interested at the State Department and my office in looking at initiatives that I think will pay off in a big way. The moonshot kind of initiatives that have a lot of cost benefit.\nAnd in that regard, I\u2019ll just mention that we will be trying to be a catalyst for what I mentioned from the podium about assessing crops, importance to nutrition, about their effect, their impact\u2013 the impact that climate change is having, and about trying to catalyze programs in the future that will help those crops adapt to climate change.\nBARBARA STINSON: Wonderful. Well, it\u2019s great to hear that perspective on the work that\u2019s ahead of you. And I really appreciate it in your comments both your advice not necessarily to be able to look into the rearview mirror to find the answers but also to consider 1859 and those seminal events that you mentioned.\nSo, let\u2019s talk just a little bit about the assessment charge that you\u2019re taking up assessing the impact on crops of climate change. This is the business of Cynthia Rosenzweig and those at NASA and the GISS, the Goddard Institute, and particularly her argument project. Can you just say a little bit about the assessment not only of impact on nutrition of climate change but some of the other aspects that you\u2019re hoping to focus on.\nDR. FOWLER: Yeah. Well, yes. Obviously, climate change is having a huge impact already on nutrition. It has deleterious impacts on the actual nutrition of our crops. It lowers the nutritional value of a lot of our crops.\nBut looking forward, one of the things that\u2019s amazed me and frustrated me, frankly, is looking at projections of future food demand. You can go in the academic literature, and you\u2019ll find many, many articles out there about what the food demand is going to be in 2050. Generally speaking, we need to produce 50% to 60% more food by 2050.\nAnd very often, those same articles will give a projection of how much food we will produce. And that\u2019s where the reference to the rearview mirror comes in because I think for the most part, we are looking in the rearview mirror when we project future food production. And you can see the projections being roughly in the realm of 50% more about 2050.\nIf you want to scare yourself though look at the footnotes. And the footnotes will say, well, this projection doesn\u2019t take into consideration climate change, conflict, food, and price inflation, et cetera, et cetera. In other words, all the things that we\u2019re having today.\nIf you in turn go to some of the climate people and look at\u2013 at what they\u2019re projecting for individual crops, well, you see that May\u2019s experts will tell you that one degree centigrade increase in climate will increase pest and disease damage by 10% to 20%. And in some areas of Africa, you can get the projection that well by 2050 with the climate change that they\u2019re looking at there, we won\u2019t be producing 50% more food, we\u2019ll be producing 10% less, and that\u2019s a big variance.\nSo, I think that perhaps one of the things that we can do at the State Department we\u2019re not an implementing agency. We don\u2019t have these types on the ground. Programs is to sound the alarm and to say that let\u2019s be careful. Let\u2019s not make assumptions about future food production.\nLet\u2019s look at what the needs are going to be in the future. And let\u2019s plan backwards from that. And let\u2019s put the programs and the investments in place that we really need to ensure that we can produce the food to feed everyone.\nTremendous perspective really to offer. Can you say a little bit more about the orphan crops \u2013 about the crops that have been considered minor crops and yet we know we need to emphasize that diversity in production going forward. How do you see it?\nWell, I think there are actually two categories at least in my mind of orphan crops. And the first category are of really important crops that we don\u2019t think of as being orphans, but they are. So, that would be anything other than the top four or five crops.\nCrops that are receiving some investment and are very popular and well-known crops, sorghum would be one. Frankly speaking, potatoes and sweet potatoes. And a lot of those types of crops and virtually all the vegetables would be in that category. Simply not receiving the amount of investment that they deserve if you\u2019re considering food security as being as nutrition as being central to food security.\nThe second category that worries me even more would be crops that we take totally for granted. This would be African leafy greens, for example. Crops that are part of the household gardens and developing countries for which there are no plant breeders at all.\nAnd here again, we have to be careful about the assumptions we\u2019re making. Are we assuming that those crops magically are going to be adapted to climates that have never before existed in the history of agriculture simply because we want them to and need them to. That to me is a dangerous assumption. So, we do need to be devoting some attention to those crops as well because they\u2019re disproportionately I think important\u2013 particularly to women, to children because of the supply of micronutrients and very often grown in household gardens.\nBARBARA STINSON: Well, thank you so much. I know everyone appreciates hearing not only your in-depth scientific experience that you bring but that broad policy and diplomatic role that you\u2019ll have in your position. We\u2019re coming up to COP 27. Tell us a little bit about the United States \u2013 not an official position but really what do you\u2013 what are you expecting coming up next month.\nDR. FOWLER: Well, I think COP 27 offers all of us an enormous opportunity to look at the question of crop adaptation\u2013 agricultural systems adaptation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that agriculture hasn\u2019t been let\u2019s say given its due at many of the previous cops, but now here we are. And I think we really have to take advantage of this because frankly, if our agricultural systems don\u2019t adapt to climate change, if our crops don\u2019t adapt to climate change, our crops being on the front lines, if they don\u2019t adapt to climate change, then neither will we.\nAnd so all of our hopes and dreams if you\u2019re an environmentalist or whatever, we\u2019ll, really go down the tubes if we don\u2019t have a successful agricultural system. At the end of the day, we all know that people will do what they need to do to try to feed themselves and their families. And there are many studies out there that will tell you that low productivity agricultural systems lead to environmental degradation.\nIt was only the middle of the 1980s when we saw quite a historic transformation. In the middle of the 1980s for the first time in human history that we were producing more food, the incremental amounts that we were producing every year came from intensification of Agriculture rather than cutting down trees and expanding our croplands. Do we want to go back to what has been the most historically prominent way of increasing food production, which is to cut down more trees and expand cropland or are we satisfied with the route that we\u2019re on now, which is to make better use of the resources that we already have? And I think that\u2019s a message that needs to get out at COP 27.\nBARBARA STINSON: Food productivity over just flat food production.\nDR. FOWLER: Yeah.\nBARBARA STINSON: Well, thank you so much for all of these perspectives. I want to connect part of what you\u2019re talking about with regard to adaptation and the mitigation opportunities within agriculture to the work that Cynthia Rosenzweig is doing and the sessions that we\u2019ll have tomorrow to really explore that the assessment potential of the models that are being used worldwide already. And I just\u2013 I want to thank you for rooting us in history in this conversation.\nI know you\u2019ve laid out some themes that we\u2019ll draw on throughout the discussion. So, thank you so much for your time today and for being with us. And you\u2019re here with us throughout the week, I think.\nDR. FOWLER: I am.\nBARBARA STINSON: I appreciate that.\nDR.

highlighting the ESMA Site Museum in Buenos Aires and its importance to the process of memory, truth, and justice in Argentina.\u00a0 I want to thank Ambassador Arguello for this invitation and the dedication of the Embassy of Argentina staff.\nThe United States applauds Argentina\u2019s recognition of the atrocities that took place during its last military dictatorship.\u00a0 We understand that confronting a painful past is a difficult process but one that is critical to address the need for justice and reconciliation.\u00a0 The steps Argentina has taken in this regard, including criminal trials of former members of the military, demonstrate how far your country has come.\u00a0 Steps to address the human rights violations of the past, in combination with all the complementary work that has been done over the years to seek justice for victims and survivors, demonstrate the unrelenting courage and strength of the Argentinian people and their commitment to human rights.\nBeing a present-day champion of human rights requires addressing the human rights violations of the past.\u00a0 In the case of the ESMA premises, this means acknowledging the horrific acts that were perpetrated there and honoring the memory of the individuals who were kidnapped, tortured, and disappeared, as well as the countless children who were \u201cstolen.\u201d\u00a0 By sensitively preserving the site as a memorial to those individuals, your government is bearing witness to human rights violations and condemning the acts that were committed there.\nI want to applaud the cooperation between the Government of Argentina and Argentine civil society on the ESMA project.\u00a0 The ESMA memorial and what it represents would not have been possible without the work of groups like the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who kept pressure on previous administrations to prioritize transparency and justice for the victims.\nHonoring the memory of those who suffered unspeakable abuses and those who were disappeared not only provides a measure of justice to their loved ones but serves as reminder to future generations that human rights and democracy must remain at the core of our two countries\u2019 domestic politics and foreign policy.\u00a0 It is in this spirit that we look forward to further cooperation in our multilateral initiatives to prioritize human rights in the western hemisphere and throughout the world, in the OAS, the Human Rights Council, and beyond.\nThe United States and Argentina, of course, already work closely on many shared values \u2013 transparency, justice, human rights, and democracy.\u00a0 Our partnership to promote and protect the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons, strengthen worker rights in global supply chains, combat antisemitism and promote racial equity, and support transitional justice and accountability is extremely important not only for Argentina but also for the world.\u00a0 Our human rights collaboration has shined a light on violations occurring in Syria, Ukraine, and Sri Lanka, to name a few, and it serves as an example to every country on what upholding universal human rights standards and the tenets of the UN Charter are all about.\nI would also like to commend Argentina for your commitment to inclusive democracy where all individuals are valued, respected and included in the governing process.\u00a0 Throughout this Summit for Democracy Year of Action, I encourage us to remain focused on ensuring that our democracies deliver for all of our people, and we welcome Argentina\u2019s leadership in this regard.\nAmbassador Arguello, in visiting this space you and your staff have created here, and in reflecting on the abuses suffered by thousands of men, women and children at the former ESMA site in Buenos Aires, I think once more of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo\u2014the \u201cAbuelas\u201d\u2014who reminded us that it is our duty to keep the memory, to keep talking tirelessly, to clarify and spread the truth, and to enlighten the minds of those who still refuse to understand.\nAmbassador, thank you once again for inviting me to be present at the dedication of this powerful and moving memorial space.\n\n"}, {"url":

"speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Hoover Institution", "location": "Stanford University, Stanford, California", "date": "October 17, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY MATTIS: Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s event, a conversation between former Secretary of State Dr. Condoleezza Rice and our current Secretary of State Tony Blinken. At a time when America is navigating its role in a changing world, today\u2019s talk in the finest tradition of the great university where we meet offers a unique opportunity to delve into important issues.\nI\u2019m Jim Mattis, a Fellow here at Hoover, where we seek to improve the human condition by advancing ideas that promote economic opportunity while safeguarding peace. Thanks to their record of devoted service to our nation, little introduction is needed for these two patriots. America is one great, big, promising, exasperating, inspiring, and vexing experiment with all the political volatility inherent to a free and open society.\nAdmired leadership in our republic calls for certain characteristics: first, a humble awareness of each generation\u2019s responsibility to improve on this experiment in forming a more perfect union; and second, competence. The two citizens on this stage are exemplars of both characteristics. Dr. Rice\u2019s contribution over many years of leadership cannot be summed up in a few words. Suffice that through merit, conviction, and a keen perceptiveness of the world we must live in, she rose to the apex of our government, ultimately splitting eight years of leadership between service as our National Security Advisor and as our 66th Secretary of State. We\u2019re proud to call her boss and coach of the Hoover team.\nSecretary Blinken has also accumulated a lengthy portfolio of foreign affairs experience before becoming our Secretary of State. It wasn\u2019t long after graduation from Harvard and Columbia that he entered government service, ultimately serving as the Deputy National Security Advisor and Deputy Secretary of State following his time on Capitol Hill, where he served as the staff director for the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee.\nIn a recent talk with graduates, he suggested that if they\u2019re going to spend a lot of their lives at work, then they should work at something they love. Our nation is fortunate that both these leaders devote their best efforts to something they love, and that is America. In so doing, their leadership by example reminds each of us that government service in a democracy is both privilege and responsibility. As problem solvers during these tumultuous years, their leadership forged trust while navigating maddeningly complex issues. Holding our values foremost, they have dealt pragmatically with a swiftly changing world filled by the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nThey have done so while listening and maintaining respect for those who disagreed with them, strengthening a necessary attribute for leadership in a democracy. Today\u2019s discussion will focus on the evolution and importance of technology, diplomacy, and national security \u2013 familiar topics here in Silicon Valley and highly relevant across our nation and round the world.\nHoover Institution was established to advance the principles of freedom. We ask bold questions and propose solutions to help guide American policy at home and abroad. In that spirit and consistent with Stanford\u2019s role of promoting the free competition of ideas, let\u2019s get started. First a conversation, then Q&A. Again, please give a hearty welcome to Secretaries Blinken and Rice. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY RICE: Well, thank you very much. But before we get started, I just have to say that that gentleman, Secretary Mattis, served as our Secretary of Defense but also many years of service as a Marine, something also carried by a great patron of this place, George Shultz. And so I\u2019d like you to give Secretary Mattis a hand, please. (Applause.)\nWelcome. Welcome to Stanford. Welcome to Hoover. Welcome to the Silicon Valley.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It\u2019s wonderful to be back. Thank you.\nSECRETARY RICE: And it\u2019s probably nice to be here, right?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: There\u2019s something about occasionally getting out of Washington that isn\u2019t a bad thing. (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah, it\u2019s a good thing. A good thing, right. (Laughter.)\nWell, we\u2019re going to have a conversation and then we will open for a few questions and answers. I\u2019m still a professor; I will call on somebody if nobody raises their hand \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 so get ready with your questions.\nYou\u2019ve just had a pretty momentous week, and I don\u2019t just mean what\u2019s going on in the world, but I mean the release of the National Security Strategy. And for those who don\u2019t fully follow these things, I think the National Security Strategy is an opportunity for the President to really ask his team: What should we be doing now to prepare for a better future? And the National Security Strategy has a number of elements that I\u2019d like you to speak to, and I\u2019m going to start with one that\u2019s kind of near and dear to the heart of every secretary of state probably going back to our long-long-time predecessor Thomas Jefferson. In case you didn\u2019t know it, he was the first secretary of state.\nBut you start with talking about American values but also the competition between autocracy and democracy. Can you expand a little bit on how you think about this moment? The United States has had many competitors across its history, but this particular moment, how do you think about this big issue?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, first let me just say how wonderful it is to be back at Stanford, to be with my friend Dr. Rice. Jim, I\u2019ve been an admirer of yours and your leadership for many, many years, and today you again reaffirmed why you have such a strong, powerful, eloquent voice. It\u2019s great to be with you. Thank you.\nAnd first of all, I\u2019m wondering: Do you have classes? (Laughter.) What \u2013 are you getting credit? (Laughter.)\nOne of the things that I think is almost visceral to us right now is that we\u2019re at an inflection point. And to put it in broad perspective, the post Cold War era is over and there is now an intense competition underway to shape what comes next. That\u2019s the moment we think that we\u2019re living in.\nPart of this is the renewed but also new great power competition, and that\u2019s very much at the heart of the strategy. Part of this is trying to figure out ways, and in ways that we haven \u2018t before, how to solve some really big challenges that are actually having a direct impact on the lives of our people, whether it is global health \u2013 and we\u2019ve been living through COVID \u2013 whether it\u2019s the impact of climate change, whether it\u2019s just the role of all of the emerging technologies, so many of them coming from here, that are shaping our lives. All of that is reflected in the strategy.\nNow, this is \u2013 Dr. Rice and I both worked on a few of these in our time. Rarely have so many labored for so long \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: And you can drop the Dr. Rice if you \u2013 right, right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. But rarely \u2013 I think we would both say rarely have so many in government worked for so long on something read by so few. (Laughter.) But having said that, it is an important document because it does try to give coherence to what we\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s important across the government so that all of the different agencies and departments are kind of working off of the same blueprint, and internationally so that both friend and foe alike have a good idea about what we\u2019re all about, why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing, why we\u2019re saying what we\u2019re saying.\nSECRETARY RICE: You talked about the great power rivalry, and this is something that I don\u2019t think we really ever thought we would see again after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But indeed it has come back and it\u2019s come back with force, and I\u2019d like you to address the two big rivals.\nThe National Security Strategy talks about restraining Russia and outcompeting China, and that\u2019s two very different ways to think about the great powers. So \u2013 and perhaps you want to weave a little bit of Ukraine into the Russia story, but can you start with restraining Russia \u2013 some would say a declining power in the great power competition, but one that is on the front pages now every day?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think declining power is probably a fair assessment, but one that has an enormous capacity if it chooses to use it to do damage, to be a disrupter. And of course, we see that front and center on our front pages every day in Ukraine.\nWhen we started out \u2013 and again, we\u2019ve both been dealing with this for a long time, and Condi knows more \u2013 has in a sense forgotten more about Russia than I\u2019ll know for many years of working these issues. I think many administrations have come in with the hope that we might have a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia precisely because we have so many big things that we want to be working on that go to the betterment of the lives of our people and people around the world.\nHowever, Russia \u2013 especially under President Putin \u2013 is a major disrupter and one that can make tremendous trouble. We see that in Ukraine. But we see it in its basic opposition and Putin\u2019s basic opposition to the order that emerged after two World Wars and then after the Cold War with a basic set of rules and principles that we thought were necessary to try to help keep international peace and security.\nThis is in direct opposition to what President Putin is trying to do in reconstituting \u2013 take your pick \u2013 a Russian empire or a Soviet one. And it\u2019s manifesting itself in the actions he\u2019s taken. We\u2019ve seen this play out over the last almost decade now. But for us \u2013 and I\u2019ll just say this very briefly \u2013 the reason there\u2019s so much focus on Ukraine is twofold. One is Ukraine itself. I think it bothers all of us profoundly when one country tries to lord it over another, when it tries to assert a world in which might makes right, in which it changes borders by force, in which it tries to subjugate another country to its will. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\nBut what\u2019s also going in this: It\u2019s not only an aggression against Ukraine. It is an aggression against the basic principles that are embodied in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a whole series of norms and rules that many generations labored to build. And are they perfect? Far from it. Have we made many mistakes both in designing them and in their application? Yes. But fundamentally they have helped make sure that we didn\u2019t have another global conflict after two world wars. And what Russia is doing, what Putin is doing, is in direct opposition to those.\nSECRETARY RICE: It\u2019s not your job exclusively, but there are Americans who say: Why Ukraine? Why not Peoria or Des Moines? And you just talked about the rules-based order. Can you sharpen it for Americans as to why this conflict is so important? Because this may go on a while, and we may have to sustain American support and therefore democratic support for a long time.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: At least from my perspective, if we and others are not standing up for these basic understandings, these basic rules, the idea that countries\u2019 independence should be respected, its territorial integrity should be respected, not changed by force; if we don\u2019t stand up for that \u2013 and we can do that in a variety of ways, which we can come to \u2013 if we don\u2019t stand up to that where it\u2019s being challenged, then the risk you have is opening a Pandora\u2019s box, where aggressors \u2013 not just in Europe, not just Russia \u2013 will take a lesson and say: I can act with impunity; I can do this. And that\u2019s going to stir up conflicts in many parts of the world.\nAnd the one thing we know from history is that inevitably, one way or another, this pulls us in. And if we can do whatever we can to prevent rather than having to respond and to make sure that some of these rules are upheld \u2013 even as we try to modernize them even as we try to make sure that they reflect the world that we\u2019re living in, not just the world that they were written in, which in many cases was 70 years ago \u2013 I think it\u2019s clearly in our interest to do that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to show in Ukraine.\nSECRETARY RICE: Right. Let\u2019s talk about the other great power. I\u2019ll come to a regional power in a moment, but let\u2019s talk about the great power, China. Big party congress going on. Lots at stake. Xi Jinping is likely to be coronated for his third term. And he\u2019s been a little bit of a different Chinese leader. It used to be said of Chinese leaders, when I was there \u2013 Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin before him \u2013 \u201chide and bide.\u201d Just keep developing China \u2013 the Chinese would always say, \u201cOh, we\u2019re just a developing country; we don\u2019t really do foreign policy.\u201d\nWell, Xi Jinping has a quite different view of China\u2019s role. And 30-plus years of kind of a integrationist narrative about China seems to be coming apart. You\u2019ve called it \u201coutcompeting\u201d China, which I think is an interesting concept. So talk about China and the United States in this regard.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, you\u2019re exactly right. We\u2019ve seen a very different China emerge in recent years under Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership. It is more repressive at home, it\u2019s more aggressive abroad, and in many instances that poses a challenge to our own interests, as well as to our own values. But I also think it\u2019s important not to reduce this to a bumper sticker. This relationship is among the most consequential that we have. It\u2019s among the most challenging we have. It\u2019s among the most complicated that we have. And what we\u2019ve seen in recent years is the emergence of \u2013 or clearly adversarial aspects to the relationship; for sure \u2013 and I\u2019ll come back to it quickly \u2013 competitive aspects; but there also remain cooperative aspects. And we can\u2019t lose sight of those, because some of the really big problems that we have to find ways to solve are a lot harder to solve if the United States and China are not actually engaged in trying to solve them: climate, global health, et cetera.\nBut the competitive aspect is front and center, because this is, as I suggested, at least from our perspective, a competition to shape what comes next after this post-Cold War period. What does it look like? Whose values are going to be reflected in what we do? And from our perspective at least, we have a basic choice, because we find \u2013 and I think this has been evident over the \u2013 especially over the period since the Second World War \u2013 the world doesn\u2019t organize itself. And for the United States, the choice is this: If we\u2019re not playing a part in the organizing, if we\u2019re not taking a leadership role in that, then one of two things \u2013 either someone else is, and it may well be China, and there, again, probably not in a way that fully reflects our interests and values; or maybe just as bad, no one\u2019s doing it, and then you tend to have vaccums that get filled with bad things before they get filled with good things.\nSo we have an interest in engaging, we have an interest in leading, and we have an interest in making sure that, to the extent we\u2019re in competition over what this new thing looks like, we are bringing everything to the table. In my own judgment, China also wants an order, but it\u2019s a profoundly illiberal order. The order that we seek \u2013 again, imperfectly \u2013 is a more liberal one, and that\u2019s what that competition is about.\nSECRETARY RICE: I\u2019m going to come back to how we do this, because you talk a lot about investing in our own strengths \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah.\nSECRETARY RICE: \u2014 but I want to stay for a moment on the relationship with China. You gave a very good speech a few months ago in which you talked about \u2013 I\u2019d call it a rather nuanced approach to China. As you\u2019ve said, that there\u2019s some areas of conflict, some areas of competition, and some areas of cooperation. Pretty quickly, the Chinese came out and said: not gonna happen \u2013 let me put it that way \u2013 because we can\u2019t delink these things. Do you have some hope that there might still be room? Maybe after the party congress is over, maybe after our own version of the party congress, the midterms, are over \u2013 then would there be room, and where would you see those potential areas of cooperation with China?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: The world fundamentally expects this of us, so whether China wants to find ways to cooperate or not on particularly climate, global health, maybe counternarcotics, even if they don\u2019t want to, there\u2019s a huge demand signal from the world. They expect us to try to find ways to advance these issues, and if we can, together, because it\u2019s affecting them as well as us.\nWe know we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with climate as we should if China is not part of the picture. It\u2019s going to have to decide; we can\u2019t decide for it. It has to decide whether it\u2019s in its interests, but it\u2019s also getting pressure from others around the world to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.\nSame thing on global health. And this is not about pointing fingers for the pandemic \u2013 it\u2019s about figuring out how do we build a more secure global health system so that this doesn\u2019t happen again. China needs to be part of that answer. But it\u2019s going to have to judge for itself whether, in its relationship with us, it finds ways to pursue cooperation, whether it just has to be responsive to demand signals that it\u2019s getting from countries around the world to be a positive actor, not a negative actor, on issues that concern them \u2013 not just China, not just the United States.\nSECRETARY RICE: We had reasonable cooperation at one time on another troublesome part of the world, North Korea. Obviously, it\u2019s been in the news again recently. Any thoughts on whether or not that scenario \u2013 it\u2019s really nonproliferation. Do you really want nuclear weapons in the hands of, shall we say, troublesome regimes like the North Koreans?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: This has been a challenge going back every administration I think we were each involved in, in one way or another, and one that has manifestly not gotten better over the years. I think from the leadership\u2019s perspective in North Korea, part of what we\u2019re seeing is it doesn\u2019t like to be ignored.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And so when the world is focused elsewhere, this is a reminder that: We\u2019re still here. We\u2019re still a problem. You have to deal with it.\nBut there\u2019s something else going on as well. Over the last months, going back about a year, we have significantly increased our own work with our allies and partners in the region \u2013 South Korea, Japan \u2013 both on a bilateral basis where we\u2019ve, for example, renewed exercises that we\u2019d had for years that were put in abeyance a few years ago \u2013 we brought them back, military exercises, to make sure that we could defend and hopefully deter any kind of North Korean aggression \u2013 as well as work that\u2019s being done now in ways that it hadn\u2019t been in recent years among the United States, Japan, Korea together, which has lots of benefits, including bringing Korea and Japan closer together. I think that Kim Jong-un saw that and didn\u2019t like it, and it\u2019s a response to that.\nWe\u2019ve taken a variety of actions, including at the United Nations, including strengthening even more our defense and deterrence, but it is an ongoing problem. And it does go, Condi, to exactly what you\u2019re talking about, which are concerns about broader proliferation. At the end of the day, one of the most important and powerful things about trying to continue to advance nonproliferation, preventing the spread of weapons, as well as arms control ourselves and being responsible actors under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, is making sure that we don\u2019t have a world where a whole variety of countries conclude that they\u2019re going to be better off if they acquire nuclear weapons that they don\u2019t have. And we know that that\u2019s a world that\u2019s going to be even more fraught. So we have to find ways to reinforce these norms, these rules, these standards that we\u2019ve signed on to and that need our engagement.\nSECRETARY RICE: I\u2019m going to come to technology in just a moment, I promise you, but I will get lots of messages that say you didn\u2019t ask him about Iran. Do you want to say just a word about that situation? It\u2019s extraordinary moments these days.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What we\u2019re seeing is \u2013 really is remarkable. And it starts with the incredible courage of very young people, especially women and girls, who are standing up for their most basic rights, their most fundamental freedoms, at extraordinary personal risk. And of course, we saw the prominent deaths of young women that led to this.\nBut what\u2019s powerful about it is that this is \u2013 this is grassroots, this is bottom up. This is a reflection of huge frustration and huge anger that so many in Iranian society have toward the direction of their country and toward their leadership, and they\u2019re demanding change. This is not made in the U.S.A.; it\u2019s not made anywhere else. To the extent that leaders in Iran try to point the fingers and somehow blame us, they are profoundly misreading and misunderstanding their own people and their own country, and that\u2019s going to be to their detriment.\nWhat can we do? First, we can stand and speak in solidarity with those who are simply trying to stand up for their own rights. Second, we can look at the different actors in Iran who are denying those rights and do what we can to penalize them for their actions. So we, for example, had sanctions that we put forward on the so-called morality police. And then maybe most important, and this goes directly in many ways to this community, we want to make sure that we are doing nothing that gets in the way of making sure that Iranians have the ability to the greatest extent possible of communicating with each other and connecting to the outside world, and that comes with technology. So we\u2019ve issued some licenses to make sure that we\u2019re not doing that, that people don\u2019t feel that our sanctions prohibit them from getting the technology that Iranians need to communicate with each other and with the world to the Iranian people.\nSECRETARY RICE: A little bit more activist this time than in 2012?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Each period\u2019s a little bit different.\nSECRETARY RICE: A little different, yeah. Right?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And I think \u2013 I think our voice has been very clear \u2013 not just our voice, our actions. And not just ours, countries around the world. But fundamentally, this is about the Iranian people. It\u2019s about their country. It\u2019s about their future. They will decide it. But we want to demonstrate in both practical as well as rhetorical ways our solidarity with them in this moment.\nSECRETARY RICE: So you\u2019re sitting at Stanford University in the middle of Silicon Valley. A long, long history between this place and the valley. And you are seeing and talking to the people who are really leading the technology revolutions. It goes back a long way here.\nSo in 2007 when I was secretary, I invited the then-Foreign Minister of Australia Alexander Downer here, and we have a little trip. And I got to \u2013 got to drive an experimental car called a Tesla. (Laughter.) Alexander wouldn\u2019t get in it. He wasn\u2019t sure that he wanted \u2013 well, I think it was probably the Australian secret service that didn\u2019t want him in an experimental car. But in any case, that\u2019s now a household name, maybe giving us answers to how to think about electric vehicles and climate change and the like.\nBut it says something very important about another part of the National Security Strategy, which it\u2019s \u2013 which says investing in our strengths. Very often, we get into what I call authoritarian envy. They build great airports. Democracy is so messy. But we forget that innovation has been from a place, the United States of America, that is the freest and most open. And so talk about investing in those strengths, protecting those strengths, and how that plays into the diplomacy that we must do but also the national security that we must achieve.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It\u2019s quite simply foundational, and let me say a couple of things about this. First, we go back to this proposition that we\u2019re in a moment of intense competition to shape what comes next. Technology, innovation, entrepreneurship \u2013 they are at the heart of that. This is how we are going to retool economies for the future. This is how we\u2019re going to modernize militaries as necessary. This is, through technology, how we are quite literally reshaping people\u2019s lives.\nAnd so it goes fundamentally to our national strength, but it also goes to a positive vision for the future that can be incredibly attractive for the United States around the world. Because as the technologies that are developed here \u2013 and I was just at the SLAC this morning, which is extraordinary, even for someone who probably understood about 1 percent of what I was hearing \u2013 this really does go to America\u2019s most positive role in the world.\nAs we\u2019re inventing; as you\u2019re inventing new technologies that are going to make sure that we can overcome disease and that we can actually strengthen global health and make sure that we don\u2019t have a repeat of COVID-19; as you\u2019re finding ways to make sure that we have sustainable, healthy food supplies for people around the world who so desperately need it and we\u2019re living in a moment of intense food insecurity; as you\u2019re looking at ways to make sure that we actually develop the technology to ensure an energy future that\u2019s not dependent on fossil fuels; as you\u2019re looking at ways to make sure we have secure supply chains for technology going forward and good jobs for the future; if we continue to get that right, if we continue to lead on that, if we continue to be seen as a beacon for the world, that goes directly to our standing around the world, our strength around the world in ways that I can\u2019t even begin to adequately describe.\nSo for us it starts with investing in ourselves. If you look at the so-called American Century, the second part of the 20th century, we were making these investments in ourselves in the \u201850s, the \u201860s and \u201870s in education, in research and development, in basic science, in our infrastructure. And we moved away from that. And it is not to say at all that government should be the one making all of these investments. We\u2019re never going to compete with, for example, a Chinese model that dedicates all of its state resources to a particular part of the economy, to a particular part of the world. But what we can do and do more effectively is making sure we\u2019re making these basic investments and then help catalyze, help facilitate, and ultimately help get out of the way for the private sector to really carry things forward.\nWe\u2019ve had two, at least from where I sit, enormous successes in the last few months, starting with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, a product of extraordinary work over several years by Republicans and Democrats alike to make sure that we were renewing these investments in ourselves. A lot of the focus on chips has rightly gone to renewing our ability to manufacture chips, semiconductors here in the United States, having subcontracted that out many years ago. But there are huge investments in basic science, basic research and development that are contained in the CHIPS and Science Act and the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which has the biggest commitment to dealing effectively with climate change in the history of our country, more than $350 billion. And again, a lot of that\u2019s going to investments in our own innovative capacity.\nSo I think, Condi, that is at the foundation of our strength, and it shows why the connection between what happens here and what happens around the world is stronger than it\u2019s ever been. Since we did CHIPS and since we did the IRA, I found the conversations that I\u2019m having with counterparts around the world have changed. There\u2019s now this view that, wait a minute, maybe America is getting its act together and this is something that we want to be part of.\nSECRETARY RICE: That\u2019s the positive side of it, of course, that we invest in ourselves. But there\u2019s also a question that\u2019s constantly on the table about how much we\u2019ve let out of the barn, so to speak, vis-\u00e0-vis the Chinese. They started down this road of indigenous development \u2013 in some ways hasn\u2019t gone all that well. We keep reading about problems in their own high-end chip development and the like.\nSo how do you see the balance between investing in what we do here and making sure that it doesn\u2019t escape to there? And it\u2019s particularly actually hard for a secretary of state, because one of the things that you don\u2019t want to do is make people declare loyalties. That\u2019s the quickest way to lose friends, to say you either choose China or us. That doesn\u2019t work very well diplomatically.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We both know that very well.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yes, right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And what we\u2019ve been saying is this: We\u2019re not asking people to choose; we want to give you a choice. And that means we have to have something to put on the table. A big part of what we\u2019re trying to do besides the investment in ourselves, the other \u2013 the flip side of that is trying to get greater alignment with allies, with partners, with a whole variety of countries who might not even neatly fit into the ally or partner category but who have an interest in making sure that there\u2019s a basic understanding about the rules and that everyone plays by them. So we spent a lot of time trying to re-energize and revitalize \u2013 re-engage our alliances, our partnerships.\nWe\u2019ve also been inventing or energizing some new ones \u2013 new collections of countries that may be fit for purpose on specific issues; for example, making sure we have resilient supply chains, making sure that we\u2019re on semiconductors investing together because so much of this work has to be collaborative as well, but also protecting. And in the case of the highest end semiconductors \u2013 as you know very well, there\u2019s only a small number of countries that either are manufacturing the highest end semiconductors or making the tools to manufacture the highest end semiconductors. We want to make sure that we keep those where they need to be. So this alignment with other countries trying to all move in the same direction, trying to work together on shaping some of the norms, the standards, the rules by which technology is used, that\u2019s also profoundly part of our national interest and our strength around the world.\nSECRETARY RICE: This is a question that could solicit a rather boring answer, but this is a university, so it\u2019s all right. We\u2019re accustomed to boring answers. (Laughter.) So you talked about standards. And maybe what\u2019s not fully understood is there are international efforts, international organizations where the standards are actually written \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: That\u2019s right.\nSECRETARY RICE: \u2014 for things like the internet, for questions about ships and supply chains. And the United States has always had a reputation of being fully uninterested \u2013 completely uninterested in sending people to these conferences at the assistant secretary level to spend two years, three years writing standards.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: That\u2019s right.\nSECRETARY RICE: Are you interested in this?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: I have to admit: I wasn\u2019t. All right. So now. (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Condi, I have walked out on standards in the biggest way, and we are flooding the zone for exactly that reason. Somewhere in the world on virtually any piece of technology that may be invented here, a group of people is sitting around a table in a windowless conference room writing the rules about how these are going to be used. And whoever writes the rules is going to have a powerful impact on the use of technology going forward.\nTo state the obvious, technology isn\u2019t inherently good or bad; the rules by which it\u2019s used might be. And we want to make sure that, for example, when it comes to protecting privacy, when it comes to upholding human rights, when it comes to advancing our own security, but also enhancing our competitiveness, the rules reflect that. And as the saying goes, if you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu. We want to make sure that we\u2019re at the table doing that. So, yeah, this is \u2013 sometimes it seems mind-numbing.\nWe spent a lot of time making sure \u2013 for example, there are competition for jobs in the international system, the folks who actually turn up at these meetings. Their elections, or their appointments, including in the entire United Nations system \u2013 we\u2019re spending a lot of time making sure that people that reflect our views and values are competing and winning those jobs. It really does make a difference. It does seem mind-numbing, but it\u2019s incredible how at the end of the day that\u2019s going to shape the world as well.\nSECRETARY RICE: I should probably go back and apologize to my under secretary for economics who used to try to get me to pay attention. All right. So you\u2019ve convinced me, because after all, this really is \u2013 when we talk about the competition and going back to autocracy versus democracy, if these are used in a certain way, they will be used in different ways by autocracies. So you take something like facial recognition, which might simply make it possible for you to get through an airport more quickly if you\u2019re in the United States, and China has a very different way. So I applaud your interest in this mind-numbing part of it.\nHow\u2019s it coming with others? You mentioned that we now are in the game, but when you think about particularly relations with the Europeans, we\u2019ve not always had the greatest alignment with what you think should be our closest allies on things like privacy and the like. So can you talk a little bit about relations with the Europeans? Has it been affected by the extraordinary cooperation that we\u2019re getting around Ukraine at this point? Someone said that Vladimir Putin had within a matter of months ended German pacifism and Swedish neutrality, which I think is probably true. But is it \u2013 is it having an effect?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It is remarkable the extent to which Putin has precipitated virtually everything he says he wants to prevent, particularly in terms of the so-called Western world sticking together and actually strengthening its cooperation across a whole variety of issues. I think we are making progress on this, because you\u2019re right, we have to find ways to make sure that on technology we are more aligned with other countries, starting in many cases with close partners in Europe as well as in Asia and then broadening out.\nWe have all of these different constellations, groupings, partnerships; one of them is something called the Technology and Trade Council with the European Union. And to put it in the simplest terms, this is a way of trying to make sure we\u2019re actually all rowing in the same direction when it comes to these norms, these rules, these standards, but also a whole variety of other things. If we have export controls on the highest end technology that we think should not wind up in the hands of some of our competitors, including China, if we\u2019re the only ones doing it and others are not abiding by them, then it\u2019s not going to work. So we have to try to get alignment there, and we are.\nIf we want to make sure that when we have concerns about some of the investment that\u2019s coming into our own countries that may be going to critical industries, critical companies, ones that are \u2013 that affect our security, we want to make sure that countries have the tools to look at those investments and decide whether this is something they want to go forward or not. We\u2019re working on those together with the European Union. We\u2019re thinking about critical supply chains and particularly for semiconductors. We\u2019ve seen what happened when these get disrupted. We\u2019re designing together an early warning system so that if we see a disruption anywhere in a supply chain for a critical component \u2013 first of all going to semiconductors but broadening out to other technologies \u2013 a flashing red light goes off and we can act on it together. All of these things are bringing us into closer alignment.\nNow, having said that, we have differences of view, differences of perspective \u2013 just as we have within our own country, because obviously we don\u2019t have a unified technology policy in our own country \u2013 that are always going to be there. We also have competition with some of our closest friends. We have \u2013 we\u2019re competing with Europeans, but we both fundamentally have the same interest in a system where people who play by the basic rules; where privacy is respected, even if we have different perspectives on the best way to do that; where our security is upheld, where human rights are respected, and where we can enhance our competitiveness. So the question is can we find ways to design those together, come into agreement. And then finally this: Competition when it\u2019s fair, when it\u2019s on a level playing field, when it\u2019s a race to the top, is good. That\u2019s what our own system is all about.\nSo for us it\u2019s not saying, oh, we have to avoid competition with friends and partners and allies; it\u2019s, on the contrary, making sure that together that competition is fair, it\u2019s transparent, it has the rights of workers in mind, it has the environment in mind, it has protection of intellectual property in mind. And if we do that, then countries that don\u2019t abide by the same way of doing things will have to decide are they going to get into the race to the top with us and raise their own standards, raise their own game \u2013 that\u2019s good for the world \u2013 or not.\nSECRETARY RICE: So let\u2019s go now from out there to Foggy Bottom, to the place that you work, the State Department, and talk a little bit about how all of this is affecting the State Department. Let me just say that when I left the State Department, the \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a smartphone for all intents and purposes, and I think we still \u2013 when I got there \u2013 still had Wang computers, believe it or not.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I remember those.\nSECRETARY RICE: You\u2019re all too young to even know what a Wang computer was, so it just gives you a sense. How in the world is a place that some 20 years ago still had Wang computers going to play in this world of technology? What does it mean for diplomacy and what does it mean for the State Department?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We have to be, and we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can be, to really be fit for the purpose of this moment and the moments to come. And we both worked on this and looked at this \u2013 anyone comes into these jobs and they\u2019re looking at their own department or agency and trying to figure out what do I need to change, what makes sense. And we spent some time doing that. And I think we came to a couple of conclusions that are reflected in what we\u2019re doing.\nFirst is you\u2019re only \u2013 you\u2019re in these jobs for a finite period of time. You\u2019re not going to \u2013 you\u2019re not going to change everything and probably you shouldn\u2019t, so you\u2019ve got to pick a handful of things that maybe you can make a difference on, get a start on, hopefully it continues when you\u2019re no longer there. That\u2019s one.\nSecond, one of the biggest challenges we face is that the things that are really having an impact on the lives of everyone in this room and all of our fellow citizens are not necessarily the issues that the State Department has been front and center on or has the expertise on. And again, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s health, whether it\u2019s food insecurity, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s economics, and whether it is cyberspace and digital policy, this has not been our bread and butter. And our bread and butter remains issues of war and peace, preventing conflict, making \u2013 helping to end conflict where we can, making sure that the American people are secure through diplomacy. But each of these issues is directly tied to that.\nSo what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019re engaged in modernizing the department to make sure that we\u2019re organized in a way and attract the talent in a way that allows us to play a leadership role on these issues. So, for example \u2013 and you\u2019ll \u2013 Condi, you\u2019ll appreciate this \u2013 I think land record speed, we established a new bureau for cyber and digital policy in about six months\u2019 time. And in fact, the ambassador running that, Nate Fick, who is actually a technologist (inaudible), is with us today. This is how we make sure that we have a place that the expertise can come to in the department and, ultimately, we can grow the expertise so that we can engage effectively on these issues.\nWe\u2019re in the process of doing something similar on global health. One of the most extraordinary achievements in American foreign policy over the last 25 years is something called PEPFAR, something that President Bush and Condi initiated to deal with the HIV/AIDS as well as malaria and tuberculosis crisis. I don\u2019t think there has been a program in the recent history of the United States Government that has saved more lives than PEPFAR. Now we have an opportunity to make sure that coming out of COVID and inspired by what was done with PEPFAR we build an even better platform for dealing with questions of global health, and we want to make sure that the department\u2019s organized to do that, that we attract the talent.\nJohn Kerry is leading extraordinary efforts on climate, but we want to make sure that those are institutionalized so that, again, we are a leader. Because here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and again, you all know this very well \u2013 just as if we\u2019re not leading and we\u2019re not engaged, we\u2019re going to have a problem because someone else will do it or no one will do it; if we\u2019re not finding new ways to cooperate, to collaborate, to work with other countries on these issues, we simply can\u2019t get them done. Climate \u2013 we\u2019re 15 percent or so of global emissions. By definition, even if we did everything right at home, we have to figure out a way to deal with the other 85 percent. That means, among other things, diplomacy to bring others along.\nWhen we\u2019re dealing with global health, when we\u2019re dealing with COVID-19, we know that we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain and that even, again, if we did everything right at home, if there\u2019s still an environment in which a new variant is going to pop up its head somewhere around the world and we\u2019re not able to deal with that, we\u2019re not going to be protecting our people. We have to find ways to collaborate and cooperate on that. And the technologies themselves, we are \u2013 have to be the ones who are helping to shape the way that they\u2019re used.\nAll of that is a function of diplomacy, and that\u2019s why I want to make sure that the department has the tools, has the organization, and has the talent to do it. So I\u2019m here to proselytize a little bit too. (Laughter.) We want you.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We need you at the department. This is an opportunity to pursue so many of the things that you\u2019ve been studying, working on, and are passionate about, but to do it \u2013 for those of you who are American \u2013 for your country. And for me, at least, I found that \u2013 and I \u2013 Condi, I suspect you feel the same way \u2013 there are so many extraordinary things you can do with your passions and your pursuits, and you can do them in a variety of different ways. And there are different rewards in the different ways that you do them. But at least for me, going to work every day literally and figuratively with the flag \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: \u2014 behind my back, I can\u2019t even put a value on that. So to those of you who have an interest in actually doing public service, even for a short period of time \u2013 and it seems like the State Department, what does that have to do with what I\u2019m interested in \u2013 it has everything to do with it because virtually everything that so many of you are working on here actually has a direct application to what we\u2019re trying to do around the world. And we hope that a few of you will join us.\nSECRETARY RICE: Well, I was going to give you an opportunity for a recruitment pitch. I think we just got it. (Laughter.) But I want to join in. I do think that there is nothing like public service. There\u2019s nothing like getting up in the morning and recognizing that you\u2019re going to work and try to do your very best for this extraordinary country that we inherited, that we continue to try to perfect. And I don\u2019t know about you, but whenever I would get off a plane that said \u201cThe United States of America,\u201d I thought it was a pretty special moment. And so for all of you, particularly those out there who might have some technical skills that might be needed, consider it. There\u2019s nothing quite like public service.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.\nSECRETARY RICE: With that, we\u2019re going to open up for some Q&A, and I know we\u2019ll get plenty, so I\u2019m going to take the first question right here on the front.\nQUESTION: Hello. Thank you so much for your inspiring remarks, Secretary Blinken. I\u2019m curious about what you see as the merits of diplomacy through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations when their efficacy in enforcing treaties and maintaining the international order have proved to be a little bit precarious.\nSECRETARY RICE: And are you a student? Just to \u2014\nQUESTION: Yes. My name\u2019s Mac. I\u2019m a senior majoring in political science.\nSECRETARY RICE: Great, great.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So thank you for the question, and it\u2019s one that we work on every single day. Look, these institutions, starting with the United Nations, are only as good or as bad as the countries that make up their membership. And so, yes, there are certain things that are inherent to the institutions themselves, and their leadership is really important. But fundamentally, the members have to help make them work or not, and you\u2019re absolutely right that we\u2019ve seen in a number of them dysfunctions of one kind or another. The UN Security Council because of this renewed great power competition is often at loggerheads and as a result often paralyzed.\nBut at the same time, incredibly powerful things still happen. Just to give you one recent example, when Russia proceeded with its purported annexation of territory in Ukraine, we went to the United Nations and we tried at the Security Council to get a resolution reflecting that. Of course, it was vetoed by Russia, although we got a strong vote among the permanent and non\u2011permanent members of the council. But then we went to the General Assembly, to the entire body of the United Nations, and an extraordinary thing happened: 143 countries in the world stood up in opposition to the annexation, to the sham referenda that Russia had used as justification for the purported annexations. And that in and of itself is a powerful indicator of where the world actually is now on Russia\u2019s aggression, something that the Russians have to factor into their thinking. So there is \u2013 there are things that you can still do and do effectively.\nThe other thing I\u2019d say is this: Day in, day out, one of the things that gets lost in the UN system is there are different agencies that have their challenges but are doing things that in their absence either we would have to do directly ourselves or no one would do. International peacekeeping has been very troubled, but there are places in the world where the so-called Blue Helmets are. There are roughly I think 100,000 forces that are \u2013 that make up UN peacekeeping. The United States has maybe a small handful. These are folks from other countries who are taking this on. If they weren\u2019t doing it, we might have to, or we\u2019d have to let these crises go in ways that would make them even worse. And on things like health, on the environment, on education, these agencies are really doing important things.\nOur job is to try to make them do it better, more efficiently, more effectively, cut through the bureaucracy, cut through the corruption that\u2019s sometimes there, and work to try to make them a little bit better. But it\u2019s a little bit like our own situation, which is there\u2019s a need to try to forge a more perfect union, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on every day. But here, again, if we\u2019re not actually there in the room, it\u2019s probably not going to happen, which is why showing up, being \u2013 participating in this, even with all the frustrations and even with all the criticism, I think makes a difference.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yes. Going to go to the students here \u2013 right here.\nQUESTION: Hi, Secretary Blinken. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. My name is Divya Ganesan, and I\u2019m an undergraduate student here studying computer science and political science. My question for you is that a lot of students in the room hope to be CEOs, software engineers, et cetera. How has diplomacy changed in a world where technology companies like Google and Facebook have both the network and soft power diplomacy of an actual country? And how should that affect the way that we care about diplomacy?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think the single biggest change that I\u2019ve seen in the 30 or so years that I\u2019ve been doing this is precisely in the technology and information space, because one of the things \u2013 to state the obvious \u2013 that\u2019s happened is that a whole series of new actors have been empowered with technology and the ability in one way or another to control information in ways that were not the case before.\nAnd for those of us in government, this has profound, profound effects. Among other things, it means that if we can\u2019t find a way to align with these different actors who wield so much power, then we know that the best-laid plans will easily be disrupted. So we have a profound stake in trying to make sure that to the best of our ability we\u2019re actually all rowing in the same direction. One of the reasons that not only am I here for a couple of days but we stood up this new bureau is to make sure that we have day-in, day-out connectivity with this entire ecosystem.\nAnd we\u2019re going to disagree, and there are disagreements between the public and the private. That\u2019s not going to go away. But where we can find ways to work through the disagreements and come out in a place where we\u2019re trying to move things in the same direction, that\u2019s going to make our life easier; it\u2019s going to make it easier for the policies that we pursue to actually take root and be implemented. We \u2013 it\u2019s in our self-interest, but it\u2019s also the right thing to do to make sure that on any given problem we have all of the different stakeholders in on the takeoff and not just try and bring them in on the landing because the plane\u2019s going to crash. But it\u2019s challenging work, and sometimes there\u2019s a different interest at stake, and we have to find ways to reconcile those. It\u2019s going to be very imperfect, but what I can tell you is it\u2019s more important than it\u2019s ever been. Otherwise, we\u2019re not going to make progress.\nSo \u2013 but here\u2019s the other thing I\u2019ve heard, and I\u2019ve been coming out here for a long time. My strong sense is that for the multiplicity of motivations that people have for the work that they\u2019re doing, so many people do want to be in one way or another part of something larger than themselves. They do want to be positive actors in solving problems that are afflicting our \u2013 all of our citizens. And this place, maybe more than any on Earth, has been such an incredibly positive actor in doing that.\nNow, there are other things that from some perspectives are less positive. But I can\u2019t think of how we answer this challenge now of renewed competition for how the world is going to look over the next 25, 50, or 100 years if we are not doing it together with what is at the heart of our national strength. And that is what\u2019s coming out of this part of our country.\nSECRETARY RICE: In the blue shirt over here. We\u2019ll take a couple quick \u2013 please keep it brief because I\u2019m going to try to take one more question.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. My name is Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00edz, and I\u2019m an undergraduate student studying political science and economics, and I\u2019m originally from Mexico. I would like to bring our attention to an area of the world that has not been discussed in this conversation, Latin America, my own home region, in which there is a lot going on \u2013 the rise of influence in China in investment in countries like Ecuador and Argentina, not to mention drug violence in my own home country of Mexico. Given how close geographically Latin America is to the United States, I wanted to know what the policy of the United States should be in this region in coming years.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Few countries have a greater impact on each other\u2019s day-in, day-out lives than the United States and Mexico. We know it. We feel it. We see it every single day. As it happens, we just had our senior Mexican counterparts in Washington just last week and where the Attorney General, the Secretary for Homeland Security Ali Mayorkas, myself, were working with them on something that we re-established, which is a security dialogue. How do we work together cooperatively to get a better grip on challenges to security in both of our countries that have been afflicting us for many years \u2013 drugs coming this way, guns going that way, money fueling the whole thing. And if we\u2019re not working on these things collaboratively, we\u2019re not going to succeed.\nAnd I think the collaboration now with Mexico has been quite extraordinary. Migration \u2013 we are living through a period that is \u2013 we throw around the word \u201chistoric.\u201d This is a historic period when it comes to migration. There are more people on the move around the planet, forcibly displaced in one way or another from their homes, than at any time in recorded history since we\u2019ve been keeping statistics on this \u2013 100 million people. We feel that profoundly in our own hemisphere. In the Americas, we have Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans all on the move for one reason or another. We\u2019ve been working very hard to create a shared sense of responsibility for dealing with migration in a safe, orderly, humane way. No single country can deal with this effectively alone. So that\u2019s very much part of our dialogue.\nBut there\u2019s also something that\u2019s very powerful, which is there\u2019s great potential in our own hemisphere to be an economic engine for growth for all of our countries; to have, for example, more integrated supply chains that make sure that we don\u2019t have the disruptions that we\u2019ve experienced on things like computer chips. The lithium that\u2019s going to go into electric vehicle batteries \u2013 well, for example, Mexico has a lot of that lithium. Finding ways to work on it together and then to have a resilient supply chain to get it to the places where the batteries are manufactured, that\u2019s something we\u2019re working on. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity that I think that\u2019s being felt in a more integrated North America \u2013 Mexico, the United States, Canada \u2013 and a more integrated hemisphere.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is this, and it also goes back to the migration challenge that we\u2019re facing. We have to find ways to be making smart investments in communities that people are leaving, because what we see is that the primary driver of migration in our own hemisphere \u2013 there are different ones, but the most fundamental one is a lack of basic opportunity. And if you don\u2019t have that, if you can\u2019t put bread on the table for your family, you\u2019re going to try to figure something else out.\nAnd it\u2019s not that people get up in the morning and say, gee, wouldn\u2019t it be fun today to put my life on the line, to put myself in the hands of a human trafficker, to leave my family behind, to leave my friends behind, to leave my culture and my language behind. It takes something very powerful to drive people to that decision. We have an ability to affect that decision over time in actually creating greater opportunity in different communities in our hemisphere. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on as well.\nBut the bottom line is this. Unless we\u2019re doing it collaboratively, unless we\u2019re working these issues together, it\u2019s not going to happen. So it goes back, Condi, to what you were saying about sitting in these \u2013 in these rooms with norms and standards. We\u2019re sitting in rooms throughout our hemisphere every day, engaged, sleeves rolled up, showing up, because that\u2019s ultimately how you build some trust, how you build some confidence, how you build actual partnership, and maybe start to get things done.\nBottom line is this. I think you\u2019re seeing governments throughout our hemisphere who are all facing the same challenge, which is: Can they deliver the basic things that their people need or aspire to? And if they can\u2019t they\u2019re going to be gone. We just went through a cycle where a lot of governments in the hemisphere that happened to be, for example, from the \u2013 from the right politically are out. We have new governments that are in that are more from the left. But it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s less about ideology and it\u2019s more about delivering for people. What the United States can offer, and it goes back to saying to people we\u2019re not demanding that you choose, it\u2019s we\u2019re offering you a choice, is: Can we have the right kind of partnerships that make sense to them and help them deliver?\nChina, last thing I\u2019ll mention on this. If China has extraordinary resources that it can decide as a government to put into investments in our own hemisphere or around the world, that\u2019s a source of strength. But if those investments are done in a way where they\u2019re piling debt on the countries that take them that it can\u2019t \u2013 that can\u2019t be repaid, where workers are coming in from China instead of using local workers to do the projects, or the rights of the workers themselves on the projects are not being respected, where there\u2019s no consideration for the environment and the impact of a project on the environment, where corruption is part and parcel of what\u2019s being done \u2013 that\u2019s going to alienate a lot of the recipients of Chinese largesse. If we\u2019re offering a different model that, as I said, is more of a race to the top, that\u2019s going to be very attractive.\nBut for us, we have to find ways to actually mobilize and catalyze the private sector. There\u2019s a lot of resource that sits on the sidelines. What government can do is be a catalyst, a guarantor, someone who says, yeah, this is a good place, this is a smart place, this is a reasonable place to make these kinds of investments. And then it becomes more of a win/win proposition for everyone.\nSECRETARY RICE: We\u2019ve come to the hour.\nQUESTION: Can (inaudible) about Taiwan?\nSECRETARY RICE: All right. All right, certainly. You want to say something quick about Taiwan?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Sure.\nSECRETARY RICE: All right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What would you like me to say? (Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Hi, Secretary. I\u2019m the MBA first student from GSB. I\u2019m just wondering \u2013 I know you are very time-limited \u2013 maybe say something quick about like what is United States attitude toward Taiwan?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah, sure.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah. Or not so quick.\nQUESTION: I mean, like a lot of officials have \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: Take your time to talk about Taiwan. We don\u2019t want to \u2013 yes \u2013 have an incident twice. Yes. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So one of the things that we\u2019ve worked on together in a variety of ways for years is our approach to Taiwan and the challenge that is inherent in dealing with the differences between Beijing and Taiwan. And a hallmark of the policy, going back decades through Republican and Democratic administrations, has been an insistence that the differences that exist need to be resolved peacefully. And actually, it\u2019s been, up until recently, incredibly successful. I think it\u2019s been managed well, in a way that has avoided conflict, that has also allowed people on Taiwan to really flourish, and benefit not just their own lives, but Taiwan has so much to contribute to the world that it\u2019s doing every single day.\nWhat\u2019s changed is this \u2013 it goes back to something that Condi was saying at the very beginning \u2013 there has been a change in the approach from Beijing toward Taiwan in recent years. And instead of sticking with the status quo that was established in a positive way, a fundamental decision that the status quo was no longer acceptable and that Beijing was determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline. And if peaceful means didn\u2019t work, then it would employ coercive means \u2013 and possibly, if coercive means don\u2019t work, maybe forceful means \u2013 to achieve its objectives. And that is what is profoundly disrupting the status quo and creating tremendous tensions.\nAnd this is a matter of concern not just to the United States because it\u2019s been a central component of managing the relationship with China for so long, but it\u2019s of profound concern to countries around the world. The amount of commercial traffic that goes through the straits every single day and has an impact on economies around the world is enormous. If that were to be disrupted as a result of a crisis, countries around world would suffer.\nThe last group of people I need to tell this is right here in this room. On semiconductors, if Taiwanese production were disrupted as a result of a crisis, you would have an economic crisis around the world. So there\u2019s a profound stake not just for us but for countries around the world in preserving peace and stability when it comes to Taiwan and the straits, and to making sure that the differences that exist are resolved peacefully. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been so engaged on this.\nI hope that Beijing will come back to a place where it actually sees the merits in making sure that differences are peacefully resolved, that it doesn\u2019t try to force things through coercion, and even worse, through force. We are determined to make good on our commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act and supporting their ability to defend themselves. We\u2019re also \u2013 we also remain fundamentally committed to the \u201cone China\u201d policy as well. That hasn\u2019t changed. That won\u2019t change. But at the heart of that was a commitment to resolve these differences peacefully, and if that\u2019s changing, then that does offer, unfortunately, prospects for very challenging situations going forward.\nSECRETARY RICE: Thank you. And with that, we have come to the end of the hour. If you will join me in please thanking Secretary Blinken. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-university-recruitment-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemarks at a University Recruitment Event\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Stanford University Encina Courtyard", "location": "Stanford, California", "date": "October 17, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you so much. First of all, I\u2019m so glad that you were able to get class outside today, and I\u2019m really happy to participate in that. We\u2019re here in part to ask you to think about the possibility of public service and including the possibility of service in the State Department. And I know that that may not be the first thing that comes to mind as you\u2019re thinking about what to do when you\u2019re at Stanford or at some point later in your career, but I\u2019d like to just take a moment (inaudible) suggest why actually this would be an extraordinary time to think about not just (inaudible) some kind of public service but actually coming to the State Department and working on what America is doing around the world.\nWe were talking about this, and some of you may have been there with Condoleezza Rice just a short while ago, and some of your in many cases classmates. This is in many ways an inflection point, an inflection point because the world that existed after the end of the Cold War \u2013 the post-Cold War world \u2013 has really come to an end. And there\u2019s an intense competition that\u2019s underway to shape what actually comes next, and a big part of that competition is going to be driven by technology.\nTechnology is going to be at the heart of retooling our economies for the future. It\u2019s going to be at the heart \u2013 in some cases of reforming our militaries to make them more effective and fit for purpose. It\u2019s at the heart of reshaping lives in our country and around the world. But maybe most important, it\u2019s at the heart of a positive vision that I think is responsive to the needs of people not just in our own country but around the world.\nThe things that so many of you are thinking about, are working on, studying \u2013 how to make sure that we can use technology to cure disease and to have a stronger global health system after COVID-19; how do we think about making sure that people can feed themselves sustainably at a time when we\u2019re dealing with profound food insecurity around the world; how we deal with climate change so that we have a planet that can power itself, but doing it in a way that\u2019s not dependent on fossil fuels; how do we think about supply chains to make sure that the things that people need in their daily lives are not disrupted because of disruptions to the supply chain; how do we think about good jobs for the future \u2013 all of that has technology, innovation, entrepreneurship at the heart of the answer. And all of that is what can \u2013 powerfully resonates around the world. And when we get it right, it directly goes to how the rest of the world sees us. I feel that every single day in the job that I\u2019m doing.\nSo at our own Department of State \u2013 and I want to kind of make in a minute \u2013 a lot of these issues have not necessarily been front and center in what we do or what we\u2019re seen to be doing. People think of the State Department, they think of diplomacy, they think of issues of war and peace and trying to make peace where there\u2019s war, trying to prevent conflict.\nBut we know that the big issues that are really having an impact on people\u2019s lives \u2013 whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s the impact of new technologies \u2013 each of those has to be front and center in what we do as well because there\u2019s not a solution set to any of those problems that does not involve, in some way or another, collaboration, cooperation, coordination with countries around the world, with companies around the world, with innovators around the world. And that\u2019s where the State Department comes in. That\u2019s where diplomacy comes in \u2013 trying to advance, to facilitate that cooperation and that coordination.\nWe were talking about this earlier: we\u2019re trying to solve the climate crisis. Even if we do everything right at home, if we\u2019re 15 percent of global emissions and we\u2019re not dealing with the other 85 percent, we don\u2019t solve the problem. Diplomacy is a big part of that. If we\u2019re dealing with COVID and trying to make sure that we don\u2019t have another pandemic, building a stronger global health system that\u2019s only going to be as strong as the weakest link in the chain \u2013 that\u2019s necessary. And again, even if we got everything right at home, if there\u2019s another outbreak of disease and there\u2019s a variant that undercuts what we\u2019re doing at home, we can\u2019t succeed.\nAnd all of these technologies that many of you are actually studying, working on, helping to develop, how they get used \u2013 the rules, the standards, the norms by which they\u2019re used, which are decided not necessarily in the United States but maybe in some windowless conference room around the world \u2013 that will decide if technology is used for good or for less good, whether privacy, whether security, whether human rights and our values, as well as our competitiveness is actually upheld.\nAnd again, that\u2019s exactly what diplomats are doing. We have a new bureau in our department for cyber and digital policy to make sure that we\u2019re organized in a way that allows us to really engage on these issues. And a big part of making sure that that works, as well as a new office we\u2019re standing up to deal with emerging technologies \u2013 everything from AI to quantum to bioengineering \u2013 that we have a lead role to play in making sure that the United States is well represented around the world.\nAnd that\u2019s where all of you come in. The very things that you\u2019re interested in, that you\u2019re passionate about, that you\u2019re working on, that you\u2019re studying, there\u2019s actually a way to pursue them as part of the State Department, and maybe spending a little bit of time of working in the public sector, in public service, and doing something that I\u2019ve found over 30 years has given tremendous meaning to my own life, and that\u2019s being able to go to work every day with an American flag behind my back either literally or figuratively. And for some of you, that may be an attractive proposition, even if it\u2019s only for a little bit of time.\nWe\u2019re finding new ways to bring those who are steeped on STEM into our department, and we can talk a little bit about that. But I really just wanted to encourage you to actually consider that, to think about that as an opportunity, whether it\u2019s in a few years; whether it\u2019s in 10 or 15 years. But we need you: we need the talent, we need the insight, and we especially need a new generation of people to look at these problems that are incredibly daunting, but that have solutions, and increasingly they\u2019ll have the solutions that you\u2019re finding and developing.\nSo with that, Nate, do you want to say a few words about what we\u2019re doing?\nAMBASSADOR FICK: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And thanks, everybody, for being here. It is \u2013 it\u2019s real treat for me to be back in Silicon Valley. As the dean mentioned, I built a business here and was an operating partner in a venture capital firm here for 10 years. I spent a lot of mornings running around The Dish, worried about raising money, and whether a (inaudible) feature would work, losing a customer, hiring a key person. And so it is terrific to be back here.\nI have now had a few weeks of experience building this new bureau at the State Department, and I\u2019ll tell you, there\u2019s one big point of commonality between what I\u2019m doing now and what I was doing before, building a tech business. Both the bureau and our company were what I called elevator assets organizations. At the end of the day, we had some computers, we had some chairs, but basically, all of our assets went down the elevator at night and went home. That\u2019s all we had. Human capital, people, it\u2019s all we had.\nAnd so the fundamental challenge in building either of these organizations, any organization, is finding the right people to come join the team. The Secretary mentioned getting in his conference rooms, right, and setting standards, kind of the unsexy work of moving the ball down the field. My first week on the job was doing exactly that. I got sworn in on a Thursday to get a passport on a Friday to go to Romania on a Saturday in order to spend the better part of a week meeting with delegations from countries around the world to persuade them to vote for an American candidate to be secretary general of the International Telecommunications Union, a standard-setting body that\u2019s been around since 1865. It was set up to make sure that European telegraphs could talk to American telegraphs, could talk to Asian telegraphs. And this stuff really matters. We may not think about it every day, but it really matters.\nAnd I got on the phone with my wife at the end of the first day and she said, \u201cSo how is it?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, the people are tremendous. The people are just incredible, and the sense of purpose is incredible.\u201d So I think that the \u2013 we need American companies building and scaling technology around the world in accordance with our values. And we need American diplomatic leadership on topics like setting the standards and the norms for tech also in accordance with our values.\nSo I think our invitation to you is something like the following: if you \u2013 as products of at least a few years in this place, if you really believe that the innovation economy is a wellspring of our attractiveness and economic health and national security as a nation, if you believe that; and if you believe in the intrinsic value of diplomacy, if you believe that talking about our differences is the most effective way to bridge them or resolve them; and if you believe that tech is the next frontier in diplomacy, just as it\u2019s the next frontier in every aspect of our lives \u2013 if you would believe those things, then we have a place for you. And I can say that with conviction because there was a place for me.\nI did not see myself five or seven or 10 years ago at the State Department. But I\u2019ll tell you, now, having spent a little bit of time in this great organization, it reminds me of a recruiting slogan the Marines used in the \u201990s when I graduated from college and joined the Marines. They said, \u201cWe never promised you a rose garden.\u201d The same is true at the State Department. There are things you can do coming out of Stanford where you\u2019re going to make more money and maybe you\u2019ll work easier hours. But I would challenge you to find something that will give you the same sense of purpose.\nThe Secretary has talked about the, I stand a little taller walking behind my desk with the American flag there, and I come through the turnstile every morning with a big grin on my face. And so whether it\u2019s four years of your career or 40 years of your career, please consider giving a portion of your time and your energy to public service because we need you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-slac-national-accelerator-laboratory/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemarks at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

(applause); and of course, our Secretary of State Antony Blinken (applause).\u00a0 I am Lee Satterfield, the assistant secretary of state for Educational and Cultural Affairs.\u00a0 Tonight\u2019s ceremony signifies much more than a signing ceremony.\u00a0 Tonight we celebrate the priority that Secretary Blinken places on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.\nThe State Department is elevating the Biden administration\u2019s engagement with the Hispanic community by signing this important MOU with HACU, the first time it\u2019s been signed by a secretary of state in two decades.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYesterday, Secretary Blinken said that President Biden\u2019s National Security Strategy lays out a vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous world, and a comprehensive plan to realize it.\u00a0 This MOU is an important step in that plan.\u00a0 The Biden administration want more members of the Hispanic community to be a part of America\u2019s diplomatic and development work.\u00a0 We want more opportunities for Hispanic students and scholars to study and research abroad.\u00a0 And we want more international students and scholars studying and researching at our Hispanic-serving institutions, because inclusion of every community strengthens our global competitiveness, security, and shared prosperity.\nNow please join me in welcoming Josue Barrera.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR BARRERA:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas noches.\u00a0\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0Buenas noches.\nMR BARRERA:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s my favorite part of any Hispanic event.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 My name is Josue Manuel Barrera, if you can try saying that, too.\u00a0 My HACU story started 16 years ago. \u00a0I was a second-year graduate student and teaching assistant studying public policy at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, an overwhelmingly Hispanic-serving institution recognized now for its positive impact in social mobility. \u00a0I helped coordinate the visit of a HACU representative to the university, and by the end of the visit, I added my name to the list of students interested in gaining experience at the federal level.\nSeveral months passed and I didn\u2019t give it much thought, and then a phone call. \u00a0The HACU representative on the other end of the line asked if I was interested in spending a semester in D.C. \u00a0If so, I had two days to decide and two weeks to prepare.\u00a0 So I sold my very cool 1988 Nissan Pathfinder, bought some horribly ill-fitting suits, and hopped on a plane to D.C. \u00a0When I called my mother know, I landed and everything was okay, and the first thing she asked us:\u00a0Cuando regresas \u2013\u00a0when are you coming back?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 To this day, I call, and the first thing she asks is: when are you coming back?\nThe phone call \u2013 back to the story \u2013 opened the doors for me to enter public service at the State Department and the opportunity to contribute to our nation in unique and meaningful ways.\u00a0 In the Bureau of Public Affairs \u2013 I see my first supervisor here \u2013 Western Hemisphere Affairs, Educational and Cultural Affairs (cheers) \u2013 wow, cool \u2013 and now Global Talent Management (cheers).\nIn 2019 just before the pandemic hit and the national dialogue on race escalated, my team began the effort to institutionalize what\u2019s now the Secretary\u2019s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.\u00a0 And I just returned to the department a few weeks ago after spending a year studying national security strategy with senior military officials.\u00a0\u00a0 My current focus is another of the Secretary\u2019s priorities: working to develop the department\u2019s first-ever strategic plan for retention.\nI will forever be grateful for that HACU phone call and the path is has led to.\u00a0 It\u2019s a call that I hope HACU can continue making for many students in the years to come.\nNow, he may not have been the person who made the call, but I know it was the work of the individual whom I\u2019m about to introduce that made it possible.\u00a0 Since 1996, he has been the driving force in building HACU and, to clarion call, effectively serving our nation\u2019s Hispanic-serving institutions, and positively affecting the education, careers, and lives of millions of Hispanic students throughout the United States.\nDr. Flores is a master architect and team builder within HACU, throughout the HSI community, across government, business and industry, and throughout U.S. society.\u00a0 I for one can most pleased that the department is continuing its collaboration with HACU.\u00a0 It\u2019s my pleasure to introduce to you President and CEO of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, Dr. Antonio Flores.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR FLORES:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0\nMR FLORES:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0 Thank you for those very kind words, Josue, and of course we\u2019re very proud of your career.\u00a0 He is obviously one of more than 15,000 placements that HACU has been able to over the years have with federal agencies of top-notch talent from our institutions.\u00a0 But\u00a0buenas tardes\u00a0and good evening.\nBefore I go on to my brief remarks, I want to acknowledge my colleagues who are here tonight because it\u2019s them who make everything happen in HACU.\u00a0 I just stay out of the way and they make it happen.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Dr. Lena Rodriguez, who is our senior VP for policy and government relations here in D.C., is here with us.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Ben Melano, senior executive director of the national internship program that we have at HACU.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We have a good friend, colleague, and president of Glendale Community College in Arizona, Dr. Terry Leyba Ruiz (applause) and Norma Jean Garcia, who is our executive director of communications in San Antonio.\u00a0 Thank you all for helping us.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSecretary Blinken, Assistant Secretary Satterfield (laughter), distinguished guests and friends, as we approach the end of Hispanic Heritage Month this weekend, and of course of the playoffs later in the month (laughter), it is only fitting that we do it with a homerun.\u00a0 And of course we are doing it in this magnificent venue, the Benjamin Franklin Room, under the seal of the United States of America, with the motto, \u201cE pluribus unum.\u201d\u00a0 And then that basically means, \u201cOut of many, one.\u201d\u00a0 And we gather to celebrate the historic signing of a comprehensive memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of State and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, HACU.\nHACU represents the 559 Hispanic-serving institutions, or HSIs, across the nation, and collectively these institutions serve 5.3 million college students from all walks of life, including 67 percent of the 3.8 million Hispanics in college today.\u00a0 HSIs are the backbone of Hispanic higher education and a major pillar of America\u2019s workforce development.\nThe MOU that we are about to sign will facilitate new opportunities for HSI students and graduates in the Foreign Service, in the civilian labor force of the State Department, as well as in study abroad programs and internships.\nMr. Secretary, on behalf of HACU and its nearly 600 member colleges and institutions across the country and its affiliated universities in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Spain, I thank you most sincerely for your foresight in signing this MOU, but also for your tireless leadership to promote America\u2019s values and democratic principles.\u00a0 I also would like to thank Assistant Secretary Satterfield for her invaluable support and guidance in the framing of the MOU, and Deputy Assistant Secretary Rosenzweig for his steadfast assistance to our HACU team under the leadership of Dr. Lena Rodriguez to bring us to this point.\nMr. Secretary, I am deeply honored and humbled by the opportunity to cosign this MOU with someone who personifies America\u2019s vision of a more peaceful and just world on behalf of President Biden.\u00a0 And I thank each and every one of you in the audience for joining us to celebrate the signing of this transformational MOU between the U.S. Department and \u2013 Department of State and HACU.\nThank you.\u00a0\u00a0Muchas gracias.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS GUZMAN:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas a todos.\u00a0 It is an absolute honor to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with all of you who care deeply about equal opportunity and work hard to support the Hispanic community.\u00a0 I am Susana Guzman.\u00a0 I am especially proud to stand here today as a first-generation American with a mother from Barranquilla, Colombia, and a father from Oriente, Cuba, who migrated to Miami, Florida in the \u201890s, and as a graduate of two Hispanic-serving institutions, Florida International University and Miami-Dade College.\u00a0 I know firsthand the life-changing opportunities that HSIs provide to their students.\nAs a beneficiary of Pell Grant scholarships and a scholarship that allowed me to study abroad, much like the State Department\u2019s Gilman scholarship which offers students like me international experiences, my experience informs the work that I do today as a program officer at the U.S. Department of State in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the Western Hemisphere Bureau to focus on inclusive education.\u00a0 I understand the importance of opportunities and of mentorship.\u00a0 In fact, it was during my internship in ECA in 2015 that I first aspired to be a civil servant after a day of shadowing our former assistant secretary, Evan Ryan, whom the Secretary knows very well.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We all have that in common, those of us that have spoken today, so we are honored to be here.\nSecretary Blinken was sworn in on January 2021, and since then he has worked to carry out President Biden\u2019s foreign policy agenda in a complex world.\u00a0 While doing so, Secretary Blinken has created and enacted policies that reflect his and the administration\u2019s belief in the paramount importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, integrating DEIA into all that we do, from our foreign policy to our exchange programming to our workplace.\u00a0 That makes me so proud to work here at the State Department.\u00a0\u00a0Muchas gracias, Mr. Secretary.\nCon mucho orgullo, with much pride, let\u2019s welcome our 71st Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good evening, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0 Welcome, welcome, welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 Welcome to the Benjamin Franklin Room.\u00a0 He\u2019s gazing at us right now.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I like to remind people that Benjamin Franklin was our first diplomat.\u00a0 He signed our first treaty.\u00a0 He charted the Gulf Stream.\u00a0 He helped pioneer electricity.\u00a0 He gave us our ethos of self-government.\u00a0 And virtually none of this did he do while sober, so \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what the lesson is, but I share it anyway.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSusana, thank you for the wonderful introduction, but thank you especially for your service here at the State Department.\u00a0 We are so proud and pleased to have you among us.\u00a0 You did a wonderful job.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd Dr. Flores, my thanks to you for your partnership and for your leadership of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\u00a0 I want to recognize also those at the State Department who have helped support and grow this partnership, including members of our employee affinity group, the Hispanic Employee Council of Foreign Affairs Agencies.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI am delighted to sign in a few moments this new memorandum of understanding during Hispanic Heritage Month, when we honor generations of Hispanic and Latino people who have served in every part of this department \u2013 from diplomats strengthening our alliances and partnerships, to development experts administering aid and expanding economic opportunity, to locally employed staff who are the lifeblood of every single embassy we have around the world and notably in our hemisphere, which I just spent some time last week in Colombia, in Chile and Peru, and saw the remarkable people that we have working with us in our embassies from those countries.\nBut it\u2019s also an opportunity to look ahead, to look ahead to the future of the department and how we can make it as diverse and inclusive as possible, because Susana is right: this has been at the heart of my mission since I\u2019ve been on this job.\nThis is not only a matter of doing the right thing, it\u2019s also doing the smart thing.\u00a0 And I know this every single day.\u00a0 We\u2019re operating in an extraordinarily diverse world.\u00a0 The greatest strength that we bring to the table is our own diversity.\u00a0 Our diversity makes us stronger.\u00a0 It makes us smarter.\u00a0 It makes is more creative.\u00a0 It brings different perspectives, different viewpoints, different experiences to every single problem we have before us.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t take advantage of that, we are quite simply tying our own hands behind our back.\u00a0 It makes no sense, and we are determined to make sure that we have a Department of State that truly reflects the country that it represents.\nToday, we\u2019re taking an important step in actually advancing this mission by reaffirming what has been a two-decades-long partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\u00a0 The institutions that make up HACU embody one of the best parts of our open, democratic society: the pursuit of knowledge, of education, of scholarship.\u00a0 Hispanic colleges and universities are home to researchers working to solve some of the most pressing challenges of our time that are going to affect the lives of millions of people, like developing innovative methods for removing carbon dioxide from atmosphere, finding new treatments for cancer.\u00a0 The institutions are training tomorrow\u2019s microbiologists, their labor economists, science teachers, psychologists, and yes, diplomats, among many other fields that are enriching our communities and also enriching our lives.\u00a0 And they foster a vibrant exchange of ideas not only among us but also across borders; for example, sponsoring students studying international business in Japan, sending students and faculty to learn about renewable energy in Costa Rica.\nThe MOU that we\u2019re signing this evening affirms a continued collaboration for the next five years.\u00a0 What does that mean?\u00a0 Well, it means that we\u2019ll keep working together to recruit students, to recruit faculty, to recruit staff from HACU colleges and universities to participate in our exchange programs around the world, like the Fulbright Program or the Benjamin Gilman International Scholarship.\u00a0 We will continue strengthening the pipeline from HACU institutions to careers in diplomacy, including through internship programs like the one, as we just heard, first brought Josue to the State Department.\u00a0 And by the way, my mom says the same thing to me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTo reach these goals, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with exchange program alumni, we\u2019ll promote participation in symposia and conferences, we will visit Hispanic-serving institutions.\nIf you look at it, there is real progress to show for our efforts over the last 20 years both within this department and beyond it.\u00a0 Since HACU and the department signed the first MOU together 20 years ago, the number of Hispanic and Latino employees at State has grown from 4 percent in 2001 to 8 percent of employees today.\u00a0 And broadly, between 2000 and 2019, the number of Hispanic and Latino students from the United States who\u2019ve studied abroad has nearly doubled.\nSo these are positive trends.\u00a0 They\u2019re good, but not good enough.\u00a0 We have work to do to make sure that this department and our programs look more like the country that we serve and that Hispanic and Latino students have the same access, the same opportunity, as their peers, whether in their studies, whether in academia, or for that matter anywhere in the world.\nAnd the truth is in neither of these categories does the representation of Hispanic and Latinos fully reflect their share of America\u2019s population.\u00a0 So that tells us that we have work to do and we are working to change that, led in part by Ambassador Bernicat who is here, who directs our work for us, recruitment and retention efforts, and Ambassador Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley.\u00a0 Gina, are you here tonight?\u00a0 Not sure if you are, but Gina is doing remarkable work.\u00a0 She is our first chief diversity and inclusion officer.\u00a0 I had the privilege of naming her to a job that we instituted, and she is helping to build a department that attracts but also retains a team that reflects our nation.\nOne of the things that we\u2019ve found over the years is even when we\u2019ve had some success in bringing under-represented parts of our country into the State Department, we don\u2019t always do such a good job in retaining them.\u00a0 And one of the things we\u2019re working on is making sure that we do, that we better understand why different groups may choose to leave and abandon an investment they had made early, and how we can continue to change and evolve our culture to make sure that it is the most welcoming place for everyone.\nOur collaboration with HACU will also continue to foster ties beyond the United States with students, with scholars, with communities across our hemisphere through our 100,000 Strong in the Americas Initiative.\u00a0 Some of you may be familiar with this.\u00a0 With this initiative, the State Department is working to expand study abroad opportunities for students across the Americas so that we can build stronger ties between our nations and spur inclusive economic growth for the entire region, from the bottom up and the middle out.\u00a0 One way we\u2019re doing this is by offering grants to universities to help them develop their own exchange programs.\nHACU institutions have been some of our biggest partners in this effort.\u00a0 If you go back to 2014, one-third of the grants that the State Department\u2019s 100,000 Strong in the Americas Innovation Fund has awarded have gone to teams that include at least one HACU institution.\u00a0 With these grants, Hispanic-serving institutions have forged strategic partnerships and relationships with partners across the Americas, hosted students from across the Western Hemisphere here in the United States.\nFor the participants, the ties that are formed with our nation through individual friendships, through areas of research, cultural and community connections, what we\u2019ve seen is they often last a lifetime.\u00a0 And in many ways, nothing better benefits our foreign policy and our place in the world than these relationships.\u00a0 These lasting connections, the affinities that they create, the understanding that they help to deepen \u2013 these matter.\nAnd one thing that\u2019s always fascinated me, and Assistant Secretary Satterfield who is leading our efforts knows this very well, if you go back and look at the history of our exchange programs in bringing students, young scholars, other young people from abroad to the United States, including from the Americas, what we\u2019ve found is this: we have a pretty good track record in identifying people who are going to go on and play incredibly meaningful roles in their own countries and in their societies.\nThrough the history of our exchange programs, we\u2019ve had more than 52 people who went on to win Nobel Prizes, 400 or so who became the presidents or prime ministers of their countries, thousands who became leaders in academia, research, the sciences, culture.\u00a0 And when you\u2019re building relationships with an extraordinary group of people at a young age, and they develop a real connection with the United States, there are few things that matter more in actually building very positive partnerships for people who are going to be leaders in their countries.\nSo this really matters to our foreign policy.\u00a0 It matters to our place in the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo simply put, it\u2019s my pleasure, Dr. Flores, to be here tonight, because we\u2019re grateful.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to HACU as a partner, and now we look forward to continuing our work together for many more years to come.\nWith that, we actually get down to the real business of the evening \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and that is signing the MOU.\u00a0 So Dr. Flores, please, join me.\nMR FLORES:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be effectively witnessed.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR FLORES:\u00a0\u00a0Very nice pen.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n(The MOU was signed.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It is now official.\u00a0 (Cheers and applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Thank you so much, and this concludes our program.\u00a0 Please enjoy your time this evening in the historic Diplomatic Reception Rooms where so much history, including tonight, has taken place.\u00a0 Thank you so much and have a good evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-a-joint-press-availability/"}, {"url":

"Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Loy Henderson Auditorium", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "October 13, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Welcome.\u00a0 Welcome to the State Department.\u00a0\u00a0Bienvenido, a todos y todas.\u00a0 Thank you so much for being here today.\nA year ago, we came together in Mexico City to launch the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities, and we set three primary goals together: to protect our people, to prevent transborder crime, and to pursue criminal networks.\u00a0 And what\u2019s so critical is we defined these goals together.\u00a0 They reflect a shared responsibility and a shared interest in working together to address challenges that neither one of our nations can adequately address alone.\nToday, we have an opportunity to assess the progress that we\u2019ve made on these interconnected goals, and to identify what more we can do to meet them.\nThe high-level group represented here \u2013 including the attorney general, including the Secretary of Homeland Security, including the administrator of USAID, Ambassador Salazar, other leading U.S. Government officials focused on anti-corruption, on drug policy, on public health \u2013 all of us together reflect the comprehensive approach that the United States is bringing to bear on this set of issues.\u00a0 And we can visibly see a similar commitment on the part of our Mexican counterparts.\nThat commitment is also evident in the unprecedented investments, the new legislation, the deepened coordination that we\u2019ve demonstrated in our first year of implementation.\nLast November, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes\u00a0$1.9 billion for six new construction and modernization projects on\u00a0the U.S. southern border that include enhanced security features.\nIn June, the President signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.\u00a0 This is the United States\u2019 first major gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years, and it makes straw purchases and the trafficking of firearms a federal crime, and that we\u2019ve been using to hold traffickers accountable.\nWe\u2019ve made considerable new investments in substance use prevention, treatment, recovery \u2013 both to reduce the ravages wrought by illicit drugs, and to reduce demand.\u00a0 This year, our Drug\u2011Free Communities Program has worked with 745 community coalitions in all 50 of our states to prevent youth substance use.\nHaving said that, we still have a lot of work to do.\nWe need to enhance our efforts to disrupt illicit fentanyl production and trafficking, and synthetic opioids more broadly.\u00a0 Last year, approximately 108,000 people died in the United States of overdoses, most from synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\u00a0 Synthetic opioids are taking a rising toll in Mexico, too \u2013 something we\u2019ve talked about in recent months.\nWe need to enhance our efforts to disrupt illicit weapons trafficking.\u00a0 Last year, more than 33,000 people in Mexico were killed in intentional homicides; more than two-thirds of those came from firearms.\nSo across these and so many security issues, the same truth holds: our ability to protect our people depends on working effectively together.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do today, from treating substance use as a public health concern, to dismantling the financial networks of transnational criminal organizations, to addressing the root causes that drive people to organized crime, including a lack of economic opportunity.\nMarcelo, I just want to say to you and to all of our colleagues here we are so grateful for the spirit of openness and cooperation that all of you continue to bring to this effort \u2013 in the days leading up to today, today, indeed every day.\u00a0 And that\u2019s happening not just among those at this table, but critically, throughout the working levels of our governments.\u00a0 We deeply, deeply value it; we deeply appreciate it, and we look forward to a frank, open, productive discussion today as we\u2019ve had in recent months.\nWith that, let me turn it over to the attorney general.\u00a0 Merrick.\nATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, Tony; Secretary Mayorkas, Ali; and to our esteemed friends from Mexico, Ale.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to see all of you again and to have this opportunity to reaffirm the central importance of the law enforcement partnership between our two countries.\nThe first framework goal that we will address today, protecting our people, is a thread that runs through everything we do.\u00a0 It is why we do this work.\u00a0 On behalf of the Department of Justice, our prosecutors, and each of our law enforcement components, including the DEA, ATF, FBI, and the United States Marshals Service, I want to thank the Government of Mexico for your continued partnership in our shared efforts to protect the people of both of our countries.\u00a0 I look forward to all of our discussions today and our continued work together.\nAli.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Ali?\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken and Attorney General Garland, for your remarks.\u00a0 Secretary Ebrard, Secretary Rodriguez, Attorney General Gertz, and all colleagues, I am glad we\u2019re able to come together in this 20th \u2013 this 200th year of our country\u2019s friendship to celebrate the successes in our implementation of the historic bicentennial framework that was adopted last year.\u00a0 We are, of course, regularly reminded of how intertwined our nations are.\u00a0 Not only do we have a network of communities across our shared border that demonstrates every day how much we have in common, how connected our peoples are, but we also share so much of our respective cultures, we have common democratic principles, we have interconnected economies, and of course, we face similar challenges.\nIt is both a privilege and a pleasure to work together with all of you in strengthening our bonds which have grown so remarkably over the past several years to tackle the challenges that we both confront with really a united purpose and a shared foundational principle.\u00a0 I am very optimistic about the future because of all of you around this room and the teams whom you represent.\u00a0 I look forward to our dialogue today and to our continued work and friendship together in the days and years to come.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Antony.\u00a0\u00a0Muy buen d\u00eda.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to turn to Spanish.\n(Via interpreter)\u00a0 Thank you very much, assistant secretary.\u00a0 Thank you, Attorney General, Secretary Mayorkas, and all the rest of the officials that are here.\u00a0 I just want to say that for Mexico, this bicentennial framework is a high priority to us.\u00a0 It\u2019s strategic, and today we\u2019re going to review the accomplishments of this year of joint efforts.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to determine what we\u2019re going to do in 2023 to establish goals for that year. \u00a0President L\u00f3pez Obrador started a new security initiative.\u00a0 He launched it as he came in and to get to the root causes of insecurity and deal with young people in the rural sector.\u00a0 We have more than a half a million people \u2013 2.2 youths are out of work, I\u2019m saying.\u00a0 There\u2019s a high number of people out of work so \u2013 especially young people, and they\u2019re in a program that\u2019s created by the \u2013 we created a national guard.\u00a0 For the first time, we\u2019re going to have dominion over the entire territory from the law enforcement (inaudible).\u00a0 Before, we had 400 police forces.\nAnother key point is our \u2013 is this framework with the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it\u2019s a framework, because we have common security issues.\u00a0 And so I can tell you, and I\u2019d like to thank and underscore our gratitude to Secretary Blinken for his efforts, and Attorney General Garland who we have met on many, many occasions, and Secretary Mayorkas who we\u2019ve spoken with a lot because they\u2019ve become personally involved in all these efforts.\u00a0 What has been achieved over this year?\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 There\u2019s 32,000 weapons have been seized.\u00a0 How do we view this in Mexico?\u00a0 We \u2013 for the first time, we have a reduction of the murder rate of 9.2 percent approximately it was reduced.\u00a0 Of these 32,000 weapons had been in Mexico, if we hadn\u2019t worked together, we wouldn\u2019t have a 9.2 percent reduction of homicide rate.\u00a0 This means 17,000 cartridges, and each cartridge can kill someone in Mexico, and so it\u2019s something that\u2019s of the upmost important.\u00a0 This is not just statistics.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about saving lives.\nAnd we can\u2019t just do it without working together, and so that\u2019s why we view it as very important.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to see soon \u2013 we\u2019re going to take a look very soon at \u2013 that there\u2019s been an achievement of arrests of 5,000 chemical precursors and fentanyl as well.\u00a0 It\u2019s so much it could poison thousands of people if they had gotten to where they were going \u2013 150,000 tons of methamphetamine.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost \u2013 if \u2013 it\u2019s if we give a dose of methamphetamine, that would allow to give to every person in Mexico who\u2019s over 50 years of age, that would be enough methamphetamine.\u00a0 Ninety-four tons of cocaine were seized as well with a special interception at sea \u2013 interdiction at sea.\u00a0 It\u2019s been \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get in more detail \u2013 of these details.\u00a0 I just want to say with these results what we should do is next year we should make it higher figures to reduce violence and avoid drugs from getting to people in Mexico and the United States.\nNow that I\u2019ve said this and with our gratitude, I give the floor right now to Rosa Icela Rodriguez, the Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection.\nSECURITY SECRETARY RODRIGUEZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good morning to everything.\u00a0 I\u2019m very happy to be here with you all.\u00a0 Greetings, and I thank our hosts for their hospitality.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Mayorkas and Attorney General Garland and everyone present and the Ambassador Ken Salazar.\u00a0 I thank and say hello to the members of the cabinet of the Government of Mexico.\nAnd yes, I want to underscore that security is a priority \u2013 a topic or issue for our governments and must \u2013 this binational vision should remain in place, government to government, the government of Lopez Obrador and the current government of the United States, and at all times there be a \u2013 there prevail sovereignty and respect.\nThis is a major decision by this country.\u00a0 The bicentennial framework has enabled us to work in coordinated fashion and agree upon this collaboration without conditioning \u2013 without any conditions, so we underscore that this instrument is part of peace, peacekeeping, or peace efforts in both of our countries.\u00a0 And our nations are obligated to work together jointly because we have a shared responsibility to combat organized \u2013 transnational organized crime, which on this side in the United States leads to overdose deaths, and Mexico has violent homicides because of the transfer of these drugs.\nSo after \u2013 by working together and putting into practice, as we have done thus far, the capacities of our states to diminish the crime and to hamstring these criminal groups and bring about peace in the Americas, and therefore, Mexico and the United States, we are united by peace.\u00a0 Because we have a bilateral relationship of brotherhood; because we\u2019re neighbors, partners; in many regions, we\u2019re family members of each other.\u00a0 That\u2019s all.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Secretary.\u00a0 Before I give the floor to Dr. Alejandro Betz (ph), the attorney general \u2013 or Gertz \u2013 of Mexico, I want to highlight the presence, and it\u2019s very important in this framework of the national defense \u2013 Cresencio Sandoval, the presence of our defense minister, and Admiral Rafael Ojeda, who is the secretary of the navy of our country.\u00a0 Thank you very much for joining us here.\nYou have the floor, Mr. Attorney General.\nATTORNEY GENERAL GERTZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, thank you so much for inviting us.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to be with you all.\u00a0 Thank each and every one of you, ambassador as well.\nI believe that it\u2019s very important to point out that the work that we have been engaged in over time has been \u2013 has become even stronger as the result of the presence of Ambassador Salazar in Mexico.\nThe first thing we should mention is \u2013 and we should take this into account \u2013 crime has no borders.\u00a0 Crime is a structure that precisely takes advantage of the sovereignty of states and circumstances that are so clear about what our legal authorities, our own competencies are, to use them against the citizenry of both countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s why when we work together with full respect of each one of the governments, we can achieve something that otherwise would be absolutely impossible.\nThe first thing that I mentioned with Ambassador Salazar were three things that we were deeply concerned about because of the harm that was being caused in Mexico and the United States as a result.\u00a0 For example, what\u2019s happening with fentanyl is a phenomenon that we should attach a very high, substantive importance to.\u00a0 We are living this problem of drugs since the \u201970s and \u201980s.\u00a0 We did make some progress, but now what we\u2019re facing is one of the most horrid phenomena that\u2019s destroying the lives of young people, children in Mexico and the United States.\u00a0 This for us should be our highest priority, and I believe that whatever we do is very little as compared to what lives mean to families and new generations of Mexico and the United States.\nWe also saw something that was so important to avoid, what\u2019s being done with \u2013 to migrants.\u00a0 Migrants are victims, and those who manipulate them are heartless criminals.\u00a0 So if we don\u2019t have the ability to get to the heads of those organizations, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 won\u2019t be able to do anything.\u00a0 We cannot solve this problem.\u00a0 The problem, it comes to Mexico from all of Central America and all over the world.\u00a0 It comes to Mexico.\u00a0 We have to understand that this phenomenon is a very complicated phenomenon.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because immigrants are not criminals.\u00a0 The criminal is the one that uses them and exploits migrants in an absolutely inhuman way.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t go after the heads of these groups and these people, we\u2019re not going to be able to solve the issue.\nAnd that we\u2019re doing, what is absolutely essential to do \u2013 drug trafficking is to us a problem that dates back many, many years \u2013 we have to find a way to prevent purchase of weapons illegally in the United States and for them to flood into Mexico.\u00a0 And they cause all these confrontations, which has cost thousands and thousands of lives.\u00a0 It\u2019s absolutely essentially to understand this phenomenon, and we\u2019re very clear about this.\nAnd let me tell you one thing that I believe is of the utmost importance.\u00a0 These are data that have been upheld by the National Geographic and Statistics Institute.\u00a0 I believe that these are well known statistics by you.\u00a0 The phenomena of crime that had grown in a huge way has been stemmed.\u00a0 We don\u2019t recognize the means, but if \u2013 in reality, if you take a look at the statistics, the figures of how the mortality rates in Mexico have been evolving, and based on under this government \u2013 and remember, prevention is not my bailiwick.\u00a0 That\u2019s not my area.\u00a0 But containing these crimes, containing a criminal phenomenon for those who we know \u2013 we know what it involves and the effort that has to be made, and what\u2019s been done by the armed forces has been just exemplary.\u00a0 And this is something that we should take very much into account.\nIf you look at the statistics of how we\u2019ve stemmed common crimes, especially homicides \u2013 and let me say that when it comes to federal crimes, what we\u2019re concerned with \u2013 and this has been recognized \u2013 federal crimes have been reduced over these four years by 32 percent.\u00a0 This had never happened in the past.\u00a0 The media talk a lot about the bad stuff, but not about the good stuff.\u00a0 And so they talk more about the scandalous stuff, but we are firmly convinced that what\u2019s being done and should be recognized because that \u2013 the President of the United States is represented by the ambassador, and the ambassador has done an exemplary job.\u00a0 We\u2019re always in close contact with Secretary Mayorkas, with the Attorney General, with each and every one of you, because we believe that if we do it together, we can live up to what we have to do.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t, forget it.\u00a0 This won\u2019t work.\nAnd so a meeting like this deserves the highest respect and it deserves for us having that deep belief that we\u2019re all working on behalf of our people, our countries, but in the end we\u2019re also working \u2013 you are working for us and we\u2019re working for you as well.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to give our colleagues a minute to leave the room.\n\n"}, {"url":

Arroyo, and Mr. Secretary of the United States Antony Blinken.\u00a0 Following, the words of the ministry of foreign affairs of Peru, Dr. C\u00e9sar Landa Arroyo.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good afternoon, journalists and Mr. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 It is a great honor for us to receive you here in this House of Government within the framework of the bilateral meeting we\u2019ve had with the president of the republic to reaffirm the links which we have with the USA on which we strengthen our relationships from the foundation of our republics.\u00a0 In particular, your presence is very important for us and we want to thank you for the contribution we received from your country for our struggle against the pandemic, as well as in our challenge \u2013 our struggle against drug trafficking.\u00a0 We hope to strengthen the trade and investment links to have the necessary resources to fill the gaps we have within our society economy-wise.\nIn that sense, I would like also to say that the governability in democracy is a shared value, and the Peruvian people through elections and through the separation of powers, and in particular in the protection of human rights and the independence of the judiciary \u2013 this characterizes our democracy after we rebuilt it with the collaboration of the OAS and the Government of the United States, among others.\nFinally, I would like to stress that the commitment of the government together with the cooperation of the USA allow us to face the crisis after the pandemic as well as that which is produced by the effects of the conflict between the USSR[i]\u00a0and the Ukraine, but that we have to overcome this in coordination and with alliances, together with our vulnerable peoples in Peru, which are indigenous peoples, people with problems.\nWe have a commitment with values we share together in this bilateral meeting.\u00a0 We begin strengthening our political ties, our commercial and trade ties with the USA.\u00a0 In that sense, I really thank you for your participation within the assembly of the OAS, which has as a purpose the model Peru proposal: all together struggling against the inequality and discrimination.\u00a0 And thus we have proposals to celebrate the Lima Declaration, which reaffirms the struggle against inequality in any kind, as well as declaration to reaffirm the need to have a public health policy which warranties precisely health care for the most vulnerable people against future pandemics or natural resources; and also to reaffirm the right \u2013 the need for education, the right of people to education, which is the way in which people will acquire the basic conditions of technical and value formation to form citizens for the future.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Now we have the words of the Secretary of State of the USA Mr. Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Muchas gracias.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, C\u00e9sar, it\u2019s wonderful to be with you and wonderful to get a lot of good work done today.\u00a0 I think that work reinforces the way that we can draw on the longstanding partnership between Peru and the United States bilaterally but also together with fellow democracies across our hemisphere to make tangible progress on the issues that actually have an impact on the lives of our citizens.\u00a0 And I think you can see that in all that we actually covered today and accomplished today.\nThe foreign minister and I convened fellow ministers for a meeting of the \u2013 it\u2019s a long name \u2013 the Summit Implementation Review Group.\u00a0 What this is, is a group to follow up on the commitments that we made at the ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles a few months ago.\u00a0 There, our leaders made commitments to strengthen public health systems, to advance a regionwide digital transformation, to accelerate the clean energy transition, to invest in climate resilience and adaptation, and to promote and protect democratic governance.\nToday, we agreed to a work plan to start achieving those goals.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve already gotten to work on this since the Summit of the Americas, and we discussed some of the progress that we\u2019ve made even over the last four months toward realizing our commitments, such as partnering with the Pan American Health Organization to train half a million health care workers for our hemisphere over the next five years; implementing our partnership with Caribbean nations to develop solutions on climate, on energy, on food security through PACC 2030; and investing in Latin American and Caribbean Network for Democracy to support deepened engagement with civil society.\nC\u00e9sar and I also convened another ministerial meeting of the 21 signatories of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.\u00a0 That affirms for the first time our shared responsibility in this hemisphere in working to create the conditions for safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration \u2013 an issue where Peru is leading by example.\u00a0 At the meeting, we launched a collective implementation process with countries stepping up to lead across important lines of effort, from finding ways to better integrate migrants and support their host communities to combating xenophobia.\u00a0 Today, I announced on the part of the United States that we\u2019ll provide more than $240 million in new humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of refugees and migrants in our hemisphere as well as the host communities that welcome them.\u00a0 Just since last month, the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development announced nearly $817 million in new assistance supporting our efforts under the Los Angeles Declaration.\nAnd of course, as C\u00e9sar said, we took part in the first in-person General Assembly of the Organization of American States since 2019.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for Peru\u2019s leadership in hosting what was, I think, a constructive and consequential meeting of the OAS.\nIf you think about it, just in the time since the last OAS General Assembly in person, in 2019, we have faced as a region, as a hemisphere, no shortage of challenges, including COVID-19 and also its lasting human and economic consequences; and more recently rising food, fertilizer, and energy costs, all of which have been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 The impact of \u2013 on food supplies and fertilizer in particular has been felt profoundly here in Peru.\u00a0 And President Castillo and I discussed steps that we can take to respond to that challenge, and we committed to working on this together in the months ahead.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in Peru, in the United States, across our hemisphere, these headwinds are hitting underserved and marginalized communities the hardest \u2013 those who can least afford it.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the Lima Declaration that we and the OAS member states will adopt tomorrow to work together to advance equity and inclusion across our hemisphere is so important.\u00a0 Being together again gave us the opportunity also to recommit to the region\u2019s shared democratic values and to the proposition that we can deliver more for one another and for our people when we actually work together in common cause.\nIt\u2019s especially meaningful to make that commitment here in Lima, where our nations came together to adopt the Inter-American Democratic Charter a little over two decades ago, a step that was inspired by the grassroots mobilization of citizens across Peru at the time to defend their democracy and their right to choose their own path.\nAcross all of the issues where we\u2019re working regionally to deliver results for our people, Peru and the United States are also working together bilaterally, grounded in our shared interests and values, as we have across many administrations over many years.\nThat shared commitment was crystal-clear when the foreign minister and I met with President Castillo today.\u00a0 And we\u2019re fortunate, I must say, to have in place a terrific ambassador, Ambassador Kenna, who has been a longtime friend of mine, who is driving our bilateral cooperation across the board.\nWe discussed our shared work on migration.\u00a0 I had the chance to commend the president and the foreign minister for hosting more than 1.3 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants, and offering them a pathway to secure a more regular status.\nNearly half a million Venezuelans have already gone through this process, allowing them to work, to go to school, to access health care, and many other public services that allow them to provide for their loved ones, to build better lives, to contribute to their host communities.\nOur countries are close partners on environmental challenges as well.\u00a0 Earlier this year we came together to respond to the ecological devastation that was caused by the oil spill just north of here.\u00a0 Over the last three years, USAID has partnered with the Peruvian people and their governments and provided $60 million to improve mining practices, to fight deforestation, to promote sustainable economic development, including in indigenous communities.\nWe continue to work with Peru to address collective threats like transnational crime and drug trafficking, both of which are exacerbated by the scourge of corruption.\u00a0 Our funding, our training, our partnerships have helped Peru make important progress.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to work together in the years ahead.\nTomorrow I\u2019ll have a chance to visit the Chorrillos fish market to highlight our partnership to combat illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, which is inflicting significant harm on Peru\u2019s marine economy and environment.\u00a0 It\u2019s going directly to the livelihoods of Peruvians who are in the fishing business.\nWe also committed to protecting Peru\u2019s awe-inspiring culture and heritage.\u00a0 For the last 25 years, we\u2019ve worked together to return more than seven \u2013 excuse me, 2,000 Peruvian cultural artifacts that were once illegally trafficked in the United States.\nFinally, let me say this:\u00a0 For all the ties that bind our countries, none run as deep as the ties between our people.\u00a0 There are more than half a million Peruvian Americans living in the United States.\u00a0 For generations, they\u2019ve enriched the fabric of our country and our communities, including individuals like the legendary Peruvian American singer Yma Sumac, who is the subject of a mural commissioned at the United States embassy here in Lima to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of her birth \u2013 a mural I\u2019m very much looking forward to getting a chance to see tomorrow.\nSo I apologize for going on so long, but I think that\u2019s just evidence that we\u2019ve had a very productive day \u2013 both with our OAS colleagues, and bilaterally between the United States and Peru.\nWe and our partners continue to demonstrate real progress on the challenges that matter most in the lives of our people, and we\u2019re going to build on that progress in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Following, we have a round of questions with the media.\u00a0 Mr. Juan Carlos Portilla from Latina.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Foreign Minister Landa, here from Latina \u2013 here to your right.\u00a0 Well, Minister, you already have mentioned some aspects of the conversation you\u2019ve had with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 However, I would like to ask you if there are some specific aspects or if there will be a possibility of assigning some kind of agreement or trade agreement within the following months within the framework of these conversations.\nAnd if you allow me to thank you in advance, the Peruvian congress has denied the permit \u2013 the permission to President Castillo to travel abroad.\u00a0 I understand that there was a very important agenda with several people from the European Union.\u00a0 How much impact has this \u2013 does this have on the Government of Peru?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Well, Peru\u2019s foreign policy is based on multilaterality on one hand, and on the other hand, in accordance with our constitution, the president is the director of international relationships.\u00a0 And thus, that is why we have a presidential diplomacy which has taken the president to the General Assembly of the OAS, to Los Angeles, among other trips he has been doing.\nIn that sense, the determination of congress today is a great surprise for our ministry, and also for our partners and friend countries.\u00a0 Because His Holiness Pope Francis expected the president the following Monday, 17th, in an audience, but also he was going to have a visit in this month of October because most of \u2013 October is a very important month for religious topics because for Peru it is a \u2013 there is a great devotion during this month to\u00a0el Se\u00f1or de Los Milagros, and apart from the agendas foreseen for our meeting with the world food fund, or the food program of the UN, to strengthen the struggle against food insecurity is frustrated, and also the meeting with the leaders of the European Union to strengthen those bonds for common cooperation.\u00a0 So I would ask the representatives of congress to review this decision, because it compromises not the president himself, but the external policy in particular, and humanitarian policy also.\nAnd in particular with the United States, we have a treaty \u2013 free trade agreement which is an ongoing perfectioning, and we\u2019ve increased exports mostly from the production of SMEs with an added value.\u00a0 And the investments that are being carried out and within the international scenario, which might be complicated because of the effects of the crisis, we maintain the trust as in the meeting in the \u2013 in New York City with the American news society, with 40 entrepreneurs, where we reaffirmed juridical stability, legal stability, the respect for the agreements.\u00a0 And this also has to do with our respect for labor laws and payment for taxes.\nSo we will continue strengthening our links not only commercially, but also the struggle against \u2013 in the struggle against drug trafficking and trying to close the gaps, social gaps of extreme poverty and protect the most vulnerable peoples of Peru.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Well, what are the \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister.\nMr. Secretary, following the OPEC+ decision to cut production targets, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said it\u2019s time for a wholesale re-evaluation of the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 My questions are:\u00a0 Is there any thinking within the administration for such a re-evaluation?\u00a0 How worried are you that Gulf partners are inching towards Russia?\u00a0 And given that inching, should the United States continue to provide weapons to Saudi Arabia?\nOn Ukraine, very briefly, President Biden earlier today was asked if he will meet President Putin during G20, and he said it remains to be seen.\u00a0 He did not rule it out.\u00a0 You\u2019ve said in the past that Russians aren\u2019t prepared for meaningful diplomacy; that\u2019s why you\u2019re not engaging.\u00a0 But right now, there are increasing concerns over the possibility of a nuclear attack.\u00a0 Don\u2019t you think it is the responsibility of the United States to initiate diplomacy with Russia at a time like this?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, since the start of President Castillo\u2019s term, there has been intense turmoil surrounding his government.\u00a0 He had to reshuffle his cabinet several times and has been grappling with corruption charges.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t that endanger Peru\u2019s democracy, economy, and the stability of its policies?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Humeyra.\u00a0 First, on the OPEC decision, I think as you\u2019ve heard clearly from my colleagues in the White House and the administration, we see the decision as both disappointing and short-sighted, especially as we have a global economy that is dealing with the implications of recovering from COVID, as well as the aggression from Russia in Ukraine, the consequences that\u2019s having.\nWe\u2019ve said all along that supply needs to meet demand, and we\u2019ve been clear about that and we\u2019ve been working on that.\u00a0 And as you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps over the last months to try to ensure that that\u2019s the case, including releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, increasing significantly our production \u2013 oil production is up in the United States by about 500,000 barrels a day \u2013 and looking at other steps that we can take to ensure that there is adequate supply to meet \u2013 to meet global demand.\nThe National Economic Council Advisor, our National Security Advisor yesterday laid out some of the additional steps, tools, authorities that we\u2019re looking at, again, to make sure that we have adequate supply of energy on the market to meet demand.\nAs to the relationship going forward, we\u2019re reviewing a number of response options.\u00a0 We\u2019re consulting closely with Congress.\u00a0 We will not do anything that would infringe on our interests \u2013 that\u2019s first and foremost what will guide us \u2013 and we will keep all of those interests in mind and consult closely with all of the relevant stakeholders as we decide on any steps going forward.\nWith regard to Ukraine, I think what you\u2019ve seen in recent weeks is a doubling and tripling down by President Putin on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine \u2013 the mobilization of reserves, the purported annexation of Ukrainian territory, and of course some of the loose talk that we\u2019ve heard about nuclear weapons.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also seen of course the very significant gains by Ukrainians to regain the land that was seized from them by Russian forces, both in the northeast and in the south.\nBut the fact is that President Putin and Russia have shown absolutely no interest in any kind of meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 And unless and until they do, it\u2019s very hard to pursue it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve said all along, President Zelenskyy has said all along that this will ultimately be resolved through diplomacy.\u00a0 And if and when Russia shows that it has any seriousness of purpose about engaging in such diplomacy, we\u2019ll be ready, we\u2019ll be there.\u00a0 But every sign in this moment unfortunately points in the opposite direction.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Mr. Harold Chavez from Exitosa.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good afternoon, Foreign Minister.\u00a0 Good afternoon, Secretary.\u00a0 Harold Chavez from Exitosa.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, we would like to know which agreements you wish to get to agree upon in the OAS assembly.\u00a0 And if you allow me to speak about the impeachment facing the speech of Pedro Castillo.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Yeah, thank you very much.\u00a0 The General Assembly of the OAS, which has as purpose the crisis which is produced in our national reality and globally to \u2013 which has generated perverse consequences towards the most vulnerable peoples \u2013 that is why the focus of struggle against inequality and discrimination is not finished in \u2013 with a food topic, which is necessary, of course, satisfaction of basic social needs, but also, as it is mentioned, of struggle against corruption because it is an evil which affects and impacts on the public budget, or bad management, and also on \u2013 impacts on the piece of services by which the most vulnerable people must receive.\u00a0 And there is an agreement of struggle against corruption, but also because of the Peruvian experience of the last decades where the clause of integrity is present in many agreements or treaties that Peru has been signing or renewing.\nIn that sense, it is part, of course, of the deliberations of the internal assembly of the OAS, and in particular in food security, which is a human right for the populations.\u00a0 The most affected or vulnerable must have the possibility of have a minimum of nutritional health \u2013 girls and boys and people from the fields, from the \u2013 inside the country who do not have their main needs, basic needs covered.\u00a0 That is why in the scope of international political arena or on the strengthening of the public system in terms of health and also nutrition and food, we need to increase the public budgets to strengthen and give resources and programs to those areas.\u00a0 And this should not be made only locally \u2013 locally but all together with other countries, learning from experiences from other countries in topics of health and nutrition, as Mr. Secretary has mentioned, of strengthening this \u2013 in these topics with international cooperation both bilaterally and multilaterally will allow us to have success in solving these problems.\nThe impeachment which has been formed facing the speech of the president of the republic facing the \u2013 in the assembly of the OAS, on one hand it\u2019s the acknowledgment that the president is the director of the external policy with regard to our constitution, and of this presidential diplomacy he expresses in forums regionally or globally, as in the United Nations, the guidelines of the external policy, which is not from this government but from the state during the last years.\u00a0 And that is why we\u2019ve signed the principles of the UN, which are peace and security and the acknowledgment of the struggle of peoples, which in decolonization progresses under the UN have been having progress.\nAnd with this, the impeachment will have to be answered to with \u2013 in accordance to the summons of the \u2013 of parliament.\u00a0 In a more precise manner, when I went there to the audience two weeks ago in accordance to the new questions they asked, we will have to clarify.\u00a0 It is an external policy independent and within the framework of international values of respect to the state of democracy, not only in Peru but in the whole world.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Vivian Salama,\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Minister Landa,\u00a0gracias por alojarnos.\u00a0 Una pregunta en ingl\u00e9s, por favor.\u00a0 Gracias.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo are you \u2013 okay.\u00a0 I wanted to ask you about the impact of the Ukraine war on Peru and the region in the coming months, in particular Peru\u2019s efforts to secure fertilizers.\u00a0 What measures is Peru and its allies in the region taking to try to ease prices from climbing even further?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMr. Secretary, thank you so much for having us along with you on this trip.\u00a0 First, my question on Venezuela.\u00a0 Some recent events, including last week\u2019s successful prisoner swap by the administration, also today\u2019s vote on whether Juan Guaid\u00f3 should be allowed to be represented at OAS, are being viewed by the Venezuelan opposition as a blow, particularly one that buys Maduro some time.\u00a0 Is the U.S. ultimately losing faith in the prospect that Guaid\u00f3 might be its primary partner in Venezuela?\u00a0 And when his term ends at the end of this year, is there a prospect that the U.S. deals with neither Guaid\u00f3 or Maduro?\nAnd secondly a quick question on the UK, the global economy.\u00a0 As the global economy faces a slowdown, Britain has some unique challenges.\u00a0 Liz Truss, your former counterpart, has struggled since becoming Britain\u2019s new prime minister.\u00a0 Are you confident that the UK will be able to manage \u2013 maintain its focus on some of the mutual global priorities like the war in Ukraine and the global energy crisis given the ongoing political and economic turmoil?\nThank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) The foreign policy of Peru (inaudible) in these principles of multilateralism has diplomatic relationships with hundreds of countries in the world.\u00a0 And due to Russia\u2019s aggression on Ukraine, Peru made a declaration within the framework of the UN condemning Russia because they broke the basic principles of the UN constitution of solving problems with dialogue and negotiation, which is what Peru continues to defend with regard to this conflict, which of course has impacted on Peru and in the whole world because it has broken the supply chain of urea and grain.\u00a0 And Peru has had to find elsewhere, and we\u2019ve been talking to Mr. Antony Blinken to strengthen the cooperation of supply of fertilizers and urea which are demanded by the great extensions in agriculture in Peru, mostly survival farming that we have here in Peru.\nAnd in the assembly of the OAS, we \u2013 we have heard President Zelenskyy asking for support in his conflict, and within this framework of Peru\u2019s external policy, we again give him his support and we wish to find a solution in \u2013 because the civil society is the most affected in every war.\nAnd within this logic, Peru also has a commitment apart from the international circumstances to have an agricultural policy which protects the small farmers, mostly the rural families, so as to establish some kind of bonds \u2013 bonuses for the acquirement of urea, and establish bonds to have this supply.\u00a0 And it is very complex now because of the conflicts, but with the cooperation of the \u2013 our friend countries from the region and other latitudes too, we are seeking to satisfy this demand.\u00a0 And with \u2013 along this logic, the second agrarian reform as stated by the government wants \u2013 wishes to be translated with \u2013 by a better supply of these resources which the agrarian population needs.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Let me, if I can comment briefly on the question that you posed to the foreign minister before getting into the questions you directed at me.\u00a0 With the Russian aggression against Ukraine, we saw what was already a very difficult situation around the world when it came to food insecurity get even worse.\u00a0 Already with climate change, with COVID, we\u2019d seen significant impacts on the supply of food, including grain, including fertilizer, as well as price.\u00a0 But the Russian aggression exacerbated that dramatically, and we\u2019re now in a situation where we have more than 200 million people around the world who are severely food-insecure.\nFrom day one, we have worked to counteract that crisis and that situation.\u00a0 Back in March, shortly after the Russian aggression, President Biden dedicated a half a billion dollars to food fertilizer production in the United States to try to get more fertilizer on the market and to try to keep prices in check.\u00a0 In addition, we\u2019ve been leading the effort internationally to deal with the food insecurity prices more broadly.\u00a0 At the United Nations back in May, as you may remember, we brought dozens of countries together and we put forward a call to action, a roadmap for how to deal with food insecurity.\u00a0 More than a hundred countries now have signed onto that roadmap, and it includes specific steps that we\u2019re taking together both to deal with the immediate emergency situation that countries find themselves in but also with the mid-term and the long-term to ensure that countries have and develop the durable productive capacity that they need to produce food for themselves for the long term.\nWe also have one of the most significant programs in our government called Feed the Future that will dedicate $11 billion over five years to helping build long-term food security in countries that need assistance.\nToday we talked with President Castillo about work that our two countries can do together to address the fertilizer challenge here in Peru, and we\u2019re committed to doing that in the weeks ahead.\nOn Venezuela, there is no change in our policy or on our approach.\u00a0 There\u2019s no change to our sanctions policy.\u00a0 That can only follow constructive steps by the Maduro regime to move toward free and fair elections, to engage in negotiations with the Unitary Platform, and for there to be genuine progress in those negotiations.\nWe\u2019ve also said very clearly that we\u2019ll review our policies, including our sanctions policies, in response to constructive steps by the Maduro regime to restore democracy in Venezuela as well as to alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people, who are the number one victims of the policies of the regime.\u00a0 And at the same time, we will also review and, if necessary, recalibrate our approach if there\u2019s even more repression by the regime.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where we are.\u00a0 And as I said, there\u2019s no change.\nWhen it comes to Prime Minister Truss, I\u2019m obviously not going to comment on internal politics in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 What I can comment on is the prime minister herself, her character.\u00a0 She\u2019s someone that I had the fortune to get to know very well when she was foreign minister, and we worked very closely together over more than a year, particularly on the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\nNo one took a stronger, more principled stand against the Russian aggression; no one was more determined to make sure that we were doing everything possible to support Ukraine, to put pressure on Russia, as well as to strengthen our alliance, our defensive alliance, NATO, in case aggression extended beyond Ukraine, than then-foreign secretary and now Prime Minister Truss.\u00a0 And I have zero doubt that that will continue in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Ladies and gentlemen, the presentation before the press is (inaudible).\u00a0 Thank you to the media.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-before-the-meeting-with-cuban-venezuelan-and-nicaraguan-human-rights-defenders/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony

you.\u00a0\u00a0Buenos dias,\u00a0bom dia,\u00a0bonjour, good afternoon to everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with all of our colleagues here today.\nAnd I\u2019m especially grateful that we\u2019ve been able to hold the OAS General Assembly in person for the first time since 2019, and I want to start by again thanking our hosts here in Peru for the wonderful hospitality, the wonderful organization.\nSince the last time we met in person, I think it\u2019s fair to say that our hemisphere has faced no shortage of challenges.\u00a0 No region in the world has been harder hit by the pandemic or its economic consequences.\nAnd then just as we were beginning to recover, we ran into new headwinds \u2013 rising food and energy costs, which have been worsened by President Putin\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.\nWhat we\u2019ve also experienced is that the consequences have fallen disproportionately on communities that have historically been marginalized or underserved.\u00a0 People of African descent, and other racial and ethnic minorities.\u00a0 Indigenous communities.\u00a0 Women and girls.\u00a0 People with disabilities.\u00a0 LGBTQI+ people.\nThe recent headwinds have been compounded by longstanding, pre-existing challenges across the region: a chronic lack of economic opportunity; an accelerating climate crisis; endemic corruption, all of which are driving people to leave their homes in unprecedented numbers, despite knowing the serious risks of the journey.\nCitizens across our hemisphere are looking to their governments \u2013 to us\u00a0\u2013 to help address these problems, to create the conditions, and give them the tools they need, to actually improve their lives.\u00a0 So it\u2019s one of the greatest tests that our nations face \u2013 indeed have faced since we came together in Lima to adopt the Inter-American Democratic Charter on that indelible September 11 day in 2001.\nWe believe strongly that we can meet this test if \u2013 if we come together to close two gaps between what our democracies promise and what they deliver.\nFirst, we can address enduring inequities in access to opportunity, which have for too long prevented communities from reaching their full potential.\nThis social compact has been at the heart of the OAS since its conception.\u00a0 Under President Biden\u2019s leadership, we are committed to partnering with countries across the region to deliver solutions to challenges affecting all of our people \u2013 challenges that no country can solve alone.\nIn the Caribbean, where today, two-thirds of the people are experiencing food insecurity, we\u2019re partnering with CARICOM to combat hunger and malnutrition, but also giving farmers the tools they need to boost productivity and adapt to the growing effects of climate change, so that communities can actually feed their own people as well as others.\nTogether with partners, we\u2019re working to meet the commitment we made at the Summit of Americas in June to train and equip half a million local health care workers across the hemisphere, so that more people can get the quality care that they need in their own communities.\u00a0 This initiative in and of itself can help revolutionize access to health care and the quality of health care.\nThrough the efforts of Vice President Harris, we have raised $3.2 billion in investment commitments from more than 40 companies to promote broad-based economic opportunity in El Salvador and Guatemala and Honduras \u2013 from expanding access to rural broadband to helping create good-paying jobs in manufacturing to providing small, minority and women-owned businesses with access to credit.\nAcross these efforts and others, we focused on empowering communities that have experienced systematic marginalization over the years because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u00a0 Because when all communities have equal access to development, all of society benefits.\u00a0 And because more equal democracies tend to be more stable and secure partners.\u00a0 That\u2019s the spirit of the Lima Declaration \u2013 \u201cTogether Against Inequality and Discrimination\u201d \u2013 that we will collectively adopt tomorrow.\nA few days ago in Colombia, I had the honor of formally committing the United States to be the first international accompanier of the Ethnic Chapter of the country\u2019s 2016 peace agreement.\nThis is a visionary document because it recognizes that a lasting peace cannot be achieved without making strides toward greater equity, justice, and inclusion for the country\u2019s Afro\u2011Colombian and Indigenous communities who suffered disproportionately during the country\u2019s conflict.\nAdvancing equity is also crucial to building durable democracy \u2013 not just in Colombia, but across our hemisphere.\u00a0 Including the United States, where we have our own deep history of discrimination, which is still felt in our society.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden has made the fight for equity and racial justice a priority for our administration \u2013 at home as well as around the world.\nI have to tell you it\u2019s been one of my highest priorities at the State Department, because we know that the incredible diversity of our country is one of our greatest strengths, including in our foreign policy.\u00a0 It makes us stronger.\u00a0 It makes us smarter.\u00a0 It makes us more creative.\u00a0 It gives us the plurality of voices and views and visions that are vital to our own democratic experiment and to being a better partner to fellow democracies across the hemisphere.\u00a0 I appointed the Department\u2019s first chief diversity and inclusion officer to help drive progress toward a more diverse institution that actually looks like the country it represents and, as well, our first Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice, Desiree Cormier Smith, who is part of our delegation to the General Assembly to help us promote these efforts around the world.\nSo that\u2019s one big piece.\u00a0 The second is this:\u00a0 We believe that we have to recommit to delivering on the core principles of our OAS and Inter\u2011American Democratic Charters.\u00a0 There are so many ways member states can help make real the commitments embodied in those charters.\nWe can unequivocally condemn the authoritarian regimes in our region and take collective steps to hold them accountable.\nIn Nicaragua, the Ortega-Murillo regime is shamelessly flouting virtually every principle of the OAS and Democratic Charters \u2013 arbitrarily locking up its political opponents, brutally cracking down on protestors, committing flagrant election fraud, attacking and imprisoning journalists and human rights defenders.\nThe Cuban regime continues to imprison hundreds of people unjustly detained in the July 11th, 2021 protests for the supposed crime of coming out into the streets to peacefully call on their government to meet their basic needs, and for demanding human rights.\u00a0 Some of those incarcerated are minors; others were sentenced to decades in prison just for speaking their minds.\nMeanwhile, in Venezuela, the Maduro regime has repeatedly denied the Venezuelan people\u2019s right to pick their own leaders, caused a humanitarian catastrophe that\u2019s displaced more than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants toward whom Venezuela\u2019s neighbors have shown extraordinary generosity.\u00a0 All OAS member states should be able to come together to support a negotiated solution that leads to free and fair elections in Venezuela in 2024.\nWe can further reaffirm our commitment to the OAS and Democratic Charters by defending their principles around the world, as our member states did when the OAS became one of the first multilateral bodies to condemn President Putin\u2019s brutal war on Ukraine and then subsequently suspended Russia\u2019s membership as a Permanent OAS Observer.\nIt\u2019s crucial that we stay united by condemning Russia\u2019s sham referenda as a violation of international law, and unequivocally rejecting any attempts to illegally annex Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 And I think the statement that member states signed on to today led by Guatemala demonstrates that.\u00a0 And we hope that countries will similarly support the UN General Assembly resolution that is expected to come up in the next week or so.\nWe can help our fellow democracies that are struggling most to meet their citizens\u2019 basic needs.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we co-sponsored the resolution before this General Assembly on Haiti, which supports solutions driven by Haiti\u2019s government, political parties, civil society, diaspora, and private sector to address the country\u2019s deteriorating security situation, to restore its democratic institutions, to foster conditions so the Haitian people can finally realize their full potential.\nFinally, we can speak up when democratically\u2011elected leaders in our region borrow from the playbook of autocrats to try to stay in power and erode checks and balances, like passing legislation that grants the government overly broad powers to crack down on the media and civil society, extending term limits; harassing, persecuting, or firing independent government officials like prosecutors and judges for doing their job.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing more leaders taking these anti\u2011democratic steps \u2013 often under the false justification that they enjoy popular support.\nWe will work to bring more partners into this effort: civil society organizations, the private sector, youth groups, and other parts of our governments, which is why the United States is pleased new text \u2013 is pleased to present, excuse me, new text, for this assembly calling for more robust inter\u2011parliamentary engagement on issues of common concern.\nBut I want to be very clear that this is not about picking sides between left and right or between liberal and conservative.\u00a0 It\u2019s about putting our shared commitment to democracy above loyalty to ideology or to party.\u00a0 It\u2019s about defending the rights and aspirations of people across our hemisphere.\u00a0 It\u2019s about standing up and giving meaning to the words that we all signed on to in the charters and indeed in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nUltimately, I\u2019m confident that we will be able to meet this moment because while citizens may not be satisfied with the way their democracies are working, most still think it\u2019s the best way to tackle the everyday problems they face and actually improve their lives in tangible ways.\nCitizens still believe.\u00a0 And if they believe and are willing to engage to be our partners across this hemisphere in improving democracies from within, then there is no challenge that we cannot overcome if we do it together.\u00a0 That\u2019s the spirit that the United States brings to our common enterprise and to this hemisphere that we share.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Lima Convention Center", "location": "Lima, Peru", "date": "October 6, 2022", "content": "\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA: (Via interpreter) Good morning, everyone. Mr. Secretary of State of the United States of America Antony Blinken, ladies and gentlemen, ministers of foreign affairs, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Peruvian Government, I would like to warmly welcome you to this meeting called by the U.S. to follow up on the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.\nOur countries are \u2013 currently send, receive migrants. We are centers of transit for migrants. There are multidirectional migrant flows that lead to complex situations, and we firmly believe that we must work on these in a welcoming way, integrating migrants into our societies. Migration has been especially relevant in the Americas, and it has been a part of our migration policies throughout time. Migrants then have adapted or have provided to the development in our countries and contributed to cultures and identities.\nToday, migrant flows present interesting challenges, and we must continue to observe our principles, seeing migrants as people who are entitled to rights. That is why we are here in order to talk and develop joint solutions as actors in different areas of migration, because our goal is to create a migration agenda that is common for the Americas for our times. Our countries then have been managing migration at the domestic level as well as via international mechanisms in order to satisfy the needs of migrants. They have diverse circumstances and, therefore, may be more vulnerable in different stages of mobility. That is why our national offices and international agencies must defend the human rights of migrants, must promote their social and economic integration, and provide for regularization. Working with migrants, asylum systems for refugees, must be dealt with in order to combat human trafficking as well as the illegal trafficking of migrants, discrimination, and xenophobia.\nLadies and gentlemen, our response has been broad and generous, and in many cases our capacity to receive migrants has been overcome. Therefore, we require international cooperation. The challenges of migration have led to national responses that have opened roads for proper management of migration. Peru\u2019s work in migration has worked specifically at the Interagency Working Group for Migration Management, the goal of which is to share knowledge on migration, expertise, good practices, and initiatives regarding the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Humane Migration.\nThe work of this working group has been included in the UN documents on good practices, and it is considered an efficient platform to work together, coordinate among agencies in a multidimensional fashion in Peru. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to continue to strengthen our joint work in different spaces so that we provide a comprehensive, hemispheric solution to the phenomenon of migration.\nFinally, I would like to highlight what is stated in the L.A. Declaration \u2013 the fundamental work that we continue to do in the regional framework for protection and finding solutions, the Regional Conference on Migration and the South American Conference on Migration are key actors that may facilitate the implementation of this declaration.\nFinally, the Los Angeles Declaration proposes a plan to manage different areas and proposes 11 working groups based on four pillars of the declaration: stability and assistance; legal pathways protection; humane management of migration; and a coordinated approach in emergency cases.\nLadies and gentlemen, I trust that this meeting will be productive and will benefit our migrants. Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR: We will hear now from the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, thank you very much. And Foreign Minister Landa, C\u00e9sar, thank you for the remarkable hospitality that Peru is showing all of us here. Thank you also for your remarkable generosity in hosting more than 1.2 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants \u2013 relevant to what we\u2019re about to discuss.\nIn June, our countries met at the Summit of the Americas to adopt the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. The declaration, now endorsed by 21 countries, affirms our shared interest in handling this challenge in a way that enhances stability, increases opportunities for safe and orderly migration, while holding criminals and human traffickers accountable.\nIndeed, countries have already taken important steps on their own to deliver on the commitment that we made in Los Angeles.\nBelize launched a program in August to help register asylum seekers, refugees, and other vulnerable migrants who\u2019ve been living without official documentation. More than 5,000 migrants have already applied for the program with more expected in the coming days.\nEcuador opened a registration process in September for Venezuelan migrants to apply for legal protection. In the first month alone, more than 100,000 registered for the program. In total, more than 500,000 Venezuelan migrants are expected to apply and ultimately receive legal status in Ecuador.\nAnd Colombia, which in 2021 launched a historic initiative offering 10-year Temporary Protective Status to the more than 2.4 million Venezuelans living in the country, continued to implement its program with remarkable efficiency. More than 1.4 million Venezuelans have received already TPS cards which grant them access to public services and allow them to build new lives.\nThe United States is pleased to help support nine Migrant Integration Centers in cities across Colombia, where migrants can receive TPS cards and also get connected to services like job training, school, health care.\nJust this Tuesday, I had the opportunity to visit one of these centers in Bogot\u00e1, where I met a family of three \u2013 a mother, a father, and their nine-month-old son who fled Venezuela six months ago. Thanks to Colombia\u2019s generosity, the son can now attend publicly provided daycare and his parents were able to get loans, training, and equipment to start a small business. The father has now started his own business making blue jeans while the mother runs her own bakery. Their enterprises benefit everyone, from the workers that they employ, to the customers who buy their goods, to the community that benefits from extra economic activity.\nIntegrating migrants through efforts like these will not only improve their lives but also strengthen the communities they live in. It will make it easier for them to work, to pick up new skills, to start a small business, through which they\u2019ll pay taxes and spur local commerce \u2013 all activities that drive economic growth. And these efforts will contribute to the richness of their host countries, which will benefit from their many cultural and social contributions as well.\nIn addition to teaming up with many of the countries here today, the United States has also taken steps on our own to deliver on the Los Angeles Declaration. Earlier this summer, we resumed the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, which creates a more efficient pathway for Cubans in the United States to apply for reunification with their loved ones. The United States also launched a new system to make it easier and faster to process asylum claims. Once fully implemented, most asylum cases will be resolved in months \u2013 not years, as is the current norm.\nWe continue to rebuild and revitalize our Refugee Resettlement Program. This year we\u2019re on track to resettle the most refugees from the Western Hemisphere since 2015.\nAnd we have expanded legal labor pathways. This fiscal year, the United States nearly doubled the number of Temporary Worker Visas to northern Central American nationals, from approximately 9,800 to more than 19,000, to help U.S. employers meet the demand for seasonal workers at a time of serious labor shortage. These visas come with significant protections and offer a safe, lawful way for temporary workers to work in jobs that are not filled by Americans.\nToday, we are announcing two additional steps that we\u2019re taking to support our shared work on migration. First, the United States is providing more than $240 million in new humanitarian and bilateral and regional assistance to help meet the needs of refugees and migrants throughout our hemisphere, including through providing health services, shelter, education, and legal assistance. The support will help host communities better integrate migrant populations, including by funding programs that support migrants in applying for official status. And it will provide international law enforcement and border security assistance to help partner governments find criminals and human traffickers who prey on vulnerable people.\nSecond, in keeping with the Los Angeles Declaration, we\u2019re launching a collective implementation process so that we can turn our shared commitments into reality. Last week, we hosted many colleagues at the White House to kick off our work along several crucial lines of effort, from finding ways to better integrate migrants and support host communities, to combating xenophobia, to countering human trafficking and smuggling.\nMost countries agreed to either lead or contribute to this work, and I encourage those countries that have not yet joined a line of effort to consider doing so today.\nIn our meeting today and in the months ahead, we\u2019ll need to continue to drive progress across our commitments under the declaration throughout the region. This includes continuing to work together to address the root causes of migration, including a lack of economic opportunity, chronic insecurity, climate change, endemic corruption, which \u2013 if unaddressed \u2013 will only deepen the migration challenge that we face.\nWe need to tap into the breadth of experience of every country around this table, some of which have been at the forefront of providing humane protection to migrants for decades. We\u2019ll also need to call upon the depth of expertise of city officials, civil society leaders, businesses, humanitarian workers, who are on the front lines of supporting migrants and host communities.\nUltimately, that is how we will make real, lasting progress toward a regional approach that respects the dignity of each migrant as well supporting the host communities in countries that host them. We know \u2013 all of us \u2013 that we are facing what is genuinely a historic challenge. We have more people on the move around the world displaced from their homes than at any time in record history, more than 100 million, and our own hemisphere is experiencing that in deep, profound, and new ways.\nLos Angeles represents a recognition, an understanding, that this is a shared responsibility. Not one of us can meet this challenge alone, but we can \u2013 we can \u2013 if we work together. That\u2019s the spirit of Los Angeles. That\u2019s the spirit that we\u2019re continuing today, and we very much look forward to hearing ideas on how we can do that and do it effectively. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-organization-of-the-american-states-secretary-general-luis-almagro-at-the-ministerial-meeting-of-the-summit-implementation-review-group-sirg/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Lima Convention Center", "location": "Lima, Peru", "date": "October 6, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to see so many colleagues here this morning.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone, for attending.\u00a0 And Secretary General, wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 We have a very busy day ahead, but I\u2019m very grateful that everyone has agreed to start with this session this morning.\u00a0 I have a few words to say at the outset before turning it over to the secretary general, and then starting our session.\nSo I want to welcome everyone, first and foremost, to the Summit Implementation Review Group Ministerial.\u00a0 And I\u2019d very much like to thank our vice chair, Foreign Minister Landa for his partnership, and of course Secretary General Almagro for his leadership.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to the representatives here of the Joint Summit Working Group for their efforts to actually turn our commitments into action.\nIn June, we met in Los Angeles for the Ninth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 There we adopted five core commitments to address big challenges facing our people \u2013 challenges that none of our countries can effectively address alone.\u00a0 We arrived at these commitments following months of consultation between our governments, as well as engagement with civil society, with youth leaders, with the private sector.\nFirst, we pledged to strengthen public health systems across the Americas, working alongside partners like civil society representatives, researchers, business leaders.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on expanding access to quality, equitable health services, strengthening systems so that we can address challenges we face today and better detect and prevent future health emergencies.\nSecond, we committed to the first regional agenda for digital transformation \u2013 improving access to the internet and other digital tools, especially for historically marginalized communities.\u00a0 That includes promoting digital literacy, privacy, and cyber security, and also accelerating the digital transformation of government services and using technology to make government more transparent.\nThird, we committed to accelerate the clean energy transition by cutting emissions and expanding renewable energy.\u00a0 We also pledged to help develop a responsible mining sector and strengthen the regional supply \u2013 mineral supply chains that are vital to powering clean energy technologies.\nFourth, we resolved to invest more in climate resilience, to help our committees adapt to the growing effects of climate change, from climate smart agriculture to sustainable fishing, and to improve disaster preparedness and response.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also help communities recover from droughts, from floods and storms.\nFinally, we endorse the Inter-American Action Plan on Democratic Governance, committing to promote and protect human rights, the rule of law, and greater social inclusion.\u00a0 We agreed to bolster transparent and accountable governance and combat threats to democracy from corruption and disinformation.\nThe point of this morning\u2019s gathering is for us to report on the progress we\u2019ve made toward realizing these five core commitments, to see where we can do more together, and to make actual plans for doing so.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we hold ourselves accountable and actually turn our pledges into action.\nIn a moment, I\u2019ll suggest a calendar and working procedures for the coming year.\u00a0 The calendar sets out a schedule for developing action plans, convening subject matter experts, and reporting on our progress over the next year.\u00a0 The working procedures address logistics and outline the different roles and responsibilities for this group so that we can collaborate efficiently and effectively.\nBut first, let me quickly share some of what the United States has done since we last met.\u00a0 For example, we\u2019re working toward a pledge we made in support of the first commitment \u2013 strengthening health systems in the region.\u00a0 In June, we announced that we\u2019d joined the Pan American Health Organization to train 500,000 public health professionals in the region over the next five years.\u00a0 That will dramatically increase access to health care for millions who don\u2019t have it, and raise the quality of care for those who do.\u00a0 Last week, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, hosted a meeting with his counterparts from across the region to develop an implementation plan so that we can help meet the needs of countries throughout our hemisphere.\nWe\u2019re also making progress toward the third and fourth commitments \u2013 expanding clean energy, and adapting to climate change.\u00a0 In the last few months, we began to implement PACC 2030, the U.S.-Caribbean partnership to address the climate crisis, by teaming up with Caribbean partners and technical experts to create action plans on energy security, climate-smart technology, and global food security.\u00a0 Last month, Vice President Harris met with Carribean leaders in Washington to review our progress.\nAnd we\u2019re working toward our fifth commitment, strengthening democracy, by investing in civil society.\u00a0 So far we\u2019ve provided almost $2 million to REDLAD, the Latin American and Caribbean Network for Democracy, to support civic engagement, including by helping civil society monitor countries\u2019 implementation of their summit commitments.\nEvery one of these efforts is collaborative.\u00a0 Every one is reaching across borders and across sectors.\u00a0 Because the challenges we face are too big for any of our countries, governments, or people to solve alone.\nSo it\u2019s critical that we continue to strengthen and expand these partnerships, and not just with federal governments, but also with mayors, with community leaders, with NGOs, with the private sector, with regional organizations.\nThat\u2019s why the United States is hosting the first ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver next April.\u00a0 We\u2019ll bring together people from across the hemisphere, municipal and community leaders, entrepreneurs and academics, and indigenous and underrepresented groups, and we\u2019ll find ways to build on our summit commitments at the local level to make progress on the issues that matter most in our communities.\nAs we move forward, we\u2019ll also lay the groundwork for the Tenth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Alvarez has recently informed us of the offer by the Dominican Republic to host that summit.\u00a0 The United States fully supports this offer.\nThese are early days for our common efforts, but we\u2019ve already made concrete progress to implement the ambitious commitments that our leaders agreed to in Los Angeles.\u00a0 Now we just need to keep up the momentum.\nI very much look forward to hearing from colleagues about the areas where we\u2019re making progress today, as well as in our future meetings.\u00a0 And I look forward to discussing where we need to do more to build a strong, stable, prosperous, and resilient hemisphere for all of our people.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Secretary General Almagro.\u00a0 Luis.\nSECRETARY GENERAL ALMAGRO:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) On behalf of the General Secretariat of the OAS and technical secretariat and institutional memory of the summit process, the JSWG offers or welcomes you to this meeting to look at the implementation of the summit as we celebrate the second General Assembly of the OAS.\nMr. Chairman, delegates, colleagues, three months ago we met in Los Angeles on the occasion of the ninth summit, in which we spoke of a host of urgent challenges faced by the hemisphere.\u00a0 And we took actions accordingly \u2013 five different political commitments set by heads of state and government that were adopted.\u00a0 Now, today, on the occasion of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, under the model of together against discrimination and inequality, we thank the U.S. for its leadership in carrying out a \u2013 or heading up a productive dialogue that led to the successful carrying out of the summit.\u00a0 Despite the different perspectives that exist throughout the region, the ninth summit was an opportunity for leaders of the hemisphere to reach a shared commitment.\nIt is key within this context we continue progressing along those guidelines in a constructive way so that citizens of the \u2013 or that citizens of the hemisphere expect the political commitments and mandates adopted give us a framework, of course, to address the most pressing issues in the hemisphere and to adopt of host of public policies.\u00a0 These commitments include the need to strengthen the health care systems, to establish a regional digital transformation agenda, climate change matters, and to address the needs of energy transition, and to protect our ecosystems, and to respond to growing threats to democracy, with special emphasis on the most vulnerable populations that have been historically sidelined.\nGiven its importance for all the countries in the region, we also underscore the initiatives announced by the chair during the ninth summit, such as the LA Declaration on immigration and protection and the alliance or partnership for prosperity of the Americas and the partnership of the U.S. and the Caribbean to 2030 for the climate change response.\nNow, this all calls for political will and decision on the part of each government to work on building a focus that addresses deep social chasms that have only broadened during the pandemic.\u00a0 At the OAS, based on our four pillars \u2013 democracy, human rights, sustainable development, multidimensional security \u2013 it falls to us to foster cooperation between the countries of the hemisphere with special focus on reducing vulnerabilities, capacity building, reducing the latent inequity that marks our hemisphere.\nAnd the five different areas that we\u2019ve negotiated led to action plans that we agreed to for digital transformation, democratic governance.\u00a0 And the OAS has acknowledged (inaudible) wherewithal to do this and to offer support and coordination in the implementation phase.\u00a0 To achieve these goals will call for much determination by the countries and transform their public policies.\u00a0 To this effect, the full cooperation of the international community is very important, especially to bring to bear financial wherewithal for us to do so.\nWe celebrate the reconvening of the Joint Summits Working Group on the ninth summit and to tackle together these challenges that through coordination and collaboration ever strengthen \u2013 first, to contribute to sustainable, resilient, and equitable future.\u00a0 This is an opportunity for us to seek out a greater convergence of our agendas, enabling us to address the multiple needs in the region.\u00a0 As we will see during this general assembly and as we saw at the last summit, the region needs to redouble its efforts to move toward greater inclusion, equity, and more rights.\u00a0 The path ahead should lead to concrete actions by states.\u00a0 And my invitation is for us to continue working towards these goals.\nWe reiterate the summit secretariat\u2019s commitment to undertake the substantive matters that are necessary to this end and to follow through on the implementation of the ninth summit and to continue strengthening participation, coordination of the JSWG and civil society and social actors in the inter-American ministerial processes, as an integral part of this process.\u00a0 I wish for this meeting much success.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary General.\u00a0 I would now ask our colleagues from the media to depart.\u00a0 We\u2019ll give you a moment to do so.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":
