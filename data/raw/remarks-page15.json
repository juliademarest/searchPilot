We have fought side by side on numerous battlefields because our way of life, our deeply held beliefs, and our democratic values were threatened.\n(In English) And most recently we\u2019ve decided, again, to stand together to help our Ukrainian friends defend themselves against the aggression of their neighbor.\u00a0 Vladimir Putin has demonstrated time and again that he will stop at nothing to consolidate his power and continue his war of aggression.\u00a0 As the fight continues, we must maintain or resolve to keep Ukrainians safe, armed, and \u2013 as winter approaches \u2013 warm.\n(In French via interpreter) Secretary Blinken and I also discussed the situation in Haiti.\u00a0 This is a thing we are very concerned about.\u00a0 We recently discussed the crises that Haiti is facing at the Summit of the OAS, and we\u2019ve worked together to deliver vehicles purchased by the Haitian Government for their police force.\u00a0 We currently have a team of Canadian officials on the ground in Haiti that are assessing the humanitarian security crisis and finding ways to resolve it.\u00a0 In the immediate term, we must see a humanitarian truce to restore the supply of fuel, water, and food.\u00a0 This will allow the Haitian people to meet their basic needs and allow hospitals to respond to the ongoing cholera outbreak.\nIt was also critical that we sanction that gangs that are fueling the violence on the island, and we both welcome the steps taken by the UN Security Council to impose sanctions.\u00a0 We must keep the pressure on.\u00a0 Canada will continue to monitor the situation closely, and we will help where we can and try to support Haitian led solutions.\n(In English) We had an opportunity to discuss the ongoing situation in Iran.\u00a0 Canada salutes all Iranian who are fighting against tyranny, and we stand with the women and girls who are bravely defying the regime.\u00a0 The message is simple: women rights are human rights.\u00a0 We have a moral obligation to support the brave women of Iran and hold those persecuting them accountable.\nSecretary Blinken and I also discussed our efforts to strengthen international peace and security, including through deepened engagement in the Indo\u2011Pacific region.\u00a0 The United States and Canada are indeed Pacific nations, but we are both connected to our Pacific partners through more than just our shared coastline.\u00a0 We are joined through deep people\u2011to\u2011people ties and a vision for a free, open, and inclusive Indo\u2011Pacific.\u00a0 We both believe in deepening our diplomatic and economic ties as well as strengthening the resiliency of our global supply chain.\nToday, we agreed to hold the first Canada-U.S. Strategic Dialogue on the Indo-Pacific to further align our approaches.\u00a0 And to further economic cooperation in the region, I am pleased to announce that Canada will seek membership to the Indo\u2011Pacific Economic Framework which is commonly known as IPEF.\nSecretary Blinken and I discussed the topic of Arctic security.\u00a0 As regimes with expansionist ambitions with little regard for the rules that govern international behavior are turning their eyes towards the north, we have a responsibility to ramp up our Arctic engagement.\u00a0 Of course, we welcome the United States\u2019 recent Arctic strategy, and I am glad to announce that Canada will host the next round of the Canada-U.S. Arctic Dialogue.\u00a0 There we will advance long term planning to deepen our already strong collaboration in the region.\n(In French via interpreter) The Arctic is undoubtedly the next big geopolitical issue, and Canada intends to be a leader on this issue.\u00a0 This is something we are doing for our security and to fight climate change, as well as to defend the rules that govern our states.\n(In English.) This week marks my first year as foreign minister of Canada.\u00a0 I had to hit the ground running.\u00a0 I would say sprinting.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sprinting.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Sprinting really.\u00a0 In that time we have the chance \u2013 we had the chance to see each other in Washington obviously, but at NATO, at the G7, at the G20, at the OAS, at the UN \u2013 basically around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to have you here.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Merci beaucoup.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0M\u00e9lanie, thank you so much for the incredibly warm reception, the wonderful hospitality, and also \u2013 and maybe most importantly \u2013 the very productive and important conversation that we had with our teams just a short while ago.\u00a0 And that will continue over the next couple of days.\n(In French via interpreter) I\u2019m really delighted to be in Canada.\n(In English) This is actually, I mentioned, my second visit to Canada in this capacity. The first one was a virtual visit in February of our first year.\u00a0 But as I\u2019ve said, nothing can substitute for actually being here in person.\nAs the foreign minister said, we were together in Washington just a few weeks ago.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been together in places all around the world, and I think it speaks \u2013 our own collaboration speaks to the closeness of the Canadian-U.S. relationship and the ground that we had to cover today, and as I said, that\u2019ll continue.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much ground, it just speaks to both the breadth of that relationship as well as the depth of the collaboration that we had.\u00a0 On virtually every issue that matters to our people, the United States and Canada are working together.\nWe discussed, as M\u00e9lanie said, our continued unwavering support for Ukraine as it faces this ongoing aggression from President Putin\u2019s Russia.\u00a0 We applaud Canada\u2019s recent announcement of more than $34 million in new military aid to Ukraine, including artillery, satellite communication services, and winter gear for the soldiers.\u00a0 Canada and the United States will continue working with dozens of partner nations to get Ukraine\u2019s brave defenders what they need to keep fighting for their territory seized by Russia and to keep fighting for their people, strengthening our position on the battlefield and ultimately at any negotiating table that emerges.\nCanada has also committed more than $320 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and welcomed more than 104,000 Ukrainians to Canada through an emergency visa program that allows Ukrainians to come here for up to three years, during which time they can work and their children can go to school and study.\u00a0 Communities from Newfoundland and Labrador to Yukon are supporting this effort, including members of the Ukrainian diaspora that I met earlier today at Caf\u00e9 Ukraine, a community center where volunteers are doing everything from organizing social gatherings and concerts to making newly-arrived families feel a little bit less isolated, helping them find jobs, providing even art therapy for trauma survivors \u2013 all of that for free.\nM\u00e9lanie and I were joined there by Deputy Prime Minister Freeland, whose mother, of course, was born to Ukrainian refugees at a U.S. Army-run refugee camp in Germany.\u00a0 The story of her family \u2013 like my own \u2013 is testament to the long history of people in our nations serving the countries that once provided them refuge.\nThe generosity toward displaced Ukrainians is part of a long tradition of Canadians opening their arms to people in need time and again.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done that with approximately 23,000 Afghan refugees since the Taliban takeover in August of 2021.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done that with more than a million refugees worldwide going back to the 1980s.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite remarkable and something that speaks volumes for Canada around the world.\nMany of the refugees are sponsored by families, by universities, by faith groups and other citizens through a private sponsorship program that Canada launched more than four decades ago that\u2019s helped more than 327,000 refugees build new lives in this country and become a model for the world.\u00a0 We are going to soon pilot a program in the United States very much like it, and it\u2019s been inspired by what Canada has done, where American communities are eager to play a similar role.\nIn addition to our assistance to Ukraine, Canada and the U.S. are also supporting our allies and partners across the Atlantic as they head into winter with heavy energy costs.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together through the G7, we\u2019re also doing it bilaterally, to help mitigate Russian-driven supply disruptions.\u00a0 And we\u2019re accelerating the transition toward renewable energy and away from the dependence on Russia and other unreliable governments.\nThe same goes for other vital inputs in our supply chains.\u00a0 From critical minerals to microchips, we need to be able to source and to make essential products closer to home.\u00a0 That will not only make us more reliable in delivering for our people, but also more competitive in the 21st century economy.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s tax credit for electric vehicles that are made in North America, which President Biden signed into law in August, and creates incentives for Americans to buy vehicles made in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\u00a0 Tomorrow, I am visiting a lithium battery recycling facility operated by the Canadian company Lithion, which is partnering with General Motors to increase our supply of batteries that power these vehicles, and also bring down their costs.\nThis is not a one-off.\u00a0 U.S.-Canada cooperation is deepening at every step of the battery value chain, from mining to production to recycling, benefitting communities on both sides of our border.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we saw in the recent announcement by Ontario-based company Li-Cycle that will invest $485 million in expanding a battery recycling facility in Rochester, New York, \u00a0creating over 200 good-paying jobs.\nThis cooperation is good for both our nations\u2019 competitiveness.\u00a0 It\u2019s good for Canadian and American workers.\u00a0 And it\u2019s good for our planet.\u00a0 And it\u2019s something we\u2019re aiming to replicate across other supply chains.\nThat\u2019s far from the only way that we\u2019re partnering to boost our competitiveness.\u00a0 Let me just mention quickly a couple of things, and we talked about these as well.\nWe will continue to work with Canada to advance the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, to drive our hemisphere\u2019s inclusive economic growth.\nAnd the foreign minister reiterated Canada\u2019s interest in joining the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 As you just heard, we support Canada \u2013 a fellow Pacific nation \u2013 joining this framework.\u00a0 In the coming months, we will consult closely with other IPEF members on the development of a process for considering new members, because it\u2019s not a decision the United States can make unilaterally, but we would welcome Canada\u2019s participation.\nM\u00e9lanie and I also discussed other parts of the world beyond Ukraine, where we\u2019re working together to tackle fundamental challenges to international law and to the United Nations Charter.\nWe\u2019re working together to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its vicious crackdown on brave young women who continue to come out into the streets to demand their rights, more than 40 days now after the killing of Mahsa Amini.\u00a0 We fully support the statement that Minister Joly and 11 other women foreign ministers from around the world issued condemning the regime\u2019s repression.\nThe Iranian regime has also provided the Kremlin with drones and assisted Russia in their use \u2013drones that are being used to kill Ukrainian civilians and destroy the infrastructure they rely on for electricity, for water, for heat.\u00a0 It\u2019s appalling, and Canada and the United States will keep working with our allies and partners to expose, to deter, and to counter Iran\u2019s provision of these weapons.\nWe support Canada\u2019s efforts to rally countries around the world in ending the unlawful practice of detaining innocent individuals and using them as political pawns.\u00a0 Both of our countries have suffered from this.\u00a0 We\u2019re working and we will be acting together to deal with it.\nAnd we talked about shared challenges in our region, including in Haiti, as you heard from M\u00e9lanie.\u00a0 We agree that between deepening food and fuel shortages, the growing cholera outbreak, and gangs blockading ports and terrorizing civilians, the situation is simply unsustainable.\nWe appreciate Canada\u2019s leadership in creating the UN Basket Fund to strengthen citizen security and law enforcement, and in airlifting vital security-related equipment to the Haitian Government last week \u2013 efforts in which the United States has been a proud partner.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to work together to rally international support around helping the Haitian people find a way forward \u2013 from the sanctions adopted unanimously last week by the Security Council against the leaders of gangs and the patrons that direct and profit from them, to other measures aimed at improving security for Haitians.\nAs fellow Arctic nations, as M\u00e9lanie mentioned, and shared stewards of the North American Arctic, we see how climate change is rapidly transforming the region.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re working together to create an Arctic that is more sustainable, peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative, as is reflected in the updated U.S. National Strategy for the Arctic Region that we recently released.\nSo we face a set of complex challenges.\u00a0 But we have the immense good fortune of having a neighbor in Canada that not only shares our interests, but our respect for human rights, our commitment to democracy, our belief that all our people should have equal opportunities to reach their full potential.\u00a0 It\u2019s why we make such a good team.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to taking our relationship and our cooperation to even higher levels.\nI simply couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner in Canada and I certainly could not ask for a better partner in its foreign minister, my friend and my colleague, M\u00e9lanie Joly.\u00a0 So thank you for having us here today.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Merci,\u00a0Tony.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\u00a0\u00a0(In French.)\u00a0 We\u2019ll now be beginning the question-and-answer session.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be taking two questions from Canadian media and two questions from American media.\u00a0 (In French.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 (In French) \u2013 I will ask in French \u2013 (in French).\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Madam Joly, the agreement on \u2013 the Safe Third Country Agreement \u2013 what do you have to say about that?\u00a0 And for Secretary Blinken, are you satisfied with the actual \u2013 with the current agreement?\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you, Christian.\u00a0 Obviously, border security is very important for us and we need to ensure that asylum seekers are treated with compassion.\u00a0 This is an issue that I discussed with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 We have a bilateral agreement on this issue.\u00a0 It is the Safe Third Country Agreement, and those negotiations are ongoing.\u00a0 Of course, our goal is to be able to cooperate with the U.S. on this issue.\n(In English) So indeed, the security at the border is extremely important and we need to make sure that asylum seekers are also dealt with compassion.\u00a0 It is a bilateral agreement that unites the U.S. and Canada on this very question.\u00a0 This issue was raised by me to Secretary Blinken and negotiations are underway, and we\u2019ll make sure that these negotiations are fruitful.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Little to add.\u00a0 As the foreign minister said, yes, this is something we discussed and we\u2019ll continue to discuss.\nLet me just say more broadly, to put this also in some perspective, we are facing a historic migration challenge around the world.\u00a0 We have more people on the move, displaced from their homes, than at any time in recorded history \u2013 more than a hundred million people now.\u00a0 And of course, in our own hemisphere, the hemisphere that we share, that\u2019s also very much the case.\u00a0 And whether it is Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Haitians, Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, we see people on the move throughout the hemisphere.\u00a0 And this is a challenge that has to be addressed and met by the countries of origin, the countries of transit, and the countries of destination.\u00a0 And we have to do it more effectively together.\nPut simply, there needs to be a greater sense of shared responsibility for dealing with migration challenges.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what came out of the Summit of the Americas with the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration.\u00a0 And Canada and the United States are helping to lead those efforts.\nSo across the board, this is something that we\u2019re working on very closely together, in all of its manifestations.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll work through any particular challenges that we have to.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Before I ask my second question, could you answer in French, perhaps?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 English, but \u2013 that\u2019s all right.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I think you have a great accent in French.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Christian, he doesn\u2019t have an accent in French.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, concerning NEXUS and the NEXUS pass, what do the U.S. and Canada need to do to get through that impasse?\u00a0 And Ms. Joly, what do you think of the possibility that some NEXUS officials might be armed at the border?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So NEXUS \u2013 this is something else that was discussed in our meeting and we\u2019re both determined to work through it.\u00a0 We both feel strongly that the most powerful bond we have is in the ability of Canadians and Americans alike to move back and forth to our respective countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s what connects us every single day.\nSo we\u2019re committed and determined to work through this.\u00a0 We want to see the backlog it\u2019s created be addressed.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working very hard ourselves, putting in additional personnel and resources in the United States to work through the backlog, and we want to and need to resolve this particular issue so that we can go at 100 percent, 110 percent, both to deal with the backlog and to make sure that we\u2019re doing everything possible to facilitate movement between our two countries.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So indeed, we need to make sure that Canadians that want to have access to a NEXUS card or used to have access to a NEXUS card and want it \u2013 want a new one are able to.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why we are looking actively at how to address the backlog and to address services being rendered, and meanwhile working on our own bilateral relationship when it comes to security at the border.\nSo we\u2019re in solution mode, and we\u2019ll find a solution.\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced.\n(Via interpreter) As the Secretary of State mentioned, we want to make sure that any Canadian who has a NEXUS card or who wants to renew one will be able to do so.\u00a0 We are working together to find solutions to deal with the backlog.\u00a0 What is the French word for that? \u00a0Arri\u00e9r\u00e9,\u00a0yes, the backlog.\u00a0 Thank you to the journalist for answering my question.\nIn any case, we\u2019re dealing with working on that backlog, reducing the backlog, and being able to provide services while pursuing our discussions on the issue of border security.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 We\u2019ll go to the next question, from American media this time around.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Leon Bruneau \u2013\u00a0bonjour \u2013 de\u00a0l\u2019Agence French-Presse.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Bonjour.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0American (inaudible).\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nA question for both of you.\u00a0 You said you talked about Haiti in your discussions.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of talk about potential setting up a security force, or some sort of security force, a police force with some military elements for Haiti.\u00a0 And at the same time \u2013 and I understand it\u2019s a very difficult situation, but at the same time, given past experiences, we don\u2019t see any country really standing up and willing to lead this force, if that is even a good idea, given that in Haiti it may not be so well accepted.\nSo my question for the Secretary is:\u00a0 First of all, do you think that this force, the idea of a force, security force, is a good idea?\u00a0 And who would lead that force, since the United States has said that they would not do so?\u00a0 You said you would support it but you would not lead it.\n(Via interpreter) And to you, Madam Minister, would Canada be ready to lead this force?\u00a0 And if yes, under which conditions?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 First, taking a step back on this as well, we have to look at the big \u2013 the big picture in Haiti and the challenges that the Haitian people face and that we need to help them address.\u00a0 And we know that between human-made and natural-made challenges, Haiti has more than its hands full.\u00a0 We now have a cholera outbreak, on top of everything else, that is very serious.\nBut in order to actually get to a place where we can genuinely help Haitians with the assistance that they need and also make sure that they can be on the path to elections to get to a new government over time, the knot that really has to be broken in the first instance is concerning security, because Haiti now faces a situation where gangs dominate important space in Port-au-Prince, the capital, as well as in other parts of Haiti, preventing assistance from getting through \u2013 everything from food and fuel and water \u2013 by blocking critical ports, critical fuel facilities, and also creating an environment in which people cannot move freely about, which would certainly make an election down the road impossible.\nSo our countries have been working very closely together to do a few things to try to cut this insecurity knot and deal with the gang problem.\u00a0 One is to support the Haitian National Police, including with equipment, with advice, and just recently, as you know, Canada provided armored vehicles to the Haitian National Police with our collaboration.\u00a0 At the same time, we are trying to break the nexus between these gangs and some of the political actors who are financing them and directing them, and that goes to the sanctions that were recently put forward at the United Nations as well as sanctions we\u2019re doing on our own basis to try to get at those who are supporting and directing the gangs.\nHaving said all that, I think it\u2019s a shared view that more likely needs to be done for the national police in support of them to allow them to get a real grip on security and to take back these parts of the capital that the gangs have been dominating.\u00a0 So there is now a second draft resolution in the works at the United Nations after the initial resolution on sanctions that would authorize a non-UN international assistance mission to improve the security situation and enable the flow of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Haiti.\u00a0 And so what we\u2019ve been talking about is what might that look like, what would it need, and we\u2019ve both been talking to a variety of countries to gauge their interest and willingness to participate in that.\nSo that\u2019s the conversation we\u2019re having, but I think we \u2013 and I appreciate very much the fact that Canada has just sent or announced that it\u2019s sending an assessment team to Haiti to look at what would actually be required in terms of supporting the police.\u00a0 But the purpose of any such mission would be to support the Haitian National Police in doing their jobs to make sure that the state once again actually controls the country, not gangs that right now are one of the biggest problems that we face in actually being able to move forward and help Haiti.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So to follow up on that, first and foremost, I think it\u2019s important to remind ourselves that Haiti is facing a triple crisis, the first one being a security crisis.\u00a0 The Varreux Terminal needs to be unblocked.\u00a0 It is fundamental that Haiti be able to supply itself with gas and as well as with clean water, because as Secretary Blinken mentioned, there is an outbreak of cholera right now.\u00a0 So the second also crisis that Haiti is facing is a humanitarian one, and we definitely need to support Haiti to make sure that \u2013 and bring the international community to support Haiti facing this important crisis.\nAnd finally I would say it is also of equal importance to address the political crisis, because there needs to be fair elections happening, and we need to make sure that the environment for these elections to happen is the right one.\u00a0 But to do that we need to address the security and humanitarian issue.\u00a0 So that is why Canada sent an assessment mission.\u00a0 I confirmed it this morning.\u00a0 The goal is to be able to have information coming from the team that is right now in Haiti on these three crises.\nWe\u2019ve said it many times:\u00a0 We will always support solutions that are by and for Haitians, because we believe in the fact that solutions are better when, of course, they\u2019re taken by them and that we support them.\u00a0 That is also why we\u2019re having conversations with the United States on this issue.\u00a0 That\u2019s also why I had a long conversation with the head of the African Union, who is in town, Moussa Faki, this morning about the issue, and also that I had conversations with my CARICOM colleagues, because we need to make sure that it is, yes, Canada and U.S. collaborating with the Haitians, but also with many other countries.\u00a0 At the end of the day we need to make sure that there is strong legitimacy for this approach, and Canada will always be there to support Haiti.\nI think one of the things that we haven\u2019t done, when it comes to Haiti in the past, over the decades of Canada being involved in Haiti, is really sanctioning the people that are at the core of the financing of these gangs, and we need to make sure that we have a strong approach when it comes to sanctioning.\u00a0 And we are working with the U.S., along our United Nations partners, because obviously this conversation is happening at the UN Security Council.\u00a0 There was an important resolution also that was \u2013 that was taken by the UN Security Council on sanctions, and particularly targeting the head of the gangs, which is a so-called \u201cBarbecue.\u201d\u00a0 And we want to make sure that Canada follows suit on this, but the conversation regarding sanction is well and alive, and we need to make sure that the people that are benefiting from the violence in the streets of Port-au-Prince are held accountable.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Our next question will be from Canadian media, and just a reminder that we request that your question be asked in a single interaction.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Mercedes Stephenson, Global News.\u00a0 Thank you for taking our questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and Minister Joly, you were just discussing Haiti.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering, Secretary Blinken, when you came here, if you were hoping for a commitment from Canada to lead this mission and if that is something you would still like to see.\u00a0 And Minister Joly, what the range of options are \u2013 because it will be partially determined by what we\u2019re capable of, which comes to my follow up.\nSecretary Blinken, how does the United States feel about Canada\u2019s current levels of defense and foreign affairs spending?\u00a0 We have a chief of defense staff who has said we can\u2019t do more than the essential.\u00a0 The Canadian Government announced $5 billion they said was new spending for NORAD.\u00a0 It turned out that was recycled.\u00a0 And we\u2019re under enormous pressure to be able to perform even the basic capabilities.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if that concerns the United States, and Minister Joly, if that\u2019s a frustration for you in trying to fulfill your job with Canada\u2019s (inaudible).\u00a0\u00a0Et en fran\u00e7ais,\u00a0as well, please.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Happy to start.\u00a0 So on Haiti, if you look at the draft resolution, that\u2019s before the Security Council right now, the second resolution, it is looking for and asking for countries to provide contributions and personnel of equipment, of other resources for a potential mission, one that would be very limited in scope, limited in time, and in support, as the foreign minister said, of the Haitian National Police, because the purpose is to reinforce their capacity to finally get a grip on the security situation and to deal with the problem of gangs dominating certain critical parts of Port-au-Prince in particular.\nSo we\u2019re talking between us, but also, as M\u00e9lanie said, with many other countries about who might be willing to participate in such a mission, as well as who will lead it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s an ongoing conversation that we\u2019re both having and having with others.\u00a0 So this is a work in progress and we\u2019re continuing to pursue it.\nWith regard to defense spending, I\u2019d say a couple of things.\u00a0 First, Canada\u2019s making extraordinary contributions every single day, particularly as we see with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and the work as well as the very important material support that Canada is providing to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves.\u00a0 And we just saw another significant provision of support, as well as very significant humanitarian assistance both in Ukraine itself, as well as, of course, all of the support that Canada is giving to so many Ukrainians who have come to Canada.\nMore broadly than that, though, we as allies have been working together in NATO for years to continue to strengthen our contributions to our common defense.\u00a0 We had the recent NATO Summit in which we\u2019re working closely on a new Strategic Concept, which will require resources.\u00a0 We have a common commitment that we\u2019ve made many years ago at the Wales Summit to spending a certain percentage of our GDP on defense for countries.\u00a0 This is a work in progress.\u00a0 We\u2019re all making efforts to meet both the commitment it was made in 2014, but also to take into account so much that has changed since 2014.\u00a0 And that requires us, I believe all, to do more to provide for our common security.\nWe took steps at NATO in the face of the Russian aggression to strengthen NATO itself, including on the eastern flank.\u00a0 Canada\u2019s played an important part of that.\u00a0 But I think as we\u2019re talking about this now, we\u2019re looking at new challenges that weren\u2019t even there in 2014 when we all made these commitments to NATO and to our defense spending.\u00a0 So I think we all have to find ways to resource them properly, and that\u2019s part of our conversation.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 So on Haiti, Mercedes, so we have provided $40 million since the beginning of this year for the Haitian police.\u00a0 And we historically have very much been involved in creating their training and really making sure to empower them on the ground.\u00a0 What we\u2019re seeing right now is there is more help needed and the Haitian police need to be able to handle the gangs, which is not the case at this point.\u00a0 And so that\u2019s why the assessment team is in Haiti right now to see what\u2019s the level of organization of the Haitian police and what\u2019s the security situation.\u00a0 What does the Haitian Government has in terms of tools to deal with the gangs that are funded?\nAnd so that is why we\u2019re looking at different options, but we want to make sure that we have the right assessment.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve said it many times \u2013 it needs to be by and for Haitians.\u00a0 So we will be working with Haitians themselves, and we need to work also with many countries around the world to deal with this issue.\nAnd so I think that Canada has always been a very, very good friend to Haiti.\u00a0 We have a strong relationship.\u00a0 Our police forces have strong relationship with Haiti also because they\u2019ve been there in the 19th, at the beginning of the 2000s, and we want to maintain them.\u00a0\u00a0 And more than ever, Haiti needs us.\u00a0 And so of course we will play a role.\nIn terms of military investments and being able to do my job, I think \u2013 looking back at the last year, I think it\u2019s been a very busy year.\u00a0 And I think that we can be proud of Canada\u2019s leadership in the world on many issues, from indeed Haiti but also looking at what we\u2019re doing to support women in Iran right now or, obviously, everything we\u2019ve done on the question of Ukraine.\u00a0 On the question of Ukraine, we\u2019ve spent and invested more than $3.5 billion at this point at all levels.\u00a0 We\u2019re one of the countries that is investing the most per capita.\nWe also are leading, like Tony said, on the eastern flank of Europe, the NATO Latvian forces.\u00a0 And I\u2019m coming up with an Indo-Pacific strategy, and the goal is definitely for Canada to play a bigger role in the region.\u00a0 But as you know, Minister Anand, our defense minister, has a defense policy review to undergo, and so I\u2019m convinced that she\u2019ll show great leadership on this issue.\nSo you want me to say that\u00a0en fran\u00e7ais?\u00a0 Okay.\n(Via interpreter) So, of course, when it comes to Haiti, we have long been involved in creating training for the Haitian police, including through their academy.\u00a0 And this is curricula that was developed through the \u201990s and the 2000s in Canada.\u00a0 Canada has long been a very close friend of Haiti, and our objective has always been to improve and deepen that friendship.\u00a0 No decision will be taken without the involvement of the Haitians themselves.\u00a0 I have always said any solutions must be by and for Haitians because, of course, this is all for them.\u00a0 It is the Haitian people who are suffering now, and they\u2019re the ones who need to be helped.\nWe\u2019ve worked with the Americans and other countries in the region to ensure that we deal with the humanitarian, economic, and political crises there.\u00a0 And something else that\u2019s quite important now is that there currently is an assessment mission there on the ground, and the goal of the mission is to understand what is the state of the police force in Haiti and what is the current security situation.\nWhen it comes to defense, well, we\u2019ve invested over $3.5 billion in the Ukraine crisis since the beginning of the year.\u00a0 We\u2019re also leading NATO forces in Lithuania, and we\u2019re starting to play a greater role in the Indo-Pacific as well.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and myself have had good discussions concerning defense investments, and Minister Anand is currently reviewing the national defense policy, so I\u2019m convinced that that will end in a solution.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(In French.)\u00a0 We\u2019ll now be taking our last question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, Jennifer Hansler from CNN.\u00a0 Thank you so much for taking our questions.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, President Putin today praised the Saudi crown prince and said Russia would look to deepen its relations with Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Will this factor into the U.S.\u2019s response to the OPEC decision?\u00a0 And when can we expect to see the first repercussions for that decision?\nAnd then to both of the ministers, Russia has suggested it could let the Black Sea grain deal expire.\u00a0 Are there any concessions that the U.S. and Canada would consider in order to facilitate the extension of that deal?\nAnd how specifically do you deter Iran from providing drones to Russia, and given the pace of these drone attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, are you confident that the U.S. and Canadian support can be robust and quick enough for Ukraine to keep its heat on and its critical services this winter?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Now would you ask it in French as well?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah, sadly only speak Spanish.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0(Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, one of the reasons that we were very disappointed in the OPEC+ and Saudi decision to decrease production was precisely because of the potential impact it would have on oil prices, not only affecting consumers in our respective countries but potentially lining President Putin pockets at the time when he continues to pursue the aggression against Ukraine \u2013 indeed, in many ways, doubling and tripling down on it with the mobilization, the annexation, the loose talk about nuclear weapons, and now the horrific assault on Ukraine\u2019s basic infrastructure: trying to turn the lights out, turn the power off, turn the heat off for the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 So anything that assists that is profoundly wrong and profoundly objectionable.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s worth noting that Saudi Arabia supported the resolution that came before the United Nations General Assembly, where 143 countries condemned the purported annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia.\u00a0 And just recently, Saudi Arabia came forward with, I believe, more than $400 million in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.\u00a0 Both very positive decisions that that we\u2019ve taken note of.\nAs we\u2019ve said, the relationship with Saudi Arabia has been built up over many years, many decades through many administrations, on a bipartisan basis.\u00a0 We will look at this, as we are, methodically and with deliberation for the purpose of making sure that it is working to advance our interests.\u00a0 That\u2019s the objective.\u00a0 And we have a multiplicity of interests when it comes to the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 And as we\u2019re looking at this, we\u2019re \u2013 we want to make sure that, as I said, those interests are being advanced and supported.\nWhen it comes to the grain agreement, first, remember none of this should have been necessary in the first place, because the only reason we had to get this grain agreement is because Russia invaded Ukraine and then blockaded its ports, denying the entire world the benefits of the Ukrainian breadbasket.\u00a0 Thanks to terrific work by the United Nations, by the secretary-general, with the support of Turkey, an agreement was reached where Russia stopped the end of the blockade of Odesa and a process was put in place to allow Ukrainian grain and food products to flow out to the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s been a tremendous benefit.\u00a0 More than nine million metric tons of grain have gotten out through the Odesa ports.\u00a0 Two-thirds of that has gone to the Global South, to countries in Africa and Asia and elsewhere, who desperately needed it.\u00a0 It\u2019s had a very positive impact in lowering prices that\u2019s benefited everyone around the world.\nSo the idea that Russia would now say, ah, it doesn\u2019t want to continue, it wants to turn it off, I think will be met with great anger by countries around the world who are benefiting from Ukrainian grain.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s profoundly in everyone\u2019s interests to make sure that this grain can continue to move out of Ukraine, and certainly we will do everything we can to sustain the agreement.\u00a0 But I think a decision by Russia to discontinue this agreement would the met with deep concern from countries around the world, especially in the Global South.\nWith regard to Iran and the drones that it\u2019s providing to Russia, that Russia is using to kill innocent Ukrainians and to try to destroy the infrastructure of Ukraine, we\u2019ve been warning about this going back many months.\u00a0 Starting in July, we raised concerns that Iran was thinking about providing these drones to Russia.\u00a0 Since well before the Russian aggression, we\u2019ve been going after the Iranian drone networks, the UAV networks.\u00a0 We sanctioned them well over a year ago.\u00a0 We just sanctioned them again a few weeks ago.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to break up these networks.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions, to disrupt this trade, as well as, of course, to help the Iranian \u2013 the Ukrainians, excuse me, harden their own defenses.\nBut I think, again, the fact that Iran is doing this is something that virtually the entire world will find profoundly objectionable.\u00a0 It\u2019s also evidence of the fact that the sanctions that we\u2019ve imposed on Russia, all of us, and the export controls, are having a powerful impact because Russia is unable to produce parts for its own equipment, to manufacture its own equipment, and it\u2019s having to turn to whatever corner of the world it can find to try to get things to continue its aggression.\u00a0 So we are looking very hard at what can be done to stop this, but the first thing is it\u2019s very visible to the entire world.\u00a0 And I think the world is not going to countenance this relationship and the supply of these weapons to Russia.\nFinally, we just proceeded with, I think, our 24th drawdown of defense equipment for Ukraine.\u00a0 As I said, the Canadians have recently contributed additional systems to the Ukrainians.\u00a0 We have a process in place that Secretary of Defense Austin is leading.\u00a0 It was started in Ramstein, Germany, where we\u2019re coordinating the efforts of dozens of countries to make sure that Ukraine continues to get what it needs to defend itself.\u00a0 And this has been an evolving picture over time.\u00a0 As the nature of the aggression has changed, moved to different places, using different means, we\u2019ve adjusted, and we\u2019ll continue to do that, as I said, to make sure that the Ukrainians have what they need.\nThere\u2019s a profound commitment that we have \u2013 but not just the United States and Canada, dozens of countries have \u2013 to make sure that Ukraine continues to get what it needs to defend itself and to take back the territory that was seized from it by Russia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 On the UN grain deal, I must say that I just had a conversation this morning with the head of the African Union, which was very concerned as well that this deal will not be continuing to be supported by Russia.\u00a0 So I think we can really work with many countries around the world \u2013 definitely the U.S. and us, but also working with African countries and Middle Eastern countries that are depending from this important grain deal.\u00a0 And we will continue to voice that support to that deal at the UN through our ambassador.\nI think also that it is equally important for us as a very important grain producer to continue to provide the world with our own grains and food.\u00a0 We\u2019ve increased also massively our support to the World Food Programme; we\u2019re now the fourth biggest donor in the world.\u00a0 And my job is to make sure that, working with the minister of international development, we shed light on the question of food security.\u00a0 We will be going to the G7 next week \u2013 Tony and I \u2013 and definitely as this G7 will be particularly focused on the needs of Africa, we will be looking at how we can continue to support the UN grain deal, but at the same time that we can address the issue of the food crisis.\nAnd finally on the question of Iran, we look forward to working with the U.S. on shedding light on Iran\u2019s involvement in Ukraine and making sure that they\u2019re held accountable.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already, as mentioned, hosted a female foreign minister meeting \u2013 nearly 17 of them were present \u2013 and we also launched a very important declaration to support women in Iran that are fighting for women rights.\u00a0 But I think that the issue of Iran being involved in Ukraine and supporting Russia brings the Iranian regime\u2019s \u2013 how can I say \u2013 inhumanity to another level.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why we will make sure that we hold them accountable.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(In French.)\u00a0 This ends press conference for today.\u00a0 Thank you all for being here.\n\n"}, {"url":

but two, we\u2019ve been able to support them in that effort.\u00a0 And from day one \u2013 as M\u00e9lanie said, even before day one, the United States and Canada working together helped prepare for the rising storm that we saw and then try to make sure that Ukrainians get what they need to fend off the aggression and retake their land.\u00a0 But also making sure that those Ukrainians who left had a place to go and were welcomed with open arms.\nAnd what we see here in this caf\u00e9 is really wonderful because it gives a sense of community to people who have just had to leave everything behind.\u00a0 It creates networks for them to make sure that they can adjust and adapt to their new home, at least for now.\u00a0 I think most people want to go back to the home that they left, and hopefully that\u2019ll happen as soon as possible.\u00a0 But meanwhile the fact that they\u2019re so warmly and generously welcomed in Canada makes all the difference in the world.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0And we want to thank Yaroslav, and \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 (inaudible), and Anton, and all of them \u2014\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Marusia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 \u2014 yes, as well \u2013 for your work here, and we\u2019re proud of the work you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 And this is just Canada, so welcome here.\nMS GARBUTT:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s what we do.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0We welcome people very well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nMS GARBUTT:\u00a0\u00a0We do.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, tout le monde.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, tout le monde\u00a0(inaudible).\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-at-a-diwali-reception/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

they\u2019ve shared sweets; they\u2019ve given thanks through\u00a0pooja; they\u2019ve lit sparklers.\u00a0 All around the world, from the streets of New Delhi, to the parks of Kuala Lumpur, to right down the street at the White House, people have gathered to share in the simple joy of being around friends and family.\u00a0 And through it all, they have each reaffirmed their commitment to bringing light to their communities.\nThat final obligation of spreading light is maybe more important than it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 So even as we celebrate tonight, we remember those around the world who are not able to freely celebrate their cultural and religious holidays.\nEven in the face of challenges \u2013 especially in the face of challenges \u2013 the State Department will continue to support freedom of belief and celebrate religious diversity around the world.\nAs you heard Rashad mention a few moments ago, religious freedom is a fundamental American value, and supporting it is a priority for President Biden.\u00a0 It\u2019s also an invaluable part of the United States diplomacy, because it actually helps us build bonds with other nations and with peoples around the world.\nOne way that we show our support for religious diversity is through helping to preserve vital pieces of cultural heritage around the world.\u00a0 Through efforts like the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, we\u2019re helping to restore damaged historic buildings; we\u2019re helping to recover lost or stolen cultural objects, like paintings and sculptures.\u00a0 Just this past February, our colleagues at the Mission in Australia, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Indian law enforcement agents, recovered a 500-year-old stolen statue of Hanuman, a Hindu deity, and returned it to the Indian Government.\nAnother way that we demonstrate our support for religious freedom is through celebrations like this one, which is one of many happening across the State Department.\u00a0 For example, in our embassy in Abu Dhabi, guests last week decorated a\u00a0rungolee\u00a0in the main entrance, while at Embassy New Delhi, local staff, community members showcased traditional dances.\nEach of these efforts \u2013 each bond that we build between ourselves and other countries \u2013 makes it easier to collaborate on so many of the pressing issues of our time.\u00a0 And here, too, not surprisingly, our engagement with faith communities is a vital part of our work in our embassies and consulates all around the world.\nFor example, diplomats in our mission to India regularly visit temples,\u00a0stupas,\u00a0gurdwaras\u00a0\u2013 both to promote our shared value of pluralism and religious tolerance, and to partner together on common challenges.\u00a0 And over the past two years, Mission Delhi \u2013 across community members in the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, and Buddhist faiths, among others \u2013 have hosted vaccination drives in places of worship around the country as part of the overall effort to help more than 25 million Indians get their COVID-19 vaccines.\nMany of you are already partners in this work.\u00a0 As members of the diplomatic, religious, and civil society communities, you\u2019re playing an invaluable role in helping to connect us with local populations abroad, and by pushing us to do more to support religious freedom around the world.\nPlease keep it up.\u00a0 We need your energy.\u00a0 We need your initiative.\u00a0 We need your knowledge.\u00a0 We need your expertise.\u00a0 We need all of that if we\u2019re going to continue building mutual respect and understanding, if we\u2019re going to continue expanding religious freedom, and ultimately, if we are going to ensure that light triumphs over darkness.\nWe\u2019ll celebrate that triumph in just a few moments with the lighting of the\u00a0diya.\u00a0 For now, thank you, thank you to everybody for being here tonight, for joining in this celebration, for the community that you have formed together, and for the work that you\u2019re doing not just in this day and on this happy occasion, but every single day to advance the values and the light that we want to spread.\u00a0 Happy Diwali, everyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDoctor, over to you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-israeli-president-isaac-herzog-before-their-meeting-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

And we\u2019re building bridges\u00a0\u2013 in STEM, between our people, between all of our countries.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing that through all of you.\nAs this program now enters its second decade, we\u2019re also expanding its reach.\u00a0 We\u2019ll spread to new parts of our own country, the United States, as well as new regions of the world, starting with the Balkans.\u00a0 We\u2019ll create additional opportunities for collaboration between alums and mentors.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue supporting younger generations of women in STEM.\nSo what I\u2019d like to leave you with is this encouragement, that you continue engaging with the program not just now, not just in the months ahead, but in the years ahead, because we couldn\u2019t be prouder to be your partners and because this has to be a living, growing, expanding, evolving thing.\u00a0 And you\u2019re the ones who can make it be exactly that.\nAs important as five weeks may be, what\u2019s even more important is what follows from it.\u00a0 And again, these connections that you\u2019ve made, these networks that you\u2019re building, that to me is the power of TechWomen.\u00a0 That\u2019s what makes it something that will carry us, carry you, carry our societies far into the future.\nWe know\u00a0\u2013 because we\u2019ve seen it already in the time that the program has existed\u00a0\u2013 we know that you\u2019re going to keep doing remarkable work, not only in your fields but also to support other women.\u00a0 More than 90 percent of the TechWomen alumna who\u2019ve been surveyed have said that they\u2019ve actually gone on to mentor women in their countries.\u00a0 So I hope you\u2019ll continue to build on that tradition, too.\u00a0 Carrying it forward, paying it forward, that\u2019s also the power of TechWomen.\nMy last thought is this.\u00a0 You\u2019ve already heard about some remarkable projects that have come out of this session.\u00a0 But I really can\u2019t wait\u00a0\u2013 we can\u2019t wait\u00a0\u2013 to see all that you\u2019re going to do in the years ahead, that you\u2019re going to do together, that you\u2019re going to do for the betterment of your countries, of your societies, of the world and the planet that we share.\u00a0 This is\u00a0\u2013 you are\u00a0\u2013 the hope that we have for our common future.\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t be prouder to be working with you.\u00a0 Thank you so very much.

Blinken and French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna at a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Benjamin Franklin Room", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "October 21, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0Bonjour, tout le monde.\n(Via interpreter) Catherine, I\u2019m delighted to host you here at the State Department and in Washington.\nIt\u2019s a true pleasure to have my friend and colleague, Catherine Colonna, the French Foreign Minister here in Washington and at the State Department.\u00a0 This is actually the first time that we\u2019ve had the honor of hosting our French colleagues and Catherine here in Washington, despite the fact that we have been closely collaborating over these past five months everywhere from Brussels to Bali, most recently at the United Nations Security Council in the course of a ministerial that the foreign minister presided over on Ukraine.\nOn virtually every issue that matters to our nations and matters to much of the world, I couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner, the United States couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner.\u00a0 And that was reflected in, as usual, the very productive conversation and meeting that we had today.\u00a0 We discussed our united and unwavering response to President Putin\u2019s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 In recent days, we\u2019ve witnessed Moscow\u2019s widespread strikes on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine \u2013 many carried out using drones supplied by Iran.\u00a0 These strikes have a clear goal: to make the Ukrainian people suffer.\u00a0 And the damage they\u2019re inflicting will make it harder for Ukrainians to heat their homes, find safe water to drink, access the electricity that they need to run everything from stores to hospitals to public transportation.\nPresident Putin thinks that these attacks will somehow break the will of Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Instead, he is only deepening their resolve to defend their country.\u00a0 Moscow can knock out the lights across Ukraine, but it cannot, it will not, extinguish the Ukrainian spirit.\nPresident Putin thought he could divide the transatlantic alliance.\u00a0 Instead, he\u2019s brought us even closer together.\u00a0 The United States is working closely with France and other European allies to help make the decisive shift away from dependence on Russian energy.\u00a0 That means developing more diverse, more reliable, more sustainable sources over the long term and helping our friends get through a winter with heavy energy costs.\u00a0 As I assured the foreign minister today, we are not leaving any of our friends out in the cold.\nPresident Putin thought that he could wear down global support for Ukraine.\u00a0 Instead, countries in every region recognize that when the Kremlin tries to redraw the borders of its neighbor by force, it threatens the rules that underpin security and stability for all nations in every corner of the Earth.\u00a0 That is why 143 countries recently voted at the United Nations to condemn Russia\u2019s sham referenda and reject any attempt to annex Ukrainian territory.\nPresident Putin\u2019s declaration of martial law in parts of Ukraine that Russia purports to annex is just his latest attempt to dress up crimes in the language of law.\u00a0 His move also reveals the lie at the heart of Russia\u2019s purported annexation: if 99 percent of people in these parts of Ukraine want to be part of Russia, why does President Putin have to impose martial law to control them?\nThe foreign minister and I spoke about how we can continue to provide robust support for Ukraine\u2019s efforts to defend itself and to deliver vital humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people while also continuing to raise the costs on President Putin and his enablers for their actions.\u00a0 And we reaffirmed our commitment to meaningful diplomacy that can bring an end to the war, even as Moscow continues to demonstrate through its escalatory actions that its claim to be open to diplomacy is as hollow as it\u2019s been since President Putin lost \u2013 launched his invasion in February.\nWe applaud France\u2019s security assistance to Ukraine, including President Macron\u2019s recent announcement of a 100 million euro fund to help supply Kyiv with weapons.\u00a0 France is also host to more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, including thousands who have been welcomed into French households.\nOf course, our cooperation and our conversation extended far beyond Ukraine today.\u00a0 We\u2019re working closely together to rally international coalitions to meet global challenges which no nation or even group of nations can solve alone.\u00a0 That includes our joint efforts to combat the climate crisis.\u00a0 Next week, we\u2019ll hold the second annual high-level meeting of the U.S.\u2011France Clean Energy Partnership, which is ramping up our renewable energy production.\nWe\u2019re stalwart partners in strengthening global health security, as was evident in France\u2019s pledge of nearly $1.6 billion at last month\u2019s Global Fund Seventh Replenishment Conference, which President Biden committed to work with our Congress to contribute $6 billion to that fund.\u00a0 This is the international fund that has done so much over so many years to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, saving literally millions and millions of lives.\u00a0 Our contributions, the United States and France, the two \u2013 to the two largest contributions of any two countries \u2013 will allow us to keep making great strides against HIV/AIDS, against malaria, and against tuberculosis.\nWe\u2019re also working together to advance a free and open Indo\u2011Pacific where all nations can choose their own paths free from coercion.\u00a0 And I thank the minister for France\u2019s support in the negotiations that the governments of Israel and Lebanon reached, a historic agreement to establish a permanent maritime boundary between their two countries.\u00a0 This cooperation and coordination between France and the United States was instrumental in reaching this agreement.\nOur relationship is the embodiment of the approach in the United Nations \u2013 excuse me, the United States new National Security Strategy, which is rooted in strengthening our alliances and our partnerships, finding new ways to weave them together, and working together to shape a more open, secure, and prosperous world.\nThe state visit by President Macron in December, the first that President Biden will host during this administration, is both a testament to our unique friendship and the chance to continue to deepen it.\u00a0 I\u2019m very much looking forward to working with Catherine in the leadup to the visit and long after.\nWith that, Catherine, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0M. Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat, dear Antony, thank you very much for your warm welcome and for our meeting today, the first in Washington, as you rightly cite.\u00a0 As some of you may know, I\u2019ve happily served as a young diplomat in D.C. some time ago, let\u2019s say.\u00a0 Let me turn to French since the Secretary of State is an accomplished French speaker.\n(Via interpreter) Secretary of State, dear Tony, this visit is taking place at a decisive time.\u00a0 Almost eight months ago, Russia brought war back to the European continent by invading illegally Ukraine.\u00a0 It is by doing so threatening our collective security, breaching the fundamental principles of the Charter of the UN and as well as its own commitments, and day after day a trampling upon the laws of war and international humanitarian law given the crimes he perpetrates.\nThe international order we built collectively is being attacked.\u00a0 It is therefore not a regional stake.\u00a0 That war concerns us all as the Kremlin is blackmailing the world on energy, food, and in addition to its attacks against the very same principle that allow the states, the members of the international community, to live together, like I\u2019ve said before.\nThis is the reason why we, France, the United States, our allies, our partners made the choice to provide our staunch support to Ukraine by mobilizing all of our levers \u2013 political, economic, financial, humanitarian, and military.\u00a0 We said it on a number of occasions, and let me repeat it here:\u00a0 We will stand by Ukraine as long as necessary, because such is the interest of Europe, such is the interest of the United States, and such is very simply the interest of the world, which Russia is seeking to divide by expanding its imperialist and colonial ambitions.\nWe find strength and efficiency in our unity.\u00a0 The United States once again was here at the historical moment standing by its European friends who share the same democratic values, standing in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian Armed Forces to allow them to resist, and as we\u2019ve seen for a few weeks to even counterattack.\nAnd I would like to mention not just our unity but also another outstanding unity and underline the fact that the European reaction was historical, because confronted with an unprecedented challenge, the European Union was able to use, and quickly so, its full economic, diplomatic, and military strength.\u00a0 We quickly \u2013 very quickly \u2013 mobilized all of our instruments to hinder the Russian war effort.\u00a0 We enacted sanctions, individual sectorial sanctions, massive ones, 48 hours after the invasion, and seven times in a row since then.\nGiven that we even adopted a next package of sanctions, and on Monday, together with my colleagues of the European Union, we also decided to already work on another set of sanctions in case they were necessary.\nAnd together with the Europeans we also decided to gradually put an end to all energy dependency vis-\u00e0-vis Russia which was structural and which we fundamentally revised.\u00a0 As recalled by President Macron, the example of gas is very telling given that the European dependency dropped from 40 to 7 percent dependency vis-\u00e0-vis Russia for the \u2013 the decision taken at the Versailles summit in March.\u00a0 So within a few months we were able to adapt.\nAs you know, the embargo on coal has been in place since August.\u00a0 The one on oil is coming and will be fully in place on the 5th of December.\u00a0 And these measures are efficient, and please allow me to say because sometimes we hear that they are not.\u00a0 It is part of the propaganda by Moscow.\u00a0 But the Russian economy is impacted, already in recession this year, and we\u2019ll be back to where it were in 2000 within two years.\u00a0 So already 20 years lost and already some major part of the industrial Russian sectors in difficulty \u2013 armament, aeronautics, and automobile \u2014 so the sanctions are producing, having an impact.\nFrom a military point of view I would like to say as well that the European action is very \u2013 is determined, and President Macron recently announced to President Zelenskyy that we would step up our military assistance, delivering some new equipment.\u00a0 And you\u2019re probably aware that we are delivering artillery missiles, munitions, as well as a light tanks. \u00a0We also decided to train at least 2,000\u00a0Ukrainian soldiers in France, and we are developing cooperation in the field of intelligence, which will also be stepped up and will go further.\nSo we are doing our part, as needed, and we also provide humanitarian assistance and working on emergency reconstruction, and that will be more necessary than ever as winter approaches.\u00a0 We need to help the Ukrainian people to continue to hold on good, and we see that the Russians are targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine.\nWe are also welcoming and hosting \u2013 even though France is father \u2013 is at the west, but we have millions of Ukrainian refugees who are welcome in France and Europe.\u00a0 The kids can go to school.\u00a0 We mainly receive women and children.\u00a0 Ukrainians can work in Europe.\u00a0 It is a matter of solidarity, and we are honoring it.\u00a0 We\u2019re also providing an economic and financial assistance in the thousands of\u00a0\u2013 billions of Euros provided both by the European Union and member states individually.\nWe\u2019re also providing some concrete support when it comes to the fight against impunity.\u00a0 At the end of September, we were together at the UN Security Council for the first meeting at a ministerial level since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, dealing with the Russian\u00a0\u2013 the Ukrainian issue, and in particular, the fight against impunity.\u00a0 It was necessary to do so.\u00a0 And what we heard very much showed that Russia is very isolated. \u00a0I discussed with the Secretary of State we are providing our support to the International Criminal Court and to the Ukrainian courts so that those who perpetrate crimes in Ukraine are prosecuted as shall be because there will be no peace without justice.\nFrance also is supporting Ukraine, standing by its allies, European allies and within NATO.\u00a0 We resolutely contribute to strengthening the deterrence and defense posture of the east flank, standing by the side of our Baltic, Romanian, and Polish friends, and by deploying some additional troops, some land and air forces.\u00a0 And the European Union itself already released 3\u00a0billion euros, and we are now at 3.5 billion euros for the\u00a0\u2013 to the decision taken on Monday so that the\u00a0\u2013 what we call the European peace facility can provide Ukraine with what it takes to defend itself.\u00a0 It\u2019s basically some delivery of military equipment.\nIt is in these circumstances where\u00a0\u2013 and it will probably still be the case in the long run\u00a0\u2013 that I came, dear Tony, to talk about our bilateral relationship, and in order to prepare as well the state visit of President Macron very soon, in early December, thanks to the invitation extended by President Biden.\u00a0 And I understand that it is the first state visit organized by this administration, so please allow me to say that it is an honor which means a lot, both for my president and my country.\u00a0 The president said it once again when I saw him on Wednesday to prepare for my visit to Washington, D.C.\nSo we are together preparing for this visit in early December, and we intend to use it to show how vivid our alliance is, the oldest alliance, as is customary to often say.\u00a0 We will be working, of course, on implementing the roadmap, defined just a year ago by both our presidents in Rome in the margin of the G20 meeting in the space of energy\u00a0\u2013 in the areas of space and energy, which are strategic sectors for both our countries.\u00a0 And more than ever, we want to build on this new impulse and resolutely move forward in order to meet the challenges around the world.\u00a0 Some of them I\u2019ve just mentioned, but so many others we need to deal with: climate, energy, the Indo-Pacific, the Sahel, or the fight against terrorism.\nSo I believe that on all of these issues, discussions enable us to show that once again there was an outstanding convergence of views.\u00a0 We see each other often, very often, even though I do not so often come to D.C.\u00a0 And to conclude, the new National Security Strategy that was published this week here in the United States only shows that we share some very close analysis and recommendations.\u00a0 So in this context, we believe that this state visit will once again enable us to show how close we are, how willing we are to work together to meet all of these challenges.\nSo once again, Secretary of State, dear Tony, thank you for your warm welcome, thank you for our discussion earlier today, and thank you for all of the good work we have been doing for quite a while and as our countries have been doing for a long term since General Lafayette, George Washington, or Benjamin Franklin.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll say he is watching us and keeping a friendly eye on us.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll now take questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Kylie Atwood of CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Happy afternoon, and thank you guys for taking some questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, two questions, one on Iran and one on Russia.\nWe have heard U.S. officials in recent days be very clear in saying that reviving the Iran nuclear deal isn\u2019t a focus for the United States right now.\u00a0 But is it even possible to salvage that deal?\u00a0 Is the United States willing to strike a deal with the Iranian regime after the death of female Iranian protesters and after Iranian weapons shipments to Russia?\u00a0 And Minister Colonna, the same question to you on the French perspective on that.\u00a0 Is it still in the realm of possibility that France wants to revive the Iran nuclear deal?\nSecond question, on Russia and diplomacy.\u00a0 This week the Russian ambassador here in Washington spoke about a quiet channel of diplomacy that was used around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis to avoid a nuclear conflict.\u00a0 Then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the Russian ambassador here were leading that channel.\u00a0 Has the Biden administration studied that model and considered how to replicate something similar to that going forward to try and trigger a diplomatic path out of this war?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, thanks very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start and then turn it over to Catherine.\nFirst, with regard to Iran broadly, the JCPOA in particular.\u00a0 Look, right now the eyes of the world are on the protests in Iran, the extraordinary courage of young Iranians, especially women, who are standing up at great personal risk for their basic rights, for their basic freedoms, and encountering once again the brutal repression of their government.\u00a0 And as you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps in recent weeks in solidarity with them, in support of them, in support of every Iranian who simply wants the freedom to express their views and to have their voices heard.\nWe\u2019ve taken \u2013 we\u2019ve issued sanctions against the so-called morality police that are the ones who, among other things, are responsible for the death of Mahsa Amini, and of course we\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure, to the best of our ability, that through technology, Iranians can continue to communicate with one another and with the outside world.\u00a0 And that goes to the work that we did to make sure that we had a license in place that allows technology companies as best they can to get the necessary communications technology to Iranians.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where I think the world\u2019s focus is.\nHaving said that, with regard to the JCPOA, two things.\u00a0 First, there\u2019s no imminent agreement, and there\u2019s no imminent agreement because the Iranians continue to inject extraneous issues into the discussions about the JCPOA.\u00a0 And as long as they continue to do that, there is no possibility, no prospect for an agreement.\u00a0 We continue to believe that a diplomatic resolution to the challenge posed by Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains the best way forward, and we continue to be determined that Iran never acquire a nuclear weapon or the capacity to build one, including the fissile material necessary to fuel one.\nThe JCPOA, when it was in existence, was successful in putting Iran\u2019s program \u2013 its nuclear program \u2013 into a box.\u00a0 And unfortunately, in leaving that agreement, it\u2019s allowed Iran to get out of the box that it was in in terms of its nuclear program.\u00a0 We continue to have an interest in seeing that program put back in the box.\u00a0 We continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to do that.\u00a0 But in this moment there is no prospect for an agreement \u2013 again, because Iran continues to inject extraneous issues into the conversations that we\u2019ve had.\u00a0 And the European Union, our partners \u2013 France, Germany, the United Kingdom \u2013 are all in the same place when it comes to that.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say on this:\u00a0 With or without a deal \u2013 and this was true when the deal was in effect; it\u2019s been true since the deal has no longer been in effect \u2013 with or without it, we will continue to take every step necessary to deal with Iran\u2019s activities, Iran\u2019s aggression, whether it\u2019s in the Middle East or beyond.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeing that now with the provision of UAVs to Russia to help it continue its aggression against the Ukrainian people.\nWith regard to Russia and diplomacy, before I turn it to Catherine, we have been very clear that whenever we have something that it\u2019s important to communicate to the Russians, we\u2019ll do it, and we\u2019ve done it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had occasion to speak to Foreign Minister Lavrov on specific issues that were important to our own security.\u00a0 Other colleagues \u2013 including the Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor \u2013 have communicated with their counterparts, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.\nWhen it comes to diplomacy to end the war, it depends entirely on whether Russia gets to a place where it\u2019s actually interested in stopping the aggression that it started, and we\u2019ve seen no evidence of that in this moment.\u00a0 On the contrary, we see Russia doubling and tripling down on its aggression: in the last month, the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of Russians; horrifically, cannon fodder that Putin is trying to throw into the war.\u00a0 For the 300,000 Russians that had purportedly been mobilized, more than that number have fled the country to avoid having to go to Ukraine.\nSecond, of course, this effort to have the sham referenda and then annex Ukrainian territory, which was rejected by virtually the entire world, 143 countries; now, a horrific bombing campaign against critical civilian infrastructure, against \u2013 as Catherine said \u2013 the facilities across the country that are trying to generate electricity and power for the country to keep the lights on, to keep people warm during the winter \u2013 brutalizing the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 So every indication is that, far from being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy, President Putin continues to push in the opposite direction.\u00a0 The fundamental problem he has is that not only are the Ukrainian people extraordinarily courageous and resilient, they\u2019re also very successful in not only repelling the aggression but taking their land back.\nAnd it all comes down to what I\u2019ve been saying for some time, which is that, with the assistance that we\u2019ve been providing, with the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people, the fundamental difference maker is that Ukrainians are fighting for their country, for their land, for their future.\u00a0 Russia is not.\u00a0 The sooner President Putin understands that and comes to that conclusion, the sooner we\u2019ll be able to end this war.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMR. PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Kylie, we need \u2013 we need to go on to the Foreign Minister, please.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0We \u2013 we\u2019ll \u2013 we consider and will consider every means to advance diplomacy if we see an opening to advance it by whatever means.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019ll always look at it.\u00a0 But as I said, in this moment, Russia shows no signs of being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy by any means.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your question regarding Iran.\u00a0 I say we\u2019re pretty much aligned on this one as well.\u00a0 Let me switch to French on the JCPOA.\n(Via interpreter) Regarding the JCPOA, the Secretary of State responded in detail.\u00a0 A proposal was made to Iran, so that is some very long negotiations.\u00a0 The proposal aims at dealing with the Iranian nuclear situation, which is serious \u2013 very serious.\u00a0 This proposal has not so far been approved by Iran even though we told them there would be no better offer on the table and that it is for \u2013 it belongs to Iran to take a decision and to accept this offer if they can.\u00a0 And President Macron went as far as meeting President Raisi in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York to find out about his mindset.\u00a0 And unfortunately, we could only acknowledge that Iran at the moment was not willing to accept this proposal.\u00a0 So it is for this country to make a decision.\nSecond, and like the Secretary of State, I would like to say how concerned we all by the violence that is being used by the Iranian authorities against demonstrators, people who demonstrate peacefully so \u2013 on a number of occasions.\u00a0 And quickly we condemn this brutal repression against demonstrators.\u00a0 We also recalled the fundamental right of citizens to demonstrate peacefully, to peacefully express their opinion.\u00a0 We also demanded all citizens to be set free.\u00a0 There are a number of French citizens being held in Iran and others.\u00a0 We took a number of sanctions on behalf of the European Union against those responsible for the repression.\nSo that\u2019s been done, and more recently this week, given the support provided by Iran to the criminal action of Russia in Ukraine by way of kamikaze UAVs that were used again only a few days ago, we have at a ministerial level adopted some additional sanctions \u2013 and they are now enforced \u2013 sanctions against those responsible for these armament programs.\nAnd let me say that these UAVs that were used once again this week \u2013 against the civilian \u2013 civil infrastructures and civilians in Ukraine \u2013 this is not only in breach of the commitments by Iran in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolution, but it is also a war crime because they\u2019re targeting civilians.\u00a0 So this is the reason why we took sanctions.\nMR. PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0S\u00e9bastien Blanc, AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I have two questions, one for each of you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, there are currently tensions between France and Germany.\u00a0 Britain is in turmoil.\u00a0 We have a new prime minister in Italy with a coalition who is \u2013 who disagrees on Ukraine.\u00a0 Are you worried about a lack \u2013 a possible lack of cohesion within Europe at a time when cohesion is very much needed against Russia?\n(Via interpreter) And\u00a0Madame la Ministre, is France going to send a military force or a police force to Haiti, as requested by Prime Minister Ariel Henry?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Everything I\u2019m seeing is the exact opposite of a lack of cohesion.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re showing tremendous solidarity, we\u2019re showing tremendous coordination, tremendous cooperation in everything that we\u2019re doing together to support Ukraine, to continue to put pressure on Russia, as well as to shore up our own alliance, NATO \u2013 defensive alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that in the actions that the EU has just taken, including additional sanctions.\u00a0 We see it in the support that just a week ago more than 40 countries came together through the Ramstein process to continue the coordination in supplying weaponry to Ukraine to allow it to defend itself and to take back its territory.\u00a0 We see it in the assistance that the European Union now is providing directly to Ukraine, including direct budgetary support that will help them get through this economic challenge that they\u2019re facing largely because of the Russian aggression.\nSo everything I\u2019m seeing, both in terms of my own conversations and, importantly, the President\u2019s conversations with his counterpart, as well as in the action that\u2019s being taken, speaks to incredibly strong cohesion, solidarity, commitment to this common effort to help Ukraine defend itself, to stand up not only for Ukrainians against this aggression, but to stand up for the very principles that are at the heart of the United Nations Charter and that are important for countries everywhere around the world \u2013 the basic idea that one country can\u2019t change the borders of another by force, that it can\u2019t simply seize the land it wants or eliminate the independence or sovereignty of a country just because its leader so decides.\nTogether, Europe, the United States are standing strong in defense of those basic principles, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s important not just to our own countries but to countries around the world.\u00a0 And it was further manifested by the fact that with a resolution that was led by the European Union at the UN General Assembly just a week ago, 143 countries stood up together in opposition to what Russia is doing in Ukraine.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you, sir.\u00a0 We support the search for stability for Haiti, a country which is once again plunged into violence and poverty still, and we are well aware of the seriousness of the situation which is in the hands of criminal gangs which are only worsening the situation.\u00a0 So in this respect I would like to commend the adoption today at the Security Council of a unanimous resolution, and it is also interesting when we consider \u2013 when we look at the situation of the global order.\u00a0 So I would like to also commend the efforts deployed by the United States for the adoption and \u2013 the quick adoption of this resolution.\nIf an international support force to the police were to be set up, France would contribute probably materially, even though we still \u2013 by way of equipment we will still have to work on the details.\u00a0 But what is important in the moment is that we continue to deploy efforts at the United Nations for such a force to be deployed.\u00a0 At the moment we\u2019re not yet where we should be to contribute to resolving the problem of Haiti.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Missy Ryan,\u00a0Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thank you.\u00a0 You both mentioned the assistance that France is providing to Ukraine.\u00a0 However, there are some in the U.S. Congress who are increasingly voicing concerns about the fact that the United States is giving so much more economic and military aid to Ukraine than many of its major allies or than all of its major allies in Europe, while countries like France, in turn, are giving less proportionally than countries \u2013 smaller European countries like Estonia.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, do you think that countries \u2013 larger European countries like France and Germany \u2013 should be increasing their contributions to Ukraine?\nAnd also for you, Mr. Secretary, last week President Macron in an interview said that France would not use nuclear weapons in retaliation for a potential Russian nuclear strike on Ukraine.\u00a0 Do you think it\u2019s a good idea to preemptively take that off the table?\nAnd for you, Madam Minster, can you tell us how President Macron\u2019s comments ruling out nuclear retaliation makes France and Europe safer?\u00a0 And do you think there should be a way to take into account the significant contributions that France and other European countries have made in taking in and taking care of Ukrainian refugees to help people in the United States, for example, understand how the contributions may not be what they seem to be on the face of them?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Missy.\u00a0 With regard to assistance to Ukraine, first, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are making together an extraordinary collective effort.\u00a0 And again, you see that in the security assistance that\u2019s being provided by Europe and by the United States alike.\u00a0 You see it in the economic assistance; you see it in the humanitarian assistance that\u2019s being provided.\u00a0 And if you break it down and add it up, Europe is doing extraordinary things.\u00a0 I just mentioned that this week we saw the European Union moving forward with direct budgetary support in the billions of dollars for the Ukrainian Government, something that we\u2019ve been doing over the summer, but it\u2019s very important and very timely that Europe is now picking up this baton, very important to Ukraine as it tries to get through the winter and get through the months ahead.\nSimilarly, when it comes to the defense support to Ukraine, I could cite what France has done and continues to do, which is absolutely vital to the Ukrainians being able to defend themselves and take back territory.\u00a0 That continues; we talked about it today.\u00a0 And the same thing on the humanitarian support.\u00a0 It\u2019s also true that there are literally millions of Ukrainian refugees in Europe being welcomed by a whole variety of European countries \u2013 the kids going to school, the parents being able to work and getting support.\u00a0 That\u2019s significant; that has to be added to the equation.\u00a0 So this is a collective responsibility that we are undertaking collectively, and one of the things that we\u2019re working on virtually every day is making sure that we\u2019re coordinated, making sure we\u2019re being responsive to the needs, and doing it together.\u00a0 So I\u2019ve been impressed with the \u2013 this collective effort.\u00a0 And based on our conversations and based on conversations with other European colleagues, I have no doubt that that will continue.\nWhen it comes to nuclear weapons, two things.\u00a0 There has been loose talk coming from President Putin and from other Russians about this.\u00a0 It\u2019s the height of irresponsibility, particularly coming from a member of the United Nations Security Council.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we look at very carefully and that we take very seriously given what Russia has already done in Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ve to date seen no reason to change our own nuclear posture, but we will track it very carefully.\u00a0 And let me just say for our part \u2013 I\u2019m not going to speak for France or for anyone else \u2013 we\u2019ve communicated very clearly, very directly to Russia the consequences for any use of a nuclear weapon.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I shall continue with this first topic before moving on to the refugees.\u00a0 Madam, echoing what the Secretary of State just said, when one talks about nuclear weapons, one should talk with genuine measurement, if not prudence.\u00a0 So once again I would like to say that we\u2019re calling upon Russia to act as a responsible power.\u00a0 It is a nuclear power and accordingly it has some specific responsibility: nuclear weapons of deterrence.\u00a0 And I think one we recall \u2013 once we recall that nuclear weapons are weapons of deterrence, it says it all.\u00a0 As to the French doctrine recalled by the president of France, that is \u2013 this is the one.\nMadam, you also asked about the fact that Europe is welcoming millions and millions of refugees from Ukraine, usually women and children.\u00a0 They are being well \u2013 I believe they\u2019re well received.\u00a0 And by hosting them, well, it is a matter of solidarity, it is a matter of humanity.\u00a0 So of course it comes at a cost, but it is normal.\u00a0 And I believe when it was assessed that it is costing some 17 of 18 million euros already, and it will continue.\u00a0 But the \u2013 we will need \u2013 the member states shall continue to support to maintain this effort, but I will not use that as an argument.\u00a0 We should speak about the facts, and like the Secretary of State said, France, the European Union in itself, its member states all sharing \u2013 now shouldering their responsibility.\u00a0 They\u2019re already contributing thousands of millions \u2013 billions of euros to microeconomic support, financial support, humanitarian support, et cetera, not to mention the welcoming the refugees, as I just said.\nAnd one last word.\u00a0 Let us not play in the hands of the Russians.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been incredibly united and they bring \u2013 this is our strength.\u00a0 And I would like to call upon each and every one to say that we stand together to defend the principles of international law, according to which an order based on the rules shall not be challenged the way it is being by Russia.\u00a0 We shall clearly say what is at stake.\u00a0 It is not just the fate of Ukraine or the security of the European continent.\u00a0 It is a matter relevant to all and every single country around the world.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Keely Sullivan, France 2.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Thank you, Minister Colonna, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, if I may, I would actually like to ask you a question in French.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Allons-y.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Okay, okay.\u00a0 (Via interpreter.) I would like to ask about a statement that came out of the White House yesterday, according to which there are some Iranian military present in Crimea supporting the Russians with a number of UAV strikes in Ukraine.\u00a0 Do you consider some new sanctions by the United States or some parallel response?\u00a0 And Madam as well, Madam Minister, further to the sanctions approved by the European Union, do you consider something else further to the statement that came out of the White House?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (In French.)\n(In English) First, we\u2019ve been warning going back to July about Iranian plans to provide UAVs to Russia for use in Ukraine, so this is something that we have been seeing in the works and now we\u2019re seeing in reality.\u00a0 Back in September, a month ago, the Russians moved UAVs that they acquired from Iran into Crimea to use against the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 And, as we\u2019ve said, Russian military personnel in Crimea have been piloting these Iranian UAVs, using them to conduct kinetic strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv just in recent days and against all sorts of civilian infrastructure and civilians themselves.\u00a0 That\u2019s truly deplorable.\u00a0 And yes, we also see Iranian military personnel on the ground in Crimea who are assisting Russia in these operations.\u00a0 We believe that Russia\u2019s received dozens of these UAVs so far from Iran, with more potentially in the works.\nBut beyond consistently warning about this, going back well before the Russian aggression, we\u2019ve been taking action against the provision of UAVs by Iran to anyone that\u2019s using them in an aggressive and dangerous way, whether it\u2019s in Yemen, whether it\u2019s in Iraq, whether it\u2019s potentially against Israel, and other countries.\u00a0 We\u2019ve sanctioned the entities that we can find that are involved with this.\u00a0 There are UAV networks, including sanctions going back to last October.\u00a0 We are interdicting the illicit traffic in arms, including UAVs, wherever we can see them, find them, and interdict them.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that in coordination and cooperation with other countries.\u00a0 And we\u2019re continuing to build up the defenses of our partners, including in Ukraine, against the use of UAVs or any other kinds of weapon systems that Iran may be engaged in.\nSo this is a day-in, day-out effort.\u00a0 It goes back a long time.\u00a0 But it\u2019s now spread to Ukraine through Russia, and we\u2019re determined to stand against it wherever it\u2019s happening.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter.) Thank you, madam. As to the sanctions, like I said, we already adopted eight series of sanctions against the Russian war machine and warmongers, and the sanctions will be stepped up if necessary.\u00a0 And I was saying as well that on Monday, we decided to start working on what could be done if it were necessary.\nBut your question was in relation to Iran, and here again let me recall what we said before.\u00a0 The European Union itself took sanctions against those responsible for repression in Iran, and more recently this week, sanctions against Iran due to the delivery of military equipment to Russia used against Ukraine in breach of the commitments taken by Iran and its commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the international community.\u00a0 There is a UN Security Council resolution that prohibits that, and also for being the accomplice of the war crimes committed, perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine.\nSo these sanctions were decided at a political level on Monday.\u00a0 They were finalized yesterday.\u00a0 And they are legally in force as from today.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-opening-of-a-new-philadelphia-passport-agency-and-at-a-u-s-citizenship-and-immigration-services-naturalization-ceremony/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Because of your work, this facility will soon be able to process more than 150,000 passports every year.\u00a0 And joining in this effort are individuals, people like Julia Nixon, who has processed passports in Philadelphia for nearly four decades \u2013 starting at a time when she was required to physically paste the photographs inside passports with glue.\u00a0 Things have changed just a little bit since then. (Laughter.)\u00a0 Julia, thank you for your service.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nI want to take advantage of this moment just to do a little further advertising because the State Department is also undertaking other initiatives \u2013 redesigning our passports with stronger security features to deter fraud; making our policies more inclusive so that all people can travel with documents that truly reflect their identities.\nWe\u2019re joined by several family members, as well, of Representative Nix, after whom this facility is named.\u00a0 The son of a former slave, he was the first black person to be elected to represent the city of Philadelphia in Congress; he served the city\u2019s residents from 1956 to 1979.\u00a0 During that time, he served on multiple committees, including Post Office and Civil Service Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\u00a0 So this really connects that beautifully because this facility, which began as a post office connecting Americans to each other as well as to the wider world, now a Passport Agency connecting Americans to the world around them.\nCongressman Nix, as a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, pushed for passage of the landmark legislation on civil rights, including introducing a measure to end racial discrimination in the Armed Forces, and later supporting key voting rights legislation.\u00a0 Across each of these efforts, he tried to make a country that hadn\u2019t always treated him equally a little bit more equal.\nTo the Nix family here today \u2013 grandsons Robert Nix III, Michael, Tony, great grandson Jalen, as well as their own families: we\u2019re honored to have you join us today, join us in recognizing and appreciating the extraordinary legacy of Congressman Nix, his contributions not just to this city, but to our country.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThrough his actions, Representative Nix worked to make sure that the first three words of our Constitution \u2013 a phrase that I suspect everyone in this group knows pretty well by now from your naturalization test \u2013 \u201cWe the People\u201d \u2013 extended their promise to more Americans.\u00a0 And throughout his life, he dedicated himself to the idea that the story of America is one of growth, of inclusion, of constant renewal from within.\nEach and every one of you here today embodies that renewal.\u00a0 This is what makes our country strong.\u00a0 You arrived in America from almost every corner of the world, vastly different backgrounds, different perspectives, different journeys.\nAs a journalist in Belarus, Hanna, who\u2019s here with us today, worked with activists to cover human rights violations that were happening in Belarus.\u00a0 She was persecuted for her work; she escaped to the United States.\u00a0 Today, she and her husband, a registered nurse from Macedonia, are proud homeowners in Delaware next door.\nJimmy, trained as a civil engineer in Honduras, came to the United States when the company that he was working for transferred him here to Philadelphia.\u00a0 His work was so indispensable that the company eventually petitioned for him to stay in the United States.\u00a0 He now lives in Delaware with his wife, Melissa, who teaches Spanish at a private school.\nSung came to the United States to attend graduate school, after which he planned to return home to South Korea to become a software engineer.\u00a0 Along the way, he fell in love with another immigrant: his future wife, who came from China to study in the United States.\u00a0 They now live with their two children, ages nine and five, just outside of Philadelphia.\nThe urge to do better for yourself, to do better for your family, to be part of something bigger than any one person or family, that\u2019s something that shaped my life as well.\nMy grandfather, my father\u2019s father, Maurice Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing pogroms at the turn of the last century in Russia.\nMy stepmother, Vera Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing the communists in her native Hungary.\nAnd my late stepfather, Samuel Pisar, ultimately found a home in America after enduring the horrors of the Holocaust.\u00a0 He was liberated from concentration camps by an American GI.\u00a0 He repaid the gift by dedicating his own life to advocating for human rights, and trying to find common ground among former adversaries.\nIn 1961, he became a citizen of the United States, and here\u2019s what he used to say to me and to other members of our family.\u00a0 \u201cYou,\u201d pointing to me, \u201cyou are an American by happy accident of birth.\u00a0 I am an American by choice.\u201d\nEach of you has made that same choice.\u00a0 And with that decision comes a responsibility borne by every generation of immigrants that have come before you: that of being a citizen, of contributing your ideas, your talent, your energy to your communities.\u00a0 You are now partners in the great unfinished work of making this country better for more of its people \u2013 especially those who will come after you.\nThroughout our nation\u2019s history, we have been enriched time and again by the contributions of immigrants and their children.\nThey influence everything from the art that expands our horizons, to the scientific advancements that move us forward, to the food that we enjoy every single day.\u00a0 In fact, earlier today we made a pit stop by Federal Donuts \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 just a few blocks away.\u00a0 I got a chance to sample a few of the chef\u2019s remarkable achievements \u2013 I even helped to make one\u00a0\u2013 influenced in his case by his Israeli background.\u00a0 Another powerful example of our melting pot.\nImmigrants, as we know, have launched world-renowned companies from Apple to Google, AT&T and Pfizer.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been a key source of our national competitiveness.\u00a0 I was in Silicon Valley just a couple of days ago.\u00a0 More than half of the billion-dollar companies produced in Silicon Valley were founded by an immigrant.\nIn my own department, the State Department, those with immigrant roots are leading vital parts of our foreign policy every single day.\nUzra Zeya, whose family immigrated from India to the United States in the 1960s.\u00a0 She now helps uphold human rights around the world as our Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights.\nJulieta Noyes, whose parents fled repression in Cuba.\u00a0 She now helps support persecuted and vulnerable people around the world as our Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.\nAnd Sarah Majzoub, whose parents immigrated from Lebanon, established a successful architectural firm in the United States.\u00a0 She\u2019s now one of my closest aides in my office; she\u2019s a crucial part of making sure that I\u2019m as well-prepared as I can be each and every day.\nSimply put, we could not do American diplomacy without them and without so many other colleagues, who started someplace else and are now here as Americans.\u00a0 And we wouldn\u2019t want to.\u00a0 Our foreign policy is stronger, it\u2019s more effective, because of their service.\u00a0 We come from the most diverse country on Earth.\u00a0 We\u2019re operating in a world that\u2019s incredibly diverse.\u00a0 By definition, this diversity is the source of our strength, and if we\u2019re not making full use of it, we\u2019re shortchanging ourselves.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working every day to make sure that we are making full use of our diversity.\nHere at this Passport Agency in Philadelphia, there\u2019s a mural called The Seeker, by Philadelphia-based artist Michelle Angela Ortiz, who we\u2019re fortunate to have with us today.\u00a0 And I saw her a little bit earlier.\nIt depicts three large circles. \u00a0I hope you get a chance to see it.\u00a0 The first two circles show a host of memories: a girl reconnecting with her grandmother in Korea; a wedding in Jamaica; postcards from Panama, among many others.\nAnd then the third circle shows a young woman, \u201cthe seeker,\u201d who\u2019s looking at these memories\u00a0\u2013 which reflect a tiny sampling of the many experiences that the immigrants carry with them from a past land \u2013 looking at these memories as she forges her path in the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s an experience that binds so many of us together in this country.\u00a0 Here \u2013 as the paper that she\u2019s holding in her hands reads \u2013 we become \u201cout of many, one.\u201d\nSo I hope that you too carry your past with pride, that you share your experiences from your home countries with your new communities.\u00a0 The diverse tapestry of this country is enriched by these perspectives, these experiences, by your citizenship, by your very being.\nSo finally and simply put, I want to say thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for choosing us.\u00a0 Thank you for making that choice.\u00a0 On behalf of the American people, let me be one of the first lucky people to say:\u00a0 Welcome home, my fellow Americans.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Applause.)\nMR SPALTER:\u00a0 All right, good afternoon.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Good afternoon.\nMR SPALTER:\u00a0 Twenty-four candidates from 17 countries came here today to pledge allegiance to the United States of America.\u00a0 Candidates, I will now call the names of your country of nationality.\u00a0 I ask that you please stand and remain standing until all countries have been called.\nAlbania.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBelarus.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBhutan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Bhutan?\nMR SPALTER:\u00a0 Bhutan.\u00a0 There you go.\nChina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nGuinea.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHonduras.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIraq.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nJamaica.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nLiberia.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNepal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe Philippines.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nRussia.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSouth Korea.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTrinidad and Tobago.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTunisia.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUkraine.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd Uzbekistan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nGood afternoon, Secretary Blinken.

This was a post office before \u2013 as Philadelphia\u2019s (inaudible) post office, before it became now the passport agency.

Borlaug International Dialogue", "location": "Des Moines, Iowa", "date": "October 18, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDR. CARY FOWLER: Thank you, Barbara. It\u2019s such an honor to be with all of you today in this place on this day. Years ago, I attended a lecture by Jack Harlan. Dr. Harlan was a geneticist. He was a plant explorer. He was an agricultural historian. Worked at the University of Illinois most of his career.\nAnd the lecture was entitled Self-Perception and The Origins of Agriculture. I\u2019ll never forget it. His point was that how you believe agriculture began has a lot to do with who you are with the perch you occupy in life.\nIf you are an academic you might be tempted to think, well, agriculture must have been invented or discovered by some particularly clever person about 12,000 years ago. If you were very religiously inclined, you would think well, it was a gift from the gods. In most religions, in fact, have a story to explain the origins of Agriculture.\nLikewise today, I think how we understand the current global food crisis and certainly the solutions that we tout, these have to do with who we are and what perch we occupy. If your only tool is a hammer, you will\u2013 you know how that ends.\nSo, I\u2019m certainly as vulnerable to myopia as anyone, I realized that. I realized that the current crisis is as Barbara mentioned, multi-causal. There\u2019s COVID. There\u2019s climate. There\u2019s conflict. But there are also a lot of other things, very high fuel prices, a fertilizer situation, export bans, low, by historical standpoints, grain stockpiles, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut I cannot personally shake the belief that on the list of the 5, or list of the top 10 most important challenges that we face in regards to food security. That climate is 1, 3, 5. When I became executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust back in 2005, I remember saying at my very first staff meeting that this was a climate change organization. I think they thought I was a crazy at that time. But it was a climate change organization because climate changes everything.\nLast month was the 453rd consecutive month in which the global average temperature for that month exceeded the 20th century average. 453 consecutive months of above average temperatures. Of course, higher average temperatures are not the only thing that\u2019s happening with climate change. We\u2019re having more extremes. We\u2019re having longer periods of hot weather.\nAnd this is causing species to migrate. And so, we\u2019re in the midst of seeing new and unique combinations of species in the field\u2013 in agricultural fields around the world. We\u2019re going to have some surprises. They\u2019re not all going to be good ones.\nTake a look at this histogram just briefly. The blue bars there representing a historical distribution of average growing season temperatures in Zambia. The legend is a little bit missing for the red bars. But the red bars are the projection for what will happen between 2040 and 2060.\nAnd what you\u2019ll notice, and I\u2019ll draw your attention to is where they overlap. What this means is that in the future, the best growing seasons of the future will closely resemble the worst of the past. Let that sink in. If you go out in time a little bit further, you\u2019ll see how they actually, almost completely diverge.\nThis is the type of situation that we are going to be dealing with in the future. And I think that the assumption that we can somehow look into the rearview mirror for guidance about the future and that crop production is going to magically continue its historic upward trend. Why?\nBecause well, of course, we need it to.\nThis assumption has really outlived its usefulness. Should we worry about maize and wheat and rice and soy? Absolutely. But these are the crops that are attracting and have attracted historically the most research funding. So, I\u2019m worried about everything else as well about the not so minor, minor crops. These are what you might call orphan crops. They\u2019re orphan crops because they have a lot of potential, but we haven\u2019t been investing in them.\nRoots and tubers, fruits and vegetables, the minor millets, teff, on and on. The crops that are so vitally important for nutrition if you think about nutrition as being more than calories. For many of these crops, there are very few plant breeders. For some crops like yams, for example, there are probably fewer than 10 plant breeders in the entire world. And a lot of crops, perhaps half of the crops that are grown today, have never had a single Mendelian trained plant breeder working on them throughout agricultural history.\nSo, we justifiably I think will focus on how many people do yams feed. But increasingly, I think what we have to ask ourselves is, how many people do yams depend on. And in this case, it\u2019s not many.\nSo how is it that crops evolve? Well, they\u2019re domesticated. Think about that word, domicile, domestic. They\u2019ve entered the home. Their future is literally in our hands. Their adaptation is in our hands.\nThey adapt by formal plant breeding and/or by farmers making selections based on diversity, or they don\u2019t adapt at all. So, we may want to learn a little bit from our own history in the United States. After all, when wheat came to the United States from the Near East, when soy came from Asia, when potatoes migrated northward from the Andes, when sorghum came from Africa, think about it.\nWhen all of these crops first came to the United States, they were experiencing climate change from their native habitats. How did they evolve? How was it that they came to be grown under over such vast acreages in the United States? The answer lies in the selection that farmers made with the diversity that our own government provided them potentially particularly back in the 1800s.\nI will go backwards here for a second. Yeah. So, I think that aside from the top five crops that we have in the world today, basically all of our crops are orphan crops in the countries in which they\u2019re grown. Ideally, I think what we should be doing is to identify the crops that are or could be most important for nutrition. We should be assessing how climate change will affect them. And then with this foundation, we should be ramping up to help those crops, those domesticated crops, those crops in our hands to cope with the climate change that\u2019s on our doorstep right now.\nWe luckily have great resources in the gene banks around the world. We have perhaps 1.5 million to 2 million unique samples of crop diversity that wait to be explored and exploited for the challenge that lies ahead with climate change. Now, in closing, I want to take you back into history a little bit and I want to mention three incredibly important things that happened in a single year in the 1800s, and that year is 1859.\nThe first thing that happened was that in 1859, Edwin Drake drilled the first commercial oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania. The second thing that happened, happened at the hands of this man named John Tyndall in the UK. John Tyndall in the laboratory discovered and proved that CO2 traps heat. And thus, he in a sense discovered the greenhouse effect that was about to be created by the first slide that I showed you about the drilling of oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania.\nAnd the third thing, of course, was the publication in 1859 of Charles Darwin\u2019s book \u201cOn the Origin of Species by Natural Selection\u201d. Darwin put together four basic steps or ingredients that you have to have for evolution, otherwise known as adaptation. We \u2013 he understood that there was inheritance, and that there was diversity. The first chapter of \u201cOrigin of Species\u201d is called variation under domestication. It was about agricultural crops and domesticated species.\nIf you have inheritance which we do, if you have diversity and if you have natural selection working on that diversity, then over time you have adaptation. Well, we still have inheritance, we do have diversity, we still have natural selection, but we don\u2019t have a lot of is time at the moment. And that\u2019s where-we come in.\nThe first two of these events from 1859 presaged the crisis of climate change and food security. The third points to a solution that we have yet fully to grasp. And that solution at least in part and here\u2019s where I acknowledge my own myopia has to do with crop diversity.\nThe very ending of origin of Species by Darwin in his last paragraph he sums up the book and his feelings about what he has uncovered. That last paragraph is to me, it\u2019s like a Bach cantata. It is rich and it is exquisite. And I want to read that last paragraph to you in closing.\nDarwin says, \u201cThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one\u2013 and that, while this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed laws of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.\u201d My friends, I submit to you that this is what we need to keep alive if we hope to have food security in a climate changing world. Thank you.\nBARBARA STINSON: Have a seat.\nDR. FOWLER: OK. Thank you. Pretty warming.\nBARBARA STINSON: We have a few more minutes. So, we\u2019re going to continue the conversation just a bit. Thank you so much for your comments and perspective that you bring in global crop diversity, coming to this position now at the State Department. Just say a little bit about your position as Special Envoy to Global Food Security, it\u2019s a recent appointment. And what is on your agenda as you proceed these especially in these first few months.\nDR. FOWLER: OK. Well, if you were to read the job description that I finally found in the global food security strategy, I don\u2019t want you to look at it because you\u2019ll blame me for anything going wrong.\nBARBARA STINSON: OK. Fair enough.\nDR. FOWLER: It\u2019s a humbling position. It\u2019s\u2013 it is the\u2013 I guess the highest ranking position at the State Department dealing with global food security. So we have a lot to do with diplomacy issues, with coordination, and collaboration with other departments and agencies.\nI think what\u2013 what I have wanted to bring to the position, however, is a more long term view. There is obviously a great deal of attention that gets focused on the immediate humanitarian side of the food crisis. And I don\u2019t begrudge people working on that at all.\nBut I think we have to realize that the humanitarian need is going to overwhelm us unless we put into place the kinds of programs that will help ramp up agricultural production. So people\u2013 countries around the world can be more self-sufficient. So, we\u2019re very interested at the State Department and my office in looking at initiatives that I think will pay off in a big way. The moonshot kind of initiatives that have a lot of cost benefit.\nAnd in that regard, I\u2019ll just mention that we will be trying to be a catalyst for what I mentioned from the podium about assessing crops, importance to nutrition, about their effect, their impact\u2013 the impact that climate change is having, and about trying to catalyze programs in the future that will help those crops adapt to climate change.\nBARBARA STINSON: Wonderful. Well, it\u2019s great to hear that perspective on the work that\u2019s ahead of you. And I really appreciate it in your comments both your advice not necessarily to be able to look into the rearview mirror to find the answers but also to consider 1859 and those seminal events that you mentioned.\nSo, let\u2019s talk just a little bit about the assessment charge that you\u2019re taking up assessing the impact on crops of climate change. This is the business of Cynthia Rosenzweig and those at NASA and the GISS, the Goddard Institute, and particularly her argument project. Can you just say a little bit about the assessment not only of impact on nutrition of climate change but some of the other aspects that you\u2019re hoping to focus on.\nDR. FOWLER: Yeah. Well, yes. Obviously, climate change is having a huge impact already on nutrition. It has deleterious impacts on the actual nutrition of our crops. It lowers the nutritional value of a lot of our crops.\nBut looking forward, one of the things that\u2019s amazed me and frustrated me, frankly, is looking at projections of future food demand. You can go in the academic literature, and you\u2019ll find many, many articles out there about what the food demand is going to be in 2050. Generally speaking, we need to produce 50% to 60% more food by 2050.\nAnd very often, those same articles will give a projection of how much food we will produce. And that\u2019s where the reference to the rearview mirror comes in because I think for the most part, we are looking in the rearview mirror when we project future food production. And you can see the projections being roughly in the realm of 50% more about 2050.\nIf you want to scare yourself though look at the footnotes. And the footnotes will say, well, this projection doesn\u2019t take into consideration climate change, conflict, food, and price inflation, et cetera, et cetera. In other words, all the things that we\u2019re having today.\nIf you in turn go to some of the climate people and look at\u2013 at what they\u2019re projecting for individual crops, well, you see that May\u2019s experts will tell you that one degree centigrade increase in climate will increase pest and disease damage by 10% to 20%. And in some areas of Africa, you can get the projection that well by 2050 with the climate change that they\u2019re looking at there, we won\u2019t be producing 50% more food, we\u2019ll be producing 10% less, and that\u2019s a big variance.\nSo, I think that perhaps one of the things that we can do at the State Department we\u2019re not an implementing agency. We don\u2019t have these types on the ground. Programs is to sound the alarm and to say that let\u2019s be careful. Let\u2019s not make assumptions about future food production.\nLet\u2019s look at what the needs are going to be in the future. And let\u2019s plan backwards from that. And let\u2019s put the programs and the investments in place that we really need to ensure that we can produce the food to feed everyone.\nTremendous perspective really to offer. Can you say a little bit more about the orphan crops \u2013 about the crops that have been considered minor crops and yet we know we need to emphasize that diversity in production going forward. How do you see it?\nWell, I think there are actually two categories at least in my mind of orphan crops. And the first category are of really important crops that we don\u2019t think of as being orphans, but they are. So, that would be anything other than the top four or five crops.\nCrops that are receiving some investment and are very popular and well-known crops, sorghum would be one. Frankly speaking, potatoes and sweet potatoes. And a lot of those types of crops and virtually all the vegetables would be in that category. Simply not receiving the amount of investment that they deserve if you\u2019re considering food security as being as nutrition as being central to food security.\nThe second category that worries me even more would be crops that we take totally for granted. This would be African leafy greens, for example. Crops that are part of the household gardens and developing countries for which there are no plant breeders at all.\nAnd here again, we have to be careful about the assumptions we\u2019re making. Are we assuming that those crops magically are going to be adapted to climates that have never before existed in the history of agriculture simply because we want them to and need them to. That to me is a dangerous assumption. So, we do need to be devoting some attention to those crops as well because they\u2019re disproportionately I think important\u2013 particularly to women, to children because of the supply of micronutrients and very often grown in household gardens.\nBARBARA STINSON: Well, thank you so much. I know everyone appreciates hearing not only your in-depth scientific experience that you bring but that broad policy and diplomatic role that you\u2019ll have in your position. We\u2019re coming up to COP 27. Tell us a little bit about the United States \u2013 not an official position but really what do you\u2013 what are you expecting coming up next month.\nDR. FOWLER: Well, I think COP 27 offers all of us an enormous opportunity to look at the question of crop adaptation\u2013 agricultural systems adaptation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that agriculture hasn\u2019t been let\u2019s say given its due at many of the previous cops, but now here we are. And I think we really have to take advantage of this because frankly, if our agricultural systems don\u2019t adapt to climate change, if our crops don\u2019t adapt to climate change, our crops being on the front lines, if they don\u2019t adapt to climate change, then neither will we.\nAnd so all of our hopes and dreams if you\u2019re an environmentalist or whatever, we\u2019ll, really go down the tubes if we don\u2019t have a successful agricultural system. At the end of the day, we all know that people will do what they need to do to try to feed themselves and their families. And there are many studies out there that will tell you that low productivity agricultural systems lead to environmental degradation.\nIt was only the middle of the 1980s when we saw quite a historic transformation. In the middle of the 1980s for the first time in human history that we were producing more food, the incremental amounts that we were producing every year came from intensification of Agriculture rather than cutting down trees and expanding our croplands. Do we want to go back to what has been the most historically prominent way of increasing food production, which is to cut down more trees and expand cropland or are we satisfied with the route that we\u2019re on now, which is to make better use of the resources that we already have? And I think that\u2019s a message that needs to get out at COP 27.\nBARBARA STINSON: Food productivity over just flat food production.\nDR. FOWLER: Yeah.\nBARBARA STINSON: Well, thank you so much for all of these perspectives. I want to connect part of what you\u2019re talking about with regard to adaptation and the mitigation opportunities within agriculture to the work that Cynthia Rosenzweig is doing and the sessions that we\u2019ll have tomorrow to really explore that the assessment potential of the models that are being used worldwide already. And I just\u2013 I want to thank you for rooting us in history in this conversation.\nI know you\u2019ve laid out some themes that we\u2019ll draw on throughout the discussion. So, thank you so much for your time today and for being with us. And you\u2019re here with us throughout the week, I think.\nDR. FOWLER: I am.\nBARBARA STINSON: I appreciate that.\nDR.

highlighting the ESMA Site Museum in Buenos Aires and its importance to the process of memory, truth, and justice in Argentina.\u00a0 I want to thank Ambassador Arguello for this invitation and the dedication of the Embassy of Argentina staff.\nThe United States applauds Argentina\u2019s recognition of the atrocities that took place during its last military dictatorship.\u00a0 We understand that confronting a painful past is a difficult process but one that is critical to address the need for justice and reconciliation.\u00a0 The steps Argentina has taken in this regard, including criminal trials of former members of the military, demonstrate how far your country has come.\u00a0 Steps to address the human rights violations of the past, in combination with all the complementary work that has been done over the years to seek justice for victims and survivors, demonstrate the unrelenting courage and strength of the Argentinian people and their commitment to human rights.\nBeing a present-day champion of human rights requires addressing the human rights violations of the past.\u00a0 In the case of the ESMA premises, this means acknowledging the horrific acts that were perpetrated there and honoring the memory of the individuals who were kidnapped, tortured, and disappeared, as well as the countless children who were \u201cstolen.\u201d\u00a0 By sensitively preserving the site as a memorial to those individuals, your government is bearing witness to human rights violations and condemning the acts that were committed there.\nI want to applaud the cooperation between the Government of Argentina and Argentine civil society on the ESMA project.\u00a0 The ESMA memorial and what it represents would not have been possible without the work of groups like the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who kept pressure on previous administrations to prioritize transparency and justice for the victims.\nHonoring the memory of those who suffered unspeakable abuses and those who were disappeared not only provides a measure of justice to their loved ones but serves as reminder to future generations that human rights and democracy must remain at the core of our two countries\u2019 domestic politics and foreign policy.\u00a0 It is in this spirit that we look forward to further cooperation in our multilateral initiatives to prioritize human rights in the western hemisphere and throughout the world, in the OAS, the Human Rights Council, and beyond.\nThe United States and Argentina, of course, already work closely on many shared values \u2013 transparency, justice, human rights, and democracy.\u00a0 Our partnership to promote and protect the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons, strengthen worker rights in global supply chains, combat antisemitism and promote racial equity, and support transitional justice and accountability is extremely important not only for Argentina but also for the world.\u00a0 Our human rights collaboration has shined a light on violations occurring in Syria, Ukraine, and Sri Lanka, to name a few, and it serves as an example to every country on what upholding universal human rights standards and the tenets of the UN Charter are all about.\nI would also like to commend Argentina for your commitment to inclusive democracy where all individuals are valued, respected and included in the governing process.\u00a0 Throughout this Summit for Democracy Year of Action, I encourage us to remain focused on ensuring that our democracies deliver for all of our people, and we welcome Argentina\u2019s leadership in this regard.\nAmbassador Arguello, in visiting this space you and your staff have created here, and in reflecting on the abuses suffered by thousands of men, women and children at the former ESMA site in Buenos Aires, I think once more of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo\u2014the \u201cAbuelas\u201d\u2014who reminded us that it is our duty to keep the memory, to keep talking tirelessly, to clarify and spread the truth, and to enlighten the minds of those who still refuse to understand.\nAmbassador, thank you once again for inviting me to be present at the dedication of this powerful and moving memorial space.\n\n"}, {"url":

"speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Hoover Institution", "location": "Stanford University, Stanford, California", "date": "October 17, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY MATTIS: Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s event, a conversation between former Secretary of State Dr. Condoleezza Rice and our current Secretary of State Tony Blinken. At a time when America is navigating its role in a changing world, today\u2019s talk in the finest tradition of the great university where we meet offers a unique opportunity to delve into important issues.\nI\u2019m Jim Mattis, a Fellow here at Hoover, where we seek to improve the human condition by advancing ideas that promote economic opportunity while safeguarding peace. Thanks to their record of devoted service to our nation, little introduction is needed for these two patriots. America is one great, big, promising, exasperating, inspiring, and vexing experiment with all the political volatility inherent to a free and open society.\nAdmired leadership in our republic calls for certain characteristics: first, a humble awareness of each generation\u2019s responsibility to improve on this experiment in forming a more perfect union; and second, competence. The two citizens on this stage are exemplars of both characteristics. Dr. Rice\u2019s contribution over many years of leadership cannot be summed up in a few words. Suffice that through merit, conviction, and a keen perceptiveness of the world we must live in, she rose to the apex of our government, ultimately splitting eight years of leadership between service as our National Security Advisor and as our 66th Secretary of State. We\u2019re proud to call her boss and coach of the Hoover team.\nSecretary Blinken has also accumulated a lengthy portfolio of foreign affairs experience before becoming our Secretary of State. It wasn\u2019t long after graduation from Harvard and Columbia that he entered government service, ultimately serving as the Deputy National Security Advisor and Deputy Secretary of State following his time on Capitol Hill, where he served as the staff director for the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee.\nIn a recent talk with graduates, he suggested that if they\u2019re going to spend a lot of their lives at work, then they should work at something they love. Our nation is fortunate that both these leaders devote their best efforts to something they love, and that is America. In so doing, their leadership by example reminds each of us that government service in a democracy is both privilege and responsibility. As problem solvers during these tumultuous years, their leadership forged trust while navigating maddeningly complex issues. Holding our values foremost, they have dealt pragmatically with a swiftly changing world filled by the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nThey have done so while listening and maintaining respect for those who disagreed with them, strengthening a necessary attribute for leadership in a democracy. Today\u2019s discussion will focus on the evolution and importance of technology, diplomacy, and national security \u2013 familiar topics here in Silicon Valley and highly relevant across our nation and round the world.\nHoover Institution was established to advance the principles of freedom. We ask bold questions and propose solutions to help guide American policy at home and abroad. In that spirit and consistent with Stanford\u2019s role of promoting the free competition of ideas, let\u2019s get started. First a conversation, then Q&A. Again, please give a hearty welcome to Secretaries Blinken and Rice. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY RICE: Well, thank you very much. But before we get started, I just have to say that that gentleman, Secretary Mattis, served as our Secretary of Defense but also many years of service as a Marine, something also carried by a great patron of this place, George Shultz. And so I\u2019d like you to give Secretary Mattis a hand, please. (Applause.)\nWelcome. Welcome to Stanford. Welcome to Hoover. Welcome to the Silicon Valley.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It\u2019s wonderful to be back. Thank you.\nSECRETARY RICE: And it\u2019s probably nice to be here, right?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: There\u2019s something about occasionally getting out of Washington that isn\u2019t a bad thing. (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah, it\u2019s a good thing. A good thing, right. (Laughter.)\nWell, we\u2019re going to have a conversation and then we will open for a few questions and answers. I\u2019m still a professor; I will call on somebody if nobody raises their hand \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 so get ready with your questions.\nYou\u2019ve just had a pretty momentous week, and I don\u2019t just mean what\u2019s going on in the world, but I mean the release of the National Security Strategy. And for those who don\u2019t fully follow these things, I think the National Security Strategy is an opportunity for the President to really ask his team: What should we be doing now to prepare for a better future? And the National Security Strategy has a number of elements that I\u2019d like you to speak to, and I\u2019m going to start with one that\u2019s kind of near and dear to the heart of every secretary of state probably going back to our long-long-time predecessor Thomas Jefferson. In case you didn\u2019t know it, he was the first secretary of state.\nBut you start with talking about American values but also the competition between autocracy and democracy. Can you expand a little bit on how you think about this moment? The United States has had many competitors across its history, but this particular moment, how do you think about this big issue?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, first let me just say how wonderful it is to be back at Stanford, to be with my friend Dr. Rice. Jim, I\u2019ve been an admirer of yours and your leadership for many, many years, and today you again reaffirmed why you have such a strong, powerful, eloquent voice. It\u2019s great to be with you. Thank you.\nAnd first of all, I\u2019m wondering: Do you have classes? (Laughter.) What \u2013 are you getting credit? (Laughter.)\nOne of the things that I think is almost visceral to us right now is that we\u2019re at an inflection point. And to put it in broad perspective, the post Cold War era is over and there is now an intense competition underway to shape what comes next. That\u2019s the moment we think that we\u2019re living in.\nPart of this is the renewed but also new great power competition, and that\u2019s very much at the heart of the strategy. Part of this is trying to figure out ways, and in ways that we haven \u2018t before, how to solve some really big challenges that are actually having a direct impact on the lives of our people, whether it is global health \u2013 and we\u2019ve been living through COVID \u2013 whether it\u2019s the impact of climate change, whether it\u2019s just the role of all of the emerging technologies, so many of them coming from here, that are shaping our lives. All of that is reflected in the strategy.\nNow, this is \u2013 Dr. Rice and I both worked on a few of these in our time. Rarely have so many labored for so long \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: And you can drop the Dr. Rice if you \u2013 right, right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. But rarely \u2013 I think we would both say rarely have so many in government worked for so long on something read by so few. (Laughter.) But having said that, it is an important document because it does try to give coherence to what we\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s important across the government so that all of the different agencies and departments are kind of working off of the same blueprint, and internationally so that both friend and foe alike have a good idea about what we\u2019re all about, why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing, why we\u2019re saying what we\u2019re saying.\nSECRETARY RICE: You talked about the great power rivalry, and this is something that I don\u2019t think we really ever thought we would see again after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But indeed it has come back and it\u2019s come back with force, and I\u2019d like you to address the two big rivals.\nThe National Security Strategy talks about restraining Russia and outcompeting China, and that\u2019s two very different ways to think about the great powers. So \u2013 and perhaps you want to weave a little bit of Ukraine into the Russia story, but can you start with restraining Russia \u2013 some would say a declining power in the great power competition, but one that is on the front pages now every day?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think declining power is probably a fair assessment, but one that has an enormous capacity if it chooses to use it to do damage, to be a disrupter. And of course, we see that front and center on our front pages every day in Ukraine.\nWhen we started out \u2013 and again, we\u2019ve both been dealing with this for a long time, and Condi knows more \u2013 has in a sense forgotten more about Russia than I\u2019ll know for many years of working these issues. I think many administrations have come in with the hope that we might have a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia precisely because we have so many big things that we want to be working on that go to the betterment of the lives of our people and people around the world.\nHowever, Russia \u2013 especially under President Putin \u2013 is a major disrupter and one that can make tremendous trouble. We see that in Ukraine. But we see it in its basic opposition and Putin\u2019s basic opposition to the order that emerged after two World Wars and then after the Cold War with a basic set of rules and principles that we thought were necessary to try to help keep international peace and security.\nThis is in direct opposition to what President Putin is trying to do in reconstituting \u2013 take your pick \u2013 a Russian empire or a Soviet one. And it\u2019s manifesting itself in the actions he\u2019s taken. We\u2019ve seen this play out over the last almost decade now. But for us \u2013 and I\u2019ll just say this very briefly \u2013 the reason there\u2019s so much focus on Ukraine is twofold. One is Ukraine itself. I think it bothers all of us profoundly when one country tries to lord it over another, when it tries to assert a world in which might makes right, in which it changes borders by force, in which it tries to subjugate another country to its will. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\nBut what\u2019s also going in this: It\u2019s not only an aggression against Ukraine. It is an aggression against the basic principles that are embodied in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a whole series of norms and rules that many generations labored to build. And are they perfect? Far from it. Have we made many mistakes both in designing them and in their application? Yes. But fundamentally they have helped make sure that we didn\u2019t have another global conflict after two world wars. And what Russia is doing, what Putin is doing, is in direct opposition to those.\nSECRETARY RICE: It\u2019s not your job exclusively, but there are Americans who say: Why Ukraine? Why not Peoria or Des Moines? And you just talked about the rules-based order. Can you sharpen it for Americans as to why this conflict is so important? Because this may go on a while, and we may have to sustain American support and therefore democratic support for a long time.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: At least from my perspective, if we and others are not standing up for these basic understandings, these basic rules, the idea that countries\u2019 independence should be respected, its territorial integrity should be respected, not changed by force; if we don\u2019t stand up for that \u2013 and we can do that in a variety of ways, which we can come to \u2013 if we don\u2019t stand up to that where it\u2019s being challenged, then the risk you have is opening a Pandora\u2019s box, where aggressors \u2013 not just in Europe, not just Russia \u2013 will take a lesson and say: I can act with impunity; I can do this. And that\u2019s going to stir up conflicts in many parts of the world.\nAnd the one thing we know from history is that inevitably, one way or another, this pulls us in. And if we can do whatever we can to prevent rather than having to respond and to make sure that some of these rules are upheld \u2013 even as we try to modernize them even as we try to make sure that they reflect the world that we\u2019re living in, not just the world that they were written in, which in many cases was 70 years ago \u2013 I think it\u2019s clearly in our interest to do that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to show in Ukraine.\nSECRETARY RICE: Right. Let\u2019s talk about the other great power. I\u2019ll come to a regional power in a moment, but let\u2019s talk about the great power, China. Big party congress going on. Lots at stake. Xi Jinping is likely to be coronated for his third term. And he\u2019s been a little bit of a different Chinese leader. It used to be said of Chinese leaders, when I was there \u2013 Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin before him \u2013 \u201chide and bide.\u201d Just keep developing China \u2013 the Chinese would always say, \u201cOh, we\u2019re just a developing country; we don\u2019t really do foreign policy.\u201d\nWell, Xi Jinping has a quite different view of China\u2019s role. And 30-plus years of kind of a integrationist narrative about China seems to be coming apart. You\u2019ve called it \u201coutcompeting\u201d China, which I think is an interesting concept. So talk about China and the United States in this regard.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, you\u2019re exactly right. We\u2019ve seen a very different China emerge in recent years under Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership. It is more repressive at home, it\u2019s more aggressive abroad, and in many instances that poses a challenge to our own interests, as well as to our own values. But I also think it\u2019s important not to reduce this to a bumper sticker. This relationship is among the most consequential that we have. It\u2019s among the most challenging we have. It\u2019s among the most complicated that we have. And what we\u2019ve seen in recent years is the emergence of \u2013 or clearly adversarial aspects to the relationship; for sure \u2013 and I\u2019ll come back to it quickly \u2013 competitive aspects; but there also remain cooperative aspects. And we can\u2019t lose sight of those, because some of the really big problems that we have to find ways to solve are a lot harder to solve if the United States and China are not actually engaged in trying to solve them: climate, global health, et cetera.\nBut the competitive aspect is front and center, because this is, as I suggested, at least from our perspective, a competition to shape what comes next after this post-Cold War period. What does it look like? Whose values are going to be reflected in what we do? And from our perspective at least, we have a basic choice, because we find \u2013 and I think this has been evident over the \u2013 especially over the period since the Second World War \u2013 the world doesn\u2019t organize itself. And for the United States, the choice is this: If we\u2019re not playing a part in the organizing, if we\u2019re not taking a leadership role in that, then one of two things \u2013 either someone else is, and it may well be China, and there, again, probably not in a way that fully reflects our interests and values; or maybe just as bad, no one\u2019s doing it, and then you tend to have vaccums that get filled with bad things before they get filled with good things.\nSo we have an interest in engaging, we have an interest in leading, and we have an interest in making sure that, to the extent we\u2019re in competition over what this new thing looks like, we are bringing everything to the table. In my own judgment, China also wants an order, but it\u2019s a profoundly illiberal order. The order that we seek \u2013 again, imperfectly \u2013 is a more liberal one, and that\u2019s what that competition is about.\nSECRETARY RICE: I\u2019m going to come back to how we do this, because you talk a lot about investing in our own strengths \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah.\nSECRETARY RICE: \u2014 but I want to stay for a moment on the relationship with China. You gave a very good speech a few months ago in which you talked about \u2013 I\u2019d call it a rather nuanced approach to China. As you\u2019ve said, that there\u2019s some areas of conflict, some areas of competition, and some areas of cooperation. Pretty quickly, the Chinese came out and said: not gonna happen \u2013 let me put it that way \u2013 because we can\u2019t delink these things. Do you have some hope that there might still be room? Maybe after the party congress is over, maybe after our own version of the party congress, the midterms, are over \u2013 then would there be room, and where would you see those potential areas of cooperation with China?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: The world fundamentally expects this of us, so whether China wants to find ways to cooperate or not on particularly climate, global health, maybe counternarcotics, even if they don\u2019t want to, there\u2019s a huge demand signal from the world. They expect us to try to find ways to advance these issues, and if we can, together, because it\u2019s affecting them as well as us.\nWe know we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with climate as we should if China is not part of the picture. It\u2019s going to have to decide; we can\u2019t decide for it. It has to decide whether it\u2019s in its interests, but it\u2019s also getting pressure from others around the world to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.\nSame thing on global health. And this is not about pointing fingers for the pandemic \u2013 it\u2019s about figuring out how do we build a more secure global health system so that this doesn\u2019t happen again. China needs to be part of that answer. But it\u2019s going to have to judge for itself whether, in its relationship with us, it finds ways to pursue cooperation, whether it just has to be responsive to demand signals that it\u2019s getting from countries around the world to be a positive actor, not a negative actor, on issues that concern them \u2013 not just China, not just the United States.\nSECRETARY RICE: We had reasonable cooperation at one time on another troublesome part of the world, North Korea. Obviously, it\u2019s been in the news again recently. Any thoughts on whether or not that scenario \u2013 it\u2019s really nonproliferation. Do you really want nuclear weapons in the hands of, shall we say, troublesome regimes like the North Koreans?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: This has been a challenge going back every administration I think we were each involved in, in one way or another, and one that has manifestly not gotten better over the years. I think from the leadership\u2019s perspective in North Korea, part of what we\u2019re seeing is it doesn\u2019t like to be ignored.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And so when the world is focused elsewhere, this is a reminder that: We\u2019re still here. We\u2019re still a problem. You have to deal with it.\nBut there\u2019s something else going on as well. Over the last months, going back about a year, we have significantly increased our own work with our allies and partners in the region \u2013 South Korea, Japan \u2013 both on a bilateral basis where we\u2019ve, for example, renewed exercises that we\u2019d had for years that were put in abeyance a few years ago \u2013 we brought them back, military exercises, to make sure that we could defend and hopefully deter any kind of North Korean aggression \u2013 as well as work that\u2019s being done now in ways that it hadn\u2019t been in recent years among the United States, Japan, Korea together, which has lots of benefits, including bringing Korea and Japan closer together. I think that Kim Jong-un saw that and didn\u2019t like it, and it\u2019s a response to that.\nWe\u2019ve taken a variety of actions, including at the United Nations, including strengthening even more our defense and deterrence, but it is an ongoing problem. And it does go, Condi, to exactly what you\u2019re talking about, which are concerns about broader proliferation. At the end of the day, one of the most important and powerful things about trying to continue to advance nonproliferation, preventing the spread of weapons, as well as arms control ourselves and being responsible actors under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, is making sure that we don\u2019t have a world where a whole variety of countries conclude that they\u2019re going to be better off if they acquire nuclear weapons that they don\u2019t have. And we know that that\u2019s a world that\u2019s going to be even more fraught. So we have to find ways to reinforce these norms, these rules, these standards that we\u2019ve signed on to and that need our engagement.\nSECRETARY RICE: I\u2019m going to come to technology in just a moment, I promise you, but I will get lots of messages that say you didn\u2019t ask him about Iran. Do you want to say just a word about that situation? It\u2019s extraordinary moments these days.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What we\u2019re seeing is \u2013 really is remarkable. And it starts with the incredible courage of very young people, especially women and girls, who are standing up for their most basic rights, their most fundamental freedoms, at extraordinary personal risk. And of course, we saw the prominent deaths of young women that led to this.\nBut what\u2019s powerful about it is that this is \u2013 this is grassroots, this is bottom up. This is a reflection of huge frustration and huge anger that so many in Iranian society have toward the direction of their country and toward their leadership, and they\u2019re demanding change. This is not made in the U.S.A.; it\u2019s not made anywhere else. To the extent that leaders in Iran try to point the fingers and somehow blame us, they are profoundly misreading and misunderstanding their own people and their own country, and that\u2019s going to be to their detriment.\nWhat can we do? First, we can stand and speak in solidarity with those who are simply trying to stand up for their own rights. Second, we can look at the different actors in Iran who are denying those rights and do what we can to penalize them for their actions. So we, for example, had sanctions that we put forward on the so-called morality police. And then maybe most important, and this goes directly in many ways to this community, we want to make sure that we are doing nothing that gets in the way of making sure that Iranians have the ability to the greatest extent possible of communicating with each other and connecting to the outside world, and that comes with technology. So we\u2019ve issued some licenses to make sure that we\u2019re not doing that, that people don\u2019t feel that our sanctions prohibit them from getting the technology that Iranians need to communicate with each other and with the world to the Iranian people.\nSECRETARY RICE: A little bit more activist this time than in 2012?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Each period\u2019s a little bit different.\nSECRETARY RICE: A little different, yeah. Right?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And I think \u2013 I think our voice has been very clear \u2013 not just our voice, our actions. And not just ours, countries around the world. But fundamentally, this is about the Iranian people. It\u2019s about their country. It\u2019s about their future. They will decide it. But we want to demonstrate in both practical as well as rhetorical ways our solidarity with them in this moment.\nSECRETARY RICE: So you\u2019re sitting at Stanford University in the middle of Silicon Valley. A long, long history between this place and the valley. And you are seeing and talking to the people who are really leading the technology revolutions. It goes back a long way here.\nSo in 2007 when I was secretary, I invited the then-Foreign Minister of Australia Alexander Downer here, and we have a little trip. And I got to \u2013 got to drive an experimental car called a Tesla. (Laughter.) Alexander wouldn\u2019t get in it. He wasn\u2019t sure that he wanted \u2013 well, I think it was probably the Australian secret service that didn\u2019t want him in an experimental car. But in any case, that\u2019s now a household name, maybe giving us answers to how to think about electric vehicles and climate change and the like.\nBut it says something very important about another part of the National Security Strategy, which it\u2019s \u2013 which says investing in our strengths. Very often, we get into what I call authoritarian envy. They build great airports. Democracy is so messy. But we forget that innovation has been from a place, the United States of America, that is the freest and most open. And so talk about investing in those strengths, protecting those strengths, and how that plays into the diplomacy that we must do but also the national security that we must achieve.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It\u2019s quite simply foundational, and let me say a couple of things about this. First, we go back to this proposition that we\u2019re in a moment of intense competition to shape what comes next. Technology, innovation, entrepreneurship \u2013 they are at the heart of that. This is how we are going to retool economies for the future. This is how we\u2019re going to modernize militaries as necessary. This is, through technology, how we are quite literally reshaping people\u2019s lives.\nAnd so it goes fundamentally to our national strength, but it also goes to a positive vision for the future that can be incredibly attractive for the United States around the world. Because as the technologies that are developed here \u2013 and I was just at the SLAC this morning, which is extraordinary, even for someone who probably understood about 1 percent of what I was hearing \u2013 this really does go to America\u2019s most positive role in the world.\nAs we\u2019re inventing; as you\u2019re inventing new technologies that are going to make sure that we can overcome disease and that we can actually strengthen global health and make sure that we don\u2019t have a repeat of COVID-19; as you\u2019re finding ways to make sure that we have sustainable, healthy food supplies for people around the world who so desperately need it and we\u2019re living in a moment of intense food insecurity; as you\u2019re looking at ways to make sure that we actually develop the technology to ensure an energy future that\u2019s not dependent on fossil fuels; as you\u2019re looking at ways to make sure we have secure supply chains for technology going forward and good jobs for the future; if we continue to get that right, if we continue to lead on that, if we continue to be seen as a beacon for the world, that goes directly to our standing around the world, our strength around the world in ways that I can\u2019t even begin to adequately describe.\nSo for us it starts with investing in ourselves. If you look at the so-called American Century, the second part of the 20th century, we were making these investments in ourselves in the \u201850s, the \u201860s and \u201870s in education, in research and development, in basic science, in our infrastructure. And we moved away from that. And it is not to say at all that government should be the one making all of these investments. We\u2019re never going to compete with, for example, a Chinese model that dedicates all of its state resources to a particular part of the economy, to a particular part of the world. But what we can do and do more effectively is making sure we\u2019re making these basic investments and then help catalyze, help facilitate, and ultimately help get out of the way for the private sector to really carry things forward.\nWe\u2019ve had two, at least from where I sit, enormous successes in the last few months, starting with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, a product of extraordinary work over several years by Republicans and Democrats alike to make sure that we were renewing these investments in ourselves. A lot of the focus on chips has rightly gone to renewing our ability to manufacture chips, semiconductors here in the United States, having subcontracted that out many years ago. But there are huge investments in basic science, basic research and development that are contained in the CHIPS and Science Act and the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which has the biggest commitment to dealing effectively with climate change in the history of our country, more than $350 billion. And again, a lot of that\u2019s going to investments in our own innovative capacity.\nSo I think, Condi, that is at the foundation of our strength, and it shows why the connection between what happens here and what happens around the world is stronger than it\u2019s ever been. Since we did CHIPS and since we did the IRA, I found the conversations that I\u2019m having with counterparts around the world have changed. There\u2019s now this view that, wait a minute, maybe America is getting its act together and this is something that we want to be part of.\nSECRETARY RICE: That\u2019s the positive side of it, of course, that we invest in ourselves. But there\u2019s also a question that\u2019s constantly on the table about how much we\u2019ve let out of the barn, so to speak, vis-\u00e0-vis the Chinese. They started down this road of indigenous development \u2013 in some ways hasn\u2019t gone all that well. We keep reading about problems in their own high-end chip development and the like.\nSo how do you see the balance between investing in what we do here and making sure that it doesn\u2019t escape to there? And it\u2019s particularly actually hard for a secretary of state, because one of the things that you don\u2019t want to do is make people declare loyalties. That\u2019s the quickest way to lose friends, to say you either choose China or us. That doesn\u2019t work very well diplomatically.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We both know that very well.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yes, right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And what we\u2019ve been saying is this: We\u2019re not asking people to choose; we want to give you a choice. And that means we have to have something to put on the table. A big part of what we\u2019re trying to do besides the investment in ourselves, the other \u2013 the flip side of that is trying to get greater alignment with allies, with partners, with a whole variety of countries who might not even neatly fit into the ally or partner category but who have an interest in making sure that there\u2019s a basic understanding about the rules and that everyone plays by them. So we spent a lot of time trying to re-energize and revitalize \u2013 re-engage our alliances, our partnerships.\nWe\u2019ve also been inventing or energizing some new ones \u2013 new collections of countries that may be fit for purpose on specific issues; for example, making sure we have resilient supply chains, making sure that we\u2019re on semiconductors investing together because so much of this work has to be collaborative as well, but also protecting. And in the case of the highest end semiconductors \u2013 as you know very well, there\u2019s only a small number of countries that either are manufacturing the highest end semiconductors or making the tools to manufacture the highest end semiconductors. We want to make sure that we keep those where they need to be. So this alignment with other countries trying to all move in the same direction, trying to work together on shaping some of the norms, the standards, the rules by which technology is used, that\u2019s also profoundly part of our national interest and our strength around the world.\nSECRETARY RICE: This is a question that could solicit a rather boring answer, but this is a university, so it\u2019s all right. We\u2019re accustomed to boring answers. (Laughter.) So you talked about standards. And maybe what\u2019s not fully understood is there are international efforts, international organizations where the standards are actually written \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: That\u2019s right.\nSECRETARY RICE: \u2014 for things like the internet, for questions about ships and supply chains. And the United States has always had a reputation of being fully uninterested \u2013 completely uninterested in sending people to these conferences at the assistant secretary level to spend two years, three years writing standards.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: That\u2019s right.\nSECRETARY RICE: Are you interested in this?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: I have to admit: I wasn\u2019t. All right. So now. (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Condi, I have walked out on standards in the biggest way, and we are flooding the zone for exactly that reason. Somewhere in the world on virtually any piece of technology that may be invented here, a group of people is sitting around a table in a windowless conference room writing the rules about how these are going to be used. And whoever writes the rules is going to have a powerful impact on the use of technology going forward.\nTo state the obvious, technology isn\u2019t inherently good or bad; the rules by which it\u2019s used might be. And we want to make sure that, for example, when it comes to protecting privacy, when it comes to upholding human rights, when it comes to advancing our own security, but also enhancing our competitiveness, the rules reflect that. And as the saying goes, if you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu. We want to make sure that we\u2019re at the table doing that. So, yeah, this is \u2013 sometimes it seems mind-numbing.\nWe spent a lot of time making sure \u2013 for example, there are competition for jobs in the international system, the folks who actually turn up at these meetings. Their elections, or their appointments, including in the entire United Nations system \u2013 we\u2019re spending a lot of time making sure that people that reflect our views and values are competing and winning those jobs. It really does make a difference. It does seem mind-numbing, but it\u2019s incredible how at the end of the day that\u2019s going to shape the world as well.\nSECRETARY RICE: I should probably go back and apologize to my under secretary for economics who used to try to get me to pay attention. All right. So you\u2019ve convinced me, because after all, this really is \u2013 when we talk about the competition and going back to autocracy versus democracy, if these are used in a certain way, they will be used in different ways by autocracies. So you take something like facial recognition, which might simply make it possible for you to get through an airport more quickly if you\u2019re in the United States, and China has a very different way. So I applaud your interest in this mind-numbing part of it.\nHow\u2019s it coming with others? You mentioned that we now are in the game, but when you think about particularly relations with the Europeans, we\u2019ve not always had the greatest alignment with what you think should be our closest allies on things like privacy and the like. So can you talk a little bit about relations with the Europeans? Has it been affected by the extraordinary cooperation that we\u2019re getting around Ukraine at this point? Someone said that Vladimir Putin had within a matter of months ended German pacifism and Swedish neutrality, which I think is probably true. But is it \u2013 is it having an effect?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It is remarkable the extent to which Putin has precipitated virtually everything he says he wants to prevent, particularly in terms of the so-called Western world sticking together and actually strengthening its cooperation across a whole variety of issues. I think we are making progress on this, because you\u2019re right, we have to find ways to make sure that on technology we are more aligned with other countries, starting in many cases with close partners in Europe as well as in Asia and then broadening out.\nWe have all of these different constellations, groupings, partnerships; one of them is something called the Technology and Trade Council with the European Union. And to put it in the simplest terms, this is a way of trying to make sure we\u2019re actually all rowing in the same direction when it comes to these norms, these rules, these standards, but also a whole variety of other things. If we have export controls on the highest end technology that we think should not wind up in the hands of some of our competitors, including China, if we\u2019re the only ones doing it and others are not abiding by them, then it\u2019s not going to work. So we have to try to get alignment there, and we are.\nIf we want to make sure that when we have concerns about some of the investment that\u2019s coming into our own countries that may be going to critical industries, critical companies, ones that are \u2013 that affect our security, we want to make sure that countries have the tools to look at those investments and decide whether this is something they want to go forward or not. We\u2019re working on those together with the European Union. We\u2019re thinking about critical supply chains and particularly for semiconductors. We\u2019ve seen what happened when these get disrupted. We\u2019re designing together an early warning system so that if we see a disruption anywhere in a supply chain for a critical component \u2013 first of all going to semiconductors but broadening out to other technologies \u2013 a flashing red light goes off and we can act on it together. All of these things are bringing us into closer alignment.\nNow, having said that, we have differences of view, differences of perspective \u2013 just as we have within our own country, because obviously we don\u2019t have a unified technology policy in our own country \u2013 that are always going to be there. We also have competition with some of our closest friends. We have \u2013 we\u2019re competing with Europeans, but we both fundamentally have the same interest in a system where people who play by the basic rules; where privacy is respected, even if we have different perspectives on the best way to do that; where our security is upheld, where human rights are respected, and where we can enhance our competitiveness. So the question is can we find ways to design those together, come into agreement. And then finally this: Competition when it\u2019s fair, when it\u2019s on a level playing field, when it\u2019s a race to the top, is good. That\u2019s what our own system is all about.\nSo for us it\u2019s not saying, oh, we have to avoid competition with friends and partners and allies; it\u2019s, on the contrary, making sure that together that competition is fair, it\u2019s transparent, it has the rights of workers in mind, it has the environment in mind, it has protection of intellectual property in mind. And if we do that, then countries that don\u2019t abide by the same way of doing things will have to decide are they going to get into the race to the top with us and raise their own standards, raise their own game \u2013 that\u2019s good for the world \u2013 or not.\nSECRETARY RICE: So let\u2019s go now from out there to Foggy Bottom, to the place that you work, the State Department, and talk a little bit about how all of this is affecting the State Department. Let me just say that when I left the State Department, the \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a smartphone for all intents and purposes, and I think we still \u2013 when I got there \u2013 still had Wang computers, believe it or not.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I remember those.\nSECRETARY RICE: You\u2019re all too young to even know what a Wang computer was, so it just gives you a sense. How in the world is a place that some 20 years ago still had Wang computers going to play in this world of technology? What does it mean for diplomacy and what does it mean for the State Department?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We have to be, and we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can be, to really be fit for the purpose of this moment and the moments to come. And we both worked on this and looked at this \u2013 anyone comes into these jobs and they\u2019re looking at their own department or agency and trying to figure out what do I need to change, what makes sense. And we spent some time doing that. And I think we came to a couple of conclusions that are reflected in what we\u2019re doing.\nFirst is you\u2019re only \u2013 you\u2019re in these jobs for a finite period of time. You\u2019re not going to \u2013 you\u2019re not going to change everything and probably you shouldn\u2019t, so you\u2019ve got to pick a handful of things that maybe you can make a difference on, get a start on, hopefully it continues when you\u2019re no longer there. That\u2019s one.\nSecond, one of the biggest challenges we face is that the things that are really having an impact on the lives of everyone in this room and all of our fellow citizens are not necessarily the issues that the State Department has been front and center on or has the expertise on. And again, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s health, whether it\u2019s food insecurity, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s economics, and whether it is cyberspace and digital policy, this has not been our bread and butter. And our bread and butter remains issues of war and peace, preventing conflict, making \u2013 helping to end conflict where we can, making sure that the American people are secure through diplomacy. But each of these issues is directly tied to that.\nSo what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019re engaged in modernizing the department to make sure that we\u2019re organized in a way and attract the talent in a way that allows us to play a leadership role on these issues. So, for example \u2013 and you\u2019ll \u2013 Condi, you\u2019ll appreciate this \u2013 I think land record speed, we established a new bureau for cyber and digital policy in about six months\u2019 time. And in fact, the ambassador running that, Nate Fick, who is actually a technologist (inaudible), is with us today. This is how we make sure that we have a place that the expertise can come to in the department and, ultimately, we can grow the expertise so that we can engage effectively on these issues.\nWe\u2019re in the process of doing something similar on global health. One of the most extraordinary achievements in American foreign policy over the last 25 years is something called PEPFAR, something that President Bush and Condi initiated to deal with the HIV/AIDS as well as malaria and tuberculosis crisis. I don\u2019t think there has been a program in the recent history of the United States Government that has saved more lives than PEPFAR. Now we have an opportunity to make sure that coming out of COVID and inspired by what was done with PEPFAR we build an even better platform for dealing with questions of global health, and we want to make sure that the department\u2019s organized to do that, that we attract the talent.\nJohn Kerry is leading extraordinary efforts on climate, but we want to make sure that those are institutionalized so that, again, we are a leader. Because here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and again, you all know this very well \u2013 just as if we\u2019re not leading and we\u2019re not engaged, we\u2019re going to have a problem because someone else will do it or no one will do it; if we\u2019re not finding new ways to cooperate, to collaborate, to work with other countries on these issues, we simply can\u2019t get them done. Climate \u2013 we\u2019re 15 percent or so of global emissions. By definition, even if we did everything right at home, we have to figure out a way to deal with the other 85 percent. That means, among other things, diplomacy to bring others along.\nWhen we\u2019re dealing with global health, when we\u2019re dealing with COVID-19, we know that we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain and that even, again, if we did everything right at home, if there\u2019s still an environment in which a new variant is going to pop up its head somewhere around the world and we\u2019re not able to deal with that, we\u2019re not going to be protecting our people. We have to find ways to collaborate and cooperate on that. And the technologies themselves, we are \u2013 have to be the ones who are helping to shape the way that they\u2019re used.\nAll of that is a function of diplomacy, and that\u2019s why I want to make sure that the department has the tools, has the organization, and has the talent to do it. So I\u2019m here to proselytize a little bit too. (Laughter.) We want you.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We need you at the department. This is an opportunity to pursue so many of the things that you\u2019ve been studying, working on, and are passionate about, but to do it \u2013 for those of you who are American \u2013 for your country. And for me, at least, I found that \u2013 and I \u2013 Condi, I suspect you feel the same way \u2013 there are so many extraordinary things you can do with your passions and your pursuits, and you can do them in a variety of different ways. And there are different rewards in the different ways that you do them. But at least for me, going to work every day literally and figuratively with the flag \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: \u2014 behind my back, I can\u2019t even put a value on that. So to those of you who have an interest in actually doing public service, even for a short period of time \u2013 and it seems like the State Department, what does that have to do with what I\u2019m interested in \u2013 it has everything to do with it because virtually everything that so many of you are working on here actually has a direct application to what we\u2019re trying to do around the world. And we hope that a few of you will join us.\nSECRETARY RICE: Well, I was going to give you an opportunity for a recruitment pitch. I think we just got it. (Laughter.) But I want to join in. I do think that there is nothing like public service. There\u2019s nothing like getting up in the morning and recognizing that you\u2019re going to work and try to do your very best for this extraordinary country that we inherited, that we continue to try to perfect. And I don\u2019t know about you, but whenever I would get off a plane that said \u201cThe United States of America,\u201d I thought it was a pretty special moment. And so for all of you, particularly those out there who might have some technical skills that might be needed, consider it. There\u2019s nothing quite like public service.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.\nSECRETARY RICE: With that, we\u2019re going to open up for some Q&A, and I know we\u2019ll get plenty, so I\u2019m going to take the first question right here on the front.\nQUESTION: Hello. Thank you so much for your inspiring remarks, Secretary Blinken. I\u2019m curious about what you see as the merits of diplomacy through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations when their efficacy in enforcing treaties and maintaining the international order have proved to be a little bit precarious.\nSECRETARY RICE: And are you a student? Just to \u2014\nQUESTION: Yes. My name\u2019s Mac. I\u2019m a senior majoring in political science.\nSECRETARY RICE: Great, great.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So thank you for the question, and it\u2019s one that we work on every single day. Look, these institutions, starting with the United Nations, are only as good or as bad as the countries that make up their membership. And so, yes, there are certain things that are inherent to the institutions themselves, and their leadership is really important. But fundamentally, the members have to help make them work or not, and you\u2019re absolutely right that we\u2019ve seen in a number of them dysfunctions of one kind or another. The UN Security Council because of this renewed great power competition is often at loggerheads and as a result often paralyzed.\nBut at the same time, incredibly powerful things still happen. Just to give you one recent example, when Russia proceeded with its purported annexation of territory in Ukraine, we went to the United Nations and we tried at the Security Council to get a resolution reflecting that. Of course, it was vetoed by Russia, although we got a strong vote among the permanent and non\u2011permanent members of the council. But then we went to the General Assembly, to the entire body of the United Nations, and an extraordinary thing happened: 143 countries in the world stood up in opposition to the annexation, to the sham referenda that Russia had used as justification for the purported annexations. And that in and of itself is a powerful indicator of where the world actually is now on Russia\u2019s aggression, something that the Russians have to factor into their thinking. So there is \u2013 there are things that you can still do and do effectively.\nThe other thing I\u2019d say is this: Day in, day out, one of the things that gets lost in the UN system is there are different agencies that have their challenges but are doing things that in their absence either we would have to do directly ourselves or no one would do. International peacekeeping has been very troubled, but there are places in the world where the so-called Blue Helmets are. There are roughly I think 100,000 forces that are \u2013 that make up UN peacekeeping. The United States has maybe a small handful. These are folks from other countries who are taking this on. If they weren\u2019t doing it, we might have to, or we\u2019d have to let these crises go in ways that would make them even worse. And on things like health, on the environment, on education, these agencies are really doing important things.\nOur job is to try to make them do it better, more efficiently, more effectively, cut through the bureaucracy, cut through the corruption that\u2019s sometimes there, and work to try to make them a little bit better. But it\u2019s a little bit like our own situation, which is there\u2019s a need to try to forge a more perfect union, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on every day. But here, again, if we\u2019re not actually there in the room, it\u2019s probably not going to happen, which is why showing up, being \u2013 participating in this, even with all the frustrations and even with all the criticism, I think makes a difference.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yes. Going to go to the students here \u2013 right here.\nQUESTION: Hi, Secretary Blinken. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. My name is Divya Ganesan, and I\u2019m an undergraduate student here studying computer science and political science. My question for you is that a lot of students in the room hope to be CEOs, software engineers, et cetera. How has diplomacy changed in a world where technology companies like Google and Facebook have both the network and soft power diplomacy of an actual country? And how should that affect the way that we care about diplomacy?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think the single biggest change that I\u2019ve seen in the 30 or so years that I\u2019ve been doing this is precisely in the technology and information space, because one of the things \u2013 to state the obvious \u2013 that\u2019s happened is that a whole series of new actors have been empowered with technology and the ability in one way or another to control information in ways that were not the case before.\nAnd for those of us in government, this has profound, profound effects. Among other things, it means that if we can\u2019t find a way to align with these different actors who wield so much power, then we know that the best-laid plans will easily be disrupted. So we have a profound stake in trying to make sure that to the best of our ability we\u2019re actually all rowing in the same direction. One of the reasons that not only am I here for a couple of days but we stood up this new bureau is to make sure that we have day-in, day-out connectivity with this entire ecosystem.\nAnd we\u2019re going to disagree, and there are disagreements between the public and the private. That\u2019s not going to go away. But where we can find ways to work through the disagreements and come out in a place where we\u2019re trying to move things in the same direction, that\u2019s going to make our life easier; it\u2019s going to make it easier for the policies that we pursue to actually take root and be implemented. We \u2013 it\u2019s in our self-interest, but it\u2019s also the right thing to do to make sure that on any given problem we have all of the different stakeholders in on the takeoff and not just try and bring them in on the landing because the plane\u2019s going to crash. But it\u2019s challenging work, and sometimes there\u2019s a different interest at stake, and we have to find ways to reconcile those. It\u2019s going to be very imperfect, but what I can tell you is it\u2019s more important than it\u2019s ever been. Otherwise, we\u2019re not going to make progress.\nSo \u2013 but here\u2019s the other thing I\u2019ve heard, and I\u2019ve been coming out here for a long time. My strong sense is that for the multiplicity of motivations that people have for the work that they\u2019re doing, so many people do want to be in one way or another part of something larger than themselves. They do want to be positive actors in solving problems that are afflicting our \u2013 all of our citizens. And this place, maybe more than any on Earth, has been such an incredibly positive actor in doing that.\nNow, there are other things that from some perspectives are less positive. But I can\u2019t think of how we answer this challenge now of renewed competition for how the world is going to look over the next 25, 50, or 100 years if we are not doing it together with what is at the heart of our national strength. And that is what\u2019s coming out of this part of our country.\nSECRETARY RICE: In the blue shirt over here. We\u2019ll take a couple quick \u2013 please keep it brief because I\u2019m going to try to take one more question.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. My name is Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00edz, and I\u2019m an undergraduate student studying political science and economics, and I\u2019m originally from Mexico. I would like to bring our attention to an area of the world that has not been discussed in this conversation, Latin America, my own home region, in which there is a lot going on \u2013 the rise of influence in China in investment in countries like Ecuador and Argentina, not to mention drug violence in my own home country of Mexico. Given how close geographically Latin America is to the United States, I wanted to know what the policy of the United States should be in this region in coming years.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Few countries have a greater impact on each other\u2019s day-in, day-out lives than the United States and Mexico. We know it. We feel it. We see it every single day. As it happens, we just had our senior Mexican counterparts in Washington just last week and where the Attorney General, the Secretary for Homeland Security Ali Mayorkas, myself, were working with them on something that we re-established, which is a security dialogue. How do we work together cooperatively to get a better grip on challenges to security in both of our countries that have been afflicting us for many years \u2013 drugs coming this way, guns going that way, money fueling the whole thing. And if we\u2019re not working on these things collaboratively, we\u2019re not going to succeed.\nAnd I think the collaboration now with Mexico has been quite extraordinary. Migration \u2013 we are living through a period that is \u2013 we throw around the word \u201chistoric.\u201d This is a historic period when it comes to migration. There are more people on the move around the planet, forcibly displaced in one way or another from their homes, than at any time in recorded history since we\u2019ve been keeping statistics on this \u2013 100 million people. We feel that profoundly in our own hemisphere. In the Americas, we have Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans all on the move for one reason or another. We\u2019ve been working very hard to create a shared sense of responsibility for dealing with migration in a safe, orderly, humane way. No single country can deal with this effectively alone. So that\u2019s very much part of our dialogue.\nBut there\u2019s also something that\u2019s very powerful, which is there\u2019s great potential in our own hemisphere to be an economic engine for growth for all of our countries; to have, for example, more integrated supply chains that make sure that we don\u2019t have the disruptions that we\u2019ve experienced on things like computer chips. The lithium that\u2019s going to go into electric vehicle batteries \u2013 well, for example, Mexico has a lot of that lithium. Finding ways to work on it together and then to have a resilient supply chain to get it to the places where the batteries are manufactured, that\u2019s something we\u2019re working on. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity that I think that\u2019s being felt in a more integrated North America \u2013 Mexico, the United States, Canada \u2013 and a more integrated hemisphere.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is this, and it also goes back to the migration challenge that we\u2019re facing. We have to find ways to be making smart investments in communities that people are leaving, because what we see is that the primary driver of migration in our own hemisphere \u2013 there are different ones, but the most fundamental one is a lack of basic opportunity. And if you don\u2019t have that, if you can\u2019t put bread on the table for your family, you\u2019re going to try to figure something else out.\nAnd it\u2019s not that people get up in the morning and say, gee, wouldn\u2019t it be fun today to put my life on the line, to put myself in the hands of a human trafficker, to leave my family behind, to leave my friends behind, to leave my culture and my language behind. It takes something very powerful to drive people to that decision. We have an ability to affect that decision over time in actually creating greater opportunity in different communities in our hemisphere. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on as well.\nBut the bottom line is this. Unless we\u2019re doing it collaboratively, unless we\u2019re working these issues together, it\u2019s not going to happen. So it goes back, Condi, to what you were saying about sitting in these \u2013 in these rooms with norms and standards. We\u2019re sitting in rooms throughout our hemisphere every day, engaged, sleeves rolled up, showing up, because that\u2019s ultimately how you build some trust, how you build some confidence, how you build actual partnership, and maybe start to get things done.\nBottom line is this. I think you\u2019re seeing governments throughout our hemisphere who are all facing the same challenge, which is: Can they deliver the basic things that their people need or aspire to? And if they can\u2019t they\u2019re going to be gone. We just went through a cycle where a lot of governments in the hemisphere that happened to be, for example, from the \u2013 from the right politically are out. We have new governments that are in that are more from the left. But it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s less about ideology and it\u2019s more about delivering for people. What the United States can offer, and it goes back to saying to people we\u2019re not demanding that you choose, it\u2019s we\u2019re offering you a choice, is: Can we have the right kind of partnerships that make sense to them and help them deliver?\nChina, last thing I\u2019ll mention on this. If China has extraordinary resources that it can decide as a government to put into investments in our own hemisphere or around the world, that\u2019s a source of strength. But if those investments are done in a way where they\u2019re piling debt on the countries that take them that it can\u2019t \u2013 that can\u2019t be repaid, where workers are coming in from China instead of using local workers to do the projects, or the rights of the workers themselves on the projects are not being respected, where there\u2019s no consideration for the environment and the impact of a project on the environment, where corruption is part and parcel of what\u2019s being done \u2013 that\u2019s going to alienate a lot of the recipients of Chinese largesse. If we\u2019re offering a different model that, as I said, is more of a race to the top, that\u2019s going to be very attractive.\nBut for us, we have to find ways to actually mobilize and catalyze the private sector. There\u2019s a lot of resource that sits on the sidelines. What government can do is be a catalyst, a guarantor, someone who says, yeah, this is a good place, this is a smart place, this is a reasonable place to make these kinds of investments. And then it becomes more of a win/win proposition for everyone.\nSECRETARY RICE: We\u2019ve come to the hour.\nQUESTION: Can (inaudible) about Taiwan?\nSECRETARY RICE: All right. All right, certainly. You want to say something quick about Taiwan?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Sure.\nSECRETARY RICE: All right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What would you like me to say? (Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Hi, Secretary. I\u2019m the MBA first student from GSB. I\u2019m just wondering \u2013 I know you are very time-limited \u2013 maybe say something quick about like what is United States attitude toward Taiwan?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah, sure.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah. Or not so quick.\nQUESTION: I mean, like a lot of officials have \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: Take your time to talk about Taiwan. We don\u2019t want to \u2013 yes \u2013 have an incident twice. Yes. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So one of the things that we\u2019ve worked on together in a variety of ways for years is our approach to Taiwan and the challenge that is inherent in dealing with the differences between Beijing and Taiwan. And a hallmark of the policy, going back decades through Republican and Democratic administrations, has been an insistence that the differences that exist need to be resolved peacefully. And actually, it\u2019s been, up until recently, incredibly successful. I think it\u2019s been managed well, in a way that has avoided conflict, that has also allowed people on Taiwan to really flourish, and benefit not just their own lives, but Taiwan has so much to contribute to the world that it\u2019s doing every single day.\nWhat\u2019s changed is this \u2013 it goes back to something that Condi was saying at the very beginning \u2013 there has been a change in the approach from Beijing toward Taiwan in recent years. And instead of sticking with the status quo that was established in a positive way, a fundamental decision that the status quo was no longer acceptable and that Beijing was determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline. And if peaceful means didn\u2019t work, then it would employ coercive means \u2013 and possibly, if coercive means don\u2019t work, maybe forceful means \u2013 to achieve its objectives. And that is what is profoundly disrupting the status quo and creating tremendous tensions.\nAnd this is a matter of concern not just to the United States because it\u2019s been a central component of managing the relationship with China for so long, but it\u2019s of profound concern to countries around the world. The amount of commercial traffic that goes through the straits every single day and has an impact on economies around the world is enormous. If that were to be disrupted as a result of a crisis, countries around world would suffer.\nThe last group of people I need to tell this is right here in this room. On semiconductors, if Taiwanese production were disrupted as a result of a crisis, you would have an economic crisis around the world. So there\u2019s a profound stake not just for us but for countries around the world in preserving peace and stability when it comes to Taiwan and the straits, and to making sure that the differences that exist are resolved peacefully. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been so engaged on this.\nI hope that Beijing will come back to a place where it actually sees the merits in making sure that differences are peacefully resolved, that it doesn\u2019t try to force things through coercion, and even worse, through force. We are determined to make good on our commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act and supporting their ability to defend themselves. We\u2019re also \u2013 we also remain fundamentally committed to the \u201cone China\u201d policy as well. That hasn\u2019t changed. That won\u2019t change. But at the heart of that was a commitment to resolve these differences peacefully, and if that\u2019s changing, then that does offer, unfortunately, prospects for very challenging situations going forward.\nSECRETARY RICE: Thank you. And with that, we have come to the end of the hour. If you will join me in please thanking Secretary Blinken. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-university-recruitment-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemarks at a University Recruitment Event\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Stanford University Encina Courtyard", "location": "Stanford, California", "date": "October 17, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you so much. First of all, I\u2019m so glad that you were able to get class outside today, and I\u2019m really happy to participate in that. We\u2019re here in part to ask you to think about the possibility of public service and including the possibility of service in the State Department. And I know that that may not be the first thing that comes to mind as you\u2019re thinking about what to do when you\u2019re at Stanford or at some point later in your career, but I\u2019d like to just take a moment (inaudible) suggest why actually this would be an extraordinary time to think about not just (inaudible) some kind of public service but actually coming to the State Department and working on what America is doing around the world.\nWe were talking about this, and some of you may have been there with Condoleezza Rice just a short while ago, and some of your in many cases classmates. This is in many ways an inflection point, an inflection point because the world that existed after the end of the Cold War \u2013 the post-Cold War world \u2013 has really come to an end. And there\u2019s an intense competition that\u2019s underway to shape what actually comes next, and a big part of that competition is going to be driven by technology.\nTechnology is going to be at the heart of retooling our economies for the future. It\u2019s going to be at the heart \u2013 in some cases of reforming our militaries to make them more effective and fit for purpose. It\u2019s at the heart of reshaping lives in our country and around the world. But maybe most important, it\u2019s at the heart of a positive vision that I think is responsive to the needs of people not just in our own country but around the world.\nThe things that so many of you are thinking about, are working on, studying \u2013 how to make sure that we can use technology to cure disease and to have a stronger global health system after COVID-19; how do we think about making sure that people can feed themselves sustainably at a time when we\u2019re dealing with profound food insecurity around the world; how we deal with climate change so that we have a planet that can power itself, but doing it in a way that\u2019s not dependent on fossil fuels; how do we think about supply chains to make sure that the things that people need in their daily lives are not disrupted because of disruptions to the supply chain; how do we think about good jobs for the future \u2013 all of that has technology, innovation, entrepreneurship at the heart of the answer. And all of that is what can \u2013 powerfully resonates around the world. And when we get it right, it directly goes to how the rest of the world sees us. I feel that every single day in the job that I\u2019m doing.\nSo at our own Department of State \u2013 and I want to kind of make in a minute \u2013 a lot of these issues have not necessarily been front and center in what we do or what we\u2019re seen to be doing. People think of the State Department, they think of diplomacy, they think of issues of war and peace and trying to make peace where there\u2019s war, trying to prevent conflict.\nBut we know that the big issues that are really having an impact on people\u2019s lives \u2013 whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s the impact of new technologies \u2013 each of those has to be front and center in what we do as well because there\u2019s not a solution set to any of those problems that does not involve, in some way or another, collaboration, cooperation, coordination with countries around the world, with companies around the world, with innovators around the world. And that\u2019s where the State Department comes in. That\u2019s where diplomacy comes in \u2013 trying to advance, to facilitate that cooperation and that coordination.\nWe were talking about this earlier: we\u2019re trying to solve the climate crisis. Even if we do everything right at home, if we\u2019re 15 percent of global emissions and we\u2019re not dealing with the other 85 percent, we don\u2019t solve the problem. Diplomacy is a big part of that. If we\u2019re dealing with COVID and trying to make sure that we don\u2019t have another pandemic, building a stronger global health system that\u2019s only going to be as strong as the weakest link in the chain \u2013 that\u2019s necessary. And again, even if we got everything right at home, if there\u2019s another outbreak of disease and there\u2019s a variant that undercuts what we\u2019re doing at home, we can\u2019t succeed.\nAnd all of these technologies that many of you are actually studying, working on, helping to develop, how they get used \u2013 the rules, the standards, the norms by which they\u2019re used, which are decided not necessarily in the United States but maybe in some windowless conference room around the world \u2013 that will decide if technology is used for good or for less good, whether privacy, whether security, whether human rights and our values, as well as our competitiveness is actually upheld.\nAnd again, that\u2019s exactly what diplomats are doing. We have a new bureau in our department for cyber and digital policy to make sure that we\u2019re organized in a way that allows us to really engage on these issues. And a big part of making sure that that works, as well as a new office we\u2019re standing up to deal with emerging technologies \u2013 everything from AI to quantum to bioengineering \u2013 that we have a lead role to play in making sure that the United States is well represented around the world.\nAnd that\u2019s where all of you come in. The very things that you\u2019re interested in, that you\u2019re passionate about, that you\u2019re working on, that you\u2019re studying, there\u2019s actually a way to pursue them as part of the State Department, and maybe spending a little bit of time of working in the public sector, in public service, and doing something that I\u2019ve found over 30 years has given tremendous meaning to my own life, and that\u2019s being able to go to work every day with an American flag behind my back either literally or figuratively. And for some of you, that may be an attractive proposition, even if it\u2019s only for a little bit of time.\nWe\u2019re finding new ways to bring those who are steeped on STEM into our department, and we can talk a little bit about that. But I really just wanted to encourage you to actually consider that, to think about that as an opportunity, whether it\u2019s in a few years; whether it\u2019s in 10 or 15 years. But we need you: we need the talent, we need the insight, and we especially need a new generation of people to look at these problems that are incredibly daunting, but that have solutions, and increasingly they\u2019ll have the solutions that you\u2019re finding and developing.\nSo with that, Nate, do you want to say a few words about what we\u2019re doing?\nAMBASSADOR FICK: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And thanks, everybody, for being here. It is \u2013 it\u2019s real treat for me to be back in Silicon Valley. As the dean mentioned, I built a business here and was an operating partner in a venture capital firm here for 10 years. I spent a lot of mornings running around The Dish, worried about raising money, and whether a (inaudible) feature would work, losing a customer, hiring a key person. And so it is terrific to be back here.\nI have now had a few weeks of experience building this new bureau at the State Department, and I\u2019ll tell you, there\u2019s one big point of commonality between what I\u2019m doing now and what I was doing before, building a tech business. Both the bureau and our company were what I called elevator assets organizations. At the end of the day, we had some computers, we had some chairs, but basically, all of our assets went down the elevator at night and went home. That\u2019s all we had. Human capital, people, it\u2019s all we had.\nAnd so the fundamental challenge in building either of these organizations, any organization, is finding the right people to come join the team. The Secretary mentioned getting in his conference rooms, right, and setting standards, kind of the unsexy work of moving the ball down the field. My first week on the job was doing exactly that. I got sworn in on a Thursday to get a passport on a Friday to go to Romania on a Saturday in order to spend the better part of a week meeting with delegations from countries around the world to persuade them to vote for an American candidate to be secretary general of the International Telecommunications Union, a standard-setting body that\u2019s been around since 1865. It was set up to make sure that European telegraphs could talk to American telegraphs, could talk to Asian telegraphs. And this stuff really matters. We may not think about it every day, but it really matters.\nAnd I got on the phone with my wife at the end of the first day and she said, \u201cSo how is it?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, the people are tremendous. The people are just incredible, and the sense of purpose is incredible.\u201d So I think that the \u2013 we need American companies building and scaling technology around the world in accordance with our values. And we need American diplomatic leadership on topics like setting the standards and the norms for tech also in accordance with our values.\nSo I think our invitation to you is something like the following: if you \u2013 as products of at least a few years in this place, if you really believe that the innovation economy is a wellspring of our attractiveness and economic health and national security as a nation, if you believe that; and if you believe in the intrinsic value of diplomacy, if you believe that talking about our differences is the most effective way to bridge them or resolve them; and if you believe that tech is the next frontier in diplomacy, just as it\u2019s the next frontier in every aspect of our lives \u2013 if you would believe those things, then we have a place for you. And I can say that with conviction because there was a place for me.\nI did not see myself five or seven or 10 years ago at the State Department. But I\u2019ll tell you, now, having spent a little bit of time in this great organization, it reminds me of a recruiting slogan the Marines used in the \u201990s when I graduated from college and joined the Marines. They said, \u201cWe never promised you a rose garden.\u201d The same is true at the State Department. There are things you can do coming out of Stanford where you\u2019re going to make more money and maybe you\u2019ll work easier hours. But I would challenge you to find something that will give you the same sense of purpose.\nThe Secretary has talked about the, I stand a little taller walking behind my desk with the American flag there, and I come through the turnstile every morning with a big grin on my face. And so whether it\u2019s four years of your career or 40 years of your career, please consider giving a portion of your time and your energy to public service because we need you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-slac-national-accelerator-laboratory/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemarks at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

(applause); and of course, our Secretary of State Antony Blinken (applause).\u00a0 I am Lee Satterfield, the assistant secretary of state for Educational and Cultural Affairs.\u00a0 Tonight\u2019s ceremony signifies much more than a signing ceremony.\u00a0 Tonight we celebrate the priority that Secretary Blinken places on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.\nThe State Department is elevating the Biden administration\u2019s engagement with the Hispanic community by signing this important MOU with HACU, the first time it\u2019s been signed by a secretary of state in two decades.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYesterday, Secretary Blinken said that President Biden\u2019s National Security Strategy lays out a vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous world, and a comprehensive plan to realize it.\u00a0 This MOU is an important step in that plan.\u00a0 The Biden administration want more members of the Hispanic community to be a part of America\u2019s diplomatic and development work.\u00a0 We want more opportunities for Hispanic students and scholars to study and research abroad.\u00a0 And we want more international students and scholars studying and researching at our Hispanic-serving institutions, because inclusion of every community strengthens our global competitiveness, security, and shared prosperity.\nNow please join me in welcoming Josue Barrera.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR BARRERA:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas noches.\u00a0\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0Buenas noches.\nMR BARRERA:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s my favorite part of any Hispanic event.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 My name is Josue Manuel Barrera, if you can try saying that, too.\u00a0 My HACU story started 16 years ago. \u00a0I was a second-year graduate student and teaching assistant studying public policy at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, an overwhelmingly Hispanic-serving institution recognized now for its positive impact in social mobility. \u00a0I helped coordinate the visit of a HACU representative to the university, and by the end of the visit, I added my name to the list of students interested in gaining experience at the federal level.\nSeveral months passed and I didn\u2019t give it much thought, and then a phone call. \u00a0The HACU representative on the other end of the line asked if I was interested in spending a semester in D.C. \u00a0If so, I had two days to decide and two weeks to prepare.\u00a0 So I sold my very cool 1988 Nissan Pathfinder, bought some horribly ill-fitting suits, and hopped on a plane to D.C. \u00a0When I called my mother know, I landed and everything was okay, and the first thing she asked us:\u00a0Cuando regresas \u2013\u00a0when are you coming back?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 To this day, I call, and the first thing she asks is: when are you coming back?\nThe phone call \u2013 back to the story \u2013 opened the doors for me to enter public service at the State Department and the opportunity to contribute to our nation in unique and meaningful ways.\u00a0 In the Bureau of Public Affairs \u2013 I see my first supervisor here \u2013 Western Hemisphere Affairs, Educational and Cultural Affairs (cheers) \u2013 wow, cool \u2013 and now Global Talent Management (cheers).\nIn 2019 just before the pandemic hit and the national dialogue on race escalated, my team began the effort to institutionalize what\u2019s now the Secretary\u2019s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.\u00a0 And I just returned to the department a few weeks ago after spending a year studying national security strategy with senior military officials.\u00a0\u00a0 My current focus is another of the Secretary\u2019s priorities: working to develop the department\u2019s first-ever strategic plan for retention.\nI will forever be grateful for that HACU phone call and the path is has led to.\u00a0 It\u2019s a call that I hope HACU can continue making for many students in the years to come.\nNow, he may not have been the person who made the call, but I know it was the work of the individual whom I\u2019m about to introduce that made it possible.\u00a0 Since 1996, he has been the driving force in building HACU and, to clarion call, effectively serving our nation\u2019s Hispanic-serving institutions, and positively affecting the education, careers, and lives of millions of Hispanic students throughout the United States.\nDr. Flores is a master architect and team builder within HACU, throughout the HSI community, across government, business and industry, and throughout U.S. society.\u00a0 I for one can most pleased that the department is continuing its collaboration with HACU.\u00a0 It\u2019s my pleasure to introduce to you President and CEO of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, Dr. Antonio Flores.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR FLORES:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0\nMR FLORES:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0 Thank you for those very kind words, Josue, and of course we\u2019re very proud of your career.\u00a0 He is obviously one of more than 15,000 placements that HACU has been able to over the years have with federal agencies of top-notch talent from our institutions.\u00a0 But\u00a0buenas tardes\u00a0and good evening.\nBefore I go on to my brief remarks, I want to acknowledge my colleagues who are here tonight because it\u2019s them who make everything happen in HACU.\u00a0 I just stay out of the way and they make it happen.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Dr. Lena Rodriguez, who is our senior VP for policy and government relations here in D.C., is here with us.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Ben Melano, senior executive director of the national internship program that we have at HACU.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We have a good friend, colleague, and president of Glendale Community College in Arizona, Dr. Terry Leyba Ruiz (applause) and Norma Jean Garcia, who is our executive director of communications in San Antonio.\u00a0 Thank you all for helping us.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSecretary Blinken, Assistant Secretary Satterfield (laughter), distinguished guests and friends, as we approach the end of Hispanic Heritage Month this weekend, and of course of the playoffs later in the month (laughter), it is only fitting that we do it with a homerun.\u00a0 And of course we are doing it in this magnificent venue, the Benjamin Franklin Room, under the seal of the United States of America, with the motto, \u201cE pluribus unum.\u201d\u00a0 And then that basically means, \u201cOut of many, one.\u201d\u00a0 And we gather to celebrate the historic signing of a comprehensive memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of State and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, HACU.\nHACU represents the 559 Hispanic-serving institutions, or HSIs, across the nation, and collectively these institutions serve 5.3 million college students from all walks of life, including 67 percent of the 3.8 million Hispanics in college today.\u00a0 HSIs are the backbone of Hispanic higher education and a major pillar of America\u2019s workforce development.\nThe MOU that we are about to sign will facilitate new opportunities for HSI students and graduates in the Foreign Service, in the civilian labor force of the State Department, as well as in study abroad programs and internships.\nMr. Secretary, on behalf of HACU and its nearly 600 member colleges and institutions across the country and its affiliated universities in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Spain, I thank you most sincerely for your foresight in signing this MOU, but also for your tireless leadership to promote America\u2019s values and democratic principles.\u00a0 I also would like to thank Assistant Secretary Satterfield for her invaluable support and guidance in the framing of the MOU, and Deputy Assistant Secretary Rosenzweig for his steadfast assistance to our HACU team under the leadership of Dr. Lena Rodriguez to bring us to this point.\nMr. Secretary, I am deeply honored and humbled by the opportunity to cosign this MOU with someone who personifies America\u2019s vision of a more peaceful and just world on behalf of President Biden.\u00a0 And I thank each and every one of you in the audience for joining us to celebrate the signing of this transformational MOU between the U.S. Department and \u2013 Department of State and HACU.\nThank you.\u00a0\u00a0Muchas gracias.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS GUZMAN:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas a todos.\u00a0 It is an absolute honor to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with all of you who care deeply about equal opportunity and work hard to support the Hispanic community.\u00a0 I am Susana Guzman.\u00a0 I am especially proud to stand here today as a first-generation American with a mother from Barranquilla, Colombia, and a father from Oriente, Cuba, who migrated to Miami, Florida in the \u201890s, and as a graduate of two Hispanic-serving institutions, Florida International University and Miami-Dade College.\u00a0 I know firsthand the life-changing opportunities that HSIs provide to their students.\nAs a beneficiary of Pell Grant scholarships and a scholarship that allowed me to study abroad, much like the State Department\u2019s Gilman scholarship which offers students like me international experiences, my experience informs the work that I do today as a program officer at the U.S. Department of State in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the Western Hemisphere Bureau to focus on inclusive education.\u00a0 I understand the importance of opportunities and of mentorship.\u00a0 In fact, it was during my internship in ECA in 2015 that I first aspired to be a civil servant after a day of shadowing our former assistant secretary, Evan Ryan, whom the Secretary knows very well.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We all have that in common, those of us that have spoken today, so we are honored to be here.\nSecretary Blinken was sworn in on January 2021, and since then he has worked to carry out President Biden\u2019s foreign policy agenda in a complex world.\u00a0 While doing so, Secretary Blinken has created and enacted policies that reflect his and the administration\u2019s belief in the paramount importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, integrating DEIA into all that we do, from our foreign policy to our exchange programming to our workplace.\u00a0 That makes me so proud to work here at the State Department.\u00a0\u00a0Muchas gracias, Mr. Secretary.\nCon mucho orgullo, with much pride, let\u2019s welcome our 71st Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good evening, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0 Welcome, welcome, welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 Welcome to the Benjamin Franklin Room.\u00a0 He\u2019s gazing at us right now.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I like to remind people that Benjamin Franklin was our first diplomat.\u00a0 He signed our first treaty.\u00a0 He charted the Gulf Stream.\u00a0 He helped pioneer electricity.\u00a0 He gave us our ethos of self-government.\u00a0 And virtually none of this did he do while sober, so \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what the lesson is, but I share it anyway.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSusana, thank you for the wonderful introduction, but thank you especially for your service here at the State Department.\u00a0 We are so proud and pleased to have you among us.\u00a0 You did a wonderful job.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd Dr. Flores, my thanks to you for your partnership and for your leadership of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\u00a0 I want to recognize also those at the State Department who have helped support and grow this partnership, including members of our employee affinity group, the Hispanic Employee Council of Foreign Affairs Agencies.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI am delighted to sign in a few moments this new memorandum of understanding during Hispanic Heritage Month, when we honor generations of Hispanic and Latino people who have served in every part of this department \u2013 from diplomats strengthening our alliances and partnerships, to development experts administering aid and expanding economic opportunity, to locally employed staff who are the lifeblood of every single embassy we have around the world and notably in our hemisphere, which I just spent some time last week in Colombia, in Chile and Peru, and saw the remarkable people that we have working with us in our embassies from those countries.\nBut it\u2019s also an opportunity to look ahead, to look ahead to the future of the department and how we can make it as diverse and inclusive as possible, because Susana is right: this has been at the heart of my mission since I\u2019ve been on this job.\nThis is not only a matter of doing the right thing, it\u2019s also doing the smart thing.\u00a0 And I know this every single day.\u00a0 We\u2019re operating in an extraordinarily diverse world.\u00a0 The greatest strength that we bring to the table is our own diversity.\u00a0 Our diversity makes us stronger.\u00a0 It makes us smarter.\u00a0 It makes is more creative.\u00a0 It brings different perspectives, different viewpoints, different experiences to every single problem we have before us.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t take advantage of that, we are quite simply tying our own hands behind our back.\u00a0 It makes no sense, and we are determined to make sure that we have a Department of State that truly reflects the country that it represents.\nToday, we\u2019re taking an important step in actually advancing this mission by reaffirming what has been a two-decades-long partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\u00a0 The institutions that make up HACU embody one of the best parts of our open, democratic society: the pursuit of knowledge, of education, of scholarship.\u00a0 Hispanic colleges and universities are home to researchers working to solve some of the most pressing challenges of our time that are going to affect the lives of millions of people, like developing innovative methods for removing carbon dioxide from atmosphere, finding new treatments for cancer.\u00a0 The institutions are training tomorrow\u2019s microbiologists, their labor economists, science teachers, psychologists, and yes, diplomats, among many other fields that are enriching our communities and also enriching our lives.\u00a0 And they foster a vibrant exchange of ideas not only among us but also across borders; for example, sponsoring students studying international business in Japan, sending students and faculty to learn about renewable energy in Costa Rica.\nThe MOU that we\u2019re signing this evening affirms a continued collaboration for the next five years.\u00a0 What does that mean?\u00a0 Well, it means that we\u2019ll keep working together to recruit students, to recruit faculty, to recruit staff from HACU colleges and universities to participate in our exchange programs around the world, like the Fulbright Program or the Benjamin Gilman International Scholarship.\u00a0 We will continue strengthening the pipeline from HACU institutions to careers in diplomacy, including through internship programs like the one, as we just heard, first brought Josue to the State Department.\u00a0 And by the way, my mom says the same thing to me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTo reach these goals, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with exchange program alumni, we\u2019ll promote participation in symposia and conferences, we will visit Hispanic-serving institutions.\nIf you look at it, there is real progress to show for our efforts over the last 20 years both within this department and beyond it.\u00a0 Since HACU and the department signed the first MOU together 20 years ago, the number of Hispanic and Latino employees at State has grown from 4 percent in 2001 to 8 percent of employees today.\u00a0 And broadly, between 2000 and 2019, the number of Hispanic and Latino students from the United States who\u2019ve studied abroad has nearly doubled.\nSo these are positive trends.\u00a0 They\u2019re good, but not good enough.\u00a0 We have work to do to make sure that this department and our programs look more like the country that we serve and that Hispanic and Latino students have the same access, the same opportunity, as their peers, whether in their studies, whether in academia, or for that matter anywhere in the world.\nAnd the truth is in neither of these categories does the representation of Hispanic and Latinos fully reflect their share of America\u2019s population.\u00a0 So that tells us that we have work to do and we are working to change that, led in part by Ambassador Bernicat who is here, who directs our work for us, recruitment and retention efforts, and Ambassador Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley.\u00a0 Gina, are you here tonight?\u00a0 Not sure if you are, but Gina is doing remarkable work.\u00a0 She is our first chief diversity and inclusion officer.\u00a0 I had the privilege of naming her to a job that we instituted, and she is helping to build a department that attracts but also retains a team that reflects our nation.\nOne of the things that we\u2019ve found over the years is even when we\u2019ve had some success in bringing under-represented parts of our country into the State Department, we don\u2019t always do such a good job in retaining them.\u00a0 And one of the things we\u2019re working on is making sure that we do, that we better understand why different groups may choose to leave and abandon an investment they had made early, and how we can continue to change and evolve our culture to make sure that it is the most welcoming place for everyone.\nOur collaboration with HACU will also continue to foster ties beyond the United States with students, with scholars, with communities across our hemisphere through our 100,000 Strong in the Americas Initiative.\u00a0 Some of you may be familiar with this.\u00a0 With this initiative, the State Department is working to expand study abroad opportunities for students across the Americas so that we can build stronger ties between our nations and spur inclusive economic growth for the entire region, from the bottom up and the middle out.\u00a0 One way we\u2019re doing this is by offering grants to universities to help them develop their own exchange programs.\nHACU institutions have been some of our biggest partners in this effort.\u00a0 If you go back to 2014, one-third of the grants that the State Department\u2019s 100,000 Strong in the Americas Innovation Fund has awarded have gone to teams that include at least one HACU institution.\u00a0 With these grants, Hispanic-serving institutions have forged strategic partnerships and relationships with partners across the Americas, hosted students from across the Western Hemisphere here in the United States.\nFor the participants, the ties that are formed with our nation through individual friendships, through areas of research, cultural and community connections, what we\u2019ve seen is they often last a lifetime.\u00a0 And in many ways, nothing better benefits our foreign policy and our place in the world than these relationships.\u00a0 These lasting connections, the affinities that they create, the understanding that they help to deepen \u2013 these matter.\nAnd one thing that\u2019s always fascinated me, and Assistant Secretary Satterfield who is leading our efforts knows this very well, if you go back and look at the history of our exchange programs in bringing students, young scholars, other young people from abroad to the United States, including from the Americas, what we\u2019ve found is this: we have a pretty good track record in identifying people who are going to go on and play incredibly meaningful roles in their own countries and in their societies.\nThrough the history of our exchange programs, we\u2019ve had more than 52 people who went on to win Nobel Prizes, 400 or so who became the presidents or prime ministers of their countries, thousands who became leaders in academia, research, the sciences, culture.\u00a0 And when you\u2019re building relationships with an extraordinary group of people at a young age, and they develop a real connection with the United States, there are few things that matter more in actually building very positive partnerships for people who are going to be leaders in their countries.\nSo this really matters to our foreign policy.\u00a0 It matters to our place in the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo simply put, it\u2019s my pleasure, Dr. Flores, to be here tonight, because we\u2019re grateful.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to HACU as a partner, and now we look forward to continuing our work together for many more years to come.\nWith that, we actually get down to the real business of the evening \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and that is signing the MOU.\u00a0 So Dr. Flores, please, join me.\nMR FLORES:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be effectively witnessed.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR FLORES:\u00a0\u00a0Very nice pen.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n(The MOU was signed.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It is now official.\u00a0 (Cheers and applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Thank you so much, and this concludes our program.\u00a0 Please enjoy your time this evening in the historic Diplomatic Reception Rooms where so much history, including tonight, has taken place.\u00a0 Thank you so much and have a good evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-a-joint-press-availability/"}, {"url":

"Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Loy Henderson Auditorium", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "October 13, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Welcome.\u00a0 Welcome to the State Department.\u00a0\u00a0Bienvenido, a todos y todas.\u00a0 Thank you so much for being here today.\nA year ago, we came together in Mexico City to launch the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities, and we set three primary goals together: to protect our people, to prevent transborder crime, and to pursue criminal networks.\u00a0 And what\u2019s so critical is we defined these goals together.\u00a0 They reflect a shared responsibility and a shared interest in working together to address challenges that neither one of our nations can adequately address alone.\nToday, we have an opportunity to assess the progress that we\u2019ve made on these interconnected goals, and to identify what more we can do to meet them.\nThe high-level group represented here \u2013 including the attorney general, including the Secretary of Homeland Security, including the administrator of USAID, Ambassador Salazar, other leading U.S. Government officials focused on anti-corruption, on drug policy, on public health \u2013 all of us together reflect the comprehensive approach that the United States is bringing to bear on this set of issues.\u00a0 And we can visibly see a similar commitment on the part of our Mexican counterparts.\nThat commitment is also evident in the unprecedented investments, the new legislation, the deepened coordination that we\u2019ve demonstrated in our first year of implementation.\nLast November, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes\u00a0$1.9 billion for six new construction and modernization projects on\u00a0the U.S. southern border that include enhanced security features.\nIn June, the President signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.\u00a0 This is the United States\u2019 first major gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years, and it makes straw purchases and the trafficking of firearms a federal crime, and that we\u2019ve been using to hold traffickers accountable.\nWe\u2019ve made considerable new investments in substance use prevention, treatment, recovery \u2013 both to reduce the ravages wrought by illicit drugs, and to reduce demand.\u00a0 This year, our Drug\u2011Free Communities Program has worked with 745 community coalitions in all 50 of our states to prevent youth substance use.\nHaving said that, we still have a lot of work to do.\nWe need to enhance our efforts to disrupt illicit fentanyl production and trafficking, and synthetic opioids more broadly.\u00a0 Last year, approximately 108,000 people died in the United States of overdoses, most from synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\u00a0 Synthetic opioids are taking a rising toll in Mexico, too \u2013 something we\u2019ve talked about in recent months.\nWe need to enhance our efforts to disrupt illicit weapons trafficking.\u00a0 Last year, more than 33,000 people in Mexico were killed in intentional homicides; more than two-thirds of those came from firearms.\nSo across these and so many security issues, the same truth holds: our ability to protect our people depends on working effectively together.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do today, from treating substance use as a public health concern, to dismantling the financial networks of transnational criminal organizations, to addressing the root causes that drive people to organized crime, including a lack of economic opportunity.\nMarcelo, I just want to say to you and to all of our colleagues here we are so grateful for the spirit of openness and cooperation that all of you continue to bring to this effort \u2013 in the days leading up to today, today, indeed every day.\u00a0 And that\u2019s happening not just among those at this table, but critically, throughout the working levels of our governments.\u00a0 We deeply, deeply value it; we deeply appreciate it, and we look forward to a frank, open, productive discussion today as we\u2019ve had in recent months.\nWith that, let me turn it over to the attorney general.\u00a0 Merrick.\nATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, Tony; Secretary Mayorkas, Ali; and to our esteemed friends from Mexico, Ale.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to see all of you again and to have this opportunity to reaffirm the central importance of the law enforcement partnership between our two countries.\nThe first framework goal that we will address today, protecting our people, is a thread that runs through everything we do.\u00a0 It is why we do this work.\u00a0 On behalf of the Department of Justice, our prosecutors, and each of our law enforcement components, including the DEA, ATF, FBI, and the United States Marshals Service, I want to thank the Government of Mexico for your continued partnership in our shared efforts to protect the people of both of our countries.\u00a0 I look forward to all of our discussions today and our continued work together.\nAli.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Ali?\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken and Attorney General Garland, for your remarks.\u00a0 Secretary Ebrard, Secretary Rodriguez, Attorney General Gertz, and all colleagues, I am glad we\u2019re able to come together in this 20th \u2013 this 200th year of our country\u2019s friendship to celebrate the successes in our implementation of the historic bicentennial framework that was adopted last year.\u00a0 We are, of course, regularly reminded of how intertwined our nations are.\u00a0 Not only do we have a network of communities across our shared border that demonstrates every day how much we have in common, how connected our peoples are, but we also share so much of our respective cultures, we have common democratic principles, we have interconnected economies, and of course, we face similar challenges.\nIt is both a privilege and a pleasure to work together with all of you in strengthening our bonds which have grown so remarkably over the past several years to tackle the challenges that we both confront with really a united purpose and a shared foundational principle.\u00a0 I am very optimistic about the future because of all of you around this room and the teams whom you represent.\u00a0 I look forward to our dialogue today and to our continued work and friendship together in the days and years to come.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Antony.\u00a0\u00a0Muy buen d\u00eda.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to turn to Spanish.\n(Via interpreter)\u00a0 Thank you very much, assistant secretary.\u00a0 Thank you, Attorney General, Secretary Mayorkas, and all the rest of the officials that are here.\u00a0 I just want to say that for Mexico, this bicentennial framework is a high priority to us.\u00a0 It\u2019s strategic, and today we\u2019re going to review the accomplishments of this year of joint efforts.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to determine what we\u2019re going to do in 2023 to establish goals for that year. \u00a0President L\u00f3pez Obrador started a new security initiative.\u00a0 He launched it as he came in and to get to the root causes of insecurity and deal with young people in the rural sector.\u00a0 We have more than a half a million people \u2013 2.2 youths are out of work, I\u2019m saying.\u00a0 There\u2019s a high number of people out of work so \u2013 especially young people, and they\u2019re in a program that\u2019s created by the \u2013 we created a national guard.\u00a0 For the first time, we\u2019re going to have dominion over the entire territory from the law enforcement (inaudible).\u00a0 Before, we had 400 police forces.\nAnother key point is our \u2013 is this framework with the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it\u2019s a framework, because we have common security issues.\u00a0 And so I can tell you, and I\u2019d like to thank and underscore our gratitude to Secretary Blinken for his efforts, and Attorney General Garland who we have met on many, many occasions, and Secretary Mayorkas who we\u2019ve spoken with a lot because they\u2019ve become personally involved in all these efforts.\u00a0 What has been achieved over this year?\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 There\u2019s 32,000 weapons have been seized.\u00a0 How do we view this in Mexico?\u00a0 We \u2013 for the first time, we have a reduction of the murder rate of 9.2 percent approximately it was reduced.\u00a0 Of these 32,000 weapons had been in Mexico, if we hadn\u2019t worked together, we wouldn\u2019t have a 9.2 percent reduction of homicide rate.\u00a0 This means 17,000 cartridges, and each cartridge can kill someone in Mexico, and so it\u2019s something that\u2019s of the upmost important.\u00a0 This is not just statistics.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about saving lives.\nAnd we can\u2019t just do it without working together, and so that\u2019s why we view it as very important.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to see soon \u2013 we\u2019re going to take a look very soon at \u2013 that there\u2019s been an achievement of arrests of 5,000 chemical precursors and fentanyl as well.\u00a0 It\u2019s so much it could poison thousands of people if they had gotten to where they were going \u2013 150,000 tons of methamphetamine.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost \u2013 if \u2013 it\u2019s if we give a dose of methamphetamine, that would allow to give to every person in Mexico who\u2019s over 50 years of age, that would be enough methamphetamine.\u00a0 Ninety-four tons of cocaine were seized as well with a special interception at sea \u2013 interdiction at sea.\u00a0 It\u2019s been \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get in more detail \u2013 of these details.\u00a0 I just want to say with these results what we should do is next year we should make it higher figures to reduce violence and avoid drugs from getting to people in Mexico and the United States.\nNow that I\u2019ve said this and with our gratitude, I give the floor right now to Rosa Icela Rodriguez, the Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection.\nSECURITY SECRETARY RODRIGUEZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good morning to everything.\u00a0 I\u2019m very happy to be here with you all.\u00a0 Greetings, and I thank our hosts for their hospitality.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Mayorkas and Attorney General Garland and everyone present and the Ambassador Ken Salazar.\u00a0 I thank and say hello to the members of the cabinet of the Government of Mexico.\nAnd yes, I want to underscore that security is a priority \u2013 a topic or issue for our governments and must \u2013 this binational vision should remain in place, government to government, the government of Lopez Obrador and the current government of the United States, and at all times there be a \u2013 there prevail sovereignty and respect.\nThis is a major decision by this country.\u00a0 The bicentennial framework has enabled us to work in coordinated fashion and agree upon this collaboration without conditioning \u2013 without any conditions, so we underscore that this instrument is part of peace, peacekeeping, or peace efforts in both of our countries.\u00a0 And our nations are obligated to work together jointly because we have a shared responsibility to combat organized \u2013 transnational organized crime, which on this side in the United States leads to overdose deaths, and Mexico has violent homicides because of the transfer of these drugs.\nSo after \u2013 by working together and putting into practice, as we have done thus far, the capacities of our states to diminish the crime and to hamstring these criminal groups and bring about peace in the Americas, and therefore, Mexico and the United States, we are united by peace.\u00a0 Because we have a bilateral relationship of brotherhood; because we\u2019re neighbors, partners; in many regions, we\u2019re family members of each other.\u00a0 That\u2019s all.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Secretary.\u00a0 Before I give the floor to Dr. Alejandro Betz (ph), the attorney general \u2013 or Gertz \u2013 of Mexico, I want to highlight the presence, and it\u2019s very important in this framework of the national defense \u2013 Cresencio Sandoval, the presence of our defense minister, and Admiral Rafael Ojeda, who is the secretary of the navy of our country.\u00a0 Thank you very much for joining us here.\nYou have the floor, Mr. Attorney General.\nATTORNEY GENERAL GERTZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, thank you so much for inviting us.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to be with you all.\u00a0 Thank each and every one of you, ambassador as well.\nI believe that it\u2019s very important to point out that the work that we have been engaged in over time has been \u2013 has become even stronger as the result of the presence of Ambassador Salazar in Mexico.\nThe first thing we should mention is \u2013 and we should take this into account \u2013 crime has no borders.\u00a0 Crime is a structure that precisely takes advantage of the sovereignty of states and circumstances that are so clear about what our legal authorities, our own competencies are, to use them against the citizenry of both countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s why when we work together with full respect of each one of the governments, we can achieve something that otherwise would be absolutely impossible.\nThe first thing that I mentioned with Ambassador Salazar were three things that we were deeply concerned about because of the harm that was being caused in Mexico and the United States as a result.\u00a0 For example, what\u2019s happening with fentanyl is a phenomenon that we should attach a very high, substantive importance to.\u00a0 We are living this problem of drugs since the \u201970s and \u201980s.\u00a0 We did make some progress, but now what we\u2019re facing is one of the most horrid phenomena that\u2019s destroying the lives of young people, children in Mexico and the United States.\u00a0 This for us should be our highest priority, and I believe that whatever we do is very little as compared to what lives mean to families and new generations of Mexico and the United States.\nWe also saw something that was so important to avoid, what\u2019s being done with \u2013 to migrants.\u00a0 Migrants are victims, and those who manipulate them are heartless criminals.\u00a0 So if we don\u2019t have the ability to get to the heads of those organizations, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 won\u2019t be able to do anything.\u00a0 We cannot solve this problem.\u00a0 The problem, it comes to Mexico from all of Central America and all over the world.\u00a0 It comes to Mexico.\u00a0 We have to understand that this phenomenon is a very complicated phenomenon.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because immigrants are not criminals.\u00a0 The criminal is the one that uses them and exploits migrants in an absolutely inhuman way.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t go after the heads of these groups and these people, we\u2019re not going to be able to solve the issue.\nAnd that we\u2019re doing, what is absolutely essential to do \u2013 drug trafficking is to us a problem that dates back many, many years \u2013 we have to find a way to prevent purchase of weapons illegally in the United States and for them to flood into Mexico.\u00a0 And they cause all these confrontations, which has cost thousands and thousands of lives.\u00a0 It\u2019s absolutely essentially to understand this phenomenon, and we\u2019re very clear about this.\nAnd let me tell you one thing that I believe is of the utmost importance.\u00a0 These are data that have been upheld by the National Geographic and Statistics Institute.\u00a0 I believe that these are well known statistics by you.\u00a0 The phenomena of crime that had grown in a huge way has been stemmed.\u00a0 We don\u2019t recognize the means, but if \u2013 in reality, if you take a look at the statistics, the figures of how the mortality rates in Mexico have been evolving, and based on under this government \u2013 and remember, prevention is not my bailiwick.\u00a0 That\u2019s not my area.\u00a0 But containing these crimes, containing a criminal phenomenon for those who we know \u2013 we know what it involves and the effort that has to be made, and what\u2019s been done by the armed forces has been just exemplary.\u00a0 And this is something that we should take very much into account.\nIf you look at the statistics of how we\u2019ve stemmed common crimes, especially homicides \u2013 and let me say that when it comes to federal crimes, what we\u2019re concerned with \u2013 and this has been recognized \u2013 federal crimes have been reduced over these four years by 32 percent.\u00a0 This had never happened in the past.\u00a0 The media talk a lot about the bad stuff, but not about the good stuff.\u00a0 And so they talk more about the scandalous stuff, but we are firmly convinced that what\u2019s being done and should be recognized because that \u2013 the President of the United States is represented by the ambassador, and the ambassador has done an exemplary job.\u00a0 We\u2019re always in close contact with Secretary Mayorkas, with the Attorney General, with each and every one of you, because we believe that if we do it together, we can live up to what we have to do.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t, forget it.\u00a0 This won\u2019t work.\nAnd so a meeting like this deserves the highest respect and it deserves for us having that deep belief that we\u2019re all working on behalf of our people, our countries, but in the end we\u2019re also working \u2013 you are working for us and we\u2019re working for you as well.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to give our colleagues a minute to leave the room.\n\n"}, {"url":

Arroyo, and Mr. Secretary of the United States Antony Blinken.\u00a0 Following, the words of the ministry of foreign affairs of Peru, Dr. C\u00e9sar Landa Arroyo.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good afternoon, journalists and Mr. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 It is a great honor for us to receive you here in this House of Government within the framework of the bilateral meeting we\u2019ve had with the president of the republic to reaffirm the links which we have with the USA on which we strengthen our relationships from the foundation of our republics.\u00a0 In particular, your presence is very important for us and we want to thank you for the contribution we received from your country for our struggle against the pandemic, as well as in our challenge \u2013 our struggle against drug trafficking.\u00a0 We hope to strengthen the trade and investment links to have the necessary resources to fill the gaps we have within our society economy-wise.\nIn that sense, I would like also to say that the governability in democracy is a shared value, and the Peruvian people through elections and through the separation of powers, and in particular in the protection of human rights and the independence of the judiciary \u2013 this characterizes our democracy after we rebuilt it with the collaboration of the OAS and the Government of the United States, among others.\nFinally, I would like to stress that the commitment of the government together with the cooperation of the USA allow us to face the crisis after the pandemic as well as that which is produced by the effects of the conflict between the USSR[i]\u00a0and the Ukraine, but that we have to overcome this in coordination and with alliances, together with our vulnerable peoples in Peru, which are indigenous peoples, people with problems.\nWe have a commitment with values we share together in this bilateral meeting.\u00a0 We begin strengthening our political ties, our commercial and trade ties with the USA.\u00a0 In that sense, I really thank you for your participation within the assembly of the OAS, which has as a purpose the model Peru proposal: all together struggling against the inequality and discrimination.\u00a0 And thus we have proposals to celebrate the Lima Declaration, which reaffirms the struggle against inequality in any kind, as well as declaration to reaffirm the need to have a public health policy which warranties precisely health care for the most vulnerable people against future pandemics or natural resources; and also to reaffirm the right \u2013 the need for education, the right of people to education, which is the way in which people will acquire the basic conditions of technical and value formation to form citizens for the future.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Now we have the words of the Secretary of State of the USA Mr. Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Muchas gracias.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, C\u00e9sar, it\u2019s wonderful to be with you and wonderful to get a lot of good work done today.\u00a0 I think that work reinforces the way that we can draw on the longstanding partnership between Peru and the United States bilaterally but also together with fellow democracies across our hemisphere to make tangible progress on the issues that actually have an impact on the lives of our citizens.\u00a0 And I think you can see that in all that we actually covered today and accomplished today.\nThe foreign minister and I convened fellow ministers for a meeting of the \u2013 it\u2019s a long name \u2013 the Summit Implementation Review Group.\u00a0 What this is, is a group to follow up on the commitments that we made at the ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles a few months ago.\u00a0 There, our leaders made commitments to strengthen public health systems, to advance a regionwide digital transformation, to accelerate the clean energy transition, to invest in climate resilience and adaptation, and to promote and protect democratic governance.\nToday, we agreed to a work plan to start achieving those goals.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve already gotten to work on this since the Summit of the Americas, and we discussed some of the progress that we\u2019ve made even over the last four months toward realizing our commitments, such as partnering with the Pan American Health Organization to train half a million health care workers for our hemisphere over the next five years; implementing our partnership with Caribbean nations to develop solutions on climate, on energy, on food security through PACC 2030; and investing in Latin American and Caribbean Network for Democracy to support deepened engagement with civil society.\nC\u00e9sar and I also convened another ministerial meeting of the 21 signatories of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.\u00a0 That affirms for the first time our shared responsibility in this hemisphere in working to create the conditions for safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration \u2013 an issue where Peru is leading by example.\u00a0 At the meeting, we launched a collective implementation process with countries stepping up to lead across important lines of effort, from finding ways to better integrate migrants and support their host communities to combating xenophobia.\u00a0 Today, I announced on the part of the United States that we\u2019ll provide more than $240 million in new humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of refugees and migrants in our hemisphere as well as the host communities that welcome them.\u00a0 Just since last month, the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development announced nearly $817 million in new assistance supporting our efforts under the Los Angeles Declaration.\nAnd of course, as C\u00e9sar said, we took part in the first in-person General Assembly of the Organization of American States since 2019.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for Peru\u2019s leadership in hosting what was, I think, a constructive and consequential meeting of the OAS.\nIf you think about it, just in the time since the last OAS General Assembly in person, in 2019, we have faced as a region, as a hemisphere, no shortage of challenges, including COVID-19 and also its lasting human and economic consequences; and more recently rising food, fertilizer, and energy costs, all of which have been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 The impact of \u2013 on food supplies and fertilizer in particular has been felt profoundly here in Peru.\u00a0 And President Castillo and I discussed steps that we can take to respond to that challenge, and we committed to working on this together in the months ahead.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in Peru, in the United States, across our hemisphere, these headwinds are hitting underserved and marginalized communities the hardest \u2013 those who can least afford it.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the Lima Declaration that we and the OAS member states will adopt tomorrow to work together to advance equity and inclusion across our hemisphere is so important.\u00a0 Being together again gave us the opportunity also to recommit to the region\u2019s shared democratic values and to the proposition that we can deliver more for one another and for our people when we actually work together in common cause.\nIt\u2019s especially meaningful to make that commitment here in Lima, where our nations came together to adopt the Inter-American Democratic Charter a little over two decades ago, a step that was inspired by the grassroots mobilization of citizens across Peru at the time to defend their democracy and their right to choose their own path.\nAcross all of the issues where we\u2019re working regionally to deliver results for our people, Peru and the United States are also working together bilaterally, grounded in our shared interests and values, as we have across many administrations over many years.\nThat shared commitment was crystal-clear when the foreign minister and I met with President Castillo today.\u00a0 And we\u2019re fortunate, I must say, to have in place a terrific ambassador, Ambassador Kenna, who has been a longtime friend of mine, who is driving our bilateral cooperation across the board.\nWe discussed our shared work on migration.\u00a0 I had the chance to commend the president and the foreign minister for hosting more than 1.3 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants, and offering them a pathway to secure a more regular status.\nNearly half a million Venezuelans have already gone through this process, allowing them to work, to go to school, to access health care, and many other public services that allow them to provide for their loved ones, to build better lives, to contribute to their host communities.\nOur countries are close partners on environmental challenges as well.\u00a0 Earlier this year we came together to respond to the ecological devastation that was caused by the oil spill just north of here.\u00a0 Over the last three years, USAID has partnered with the Peruvian people and their governments and provided $60 million to improve mining practices, to fight deforestation, to promote sustainable economic development, including in indigenous communities.\nWe continue to work with Peru to address collective threats like transnational crime and drug trafficking, both of which are exacerbated by the scourge of corruption.\u00a0 Our funding, our training, our partnerships have helped Peru make important progress.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to work together in the years ahead.\nTomorrow I\u2019ll have a chance to visit the Chorrillos fish market to highlight our partnership to combat illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, which is inflicting significant harm on Peru\u2019s marine economy and environment.\u00a0 It\u2019s going directly to the livelihoods of Peruvians who are in the fishing business.\nWe also committed to protecting Peru\u2019s awe-inspiring culture and heritage.\u00a0 For the last 25 years, we\u2019ve worked together to return more than seven \u2013 excuse me, 2,000 Peruvian cultural artifacts that were once illegally trafficked in the United States.\nFinally, let me say this:\u00a0 For all the ties that bind our countries, none run as deep as the ties between our people.\u00a0 There are more than half a million Peruvian Americans living in the United States.\u00a0 For generations, they\u2019ve enriched the fabric of our country and our communities, including individuals like the legendary Peruvian American singer Yma Sumac, who is the subject of a mural commissioned at the United States embassy here in Lima to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of her birth \u2013 a mural I\u2019m very much looking forward to getting a chance to see tomorrow.\nSo I apologize for going on so long, but I think that\u2019s just evidence that we\u2019ve had a very productive day \u2013 both with our OAS colleagues, and bilaterally between the United States and Peru.\nWe and our partners continue to demonstrate real progress on the challenges that matter most in the lives of our people, and we\u2019re going to build on that progress in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Following, we have a round of questions with the media.\u00a0 Mr. Juan Carlos Portilla from Latina.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Foreign Minister Landa, here from Latina \u2013 here to your right.\u00a0 Well, Minister, you already have mentioned some aspects of the conversation you\u2019ve had with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 However, I would like to ask you if there are some specific aspects or if there will be a possibility of assigning some kind of agreement or trade agreement within the following months within the framework of these conversations.\nAnd if you allow me to thank you in advance, the Peruvian congress has denied the permit \u2013 the permission to President Castillo to travel abroad.\u00a0 I understand that there was a very important agenda with several people from the European Union.\u00a0 How much impact has this \u2013 does this have on the Government of Peru?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Well, Peru\u2019s foreign policy is based on multilaterality on one hand, and on the other hand, in accordance with our constitution, the president is the director of international relationships.\u00a0 And thus, that is why we have a presidential diplomacy which has taken the president to the General Assembly of the OAS, to Los Angeles, among other trips he has been doing.\nIn that sense, the determination of congress today is a great surprise for our ministry, and also for our partners and friend countries.\u00a0 Because His Holiness Pope Francis expected the president the following Monday, 17th, in an audience, but also he was going to have a visit in this month of October because most of \u2013 October is a very important month for religious topics because for Peru it is a \u2013 there is a great devotion during this month to\u00a0el Se\u00f1or de Los Milagros, and apart from the agendas foreseen for our meeting with the world food fund, or the food program of the UN, to strengthen the struggle against food insecurity is frustrated, and also the meeting with the leaders of the European Union to strengthen those bonds for common cooperation.\u00a0 So I would ask the representatives of congress to review this decision, because it compromises not the president himself, but the external policy in particular, and humanitarian policy also.\nAnd in particular with the United States, we have a treaty \u2013 free trade agreement which is an ongoing perfectioning, and we\u2019ve increased exports mostly from the production of SMEs with an added value.\u00a0 And the investments that are being carried out and within the international scenario, which might be complicated because of the effects of the crisis, we maintain the trust as in the meeting in the \u2013 in New York City with the American news society, with 40 entrepreneurs, where we reaffirmed juridical stability, legal stability, the respect for the agreements.\u00a0 And this also has to do with our respect for labor laws and payment for taxes.\nSo we will continue strengthening our links not only commercially, but also the struggle against \u2013 in the struggle against drug trafficking and trying to close the gaps, social gaps of extreme poverty and protect the most vulnerable peoples of Peru.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Well, what are the \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister.\nMr. Secretary, following the OPEC+ decision to cut production targets, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said it\u2019s time for a wholesale re-evaluation of the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 My questions are:\u00a0 Is there any thinking within the administration for such a re-evaluation?\u00a0 How worried are you that Gulf partners are inching towards Russia?\u00a0 And given that inching, should the United States continue to provide weapons to Saudi Arabia?\nOn Ukraine, very briefly, President Biden earlier today was asked if he will meet President Putin during G20, and he said it remains to be seen.\u00a0 He did not rule it out.\u00a0 You\u2019ve said in the past that Russians aren\u2019t prepared for meaningful diplomacy; that\u2019s why you\u2019re not engaging.\u00a0 But right now, there are increasing concerns over the possibility of a nuclear attack.\u00a0 Don\u2019t you think it is the responsibility of the United States to initiate diplomacy with Russia at a time like this?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, since the start of President Castillo\u2019s term, there has been intense turmoil surrounding his government.\u00a0 He had to reshuffle his cabinet several times and has been grappling with corruption charges.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t that endanger Peru\u2019s democracy, economy, and the stability of its policies?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Humeyra.\u00a0 First, on the OPEC decision, I think as you\u2019ve heard clearly from my colleagues in the White House and the administration, we see the decision as both disappointing and short-sighted, especially as we have a global economy that is dealing with the implications of recovering from COVID, as well as the aggression from Russia in Ukraine, the consequences that\u2019s having.\nWe\u2019ve said all along that supply needs to meet demand, and we\u2019ve been clear about that and we\u2019ve been working on that.\u00a0 And as you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps over the last months to try to ensure that that\u2019s the case, including releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, increasing significantly our production \u2013 oil production is up in the United States by about 500,000 barrels a day \u2013 and looking at other steps that we can take to ensure that there is adequate supply to meet \u2013 to meet global demand.\nThe National Economic Council Advisor, our National Security Advisor yesterday laid out some of the additional steps, tools, authorities that we\u2019re looking at, again, to make sure that we have adequate supply of energy on the market to meet demand.\nAs to the relationship going forward, we\u2019re reviewing a number of response options.\u00a0 We\u2019re consulting closely with Congress.\u00a0 We will not do anything that would infringe on our interests \u2013 that\u2019s first and foremost what will guide us \u2013 and we will keep all of those interests in mind and consult closely with all of the relevant stakeholders as we decide on any steps going forward.\nWith regard to Ukraine, I think what you\u2019ve seen in recent weeks is a doubling and tripling down by President Putin on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine \u2013 the mobilization of reserves, the purported annexation of Ukrainian territory, and of course some of the loose talk that we\u2019ve heard about nuclear weapons.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also seen of course the very significant gains by Ukrainians to regain the land that was seized from them by Russian forces, both in the northeast and in the south.\nBut the fact is that President Putin and Russia have shown absolutely no interest in any kind of meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 And unless and until they do, it\u2019s very hard to pursue it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve said all along, President Zelenskyy has said all along that this will ultimately be resolved through diplomacy.\u00a0 And if and when Russia shows that it has any seriousness of purpose about engaging in such diplomacy, we\u2019ll be ready, we\u2019ll be there.\u00a0 But every sign in this moment unfortunately points in the opposite direction.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Mr. Harold Chavez from Exitosa.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good afternoon, Foreign Minister.\u00a0 Good afternoon, Secretary.\u00a0 Harold Chavez from Exitosa.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, we would like to know which agreements you wish to get to agree upon in the OAS assembly.\u00a0 And if you allow me to speak about the impeachment facing the speech of Pedro Castillo.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Yeah, thank you very much.\u00a0 The General Assembly of the OAS, which has as purpose the crisis which is produced in our national reality and globally to \u2013 which has generated perverse consequences towards the most vulnerable peoples \u2013 that is why the focus of struggle against inequality and discrimination is not finished in \u2013 with a food topic, which is necessary, of course, satisfaction of basic social needs, but also, as it is mentioned, of struggle against corruption because it is an evil which affects and impacts on the public budget, or bad management, and also on \u2013 impacts on the piece of services by which the most vulnerable people must receive.\u00a0 And there is an agreement of struggle against corruption, but also because of the Peruvian experience of the last decades where the clause of integrity is present in many agreements or treaties that Peru has been signing or renewing.\nIn that sense, it is part, of course, of the deliberations of the internal assembly of the OAS, and in particular in food security, which is a human right for the populations.\u00a0 The most affected or vulnerable must have the possibility of have a minimum of nutritional health \u2013 girls and boys and people from the fields, from the \u2013 inside the country who do not have their main needs, basic needs covered.\u00a0 That is why in the scope of international political arena or on the strengthening of the public system in terms of health and also nutrition and food, we need to increase the public budgets to strengthen and give resources and programs to those areas.\u00a0 And this should not be made only locally \u2013 locally but all together with other countries, learning from experiences from other countries in topics of health and nutrition, as Mr. Secretary has mentioned, of strengthening this \u2013 in these topics with international cooperation both bilaterally and multilaterally will allow us to have success in solving these problems.\nThe impeachment which has been formed facing the speech of the president of the republic facing the \u2013 in the assembly of the OAS, on one hand it\u2019s the acknowledgment that the president is the director of the external policy with regard to our constitution, and of this presidential diplomacy he expresses in forums regionally or globally, as in the United Nations, the guidelines of the external policy, which is not from this government but from the state during the last years.\u00a0 And that is why we\u2019ve signed the principles of the UN, which are peace and security and the acknowledgment of the struggle of peoples, which in decolonization progresses under the UN have been having progress.\nAnd with this, the impeachment will have to be answered to with \u2013 in accordance to the summons of the \u2013 of parliament.\u00a0 In a more precise manner, when I went there to the audience two weeks ago in accordance to the new questions they asked, we will have to clarify.\u00a0 It is an external policy independent and within the framework of international values of respect to the state of democracy, not only in Peru but in the whole world.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Vivian Salama,\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Minister Landa,\u00a0gracias por alojarnos.\u00a0 Una pregunta en ingl\u00e9s, por favor.\u00a0 Gracias.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo are you \u2013 okay.\u00a0 I wanted to ask you about the impact of the Ukraine war on Peru and the region in the coming months, in particular Peru\u2019s efforts to secure fertilizers.\u00a0 What measures is Peru and its allies in the region taking to try to ease prices from climbing even further?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMr. Secretary, thank you so much for having us along with you on this trip.\u00a0 First, my question on Venezuela.\u00a0 Some recent events, including last week\u2019s successful prisoner swap by the administration, also today\u2019s vote on whether Juan Guaid\u00f3 should be allowed to be represented at OAS, are being viewed by the Venezuelan opposition as a blow, particularly one that buys Maduro some time.\u00a0 Is the U.S. ultimately losing faith in the prospect that Guaid\u00f3 might be its primary partner in Venezuela?\u00a0 And when his term ends at the end of this year, is there a prospect that the U.S. deals with neither Guaid\u00f3 or Maduro?\nAnd secondly a quick question on the UK, the global economy.\u00a0 As the global economy faces a slowdown, Britain has some unique challenges.\u00a0 Liz Truss, your former counterpart, has struggled since becoming Britain\u2019s new prime minister.\u00a0 Are you confident that the UK will be able to manage \u2013 maintain its focus on some of the mutual global priorities like the war in Ukraine and the global energy crisis given the ongoing political and economic turmoil?\nThank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) The foreign policy of Peru (inaudible) in these principles of multilateralism has diplomatic relationships with hundreds of countries in the world.\u00a0 And due to Russia\u2019s aggression on Ukraine, Peru made a declaration within the framework of the UN condemning Russia because they broke the basic principles of the UN constitution of solving problems with dialogue and negotiation, which is what Peru continues to defend with regard to this conflict, which of course has impacted on Peru and in the whole world because it has broken the supply chain of urea and grain.\u00a0 And Peru has had to find elsewhere, and we\u2019ve been talking to Mr. Antony Blinken to strengthen the cooperation of supply of fertilizers and urea which are demanded by the great extensions in agriculture in Peru, mostly survival farming that we have here in Peru.\nAnd in the assembly of the OAS, we \u2013 we have heard President Zelenskyy asking for support in his conflict, and within this framework of Peru\u2019s external policy, we again give him his support and we wish to find a solution in \u2013 because the civil society is the most affected in every war.\nAnd within this logic, Peru also has a commitment apart from the international circumstances to have an agricultural policy which protects the small farmers, mostly the rural families, so as to establish some kind of bonds \u2013 bonuses for the acquirement of urea, and establish bonds to have this supply.\u00a0 And it is very complex now because of the conflicts, but with the cooperation of the \u2013 our friend countries from the region and other latitudes too, we are seeking to satisfy this demand.\u00a0 And with \u2013 along this logic, the second agrarian reform as stated by the government wants \u2013 wishes to be translated with \u2013 by a better supply of these resources which the agrarian population needs.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Let me, if I can comment briefly on the question that you posed to the foreign minister before getting into the questions you directed at me.\u00a0 With the Russian aggression against Ukraine, we saw what was already a very difficult situation around the world when it came to food insecurity get even worse.\u00a0 Already with climate change, with COVID, we\u2019d seen significant impacts on the supply of food, including grain, including fertilizer, as well as price.\u00a0 But the Russian aggression exacerbated that dramatically, and we\u2019re now in a situation where we have more than 200 million people around the world who are severely food-insecure.\nFrom day one, we have worked to counteract that crisis and that situation.\u00a0 Back in March, shortly after the Russian aggression, President Biden dedicated a half a billion dollars to food fertilizer production in the United States to try to get more fertilizer on the market and to try to keep prices in check.\u00a0 In addition, we\u2019ve been leading the effort internationally to deal with the food insecurity prices more broadly.\u00a0 At the United Nations back in May, as you may remember, we brought dozens of countries together and we put forward a call to action, a roadmap for how to deal with food insecurity.\u00a0 More than a hundred countries now have signed onto that roadmap, and it includes specific steps that we\u2019re taking together both to deal with the immediate emergency situation that countries find themselves in but also with the mid-term and the long-term to ensure that countries have and develop the durable productive capacity that they need to produce food for themselves for the long term.\nWe also have one of the most significant programs in our government called Feed the Future that will dedicate $11 billion over five years to helping build long-term food security in countries that need assistance.\nToday we talked with President Castillo about work that our two countries can do together to address the fertilizer challenge here in Peru, and we\u2019re committed to doing that in the weeks ahead.\nOn Venezuela, there is no change in our policy or on our approach.\u00a0 There\u2019s no change to our sanctions policy.\u00a0 That can only follow constructive steps by the Maduro regime to move toward free and fair elections, to engage in negotiations with the Unitary Platform, and for there to be genuine progress in those negotiations.\nWe\u2019ve also said very clearly that we\u2019ll review our policies, including our sanctions policies, in response to constructive steps by the Maduro regime to restore democracy in Venezuela as well as to alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people, who are the number one victims of the policies of the regime.\u00a0 And at the same time, we will also review and, if necessary, recalibrate our approach if there\u2019s even more repression by the regime.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where we are.\u00a0 And as I said, there\u2019s no change.\nWhen it comes to Prime Minister Truss, I\u2019m obviously not going to comment on internal politics in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 What I can comment on is the prime minister herself, her character.\u00a0 She\u2019s someone that I had the fortune to get to know very well when she was foreign minister, and we worked very closely together over more than a year, particularly on the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\nNo one took a stronger, more principled stand against the Russian aggression; no one was more determined to make sure that we were doing everything possible to support Ukraine, to put pressure on Russia, as well as to strengthen our alliance, our defensive alliance, NATO, in case aggression extended beyond Ukraine, than then-foreign secretary and now Prime Minister Truss.\u00a0 And I have zero doubt that that will continue in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Ladies and gentlemen, the presentation before the press is (inaudible).\u00a0 Thank you to the media.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-before-the-meeting-with-cuban-venezuelan-and-nicaraguan-human-rights-defenders/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony

you.\u00a0\u00a0Buenos dias,\u00a0bom dia,\u00a0bonjour, good afternoon to everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with all of our colleagues here today.\nAnd I\u2019m especially grateful that we\u2019ve been able to hold the OAS General Assembly in person for the first time since 2019, and I want to start by again thanking our hosts here in Peru for the wonderful hospitality, the wonderful organization.\nSince the last time we met in person, I think it\u2019s fair to say that our hemisphere has faced no shortage of challenges.\u00a0 No region in the world has been harder hit by the pandemic or its economic consequences.\nAnd then just as we were beginning to recover, we ran into new headwinds \u2013 rising food and energy costs, which have been worsened by President Putin\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.\nWhat we\u2019ve also experienced is that the consequences have fallen disproportionately on communities that have historically been marginalized or underserved.\u00a0 People of African descent, and other racial and ethnic minorities.\u00a0 Indigenous communities.\u00a0 Women and girls.\u00a0 People with disabilities.\u00a0 LGBTQI+ people.\nThe recent headwinds have been compounded by longstanding, pre-existing challenges across the region: a chronic lack of economic opportunity; an accelerating climate crisis; endemic corruption, all of which are driving people to leave their homes in unprecedented numbers, despite knowing the serious risks of the journey.\nCitizens across our hemisphere are looking to their governments \u2013 to us\u00a0\u2013 to help address these problems, to create the conditions, and give them the tools they need, to actually improve their lives.\u00a0 So it\u2019s one of the greatest tests that our nations face \u2013 indeed have faced since we came together in Lima to adopt the Inter-American Democratic Charter on that indelible September 11 day in 2001.\nWe believe strongly that we can meet this test if \u2013 if we come together to close two gaps between what our democracies promise and what they deliver.\nFirst, we can address enduring inequities in access to opportunity, which have for too long prevented communities from reaching their full potential.\nThis social compact has been at the heart of the OAS since its conception.\u00a0 Under President Biden\u2019s leadership, we are committed to partnering with countries across the region to deliver solutions to challenges affecting all of our people \u2013 challenges that no country can solve alone.\nIn the Caribbean, where today, two-thirds of the people are experiencing food insecurity, we\u2019re partnering with CARICOM to combat hunger and malnutrition, but also giving farmers the tools they need to boost productivity and adapt to the growing effects of climate change, so that communities can actually feed their own people as well as others.\nTogether with partners, we\u2019re working to meet the commitment we made at the Summit of Americas in June to train and equip half a million local health care workers across the hemisphere, so that more people can get the quality care that they need in their own communities.\u00a0 This initiative in and of itself can help revolutionize access to health care and the quality of health care.\nThrough the efforts of Vice President Harris, we have raised $3.2 billion in investment commitments from more than 40 companies to promote broad-based economic opportunity in El Salvador and Guatemala and Honduras \u2013 from expanding access to rural broadband to helping create good-paying jobs in manufacturing to providing small, minority and women-owned businesses with access to credit.\nAcross these efforts and others, we focused on empowering communities that have experienced systematic marginalization over the years because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u00a0 Because when all communities have equal access to development, all of society benefits.\u00a0 And because more equal democracies tend to be more stable and secure partners.\u00a0 That\u2019s the spirit of the Lima Declaration \u2013 \u201cTogether Against Inequality and Discrimination\u201d \u2013 that we will collectively adopt tomorrow.\nA few days ago in Colombia, I had the honor of formally committing the United States to be the first international accompanier of the Ethnic Chapter of the country\u2019s 2016 peace agreement.\nThis is a visionary document because it recognizes that a lasting peace cannot be achieved without making strides toward greater equity, justice, and inclusion for the country\u2019s Afro\u2011Colombian and Indigenous communities who suffered disproportionately during the country\u2019s conflict.\nAdvancing equity is also crucial to building durable democracy \u2013 not just in Colombia, but across our hemisphere.\u00a0 Including the United States, where we have our own deep history of discrimination, which is still felt in our society.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden has made the fight for equity and racial justice a priority for our administration \u2013 at home as well as around the world.\nI have to tell you it\u2019s been one of my highest priorities at the State Department, because we know that the incredible diversity of our country is one of our greatest strengths, including in our foreign policy.\u00a0 It makes us stronger.\u00a0 It makes us smarter.\u00a0 It makes us more creative.\u00a0 It gives us the plurality of voices and views and visions that are vital to our own democratic experiment and to being a better partner to fellow democracies across the hemisphere.\u00a0 I appointed the Department\u2019s first chief diversity and inclusion officer to help drive progress toward a more diverse institution that actually looks like the country it represents and, as well, our first Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice, Desiree Cormier Smith, who is part of our delegation to the General Assembly to help us promote these efforts around the world.\nSo that\u2019s one big piece.\u00a0 The second is this:\u00a0 We believe that we have to recommit to delivering on the core principles of our OAS and Inter\u2011American Democratic Charters.\u00a0 There are so many ways member states can help make real the commitments embodied in those charters.\nWe can unequivocally condemn the authoritarian regimes in our region and take collective steps to hold them accountable.\nIn Nicaragua, the Ortega-Murillo regime is shamelessly flouting virtually every principle of the OAS and Democratic Charters \u2013 arbitrarily locking up its political opponents, brutally cracking down on protestors, committing flagrant election fraud, attacking and imprisoning journalists and human rights defenders.\nThe Cuban regime continues to imprison hundreds of people unjustly detained in the July 11th, 2021 protests for the supposed crime of coming out into the streets to peacefully call on their government to meet their basic needs, and for demanding human rights.\u00a0 Some of those incarcerated are minors; others were sentenced to decades in prison just for speaking their minds.\nMeanwhile, in Venezuela, the Maduro regime has repeatedly denied the Venezuelan people\u2019s right to pick their own leaders, caused a humanitarian catastrophe that\u2019s displaced more than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants toward whom Venezuela\u2019s neighbors have shown extraordinary generosity.\u00a0 All OAS member states should be able to come together to support a negotiated solution that leads to free and fair elections in Venezuela in 2024.\nWe can further reaffirm our commitment to the OAS and Democratic Charters by defending their principles around the world, as our member states did when the OAS became one of the first multilateral bodies to condemn President Putin\u2019s brutal war on Ukraine and then subsequently suspended Russia\u2019s membership as a Permanent OAS Observer.\nIt\u2019s crucial that we stay united by condemning Russia\u2019s sham referenda as a violation of international law, and unequivocally rejecting any attempts to illegally annex Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 And I think the statement that member states signed on to today led by Guatemala demonstrates that.\u00a0 And we hope that countries will similarly support the UN General Assembly resolution that is expected to come up in the next week or so.\nWe can help our fellow democracies that are struggling most to meet their citizens\u2019 basic needs.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we co-sponsored the resolution before this General Assembly on Haiti, which supports solutions driven by Haiti\u2019s government, political parties, civil society, diaspora, and private sector to address the country\u2019s deteriorating security situation, to restore its democratic institutions, to foster conditions so the Haitian people can finally realize their full potential.\nFinally, we can speak up when democratically\u2011elected leaders in our region borrow from the playbook of autocrats to try to stay in power and erode checks and balances, like passing legislation that grants the government overly broad powers to crack down on the media and civil society, extending term limits; harassing, persecuting, or firing independent government officials like prosecutors and judges for doing their job.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing more leaders taking these anti\u2011democratic steps \u2013 often under the false justification that they enjoy popular support.\nWe will work to bring more partners into this effort: civil society organizations, the private sector, youth groups, and other parts of our governments, which is why the United States is pleased new text \u2013 is pleased to present, excuse me, new text, for this assembly calling for more robust inter\u2011parliamentary engagement on issues of common concern.\nBut I want to be very clear that this is not about picking sides between left and right or between liberal and conservative.\u00a0 It\u2019s about putting our shared commitment to democracy above loyalty to ideology or to party.\u00a0 It\u2019s about defending the rights and aspirations of people across our hemisphere.\u00a0 It\u2019s about standing up and giving meaning to the words that we all signed on to in the charters and indeed in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nUltimately, I\u2019m confident that we will be able to meet this moment because while citizens may not be satisfied with the way their democracies are working, most still think it\u2019s the best way to tackle the everyday problems they face and actually improve their lives in tangible ways.\nCitizens still believe.\u00a0 And if they believe and are willing to engage to be our partners across this hemisphere in improving democracies from within, then there is no challenge that we cannot overcome if we do it together.\u00a0 That\u2019s the spirit that the United States brings to our common enterprise and to this hemisphere that we share.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Lima Convention Center", "location": "Lima, Peru", "date": "October 6, 2022", "content": "\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA: (Via interpreter) Good morning, everyone. Mr. Secretary of State of the United States of America Antony Blinken, ladies and gentlemen, ministers of foreign affairs, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Peruvian Government, I would like to warmly welcome you to this meeting called by the U.S. to follow up on the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.\nOur countries are \u2013 currently send, receive migrants. We are centers of transit for migrants. There are multidirectional migrant flows that lead to complex situations, and we firmly believe that we must work on these in a welcoming way, integrating migrants into our societies. Migration has been especially relevant in the Americas, and it has been a part of our migration policies throughout time. Migrants then have adapted or have provided to the development in our countries and contributed to cultures and identities.\nToday, migrant flows present interesting challenges, and we must continue to observe our principles, seeing migrants as people who are entitled to rights. That is why we are here in order to talk and develop joint solutions as actors in different areas of migration, because our goal is to create a migration agenda that is common for the Americas for our times. Our countries then have been managing migration at the domestic level as well as via international mechanisms in order to satisfy the needs of migrants. They have diverse circumstances and, therefore, may be more vulnerable in different stages of mobility. That is why our national offices and international agencies must defend the human rights of migrants, must promote their social and economic integration, and provide for regularization. Working with migrants, asylum systems for refugees, must be dealt with in order to combat human trafficking as well as the illegal trafficking of migrants, discrimination, and xenophobia.\nLadies and gentlemen, our response has been broad and generous, and in many cases our capacity to receive migrants has been overcome. Therefore, we require international cooperation. The challenges of migration have led to national responses that have opened roads for proper management of migration. Peru\u2019s work in migration has worked specifically at the Interagency Working Group for Migration Management, the goal of which is to share knowledge on migration, expertise, good practices, and initiatives regarding the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Humane Migration.\nThe work of this working group has been included in the UN documents on good practices, and it is considered an efficient platform to work together, coordinate among agencies in a multidimensional fashion in Peru. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to continue to strengthen our joint work in different spaces so that we provide a comprehensive, hemispheric solution to the phenomenon of migration.\nFinally, I would like to highlight what is stated in the L.A. Declaration \u2013 the fundamental work that we continue to do in the regional framework for protection and finding solutions, the Regional Conference on Migration and the South American Conference on Migration are key actors that may facilitate the implementation of this declaration.\nFinally, the Los Angeles Declaration proposes a plan to manage different areas and proposes 11 working groups based on four pillars of the declaration: stability and assistance; legal pathways protection; humane management of migration; and a coordinated approach in emergency cases.\nLadies and gentlemen, I trust that this meeting will be productive and will benefit our migrants. Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR: We will hear now from the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, thank you very much. And Foreign Minister Landa, C\u00e9sar, thank you for the remarkable hospitality that Peru is showing all of us here. Thank you also for your remarkable generosity in hosting more than 1.2 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants \u2013 relevant to what we\u2019re about to discuss.\nIn June, our countries met at the Summit of the Americas to adopt the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. The declaration, now endorsed by 21 countries, affirms our shared interest in handling this challenge in a way that enhances stability, increases opportunities for safe and orderly migration, while holding criminals and human traffickers accountable.\nIndeed, countries have already taken important steps on their own to deliver on the commitment that we made in Los Angeles.\nBelize launched a program in August to help register asylum seekers, refugees, and other vulnerable migrants who\u2019ve been living without official documentation. More than 5,000 migrants have already applied for the program with more expected in the coming days.\nEcuador opened a registration process in September for Venezuelan migrants to apply for legal protection. In the first month alone, more than 100,000 registered for the program. In total, more than 500,000 Venezuelan migrants are expected to apply and ultimately receive legal status in Ecuador.\nAnd Colombia, which in 2021 launched a historic initiative offering 10-year Temporary Protective Status to the more than 2.4 million Venezuelans living in the country, continued to implement its program with remarkable efficiency. More than 1.4 million Venezuelans have received already TPS cards which grant them access to public services and allow them to build new lives.\nThe United States is pleased to help support nine Migrant Integration Centers in cities across Colombia, where migrants can receive TPS cards and also get connected to services like job training, school, health care.\nJust this Tuesday, I had the opportunity to visit one of these centers in Bogot\u00e1, where I met a family of three \u2013 a mother, a father, and their nine-month-old son who fled Venezuela six months ago. Thanks to Colombia\u2019s generosity, the son can now attend publicly provided daycare and his parents were able to get loans, training, and equipment to start a small business. The father has now started his own business making blue jeans while the mother runs her own bakery. Their enterprises benefit everyone, from the workers that they employ, to the customers who buy their goods, to the community that benefits from extra economic activity.\nIntegrating migrants through efforts like these will not only improve their lives but also strengthen the communities they live in. It will make it easier for them to work, to pick up new skills, to start a small business, through which they\u2019ll pay taxes and spur local commerce \u2013 all activities that drive economic growth. And these efforts will contribute to the richness of their host countries, which will benefit from their many cultural and social contributions as well.\nIn addition to teaming up with many of the countries here today, the United States has also taken steps on our own to deliver on the Los Angeles Declaration. Earlier this summer, we resumed the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, which creates a more efficient pathway for Cubans in the United States to apply for reunification with their loved ones. The United States also launched a new system to make it easier and faster to process asylum claims. Once fully implemented, most asylum cases will be resolved in months \u2013 not years, as is the current norm.\nWe continue to rebuild and revitalize our Refugee Resettlement Program. This year we\u2019re on track to resettle the most refugees from the Western Hemisphere since 2015.\nAnd we have expanded legal labor pathways. This fiscal year, the United States nearly doubled the number of Temporary Worker Visas to northern Central American nationals, from approximately 9,800 to more than 19,000, to help U.S. employers meet the demand for seasonal workers at a time of serious labor shortage. These visas come with significant protections and offer a safe, lawful way for temporary workers to work in jobs that are not filled by Americans.\nToday, we are announcing two additional steps that we\u2019re taking to support our shared work on migration. First, the United States is providing more than $240 million in new humanitarian and bilateral and regional assistance to help meet the needs of refugees and migrants throughout our hemisphere, including through providing health services, shelter, education, and legal assistance. The support will help host communities better integrate migrant populations, including by funding programs that support migrants in applying for official status. And it will provide international law enforcement and border security assistance to help partner governments find criminals and human traffickers who prey on vulnerable people.\nSecond, in keeping with the Los Angeles Declaration, we\u2019re launching a collective implementation process so that we can turn our shared commitments into reality. Last week, we hosted many colleagues at the White House to kick off our work along several crucial lines of effort, from finding ways to better integrate migrants and support host communities, to combating xenophobia, to countering human trafficking and smuggling.\nMost countries agreed to either lead or contribute to this work, and I encourage those countries that have not yet joined a line of effort to consider doing so today.\nIn our meeting today and in the months ahead, we\u2019ll need to continue to drive progress across our commitments under the declaration throughout the region. This includes continuing to work together to address the root causes of migration, including a lack of economic opportunity, chronic insecurity, climate change, endemic corruption, which \u2013 if unaddressed \u2013 will only deepen the migration challenge that we face.\nWe need to tap into the breadth of experience of every country around this table, some of which have been at the forefront of providing humane protection to migrants for decades. We\u2019ll also need to call upon the depth of expertise of city officials, civil society leaders, businesses, humanitarian workers, who are on the front lines of supporting migrants and host communities.\nUltimately, that is how we will make real, lasting progress toward a regional approach that respects the dignity of each migrant as well supporting the host communities in countries that host them. We know \u2013 all of us \u2013 that we are facing what is genuinely a historic challenge. We have more people on the move around the world displaced from their homes than at any time in record history, more than 100 million, and our own hemisphere is experiencing that in deep, profound, and new ways.\nLos Angeles represents a recognition, an understanding, that this is a shared responsibility. Not one of us can meet this challenge alone, but we can \u2013 we can \u2013 if we work together. That\u2019s the spirit of Los Angeles. That\u2019s the spirit that we\u2019re continuing today, and we very much look forward to hearing ideas on how we can do that and do it effectively. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-organization-of-the-american-states-secretary-general-luis-almagro-at-the-ministerial-meeting-of-the-summit-implementation-review-group-sirg/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Lima Convention Center", "location": "Lima, Peru", "date": "October 6, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to see so many colleagues here this morning.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone, for attending.\u00a0 And Secretary General, wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 We have a very busy day ahead, but I\u2019m very grateful that everyone has agreed to start with this session this morning.\u00a0 I have a few words to say at the outset before turning it over to the secretary general, and then starting our session.\nSo I want to welcome everyone, first and foremost, to the Summit Implementation Review Group Ministerial.\u00a0 And I\u2019d very much like to thank our vice chair, Foreign Minister Landa for his partnership, and of course Secretary General Almagro for his leadership.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to the representatives here of the Joint Summit Working Group for their efforts to actually turn our commitments into action.\nIn June, we met in Los Angeles for the Ninth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 There we adopted five core commitments to address big challenges facing our people \u2013 challenges that none of our countries can effectively address alone.\u00a0 We arrived at these commitments following months of consultation between our governments, as well as engagement with civil society, with youth leaders, with the private sector.\nFirst, we pledged to strengthen public health systems across the Americas, working alongside partners like civil society representatives, researchers, business leaders.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on expanding access to quality, equitable health services, strengthening systems so that we can address challenges we face today and better detect and prevent future health emergencies.\nSecond, we committed to the first regional agenda for digital transformation \u2013 improving access to the internet and other digital tools, especially for historically marginalized communities.\u00a0 That includes promoting digital literacy, privacy, and cyber security, and also accelerating the digital transformation of government services and using technology to make government more transparent.\nThird, we committed to accelerate the clean energy transition by cutting emissions and expanding renewable energy.\u00a0 We also pledged to help develop a responsible mining sector and strengthen the regional supply \u2013 mineral supply chains that are vital to powering clean energy technologies.\nFourth, we resolved to invest more in climate resilience, to help our committees adapt to the growing effects of climate change, from climate smart agriculture to sustainable fishing, and to improve disaster preparedness and response.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also help communities recover from droughts, from floods and storms.\nFinally, we endorse the Inter-American Action Plan on Democratic Governance, committing to promote and protect human rights, the rule of law, and greater social inclusion.\u00a0 We agreed to bolster transparent and accountable governance and combat threats to democracy from corruption and disinformation.\nThe point of this morning\u2019s gathering is for us to report on the progress we\u2019ve made toward realizing these five core commitments, to see where we can do more together, and to make actual plans for doing so.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we hold ourselves accountable and actually turn our pledges into action.\nIn a moment, I\u2019ll suggest a calendar and working procedures for the coming year.\u00a0 The calendar sets out a schedule for developing action plans, convening subject matter experts, and reporting on our progress over the next year.\u00a0 The working procedures address logistics and outline the different roles and responsibilities for this group so that we can collaborate efficiently and effectively.\nBut first, let me quickly share some of what the United States has done since we last met.\u00a0 For example, we\u2019re working toward a pledge we made in support of the first commitment \u2013 strengthening health systems in the region.\u00a0 In June, we announced that we\u2019d joined the Pan American Health Organization to train 500,000 public health professionals in the region over the next five years.\u00a0 That will dramatically increase access to health care for millions who don\u2019t have it, and raise the quality of care for those who do.\u00a0 Last week, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, hosted a meeting with his counterparts from across the region to develop an implementation plan so that we can help meet the needs of countries throughout our hemisphere.\nWe\u2019re also making progress toward the third and fourth commitments \u2013 expanding clean energy, and adapting to climate change.\u00a0 In the last few months, we began to implement PACC 2030, the U.S.-Caribbean partnership to address the climate crisis, by teaming up with Caribbean partners and technical experts to create action plans on energy security, climate-smart technology, and global food security.\u00a0 Last month, Vice President Harris met with Carribean leaders in Washington to review our progress.\nAnd we\u2019re working toward our fifth commitment, strengthening democracy, by investing in civil society.\u00a0 So far we\u2019ve provided almost $2 million to REDLAD, the Latin American and Caribbean Network for Democracy, to support civic engagement, including by helping civil society monitor countries\u2019 implementation of their summit commitments.\nEvery one of these efforts is collaborative.\u00a0 Every one is reaching across borders and across sectors.\u00a0 Because the challenges we face are too big for any of our countries, governments, or people to solve alone.\nSo it\u2019s critical that we continue to strengthen and expand these partnerships, and not just with federal governments, but also with mayors, with community leaders, with NGOs, with the private sector, with regional organizations.\nThat\u2019s why the United States is hosting the first ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver next April.\u00a0 We\u2019ll bring together people from across the hemisphere, municipal and community leaders, entrepreneurs and academics, and indigenous and underrepresented groups, and we\u2019ll find ways to build on our summit commitments at the local level to make progress on the issues that matter most in our communities.\nAs we move forward, we\u2019ll also lay the groundwork for the Tenth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Alvarez has recently informed us of the offer by the Dominican Republic to host that summit.\u00a0 The United States fully supports this offer.\nThese are early days for our common efforts, but we\u2019ve already made concrete progress to implement the ambitious commitments that our leaders agreed to in Los Angeles.\u00a0 Now we just need to keep up the momentum.\nI very much look forward to hearing from colleagues about the areas where we\u2019re making progress today, as well as in our future meetings.\u00a0 And I look forward to discussing where we need to do more to build a strong, stable, prosperous, and resilient hemisphere for all of our people.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Secretary General Almagro.\u00a0 Luis.\nSECRETARY GENERAL ALMAGRO:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) On behalf of the General Secretariat of the OAS and technical secretariat and institutional memory of the summit process, the JSWG offers or welcomes you to this meeting to look at the implementation of the summit as we celebrate the second General Assembly of the OAS.\nMr. Chairman, delegates, colleagues, three months ago we met in Los Angeles on the occasion of the ninth summit, in which we spoke of a host of urgent challenges faced by the hemisphere.\u00a0 And we took actions accordingly \u2013 five different political commitments set by heads of state and government that were adopted.\u00a0 Now, today, on the occasion of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, under the model of together against discrimination and inequality, we thank the U.S. for its leadership in carrying out a \u2013 or heading up a productive dialogue that led to the successful carrying out of the summit.\u00a0 Despite the different perspectives that exist throughout the region, the ninth summit was an opportunity for leaders of the hemisphere to reach a shared commitment.\nIt is key within this context we continue progressing along those guidelines in a constructive way so that citizens of the \u2013 or that citizens of the hemisphere expect the political commitments and mandates adopted give us a framework, of course, to address the most pressing issues in the hemisphere and to adopt of host of public policies.\u00a0 These commitments include the need to strengthen the health care systems, to establish a regional digital transformation agenda, climate change matters, and to address the needs of energy transition, and to protect our ecosystems, and to respond to growing threats to democracy, with special emphasis on the most vulnerable populations that have been historically sidelined.\nGiven its importance for all the countries in the region, we also underscore the initiatives announced by the chair during the ninth summit, such as the LA Declaration on immigration and protection and the alliance or partnership for prosperity of the Americas and the partnership of the U.S. and the Caribbean to 2030 for the climate change response.\nNow, this all calls for political will and decision on the part of each government to work on building a focus that addresses deep social chasms that have only broadened during the pandemic.\u00a0 At the OAS, based on our four pillars \u2013 democracy, human rights, sustainable development, multidimensional security \u2013 it falls to us to foster cooperation between the countries of the hemisphere with special focus on reducing vulnerabilities, capacity building, reducing the latent inequity that marks our hemisphere.\nAnd the five different areas that we\u2019ve negotiated led to action plans that we agreed to for digital transformation, democratic governance.\u00a0 And the OAS has acknowledged (inaudible) wherewithal to do this and to offer support and coordination in the implementation phase.\u00a0 To achieve these goals will call for much determination by the countries and transform their public policies.\u00a0 To this effect, the full cooperation of the international community is very important, especially to bring to bear financial wherewithal for us to do so.\nWe celebrate the reconvening of the Joint Summits Working Group on the ninth summit and to tackle together these challenges that through coordination and collaboration ever strengthen \u2013 first, to contribute to sustainable, resilient, and equitable future.\u00a0 This is an opportunity for us to seek out a greater convergence of our agendas, enabling us to address the multiple needs in the region.\u00a0 As we will see during this general assembly and as we saw at the last summit, the region needs to redouble its efforts to move toward greater inclusion, equity, and more rights.\u00a0 The path ahead should lead to concrete actions by states.\u00a0 And my invitation is for us to continue working towards these goals.\nWe reiterate the summit secretariat\u2019s commitment to undertake the substantive matters that are necessary to this end and to follow through on the implementation of the ninth summit and to continue strengthening participation, coordination of the JSWG and civil society and social actors in the inter-American ministerial processes, as an integral part of this process.\u00a0 I wish for this meeting much success.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary General.\u00a0 I would now ask our colleagues from the media to depart.\u00a0 We\u2019ll give you a moment to do so.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Secretary,\u00a0bienvenido a Confiteria Torres.\u00a0 I am thrilled to introduce you to four, really inspiring and amazing alumni, Chilean alumni of the YLAI program, the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative.\u00a0 I have had the opportunity to spend a couple of minutes with them, learning from them about their projects, their communities, the impact that the program has had on them, and I really cannot wait for you to hear all of the great work that they are doing and the ideas that they have.\u00a0 So, I\u2019d like to invite you to say a few words to kick us off, and then we\u2019ll get started with the conversation.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Thank you, Ambassador.\u00a0 Thank you all for being here.\u00a0 One of the things that most inspires me are the exchange programs that we\u2019ve had, and we\u2019ve built over the years.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve seen these powerful connections that are made between people participating in the programs and my country, and they tend to be lasting connections.\u00a0 And so, I\u2019m hugely trying to find a way to connect with the people who have taken part, to learn about what the experience was like, what you got out of it, but also, critically, what you\u2019re doing now and how your participation in the program may have had some impact on that.\nBut what I was particularly looking forward to today is talking to the four of you because entrepreneurs, which each of you is, are truly engines of growth in both of our countries.\u00a0 And you\u2019re focused on trying to solve problems (inaudible), but you\u2019re also social entrepreneurs, which means that you\u2019re also trying to make a difference in your communities, and that\u2019s a very powerful thing.\u00a0 If we can marry these two things together, it creates opportunity, it creates growth, and it creates positive change, and I know that each of you is doing that in different ways.\u00a0 So, I was particularly anxious to hear, and as the ambassador said, we\u2019re \u2013 so much of this is about learning from you, learning from your experience, learning what\u2019s worked, what hasn\u2019t \u2013 and also, going forward, how our governments can help or maybe get out of the way and not help, as the case may be.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut I think it was striking to me as well because I had a chance to spend some time with President Boric today and other colleagues in the government.\u00a0 And so many of the things that we\u2019re trying to do, both the United States and Chile, when it comes to building more equitable societies, inclusive growth, this is very much also what you\u2019re doing (inaudible).\nSo, I\u2019m much more interested in listening than talking.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s great to have all of you here.\u00a0 Thank you.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0Great.\u00a0 So, Mr. Secretary, I\u2019d like to invite each of the fellows to briefly introduce themselves, share a little bit about the impact that YLAI has had on them and their work.\u00a0 And we will start with Camila Roa.\u00a0\u00a0Por favor.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Meehan, we\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0So, it\u2019s such an honor for all of us to be here with you today and share the meaningful experiences we have with YLAI.\u00a0 My name is Camila Roa.\u00a0 I\u2019m a teacher of English.\u00a0 And I participated in YLAI in 2017, together with Paulina.\u00a0 And I participated with a project that is called\u00a0Desde Fuera del Centro, which is an educational and cultural project that aims to decentralize contemporary music through workshops and concerts in (inaudible) school for children.\nNowadays, I\u2019m the president of Becarius for Impact, which is one of the two alumni associations that we have.\u00a0 And with them, I\u2019m working on a new project that is called\u00a0Wilegeau,\u00a0which means \u201ccreating a future\u201d in Mapudungun.\u00a0 Mapudungun is the native language of Mapuche community, and we are carrying out our project with workshops about Mapuche culture through English so that teenagers can have a greater appreciation for their own culture, like feel proud of their culture, and also learn a language that will allow them to share the culture with anyone in the world, and of course improve the \u2013 our job and career opportunities.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s wonderful.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting too, because English is about connectivity.\u00a0 We have digital connectivity, but we also have personal connectivity.\u00a0 For this moment in our collective history, English is one way we connect, do it\u2019s very powerful that you\u2019re doing that at the same time.\nI\u2019m curious about \u2013 (inaudible).\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Tell us a little bit about how the access to music program works.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Well, we started in a local school.\u00a0 My husband is a composer, and he composes contemporary music, which is a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s non-traditional so it can be difficult to have access to it, because you have to live in a main city where you can have a like, a concert hall, you can \u2013 you need the money to pay for the tickets.\u00a0 So, we realize that it\u2019s something that you can only find here or at universities where they have music programs.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s (inaudible), you see.\u00a0 So, we don\u2019t want that \u2013 I mean, for some people, music is just something they can, like, buy \u2013 like a product. \u00a0But for us, music and art is something that children have the right to have access to.\nSo, we take musicians to schools, and \u2013 and composers \u2013 and they compose music.\u00a0 The first time it was for toy instruments, so it can be closer for kids.\u00a0 I have the pictures here.\u00a0 So, these are the ears of all these students that participated.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Oh, that\u2019s wonderful.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Because one of the soft skills that we taught was listening \u2013 not only music, but each other.\u00a0 It\u2019s so important. So, there we have the composer with the toy instruments.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s wonderful.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0And all the kids.\u00a0 It was wonderful.\u00a0 And we had concerts only for them.\u00a0 They were the audience.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Is this program continuing or \u2014\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Not anymore, sadly.\u00a0 Yes, that\u2019s an issue, continuity.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0Something to discuss, yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Something to take a look at and also \u2013 but also inspiring to me, too, because the way \u2013 there\u2019s more we can do (inaudible) back in the United States to create better access.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0And the Secretary is a huge music lover himself.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, I am.\u00a0 I\u2019m particularly intrigued with that.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0So, thank you, Camila.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0And I\u2019d like to thank the Chilean and U.S. press for sharing these stories and look forward to seeing you at any future events.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks everyone.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-chilean-foreign-minister-antonia-urrejola-at-a-joint-press-availability", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

and let me first say what a pleasure it is to be back in Santiago.\u00a0 And to Foreign Minister Urrejola, Antonia, thank you so much for this morning, for the very good conversations that we had.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to President Boric for his time, for the quality of the exchange that we had.\u00a0 And just so thankful for the warm welcome that we\u2019ve received from our friends and partners here in Chile.\nI also want to acknowledge Ambassador Meehan.\u00a0 You have no idea how pleased I am to be able to say \u201cAmbassador\u201d Meehan.\u00a0 But it is really thrilling to see you here in this new role.\u00a0 And as the president knows, as the foreign minister knows, there is no stronger partner than Ambassador Meehan.\nWe have a relationship that has been bound together fundamentally by shared interests and shared values, and next year, indeed, we\u2019ll celebrate 200 years of partnership.\u00a0 That partnership spans things that matter most to our people \u2013 from economic and security issues, where we have longstanding ties, to new areas of cooperation on climate, on energy, on health, even outer space.\nAnd as I said, this relationship is based first and foremost on deeply shared values \u2013 a commitment to standing up for democracy and humans rights in our own countries, in this region, and indeed around the world.\nWe see the strength and vibrancy of Chile\u2019s democracy in the peaceful, inclusive process the country\u2019s engaged in, with regard to charting a new constitution.\u00a0 We see it in Chile\u2019s leadership in regional organizations dedicated to promoting democracy and advancing human rights, such as co-chairing the OAS working group on Nicaragua and the recent presidency of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\u00a0 We see it in the position that this government has taken on holding countries \u2013 left, right, liberal, conservative \u2013 to the same standards on human rights and democracy.\u00a0 There should be no ideological blocs when it comes to defending the principles that we\u2019ve all agreed to in the UN and its charter, at the OAS, in the Inter-American Democratic Charter.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we call them universal rights, and we have to stand up wherever they\u2019re being threatened.\nWe\u2019re also grateful for Chile\u2019s clear voice in regional and multilateral organizations like the OAS, where we\u2019ll be going tomorrow, and the United Nations, where \u2013 among other things \u2013 it has consistently condemned Russia\u2019s unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine.\nWe\u2019re growing our economic ties.\u00a0 Since Chile and the United States signed our Free Trade Agreement in 2003, trade between our countries has more than quadrupled, reaching more than $38 billion last year, supporting tens of thousands of jobs in both of our countries.\u00a0 The United States is Chile\u2019s top source of foreign direct investment, investing more than $25 billion in high growth areas, like Chile\u2019s renewable energy sector.\u00a0 And we intend to build on those ties, something we talked about today.\nJust to cite an example, the United States has invested $760 million and provided technical assistance across five solar power projects in Chile, several of which are already powering homes and business across the country.\u00a0 Chile\u2019s renewable energy sector already provides 45 percent of the country\u2019s electricity supply and is helping further Chile\u2019s ambitious clean energy goals, including carbon neutrality by 2050 \u2013 something else that we talked about today especially as we head to COP 27 together, in a little over a month\u2019s time.\nAlthough Chile\u2019s economy has grown over the years, so, too has inequity \u2013 here in Chile, but also more broadly across our own hemisphere.\u00a0 That was worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, rising energy and food costs, which has been exacerbated again by the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\nBut what we see across the board \u2013 in all of these areas, is that those hardest hit are ones who can least afford it.\u00a0 Under President Biden, the United States has committed to partnering with Chile and other countries in the region to deliver solutions to the challenges that are directly impacting the lives of our people.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fundamental part of demonstrating that democracies like ours can deliver concrete results for our people: address their needs and advance their aspirations.\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons that we launched the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.\u00a0 We did this at the Summit of the Americas a few months ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s focused on laying the foundation for economic growth from the bottom up and the middle out by expanding digital connectivity, making our supply chains more resilient, including here in the hemisphere; creating clean energy jobs as we decarbonize; and getting regional economic institutions to mobilize more investment and credit, including in middle-income countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking forward to working with Chile on this initiative.\nWe\u2019re also expanding support for those across the region who don\u2019t have access to essential services like health, like education.\u00a0 That\u2019s the idea behind our commitment to work with partners to train and equip 500,000 local health care workers, across the hemisphere, in five years.\u00a0 This initiative, if fully realized, will make a profound practical difference in the lives of millions of people across our hemisphere.\nWe discussed, as well, our growing collaboration on migration, and I expressed my appreciation for Chile\u2019s leadership on this issue, including by hosting roughly half a million Venezuelan migrants and refugees and 180,000 Haitians.\nAt the Summit of the Americas in June, Chile joined 21 other countries in the hemisphere in supporting the Los Angeles Declaration.\u00a0 This declaration is an important moment because it recognizes our shared responsibility in meeting the migration challenge; and goes about it in a way that increases stability, creates opportunities for safe and orderly migration, and supports communities that host migrants, while holding criminals and human traffickers accountable.\nBut for all the ties between our nations that we discussed today \u2013 and we covered many of them, and indeed we probably ran out of time; we could have discussed another dozen topics.\u00a0 For all of the ties that we talked about today, perhaps none are as deep as the ties between our people.\nA little bit later today, I\u2019ll meet with alumni of the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative.\u00a0 That\u2019s an exchange program that has brought together over a thousand young entrepreneurs and business and social leaders across our hemisphere.\nUltimately, it\u2019s ties like these, especially ties that bind the rising generation of Chileans and Americans that give me the most hope for the future of our relationship and our democracies.\u00a0 And they\u2019re yet another reason we\u2019re committed to continuing to strengthen the partnership between our governments.\nSo again, Antonia, Foreign Minister, thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to be here today with all of you.\nThank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Via interpreter) First question \u2013 Michael Crowley, New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, Madam Foreign Minister.\u00a0 I was not expecting to go first, so I apologize my questions are not focused as much on the region as some that will follow, but thank you for your understanding.\nSecretary Blinken, as you must know, OPEC has just agreed to an oil production cut of 2 million barrels a day.\u00a0 You joined President Biden on what was a somewhat controversial trip to Saudi Arabia recently that the President justified in part on the grounds of working with the Saudis to control oil costs.\u00a0 What is your reaction to this decision, and are you specifically disappointed in the Saudis?\nAlso, Russia has set an October 25th appeal hearing for Brittney Griner.\u00a0 Could this change the status of negotiations over Griner and Paul Whelan?\nAnd Madam Minister, President Biden\u2019s policy towards Venezuela has essentially left unchanged Trump administration policies toward the Maduro regime, including very severe economic sanctions.\u00a0 Do you think this is the correct approach for the United States to Venezuela?\u00a0 Thank you both.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Michael, thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to energy, first, what we\u2019ve been clear about is the need for energy supply to meet demand.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working on across the board, and we\u2019ve done our part.\u00a0 United States oil production is up by more than 500,000 barrels a day.\u00a0 As you know, we have tapped into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as well to make sure that energy is on the market and, also, as a way to stabilize prices. Indeed, energy prices have come down as a result of the efforts that we\u2019ve made.\nAnd when it comes to OPEC, we\u2019ve made clear our views to OPEC members.\u00a0 We have a multiplicity of interests with regard to Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 And I think the President laid those out during his trip, and they include everything from regional relationships, including improving relations between Arab countries and Israel; Yemen, where we\u2019re working very closely with Saudi Arabia to try to continue the truce; and a number of other issues, and those were all reflected in the visit.\u00a0 But we are working every single day to make sure to the best of our ability that, again, energy supply from wherever is actually meeting demand in order to ensure that energy is on the market and that prices are kept low.\nWhen it comes to Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, I can\u2019t speculate on what various court dates may or may not mean.\u00a0 What I can tell you is this:\u00a0 This has my full attention.\u00a0 And as I said before, number one on my list of priorities, around the world, is doing everything we can to bring home any American anywhere who\u2019s being arbitrarily or unjustly detained.\u00a0 And that certainly applies in the case of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\u00a0 We, as you know, have been having an ongoing discussion with Russian authorities about this.\u00a0 We put a substantial proposal on the table some months ago, and we urge Moscow to accept that proposal so that we can resolve at least this issue.\u00a0 But our imperative is securing their release. \u00a0And I don\u2019t want to weigh in on the particulars of where we are.\u00a0 All I can tell you is we\u2019re focused on it every single day.\nFOREIGN MINISTER URREJOLA:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll answer in Spanish if you\u2019re okay with that.\n(Via interpreter) When it comes to Venezuela, this was an issue we discussed with Secretary Blinken at our meeting.\u00a0 Our position is that we hope that the initial contact group, which is in Mexico \u2013 we hope that dialogue will start up again with Maduro\u2019s government as well as with the Venezuelan opposition, what we want as a country.\u00a0\u00a0 And we are, again \u2013 agreement with the U.S. and other countries in the region, as well as other European countries, that dialogue should start up again so that in Venezuela in 2024, there may be free democratic elections.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) And then for the Chilean press, Francisco Valenzuela, Channel 13.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good morning, Secretary of State, Madam Minister.\u00a0 For both of you, I would like to thank you both for being here because there were some issues that were discussed during the \u2013 your initial introduction, your remarks, so thanks again for your understanding.\nI would like you to talk in greater detail about the meeting that Secretary Blinken had with President Boric.\u00a0 What issues did you discuss?\u00a0 Did you talk about the U.S. vote for Chile as far as its candidacy for the Human Rights Council, and Chile\u2019s role?\u00a0 As you were mentioning, you talked about negotiations over Venezuela and what the U.S. vision is when it comes to leftist governments whose governments have been historically critical of the U.S., and the relationship that your country has, Secretary Blinken, with Latin America.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to put any words in President Boric\u2019s mouth.\u00a0 That would not be appropriate.\u00a0 But let me just say generally two things.\u00a0 I think the foreign minister covered most of the issues that we discussed, but we also had a conversation about our shared approach and shared priorities that are reflected in what President Biden is working to do at home in the United States, as well as more broadly, and that I believe President Boric is working to do here in Chile.\nAnd that goes to building more equitable and inclusive economies. \u00a0It goes to dealing with the issues that are front and center in the lives of our people, whether it is \u2013 whether it\u2019s security or whether it\u2019s combating the effects of climate change, dealing with health issues, including COVID, and working in ways that meet the needs and aspirations of our people.\u00a0 And I think we agreed that there\u2019s tremendous commonality in the goals that we share and, indeed, many of the approaches that we\u2019re bringing to bear.\nWhen it comes to these questions of left, right, and center, here\u2019s what I think is important:\u00a0 The political context in each country is different throughout our hemisphere, but there is a collective task to see that, as we were saying, our democracies actually deliver for our people, that we produce concrete results.\u00a0 And my own sense is that what motivates electorates in all of our countries is the desire to see their governments actually address their concerns, and produce concrete results.\u00a0 And if governments don\u2019t, then chances are they\u2019ll be voted out, someone else will be voted in.\nWe have a \u2013 I think a shared responsibility, but also an opportunity, working closely together, to do exactly that, to deliver results for our people.\u00a0 And one of the things that I shared with President Boric \u2013 something that I think he and President Biden had also talked about when they met at the Summit of the Americas \u2013 is the conviction of the United States that for virtually all of the challenges that our people face, we simply cannot be effective in addressing them alone.\u00a0 We need partnerships. \u00a0We need cooperation.\u00a0 We need collaboration.\u00a0 And that starts with the closest of our partners like Chile.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way we see the world.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way we\u2019re trying to make progress for our own people, but also for people throughout the hemisphere, and I think that\u2019s something that was very much reflected in the conversation that I was very, very pleased and appreciative of having with President Boric today.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Human Rights Council?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That did not \u2013 it did not come up.\nFOREIGN MINISTER URREJOLA:\u00a0 No.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Leon Bruneau from Agence France-Presse.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hola.\u00a0 Thanks for having this press conference.\u00a0 I wanted to ask the question \u2013 well, to both of you, actually, but on this \u2013 as I understand it, Chile has a special exemption on visas, the U.S. Visa Waiver; and I think Chile is the only country in South America that has that, and that seems to be in jeopardy from what I understand, or is fragile.\u00a0 And so, I\u2019d like to ask\u00a0la ministra\u00a0if this was discussed and if you have given to the United States and Secretary any guarantees on that.\nAnd Mr. Secretary, so following up on that, I wonder if that is a concern of yours and that you may cancel this exemption visa \u2013 of U.S. Visa Waiver Program.\u00a0 And then I\u2019d like to ask a more general question.\u00a0 You mentioned a lot \u2013 ideological blocks and what have you, but meeting in Colombia, in Chile, on Cuba specifically.\u00a0 Constantly, the U.S. has been told that you have to change your policy and what have you.\u00a0 Are you listening to the leaders in Latin America that are telling you the policy right now is not going anywhere?\nAnd if I may \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s the news of the day \u2013 ask you a question on North Korea.\u00a0 Obviously, the \u2013 North Korea fired a IRBM missile; it went over Japan.\u00a0 The U.S. and South Korea responded by firing missiles during an exercise, a joint exercise.\u00a0 Do you think that\u2019s escalating or it has a risk of escalating the process against North Korea?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER URREJOLA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) When it comes to the Visa Waiver Program, we did not discuss this issue, during my meeting with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 When it comes to that topic, I\u2019d like to say that there is a plan that has been agreed upon with the U.S. to assess Visa Waiver Programs.\u00a0 This is something that the U.S. does on an ongoing basis, not just with Chile but with other countries with whom it has this program.\u00a0 We\u2019re working in a very coordinated fashion.\u00a0 Actually, the consular team has been in the U.S. talking to Homeland Security to talk about related issues.\u00a0 We\u2019re on the right path, but I\u2019d like to say again that the assessment of the Visa Waiver Program is not something done only for Chile, but it\u2019s done for all countries that have visa waivers.\u00a0 It\u2019s very well on its way, and we didn\u2019t talk about it when we met, but \u2013 because this is under the purview of Homeland Security and there\u2019s a team in the U.S. talking about this issue right now.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 The minister is exactly right, and we\u2019re working very closely together on this.\u00a0 Chile is the only country in Latin America that is part of the Visa Waiver Program; and we very much want to sustain that, and our teams are working to do that and I\u2019m confident that we will succeed in doing that.\nOn the other questions related to the hemisphere, look, one of the things I emphasize and want to make clear \u2013 and this is something that, again, without ascribing views to President Boric, this is also my understanding from listening so carefully to him over these months.\u00a0 We do not judge countries based on their political orientation, again, whether it\u2019s left, right, center, but simply put, on their commitment to democracy, to human rights, to other shared values.\u00a0 And it\u2019s important for us in working with countries around the world to uphold those basic values and those basic principles, again irrespective of where a country or a government may fall on the political spectrum; and, for that matter, irrespective of our actual relationship with them.\nNow we may approach this question differently depending on an individual country, but the basic principle is the same.\u00a0 And when it comes to Cuba, I think you know the longstanding views of the United States, including this administration.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken steps recently, including on remittances, on travel, on visas, to try to further help the Cuban people and empower them.\u00a0 At the same time, we saw as, again, the Cuban people tried to speak up for their rights a year ago, that these protests \u2013 peaceful protests \u2013 were not only violently put down, but people were thrown in jail, including minors, with usually excessive prison terms\u00a0\u2013 15, 20, 30 years \u2013 just for speaking their minds.\nAnd so, we have to hold the Cuban Government to account, just as we would any other government, for denying the Cuban people those rights.\u00a0 Again, we may have different approaches on the best way to do that. \u00a0And that\u2019s a very important conversation that we\u2019re always having because we all make our judgments, and certainly no one\u2019s infallible when it comes to that, including us.\u00a0 And we try to\u00a0\u2013 we listen hard and learn from our partners and friends, but the underlying principle is the same.\nShifting gears as you did to North Korea, to the Korean Peninsula, because you\u2019ve heard very clearly from us over the last 24 hours, we strongly condemn the DPRK\u2019s dangerous and reckless launch of a long-range missile that flew over Northern Japan, endangering Japanese citizens.\u00a0 I spoke almost immediately to my Japanese and Korean counterparts; and I think you\u2019ve seen that we are working very closely together, both on a bilateral basis but also on a trilateral basis\u00a0\u2013 the United States, Korea, and Japan\u00a0\u2013 to demonstrate and strengthen our defensive and deterrent capabilities in light of the threat from North Korea.\nWe\u2019ve called on the DPRK to refrain from further provocations and engage in a sustained and substantive dialogue.\u00a0 This is something that we have proposed going back many months.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the DPRK\u2019s response has been to launch more missiles.\u00a0 But we are taking appropriate defense and deterrent steps with allies and partners.\u00a0 We\u2019ve called for a UN Security Council meeting, and we\u2019re consulting with our partners on next steps.\nBut I also want to make very clear that our commitment to the defense of our allies and partners, Korea and Japan, is ironclad.\u00a0 We believe that North Korea would be much better served by not only refraining from these actions but actually engaging in dialogue.\u00a0 I think what we\u2019re seeing is that if they continue down this road, it will only increase the condemnation, increase the isolation, increase the steps that are taken in response to their actions.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Last question from a Chilean agency, Francisco Valenzuela.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (In Spanish.) Can you hear me, Secretary?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I can hear you.\u00a0 I\u2019m just not hearing the translation.\nSTAFF:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, the interpreter is waiting to receive audio.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I might be a little bit rusty, but I can try to do it like this.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Our second question is pertaining to investment.\u00a0 How does your country observe the constitutional process going on here in Chile, and if in your judgment does it get\u00a0\u2013 does it give some certainty for the American presence in business in our country under role of Chile and\u00a0\u2013 are you hearing me?\u00a0 Okay. Good.\u00a0 Now I will switch back to Spanish because some words I just can\u2019t translate.\n(Via interpreter) The role of Chile\u00a0\u2013 you can ask me if you need me to repeat the question, Mr.\u00a0Secretary, or I can continue\u00a0\u2013 the role of Chile in multilateral treaties such as with the European Union or the treaty for the transpacific association known as TPP-11 and Chile were not members but\u00a0\u2013 not as members but observers.\u00a0 How do you see Chile in multilateral treaties at the global level?\nAnd I will repeat the first part:\u00a0 If \u2013 how do you see investment when it comes to the constitutional process in Chile, as well as lithium in the energy sector?\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 And I appreciate the switching to English.\u00a0 I apologize that my Spanish is not good enough to do this in Spanish; I wish it were.\u00a0 But thank you.\nFirst, I\u2019m not going to say anything about the substance of the constitutional process.\u00a0 We admire in fact the process itself and the way that Chileans are engaging this in a peaceful and constructive manner.\u00a0 But as to the\u00a0substance, this is obviously up to the Chilean people.\u00a0 It\u2019s not an issue for the United States, but here\u2019s what I can say.\nFirst, as I noted earlier, we\u2019ve already seen over the last couple of decades, since our free trade agreement was signed, a substantial increase in trade between us.\u00a0 It\u2019s now about 32, almost 33\u00a0billion dollars a year.\u00a0 And the United States is the leading supplier of foreign direct investment in Chile.\u00a0 So, the relationship is already strong, both on the trade side and on the investment side.\nBut we are convinced that it can grow stronger still and that our two countries are natural partners when it comes to this, and our hemisphere should be even more of natural partners together.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019ll see this play out in a number of ways that we discussed today and that I alluded to.\nFirst, through the partnership that we put forward at the Summit of the Americas for prosperity in the hemisphere, there are a number of areas where, working together, we can I think significantly increase trade and investment, including in Chile.\u00a0 For example, the partnership that we\u2019re designing together focuses on things like building strong supply chains in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 We all saw what happened when we had challenges with our supply chains during COVID.\u00a0 We need to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again.\u00a0 But there\u2019s also tremendous opportunity there for business, for investment.\nSimilarly, because of Chile\u2019s leadership on climate, we see a future together where we\u2019re working together and investing together, including here in Chile, on clean technology and on green economy jobs.\u00a0 These are the jobs of the future, and Chile is very, very well placed, I think, to produce many of those jobs.\u00a0 And we talked about that today, and I think we\u2019re looking at ways to generate more American investment.\u00a0 We\u2019re already done a lot on solar, as we\u2019ve discussed.\u00a0 But there\u2019s a lot more to be done.\nAt the same time, re-energizing and refocusing the international financial institutions, including the multilateral development banks here in our own hemisphere, in ways that actually address the needs of people and put investment and put loans and put money into projects that will actually make a difference in their lives \u2013 that, too, is something that we\u2019re focused on together and that I think can create even more opportunity here in Chile.\nSo, I think across the board we have a strong foundation, but there is much more that we can do.\u00a0 And we bring to it the same perspective, which is the need to do it in a way that is inclusive and that really tries to create growth for everyone \u2013 not just some, but for everyone.\u00a0 That\u2019s a shared focus of both of our governments and it animates what we\u2019re going to be doing together in the years ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER URREJOLA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) On the first issue, I\u2019d like to go back to the last thing that Secretary Blinken said about how we are working with the United States on different topics related to investment, but especially from the perspective of the fight against climate change and the importance of renewable energy.\u00a0 This is something on our agenda with the United States, as well as with European countries and other countries \u2013 at the global level, at the UN.\u00a0 This is a consistent issue.\u00a0 The president\u2019s bilateral agenda, I\u2019ve discussed it with many foreign ministers.\u00a0 There is an interest in many countries in investing in renewable energy, and as Secretary Blinken said, supply chains, lithium, are important topics for us as well.\u00a0 We share the viewpoint that we must review and refocus the work on multilateral banks.\nI would also like to remind you of the president\u2019s visit to Canada when he met with the minister of the economy, Canadian businesses, and they talked specifically about Canadian investments.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very important partner for Chile.\u00a0 And as you mentioned, I believe, there was a very important conversation in that regard, and we\u2019re working hand-in-hand with Canadian companies.\u00a0 Same thing with the United States in the framework of the Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 The minister and the president met with U.S. businesses as well.\u00a0 The same thing happened at the UN with Mario Marcel, the Council of the Americas.\nSo, we are working very closely with different businesses.\u00a0 I was in Spain, met with Spanish businesses.\u00a0 There\u2019s an open agenda when it comes to investment.\u00a0 I think that we are well on the right path.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to say, as well, that we have negotiating teams, this\u00a0\u2013 looking at the modernization agreement with the EU this week.\u00a0 As the president has said, the idea is to be able to bring those to a close by the end of the year.\u00a0 We\u2019re on the right path.\u00a0 And so, everything I\u2019m saying, as well as what Secretary Blinken has said, shows that we are working very strongly on these issues.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) We would like to thank you for coming to this press conference.\u00a0 We request that the national press allow our U.S. colleagues to leave because they must join the Secretary\u2019s delegation.\u00a0 Thanks very much.\n\n"}, {"url":

Well, thank you so much, Madam Mayor.\u00a0 This is the third time that we\u2019ve met.\u00a0 I have such admiration for the mayor\u2019s extraordinary leadership on so many issues.\u00a0 We first met talking about climate and the incredible work that Bogot\u00e1 has done on climate change.\u00a0 We\u2019re here today to talk about migration and the challenges that we face together.\u00a0 And in so many of these areas, COVID as well, the mayor and the city have done extraordinary work.\nIf you step back for a minute \u2013 and we\u2019ve talked about this before \u2013 we are living through a period in the world where we have more people on the move, displaced from their homes, than at any time in recorded history, more than 100 million people around the world.\u00a0 And here in our own hemisphere, in the Americas, we feel this strongly every day.\u00a0 Guatemalans, Hondurans, El Salvadorans, Haitians, Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans \u2013 so many people on the move, and it creates a tremendous challenge for all of us.\u00a0 What\u2019s changing now is that countries are coming together to take shared responsibility for meeting this challenge, and also, we hope, turning it into a real opportunity.\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a place where that\u2019s more the case than here in Colombia, where in I think an example both extraordinary generosity but also farsightedness, Colombia has welcomed now almost 2.5 million Venezuelans and is offering temporary protected status for ten years to people from Venezuela.\u00a0 To date about 1.5 million of the Venezuelans who are here have temporary protected status and that means that they\u2019re able to work, they\u2019re able to send their kids to school, they\u2019re able to be productive, contributing members of the community, of society, and we\u2019re not going to have a lost generation of Venezuelans with their kids not able to go to school and parents not able to go to work and put food on the table.\u00a0 So this is quite remarkable.\nHere in this place, what we saw today is what really could be a model for many other places, where all in one place people coming to their temporary protected status cards, get services, get connected to schools, get connected to jobs, get connected to support, social services, all here in this beautiful place, but it\u2019s part of the municipality of Bogot\u00e1.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a place that works for Colombians and works for Venezuelans, and it \u2013 in fact, it works for the citizens now of Bogot\u00e1.\u00a0 So it\u2019s a remarkable model.\nThe United States has been very honored and proud to help in this process.\u00a0 Throughout the crisis in Venezuela, over many years now, we\u2019ve provided nearly $3 billion in assistance, assistance that\u2019s come here to Colombia as well as to other countries: Ecuador, Peru, and so forth.\u00a0 The President announced an additional $350 million in assistance during the UN General Assembly.\u00a0 And some of \u2013 most of this is done through the U.S. Agency for International Development which does remarkable work on the ground in some many countries.\nAnd we\u2019re doing it in very practical ways.\u00a0 For example, here, we\u2019ve been able to provide financing for Colombian banks to be able to offer loans to small businesses started by Venezuelans.\u00a0 This is something that benefits them, but it powerfully benefits the community as well, because small businesses are drivers of growth, drivers of progress in all of our communities.\u00a0 So that\u2019s just one example of the practical ways that we\u2019re working in partnership.\nBut I have to say, Madam Mayor, this is just incredibly impressive.\u00a0 And I have to say it fills me with more hope that we\u2019re able not only to manage this challenge but to do it in a way that\u2019s beneficial to everyone.\u00a0 So thank you for sharing this today.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS LOPEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 I want to express once again our gratitude on behalf of Bogot\u00e1 but also as Colombia.\u00a0 Thank you so much for the support \u2013 your support and the support of the U.S. Government, to our President Gustavo Petro in our common purpose of (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-colombian-vice-president-francia-marquez-at-a-signing-ceremony-to-support-the-comprehensive-implementation-of-the-ethnic-chapter-of-the-2016-peace-accord/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

tardes.\u00a0 Gracias.\u00a0 Gracias a todos.\u00a0\u00a0I looked for this because I was almost rendered entirely speechless, quite literally.\nTo all of you here, this is a special place, and even in the few minutes that I\u2019ve been here, I can feel that.\u00a0 It\u2019s very, very powerful.\nVice President Marquez, thank you for your leadership and also for your partnership, and I\u2019ll have more to say about that in a few minutes.\nAmbassador Murillo, so many others here from the Colombian Government, from multilateral organizations, from civil society, from other institutions working toward the full implementation of the Peace Accord \u2013 thank you, thank you for your commitment to this effort.\nAnd I very much want to recognize the service of Mr. Wouriyu Valbuena and all of the Afro-Colombian, Indigenous, and other civil society leaders who are here today for their brave and sustained efforts on the part of their communities.\nLet me also acknowledge Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n S\u00e1ez for hosting us in this remarkable museum.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful for that.\nIt\u2019s quite simply moving \u2013 moving to be here and to bear witness to the harrowing consequences of more than 50 years of conflict that are depicted all around us.\u00a0 From the paintings that reflect the agony of forced disappearances for victim\u2019s families, to the floors beneath our feet, crafted from melted guns, hammered into tile with the participation of victims of sexual violence.\nEvery part of this space shows the cost of conflict.\u00a0 Every part makes an urgent case for peace, for justice.\u00a0 And every part also shows profoundly our common humanity, as translated through art, an ability to connect so powerfully one human being to another.\nThe United States has been proud to be a partner to Colombia and its people throughout the peace process.\u00a0 Today, we\u2019re taking another step in support of securing a lasting peace, by becoming the first international accompanier to the Ethnic Chapter of the Peace Accord.\nThe chapter recognizes that there can be no lasting peace without justice and equality for the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous people, who have been disproportionately harmed by this conflict.\nOver five decades, 38 percent of Afro-Colombians, 27 percent of Indigenous people registered as victims of the conflict.\u00a0 By 2017, nearly a million had been forcibly displaced.\u00a0 Countless others suffered atrocities and human rights abuses \u2013 massacres, torture, disappearances, killings, sexual violence.\u00a0 Too often, those crimes went unpunished.\nThese injustices were rooted in centuries of racism \u2013 a living legacy of slavery and colonization.\nMany persist to this day.\u00a0 According to the United Nations, of the more than 400 human rights defenders killed between 2016 and 2020, 16 percent were Indigenous, though Indigenous people make up less than 5 percent of the population.\nAnd as so many of you in this audience know very, very well, Afro-Colombian and Indigenous people continue to experience systemic marginalization and inequality.\u00a0 To give just a few examples, even when they have the same qualifications, Afro-Colombians tend to earn less than their peers.\u00a0 And on average, Indigenous people receive two years less education than other Colombians.\nThe Ethnic Chapter sets out a vision for an inclusive peace that addresses this history of inequity and ensures the rights of Afro-Colombians and Indigenous people going forward.\nIt\u2019s a vision that the United States shares and that we\u2019ve long worked to try to help make a reality.\nSince supporting the negotiation process, we\u2019ve supported Colombia\u2019s efforts to help protect vulnerable communities, dismantle criminal organizations, support investigations and prosecutions of perpetrators of violence and human rights abuses.\u00a0 In all, we\u2019ve contributed more than $1 billion to support Colombian-led efforts to implement the Peace Accord.\nWe\u2019ve also worked to expand opportunities for marginalized communities.\u00a0 The United States Congress \u2013 thanks in large part to the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Chairman Meeks in particular \u2013 has helped provide significant economic development aid for Afro-Colombian and Indigenous people for the last nine years.\nAnd last year, the U.S. Agency for International Development launched a five-year, $60 million program to support economic, political, and social inclusion in Colombia \u2013 the largest program of its kind in the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re partnering with nine Afro-Colombian and Indigenous organizations to create and implement peacebuilding and sustainable development initiatives, with a special focus on empowering women, young people, LGBTQI+ people, people with disabilities, people who are affected by violence.\nWorking toward greater equality will not only strengthen the foundations of peace in Colombia, but also the country\u2019s democracy.\u00a0 Because when every community has equal access to opportunity, to justice, to development, and security, all of society benefits.\nThat\u2019s true in Colombia.\u00a0 It\u2019s also true in the United States, with our own deep history of discrimination, which is still felt in our institutions, policies, and society.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden has made the fight for equity and racial justice a priority for our administration, at home as well as around the world.\nNow, you know better than anyone that this work can be challenging.\u00a0 But our willingness to confront the painful parts of our history \u2013 as well as our present \u2013 and do it out in the open, that is one of democracy\u2019s greatest strengths, and it\u2019s one that the United States and Colombia share.\nThe work that we\u2019re here to support \u2013 like the Ethnic Chapter itself \u2013 is only possible because of incredibly courageous Colombians who have risked everything in the fight for equal rights.\nPeople like the vice president, who has spent her entire life defending Colombia\u2019s underserved communities, their lands, their rights \u2013 \u201clos nadies,\u201d as she says.\u00a0 As a teenager, when the vice president helped protect a river in her community from exploitation; later, when she helped lead a march of women for more than 300 miles to protest illegal mining; and throughout the peace process, when she made sure that the voices of Afro-Colombians and black women were heard.\u00a0 Work she did despite harassment, despite death threats, work she continues to this day, not only as vice president but also as her government\u2019s first minister of equality.\nHer persistence, and that of so many indigenous and Afro-Colombian leaders like her \u2013 including some of you gathered here today \u2013 you\u2019ve brought the nation to this moment, and you will continue to carry it forward.\nAs the vice president said, now is the time \u2013 now is the time \u2013 to work toward peace \u2013 \u201cdecisively, without fear, with love and with joy.\u201d\u00a0 I can think of no more powerful and no more fitting words for this moment.\nAnd I can conclude simply by saying the United States is proud, proud to be your partner in this endeavor.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Gracias a todos.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter)\u00a0Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 Now it is my honor and pleasure to welcome the vice president of Colombia, Francia Marquez, for her remarks.\u00a0 Madam Vice President.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nVICE PRESIDENT MARQUEZ:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Everyone who is here today in this space, I would like to extend my special greetings to Mr. Antony Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States, and of course to your entire team of colleagues who are with you as a part of this special delegation.\u00a0 I would also like to extend my greetings to the representatives of the United Nations for human rights, Juliette de Rivero.\u00a0 Thank you for being here and for always being so willing to stand by our side and our arduous fight to protect life.\nI would like to greet Luis Gilberto Murillo, our ambassador, who has been a part of this historic fight that we have waged as peoples.\u00a0 I would like to extend my greetings to the director of the victims unit, Patricia Yagari, who is here with us.\u00a0 I would like to greet the secretary of the high-level instance for ethnic peoples, Mr. Armando Valbuena.\u00a0 My greetings to all leaders who are here as well, social organizations, members of the media, and my greetings to the community in general.\nThe first thing I have to say is that we are very pleased to receive this visit from the Secretary of State of the United States.\u00a0 We receive you and are happy to do so as a government, as an administration, because accompanying the Ethnic Chapter for peace is to take on the commitment for total peace, complete peace.\u00a0 These floors upon which we have walked are wrinkled; they are made of weapons, weapons that were used to murder and hurt millions of Colombians, but especially Colombians who were Indigenous and Afro descendants,\u00a0raizales\u00a0and\u00a0palenqueros.\u00a0 As the Colombian state recognized and as was recognized by the FARC at the time, there was a disproportionate effect on these people, and that continues to be so in the framework of the armed conflict.\nI can\u2019t be here as a black woman, as a victim, without reaffirming our commitment to peace to tell you, Mr. Secretary, that we have still not silenced every bullet.\u00a0 There are many weapons here that we were able to place here, but there are still many weapons out there, out there murdering, taking life, denying possibilities, hopes and dreams for our people.\u00a0 And I would like to especially talk about youth, about black and Indigenous youth, youth who today do not see any roads that are open to them, who see that the future is murky.\u00a0 They don\u2019t see that it\u2019s possible for them to achieve their dreams.\u00a0 Young people who on the Pacific coast of Colombia are committing suicide because they do not see a road ahead for themselves, young people, children, women who continue to be victims of forced displacement, who are expelled from their land, who are still undergoing a terrible humanitarian crisis.\nAnd this armed conflict is not uncoupled from structural racism.\u00a0 My presence today as vice president is just one step; it is not the end.\u00a0 The end is to find dignity for our people, black people,\u00a0raizal\u00a0and\u00a0palenquero\u00a0people, our Indigenous peoples, for peasant workers, for women, for young people, and for all of Colombia.\u00a0 That is why, as we discussed during our meeting with the president, it is necessary that we solve the drug problem, the drug trafficking problem, the problem of death economies, towards an economy that allows for peace for us all.\u00a0 We must plant happiness, hope, and love on our land, because unfortunately and sadly, our land has been planted with pain, sadness, and blood.\nWith that hope, Gustavo \u2013 President Gustavo Petro came into office, as did I, in order to be a part of the state in order to change those realities.\u00a0 We celebrate the fact, then, that the U.S. Government today is taking on being a partner in this exercise of ensuring rights for the victims of this country, and especially for victims, of ethnic peoples, in order to find a decent life for them and to make strides in seeking total peace.\u00a0 I will repeat: this is a huge stride to the end.\u00a0 This is a demonstration of the fact that we are on the right path, that hope continues to grow, so that we may overcome our fear \u2013 a fear that still takes hold of our people, that still takes hold of our leaders.\nThat is why, then, I would like to thank you on behalf of our national government, on behalf of my people, on behalf of our leaders, on behalf of those who are no longer here because they gave their lives for this moment so that we could reach this place.\u00a0 But we would like to reaffirm our commitment to total peace, to justice, to social justice, to human dignity.\u00a0 We would like to reaffirm our commitment to tackle, in a radical way, structural racism which has not allowed us to be as people and as communities.\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much for being here.\u00a0 I would like to thank the media, and a message of hope, of happiness, of love, and of brotherhood is what I would like to extend to the Government of the United States.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Madam Vice President of the Republic of Colombia, Francia Marquez.\u00a0 And now we will move to this very important moment, a moment that Indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants have waited for for so long and that we have worked on together with the United States Government.\u00a0 We will move to the signing ceremony.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Benjamin Franklin Room", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "September 30, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0\u00a0Bonjour, tout le monde.\nForeign Minister Joly, M\u00e9lanie, as always, I\u2019m delighted to welcome you back to the State Department, to the United States, and it is a great pleasure to continue our ongoing collaboration on so many issues that join our countries together.\nAs is fitting for such a close friend and ally, the discussion we had today touched on an incredibly wide range of critically important issues that are having a real impact on the lives of our citizens, Canadians and Americans alike, as well as people across the globe.\nWe, of course, discussed our united response to President Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, including his latest shameless effort to legitimize his attempted land grab in Ukraine.\u00a0 No one is fooled by what Moscow has done.\u00a0 The world saw the way Russia conducted these so-called referenda, with Russian occupation forces going door to door and forcing Ukrainian citizens to cast their ballots at gunpoint.\u00a0 The entire process around these sham referenda was a complete farce.\nThe United States does not, and will never, recognize any of the Kremlin\u2019s claims to sovereignty over parts of Ukraine that it\u2019s seized by force and now purports to incorporate into Russia.\u00a0 As I said last week at the United Nations Security Council, this territory is and will remain Ukrainian, and Ukraine has every right to defend its land, to defend its people, and to take back the territory that Russia has seized from it.\nCanada and the United States, like so many nations around the world, see eye to eye on this: these are just the latest in a long line of actions by Russia since it launched its war of aggression against Ukraine that violate international law, that flout the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity which underpin the entire international order so necessary to keeping peace and security around the world.\u00a0 And all of this shows the Kremlin\u2019s utter contempt for the rights and the will of the Ukrainian people.\nI also made clear that when Russia made this move, the United States and our allies and partners would impose swift and severe costs on individuals and entities \u2013 inside and outside of Russia \u2013 that provide political or economic support to illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 Today we have done just that, in coordination with the European Union, and Canada is taking similar steps as well.\nWe\u2019re also issuing a clear warning, supported by G7 leaders:\u00a0 We will hold to account any individual, entity, or country that provides political or economic support for President Putin\u2019s illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 In support of this commitment, the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce are releasing new guidance on heightened sanctions and export control risks for entities and individuals inside and outside of Russia that support in any way the Kremlin\u2019s sham referenda, purported annexation, and occupation of parts of Ukraine.\nWe\u2019re also taking action today at the United Nations Security Council to hold Russia accountable for the sham referenda and the purported annexations.\u00a0 If Russia blocks the Security Council from carrying out its responsibilities, we\u2019ll ask the UN General Assembly, where every country has a vote, to make clear that it\u2019s unacceptable to redraw borders by force.\u00a0 Every country has a stake in condemning these steps.\nAs UN Secretary-General Guterres said this week, and I quote, \u201cThe [United Nations] Charter is clear.\u00a0 Any annexation of a State\u2019s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the [United Nations] Charter and international law.\u201d\nThe United States, Canada, and our other allies and partners will continue to assist Ukraine in the fight to defend its territory against Russian aggression.\u00a0 With new security assistance that we announced just this week, the United States has now committed approximately $16.9 billion in security assistance to Ukraine going back to January 2021.\nIn our meeting, the foreign minister and I discussed ways to continue supporting Ukraine and our European allies as they prepare for a difficult winter ahead.\u00a0 Our commitment to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, its independence, its territorial integrity is steadfast.\nThe United States and Canada will also continue to work together at the G7 to help the populations hardest hit by President Putin\u2019s war of choice, including by getting life-saving aid to the people most affected by the unprecedented global food crisis.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to make crystal clear that we and our NATO Allies are prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory.\nThe United States and Canada are also standing together in responding to virtually every major global challenge that is having an effect on our people, just as we have for 150 years.\nCanada is a deeply valued ally and partner across the Arctic region in the Arctic Council, where we\u2019re working together to promote sustainable economic growth while also combating the climate crisis.\u00a0 In the coming weeks the United States will release our Arctic Strategy to further these goals, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with Canada to make them a reality.\nLike the United States, Canada is both an Atlantic and Pacific nation, and we saw that last week at the General Assembly, where Canada joined both the Partners in Blue Pacific and the Strengthening Atlantic Cooperation ministerial meetings that we held.\u00a0 These initiatives will further our shared goals of a prosperous, resilient, and secure ocean region in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.\nWe\u2019re working together to end the HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis epidemics.\u00a0 Here, too, we saw Canada\u2019s leadership on display at the General Assembly, with the prime minister\u2019s exceedingly generous contribution of more than $900 million to the Global Fund in its seventh replenishment.\nCanada, Mexico, and the United States are partners in the USMCA, through which we\u2019re strengthening supply chains, supporting strong labor rights protections, and accelerating the clean energy transition across an increasingly integrated North America.\nSince December, our countries have partnered to mobilize more than $294 million in international commitments for Haiti.\u00a0 We deeply appreciate Canada\u2019s leadership in launching the UN Basket Fund to improve citizen security and strengthen law enforcement in Haiti \u2013 an effort the United States is proud to support.\u00a0 In these extremely difficult times for the Haitian people, we\u2019re urging more partner nations to contribute to this vital cause.\nWe also applaud Canada\u2019s leadership in launching the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention in State-to-State Relations.\u00a0 This is bringing nations together to send the clearest possible message that the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals is unacceptable, and governments that engage in this practice will face consequences.\nWe discussed ways to deepen what is an already remarkably vibrant commercial and trade relationship, to boost our collective competitiveness, to create good-paying jobs for people on both sides of our border.\u00a0 The United States and Canada are of course already each other\u2019s largest trading partners, with over ten \u2013 $2 billion, excuse me, in goods and services that pass between us every single day.\u00a0 But we know we can do even more together, to the benefit of our people.\nOne way to do that is through the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides more than $368 billion for clean energy technologies like electric vehicles and battery components that are manufactured in North America.\u00a0 It\u2019s the biggest, most ambitious climate investment in the history of our country; it offers a chance for us to deepen our economic integration and expand inclusive economic opportunity for our people.\nAnother way is through the CHIPS and Science Act, which will provide funds to develop resilient semiconductor supply chains in North America, which are crucial for so many of the goods that we rely on, from smartphones to dishwashers to cars.\u00a0 Our semiconductor supply chains are already deeply interconnected, with U.S.-based companies like IBM and Skyworks conducting research, development, design, and packaging in Canada.\nIt is hard to think of two countries that work together as closely, and across as many areas, as Canada and the United States.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not only because our fates and interests are so closely intertwined, but it\u2019s because we approach these challenges and opportunities from a place of shared values.\u00a0 More than ever, we are in this together.\nSo, M\u00e9lanie, as always, thank you for the visit \u2013 but, most important, thank you for your partnership, thank you for your friendship on a professional level, on a personal level.\u00a0 We\u2019re the closest of collaborators.\u00a0 It\u2019s something I deeply value and am grateful for every day.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to have you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Tony.\u00a0\u00a0Merci, Tony.\u00a0 It\u2019s really a pleasure for me to be here for my second visit to the State Department.\u00a0 But before we start, I would like also to say a few words as Canadians are observing the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.\n(Via interpreter) On this day, we honor the children who never returned home, the survivors, their families, and their communities.\n(In English) The path of reconciliation is long and painful.\u00a0 It is one we must choose to walk with indigenous people every day.\n(Via interpreter) Dear Tony, as I say every time I come here with you, it\u2019s wonderful to \u2013 I would like to host you in Canada soon, I hope.\n(In English) Canada and the United States, and Secretary Blinken mentioned, share a special, unique relationship.\u00a0 Of course, our two countries are bound by geography and history.\u00a0 We are friends, allies, trading partners because we know we are stronger together when, obviously, we\u2019re standing together.\u00a0 We invest in each other\u2019s successes.\u00a0 We have fought side by side on numerous battlefields because our way of life, our democratic values, were threatened.\nVladimir Putin will stop at nothing to consolidate his power and assert his dominance.\u00a0 The vote to integrate Ukraine\u2019s territories into the Russian Federation is a crude attempt to formalize President Putin\u2019s conquest through political theater.\u00a0 As Canada and NATO Allies have said, the pre-orchestrated outcomes of these referenda have no legitimacy and will never be recognized.\u00a0 Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia will remain Ukrainian territory.\nCanada has imposed sanctions today on 43 new oligarchs, the so-called governing body in Kherson, and 35 Russian-backed officials in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.\n(Via interpreter) So today, Canada will impose new sanctions to 43 oligarchs, to the so-called leaders of Kherson, 35 senior officials of Russia in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.\n(In English) Courageous women across Iran are currently in the streets protesting the tragic killing of Mahsa Amini.\u00a0 Canada salutes them and we want to say to everybody that we stand with them in saying that women\u2019s rights are human rights.\n(Via interpreter) The Iranian regime has a long record of systematic violations of the rights of the population, and they continue to persecute the people.\n(In English) This regime has also shown a blatant disregard for human life with Flight PS752.\u00a0 Canada will sanction the so-called morality police and its leadership, and Canada will hold Iran accountable for its crime.\nAs we fight for human rights, Secretary Blinken and I also discussed our effort to strengthen international peace and security, including through deepened engagement in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We share a vision of a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 We both believe in strengthening our diplomatic and economic ties with the region and the resiliency of our global supply chains.\u00a0 And the Secretary just mentioned about particularly the CHIPS legislation here and the initiative, and obviously we want to make sure that as the United States go forward, we also provide our great expertise and \u2013 in terms of critical minerals, in terms of extraction but also manufacturing.\nCanada is pleased to continue the work as a full member of the partnership of the Blue Pacific.\u00a0 Alongside Secretary Blinken, we were together at the UN General Assembly, on the margins of the UN General Assembly, to talk about this very new initiative.\nNow, several weeks ago, President Biden spoke to Americans at the Independence Hall in Philadelphia, saying that democracy and equality are under assault, and that Americans are in a battle for their soul \u2013 for the soul of their nation.\u00a0 I know these words resonate deeply with Canadians.\u00a0 Canada is not immune to the same threats to our democracy, to rampant disinformation on social media, to feelings of distress towards our institutions.\u00a0 However, our resolve in the face of these challenges has never been stronger.\u00a0 We will remain resolute in our defense of democracy, and we will remain united \u2013 united in our vision for a more free and democratic world, united in our pursuit of a more just and equal society, and united in our determination to preserve our institutions for future generations.\n(Via interpreter) Because by remaining united, there is no limit to what our two nations could accomplish together.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take our first question from Shaun Tandon with the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Hi there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Hi, Shaun.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you. To begin with, Mr. Secretary, just on behalf of the press corps, condolences on the loss of your father. I wanted to share that with you \u2013 wanted to offer condolences on behalf of the State Department Correspondents Association.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Could I follow up on a couple of items today on Ukraine and Russia?\u00a0 To both of you:\u00a0 President Putin, he mentioned today, he said that the West was to blame for what happened on Nord Stream.\u00a0 I know the United States has already rejected that.\u00a0 Do you have any assessment of what actually happened?\u00a0 Could this be a violation of a \u2013 could this invoke Article 5 for NATO?\u00a0 And what does this say about security of the Baltics?\u00a0 Is there a need to up the security there?\nAnd President Zelenskyy, in response to \u2013 in response to what happened today, called for fast-track membership into NATO.\u00a0 Do you have any opinion on that?\u00a0 Do you think that all countries should be \u2013 in NATO should be on board with that?\nAnd if I could just follow up on one thing the foreign minister mentioned.\u00a0 You mentioned democracy.\u00a0 Brazil has elections coming on Sunday.\u00a0 I wonder if the two of you had any conversations about how to approach that, when to recognize the results, if there are any concerns about preserving the stability of democracy in the Western Hemisphere\u2019s second-most-populous country.\u00a0 Thanks very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (In French.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 (In French.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Shaun, thank you.\u00a0 First, on the pipelines, we\u2019ve been in very close contact with our partners in Europe \u2013 notably with Denmark and Sweden.\u00a0 We are supporting the investigation into these attacks on the pipelines and working to be able to determine who is responsible.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t want to get ahead of those investigations; that work is ongoing.\u00a0 I think everyone by now is well aware of something that M\u00e9lanie alluded to more broadly, but specific to Russia, which is the outrageous misinformation and disinformation campaigns that it engages in.\u00a0 So I really have nothing to say to the absurd allegation from President Putin that we or other partners or allies are somehow responsible for this, but we will get to the bottom of what happened, and we\u2019ll share that information as soon as we\u2019re \u2013 as soon as we have it.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the investigation that\u2019s ongoing.\nWith regard to NATO and Ukraine, our position is and remains clear, and the same as it\u2019s been.\u00a0 We strongly support NATO\u2019s open door.\u00a0 We strongly support bringing into NATO countries that seek to join and that can add to NATO\u2019s capabilities.\u00a0 There\u2019s a process for doing that, and countries will continue to follow that process.\nAnd then when it comes to Brazil and the elections, we\u2019re obviously not going to get into another country\u2019s elections.\u00a0 I can just say generally speaking that Brazil has very strong democratic institutions, including very strong electoral institutions that they\u2019ve demonstrated time and time again, and we expect that that will be the case in the upcoming election this weekend.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0To add to that, obviously we support NATO\u2019s and the EU\u2019s declaration regarding the sabotage of the pipelines.\u00a0 We think that it is a very important European infrastructure.\u00a0 That is why I also had the opportunity to talk to my Danish and Swedish counterpart and obviously we spoke about it as well.\nRegarding the referenda themselves, well, you heard what I said regarding this being Putin\u2019s political theater, but quite frankly, no one is buying it.\u00a0 So we\u2019re reaching out with many countries of the world to make sure, as the UN secretary-general mentioned, that it is clear that this is against international law and that we stand strong against that violation.\nRegarding NATO \u2013 so the Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO \u2013 our position has not changed.\u00a0 It has been the same, which is essentially we believe in NATO\u2019s \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy, and we\u2019ve always been in favor of Ukraine acceding to NATO.\nAnd finally regarding Brazil, obviously my comments are the same as the Secretary in the sense that we will not meddle into Brazil\u2019s elections, but what I can say, though, is Tony and I will be heading to the OAS next week.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be in Peru and therefore we look forward to engaging with \u2013 we hope \u2013 our future counterparts, if that\u2019s the case.\u00a0 And we will obviously be having strong discussions regarding the future of democracy within our hemisphere.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Next, let\u2019s go to James McCarten with the Canadian Press.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you both for doing this today.\u00a0 On the subject of Nord Stream, Secretary and Minister, regardless of responsibility, obviously the energy supply situation in Europe is bad and only going to get worse as a result of this.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if the two of you spoke at all today about what your two countries can do either independently or collectively to help to ease some of that pressure.\u00a0 And is there a heightened sense of danger in light of that if we\u2019re talking about providing supplies \u2013 shipping supplies across the ocean, is it as simple as that or is it more complicated now as a result of these attacks?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think first it\u2019s important to make clear that these pipelines \u2013 that is, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 \u2013 were not pumping gas into Europe at this time.\u00a0 Nord Stream 2 never became operational, as is well known.\u00a0 Nord Stream 1 has been shut down for weeks because of Russia\u2019s weaponization of energy.\nWhat we\u2019ve been doing \u2013 and we\u2019ve also been working on this together for many, many weeks as we saw the Russian aggression in Ukraine and as we saw the ongoing weaponization of energy by Russia \u2013 is to work very closely with European partners as well as countries around the world to make sure that there is enough energy on world markets.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ve significantly increased our production as well as making available to Europe liquefied natural gas.\u00a0 And we\u2019re now the leading supplier of LNG to Europe to help compensate for any gas or oil that it\u2019s losing as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nWe\u2019ve worked to release oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to make sure as well that there is oil on the markets and to help keep prices down.\u00a0 We\u2019ve engaged with the European Union and established months ago a task force to work directly with Europe on ways to decrease demand to help get through the winter, as well as to pursue additional supply and to find ways to speed up the transition to renewables even as we\u2019re getting through this challenging period.\u00a0 So all of that work is ongoing.\nMy own sense \u2013 and I mentioned this the other day \u2013 is, look, there\u2019s a lot of hard work to do to make sure that countries and partners get through the winter.\u00a0 Europe itself has taken very significant steps to both decrease demand but also look at ways to pursue the transition to renewables at the same time.\u00a0 And ultimately this is also a tremendous opportunity.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy and thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing his imperial designs.\u00a0 That\u2019s very significant and that offers tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come, but meanwhile, we\u2019re determined to do everything we possibly can to make sure that the consequences of all of this are not borne by citizens in our countries or, for that matter, around the world.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0So to add to that, indeed, we have increased our production, and, therefore, by increasing our production, we have exported to the U.S. for it to be eventually sent to Europe.\u00a0 Jonathan Wilkinson, minister of natural resources, have been in close contact also with his counterpart on this.\nLooking forward, also, where Canada can really make a difference is through our new Kitimat LNG facility, which will be able to provide LNG starting 2025 and therefore increasing production, lowering prices.\u00a0 This will be also helpful for our European friends.\u00a0 And, as mentioned when Chancellor Scholz was in Canada recently with also his vice chancellor, we are also working with the Germans and many other European allies to find solutions for the next years when it comes to renewables, and the very important, significant investment in a hydrogen facility in Stephenville, Newfoundland is part also of that plan.\nSo we want to be there short term with the existing context we know.\u00a0 We want to be there in the middle term and we want to be there in the long term.\u00a0 We\u2019re obviously very seized of the energy security situation in Europe, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re in solution mode.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Joel Gehrke, Washington Examiner.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thank you both for doing this.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to begin with a question on Iran and then turn to Ukraine.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, Amnesty International says that collective action \u2013 it\u2019s the quote \u2013 \u201ccollective action by the international community [that goes] beyond\u2026statements of condemnation,\u201d end quote, is needed to halt the violent suppression of protests in Iran.\u00a0 And now an American citizen has been killed in Iraq, as the State Department has confirmed, and the IRGC has used ballistic missiles and other ordnance in a series of strikes in Iraq.\u00a0 Does the U.S. has a response to that beyond statements of condemnation?\nOn Ukraine, we saw this week a senior Ukrainian intelligence official said there\u2019s a very high risk of \u2013 that Russia will use a tactical nuclear weapon in some fashion.\u00a0 His recommendation in light of that was to call for anti-rocket systems from the U.S.\u00a0 Do you think that there is \u2013 are there weapons the U.S. can provide to mitigate the threat of a tactical nuclear strike?\u00a0 Do you think that the prudent response to such a nuclear threat is to attempt to deter by upgrading Ukrainian armaments or to keep U.S. military aid below some threshold that might be provocative?\nAnd then, of course, Canada and the United States both participated in the Copenhagen conference last month, which was focused on how to provide long-term support to the Ukrainians.\u00a0 We are apparently settling in for a longer \u2013 much longer conflict than maybe anybody expected.\u00a0 As you consider the options for long-term support, do you think that the West needs to help Ukraine transition to training on more advanced NATO systems, be those tanks or fighter jets or anything else?\u00a0 Or should the focus be more on financial support, perhaps, for increasing defense capacity \u2013 defense industrial production in the Czech Republic and other places that can produce Russian-style legacy equipment that they\u2019re more familiar with?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot there.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 That\u2019s more \u2013 one \u2013 than one question, actually.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Boy.\u00a0 Let me take a stab at it first \u2014\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 M\u00e9lanie, and then turn to you.\u00a0 First, on Iran, starting with the protests, the simple truth is this:\u00a0 Mahsa Amini should be alive right now, and her death in and of itself is a profound affront to human rights in Iran and, for that matter, everywhere.\u00a0 When we see the Iranian Government firing on peaceful protesters, then cutting off people\u2019s access to the global internet, we\u2019re not only watching this.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking action in response.\u00a0 You saw some of the actions that we\u2019ve taken already.\u00a0 We designated the so-called morality police, the institution responsible for her death, as well as seven other Iranian security officials involved in human rights abuses.\nAt the same time \u2013 and we talked about this earlier in the week \u2013 the Treasury Department issued new licenses that will facilitate the provision of communications equipment, software and hardware, to Iranians to allow them to better communicate amongst themselves and also with the rest of the world.\u00a0 And all of this is ongoing.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to look for ways to support those who are engaging in expressing themselves peacefully in Iran as well as taking actions against those who are responsible for the most repressive human rights violations that one can imagine.\u00a0 There\u2019s also a growing chorus of condemnation around the world, including in international institutions, something that the foreign minister and I discussed today.\nWith regard to the rocket attacks that took place, first and foremost, this was an assault on Iraqi sovereignty, which we\u2019ve seen again and again coming from Iran.\u00a0 We\u2019re supporting our Iraqi and our Kurdish partners in the face of this aggression.\u00a0 You\u2019ve of course seen international condemnation of Iran\u2019s actions, including from the Iraqi Government itself, and we\u2019ve always been clear that Iran cannot and will not act with impunity.\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated that we are willing to use a wide array of tools at our disposal to counter Iran\u2019s malign and destabilizing activities in the region.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in the past and, as necessary, we\u2019ll continue to do that in the future.\u00a0 This includes sanctions.\u00a0 It includes other financial measures.\u00a0 It includes diplomatic pressure.\u00a0 We\u2019ve used every tool in our arsenal as necessary, and when it comes to it, President Biden has not hesitated to act to protect our citizens as well as our service members from attack.\u00a0 So we\u2019re monitoring the situation very closely and, of course, we\u2019re coordinating with our partners, especially in the region.\nWhen it comes to the rhetoric we\u2019ve heard from President Putin on nuclear weapons, you heard us speak to this very directly at the United Nations this week. \u00a0This kind of loose talk about nuclear weapons is the height of irresponsibility and it\u2019s something that we take very seriously.\u00a0 We are looking very carefully to see if Russia is actually doing anything that suggests that they are contemplating the use of nuclear weapons.\u00a0 To date we\u2019ve not seen them take these actions, but we also know that Russia\u2019s engaged in horrific \u2013 a horrific brutalization of Ukraine.\u00a0 And so the threats that they make, we take very seriously.\u00a0 As to President Putin\u2019s intent, I\u2019m not going to speculate on what\u2019s in his mind.\u00a0 I can just tell you that we plan against every possible scenario, including this one.\nAs to the long-term support for Ukraine, this is a very important question, and a couple of things are, I think, worth underscoring.\u00a0 One is at every step along the way in the Russian aggression against Ukraine, we have worked to make sure that we are getting to the Ukrainians what they need to effectively defend themselves against the aggression.\u00a0 That started before the aggression, as you know, as we saw it possibly coming.\u00a0 Even as we were trying to do everything we could to stop it, to prevent it, we were working to help prepare the Ukrainians for the aggression and working with allies and partners to do that.\nGoing back a year ago \u2013 Labor Day of a year ago \u2013 the President did his first drawdown of defense equipment to Ukraine.\u00a0 We did another significant one just before Christmas \u2013 again, well before the Russian aggression.\u00a0 That put into Ukrainian hands the very things that they needed and used so effectively \u2013 Stingers, Javelins to repel the aggression directed at Kyiv in the attempt to take over the whole country.\u00a0 That failed in large part because of the courage of the Ukrainian people, but also because we helped them get ready.\nNow since then, what we\u2019ve been doing is making sure that we adapt and adjust as the nature of the aggression changes to make sure that they have what they need \u2013 but not only have what they need, that they can use it effectively and maintain it.\u00a0 Increasingly, you\u2019re seeing NATO standard systems going to Ukraine to deal with the ongoing Russian aggression.\u00a0 Part of that is training, and there\u2019s training that\u2019s happening right now outside of Ukraine to make sure that, as we provide these systems to them, they are able to effectively use them.\u00a0 And I think going forward, what Ukraine wants and needs is a strong defensive and deterrence system that makes it less likely in the future that Russia will act aggressively toward Ukraine, and that if it does nonetheless do that, that Ukraine is very well prepared.\nSo even as we\u2019re working in the moment to make sure that they have what they need right now, we\u2019re also working with them on the medium and the long term to make sure that they have what they need to have effective defense and effective deterrence against Russia.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to get into the details of what that involves, but it is a very important question that we\u2019re acting on right now.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0So commands a long answer, I guess.\u00a0 So on Iran, of course, Canada is standing up with these strong woman of Iran that are peacefully protesting in the streets of Tehran and across the territory.\u00a0 That is why also I mentioned our steadfast support to them when I was at the UN General Assembly and I gave the national address for Canada.\u00a0 That is why also we are sanctioning the so-called morality police like the U.S. is doing \u2013 and key leaders of that morality police.\u00a0 But I must say that lots of things are on the table.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve done a lot, but we need to do more and will do more.\u00a0 Also, Canada has been spearheading the \u2013 a UN resolution before the General Assembly making sure that we condemn Iran\u2019s human rights violations in general.\u00a0 And so that is why we\u2019ll continue to offer and present that leadership before the UN alongside many nations, obviously with the U.S.\nOn the question of Ukraine in general, of course \u2013 and particularly the question of nuclear threats, you\u2019ve heard the Secretary, you\u2019ve heard Jens Stoltenberg, head of NATO, and many of us say nobody wins when it comes to nuclear.\u00a0 So obviously this is unthinkable, but we have to be ready and we are having conversations particularly within the G7 on this very issue.\nOn also the question of whether this \u2013 the referendas and this so-called annexation by Russia of territories, obviously we do not recognize it.\u00a0 We do not want to give any form of legitimacy to it, and therefore, this won\u2019t change our military strategy.\u00a0 And so that is why we\u2019ll continue to send weaponry, and I would say, mainly where Canada\u2019s expertise is, is training of Ukrainian officers. We have done that since 2014.\u00a0 Before the war, we had trained already 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers. And so we are partnering with the UK on this and we are training out of the UK many of the Ukrainian officers.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Alex Panetta, CBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on two of the things that came up earlier in this news conference.\u00a0 And (via interpreter) could you answer partly in French?\u00a0 That would be very much appreciated.\n(In English) The first involves NATO and the accession process.\u00a0 It \u2013 when Sweden and Finland applied earlier this year, it proceeded with lightning speed.\u00a0 Would you anticipate that Ukraine would move that quicky through this process?\u00a0 Or, given the level of complexity and risk involved, are we talking years rather than months in this particular case?\nAnd a second is on eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 The weapons systems that NATO countries are providing to Ukraine, we can infer from your earlier answer that nothing will change in the way the war proceeds in eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 But could I ask you whether there are any instructions, any different instructions about whether or not Western weapons systems can be used on eastern Ukrainian territory?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci pour cette question.\n(Via interpreter) I can only repeat that NATO\u2019s door will remain open, including for Ukraine.\u00a0 There is a well-known process for countries that seek to join NATO, a process that Ukraine, amongst other, continue to pursue if they wish so, Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.\n(In English) When it comes to Finland, and Sweden \u2013 as you know, these countries were both very long-time NATO partners that, in many ways, have been de facto allies for a long, long time, working in very close coordination with NATO, having very advanced militaries that are fully interoperable already with NATO, with equipment that is also fully compatible with what NATO countries have, and of course, strong democracies that have been partners as part of the European Union and with us for many, many, many years.\u00a0 So I think that explains the rapidity with which this process has moved forward.\nWhen it comes to the aggression in eastern Ukraine and southern Ukraine, and \u2013 but particularly now, the purported annexation of territory \u2013 we have been very clear about this.\u00a0 And as you\u2019ve just heard M\u00e9lanie repeat, it has no validity, no legitimacy, no legal standing.\u00a0 This territory remains Ukraine\u2019s.\u00a0 It will always be a part of Ukraine.\u00a0 We will never recognize the purported annexation of this territory.\u00a0 And as I said, Ukraine has every right to defend all of its territory, to defend the people who are there, and to take back territory that was illegally seized from it in the first place.\u00a0 And our support to Ukraine will continue, and that support can be used as Ukraine sees fit throughout the country to defend its territory and, as necessary, to take it back.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So regarding Sweden and Finland, obviously we value the fact that they joined NATO.\u00a0 We were the first country in the world to ratify the accession.\u00a0 Because they are also Arctic countries, it was in Canada\u2019s interest to speed up ratification.\nAnd as I mentioned before, we believe that Ukraine should be part of NATO.\u00a0 It has been our position for now more than a decade, and we believe in the \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy.\n(Via interpreter) In French.\u00a0 It is evident that, as far as we\u2019re concerned, it\u2019s important that Sweden and Finland should join NATO.\u00a0 Why so?\u00a0 Because these are also countries which are part of those countries of the Arctic.\u00a0 So necessarily, it was in Canada\u2019s interest to ensure that they would join NATO quickly.\u00a0 In fact, we were the first country in the world to ratify their accession.\u00a0 Now, with respect to Ukraine as such, we have always had an \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy.\u00a0 Our position has always been that NATO[1]\u00a0should become a member of NATO.\n(In English) This will change our military strategy.\u00a0 How will we react?\u00a0 I have answered that question.\u00a0 Clearly, like the Secretary \u2013 like Tony mentioned, we do not recognize Putin\u2019s words.\u00a0 He is spreading lies again.\u00a0 This is part of political theater.\u00a0 Nobody is buying it.\u00a0 And so that is why we will not change the course of our actions, and that is why we will continue to work with the U.S. on this, and all our European counterparts.\u00a0 And definitely, we need to continue to do more.\n(Via interpreter) As I said in English and as I had responded previously, we will not recognize the legitimacy of the referenda and, of course, the annexation by Putin.\u00a0 To us, this is political theater, a staging by President Putin, who continues truly to lie to his population and to the world.\u00a0 There is absolutely no legitimacy as to what he did.\u00a0 Therefore, we will not change the course of things.\u00a0 We will not change our actions.\u00a0 Quite the contrary, we will redouble efforts for the Ukrainian people because we believe we are in that period currently where, more than ever, we must be alongside our Ukrainian brothers.\nMR

And colleagues, it is wonderful to see you all around this table. Thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the State Department. Welcome to the Benjamin Franklin Room. You can see to my left Franklin looking out over us. He was America\u2019s first diplomat. He signed our first treaty. He did a few other things too: he charted the Gulf Stream; he helped pioneer electricity; he development \u2013 he developed our ethos of self-government. And virtually none of this did he do while sober. (Laughter.) So I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be a problem for us this afternoon, but nonetheless I wanted to welcome you in his presence.\nAnd I am truly delighted to be able to kick off the first-ever U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit.\nThis summit reflects our deep and enduring partnership with the Pacific Islands, one that\u2019s underpinned by a shared history, values, and enduring people-to-people ties. Together we\u2019ll discuss the challenges that we face, exchange ideas and perspectives, and chart a way forward to deliver on the issues that matter most to our people.\nI am very grateful today to be joined by Peace Corps Acting Director Carol Spahn[1], Millennium Challenge Corporation CEO Alice Albright \u2013 two essential partners in doing the work of teaming up with the peoples of the Pacific Islands to advance development across the region, which is what we\u2019re here today to discuss.\nAnd I\u2019d very much like to thank Suzy for her leadership not just today in helping to moderate the discussion, but exceptional leadership of the East-West Center, which really brings us together day in, day out. We\u2019re grateful for that. Suzy, you\u2019ve dedicated most of your life to strengthening ties between the United States and our Pacific partners, and I just want to congratulate you on becoming both the first Native Hawaiian and the first woman to lead the East-West Center.\nThis summit is the latest effort on the part of this administration to hear directly from you about your priorities, your ideas, your hopes for the future of the region and the world, and especially how we can work together to try to achieve them.\nMany of us were together at the Partners of the Blue Pacific Ministerial meeting that we hosted last week in New York on the margins of the UN General Assembly. We brought together countries around the vision that you and others set out in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\nToday\u2019s discussion also builds on the Pacific Leaders Summit that our gracious hosts in Fiji convened in February \u2013 grateful for that; Vice President Harris\u2019s engagement with the Pacific Islands Forum in July; Deputy Secretary of State Sherman\u2019s meetings with many of you during the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders.\nWhat I hope that you take away from these engagements is that the United States shares your vision, and we are committed to help realize it.\nIt\u2019s a vision that recognizes that only by working together can we actually tackle the biggest challenges of our time that confront all of our citizens, from combating the climate crisis and health emergencies, to promoting economic opportunity, to preserving a free and open Indo\u2011Pacific where every nation \u2013 no matter how big, no matter how small \u2013 has the right to choose its own path.\nYou can count on the United States partnering with you to rally other countries around this vision across major international gatherings \u2013 from the UN General Assembly, to COP, to the Summit for Democracy.\nWe also have the same vision for individuals. Like you, we want every person to be able to choose their path, no matter who they are or where they\u2019re born, and have a chance to reach their full potential. That\u2019s what people-centered development is all about.\nDelivering on that goal demands that we find pathways for people to build knowledge and to share ideas across communities, across borders, and that\u2019s going to be a key focus of the discussion today: deepening our people-to-people ties and our educational exchanges.\nWe\u2019re doing that through a number of programs, including ones like TechGirls, which brings high school-age girls from across the world to the United States for a summer exchange to build the knowledge, the skills, the networks that will help them pursue higher education and careers in STEM \u2013 in the sciences and technology.\nToday, we\u2019ll also discuss ways to build greater resilience across the region.\nOne of the messages that we\u2019ve heard loud and clear from Pacific Island leaders is that building resilience is about more than equipping communities to adapt to the effects of the climate crisis, which for many of you is an existential threat; it\u2019s also about preparing communities to weather a wide range of interrelated shocks that we know have caused cascading effects.\nThat reflects the world that we live in, where the changing climate is accelerating the spread of deadly viruses, where transnational criminal organizations not only threaten our security, through corruption and human trafficking, but also biodiversity, through smuggling irreplaceable wildlife and timber.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with you to deepen resilience across the board \u2013 from bolstering health security through better early warning and response systems to diseases like Dengue, to launching a program called Resilient Blue Economies, which will strengthen marine livelihoods by supporting sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, tourism. Today, I am very pleased to announce that the United States will contribute $4.8 million to this new effort.\nI have to tell you, though, that I\u2019m especially pleased as we start our conversations, as we start these two days with President Biden joining us tomorrow, that we have also come together around a declaration of partnership between the U.S. and the Pacific, one that shows that we have a shared vision for the future and a determination to build that future together.\nSo I\u2019m very pleased that we have this today, that we\u2019ve agreed on it, and it will give us a roadmap for the work that we\u2019re doing in the future.\nMost important, I\u2019m really looking forward to this conversation, to listening, to hearing from each and every one of you so that we can be a better, stronger, more effective partner in the future that we\u2019re working to build together.\nSuzy, with that, back to you.\n\nChief Executive Officer Carol Spahn \u2191\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-millennium-challenge-corporation-mou-signing-with-malawian-president-lazarus-chakwera-malawian-finance-and-economic-affairs-minister-sosten-gwengwe-and-mcc-ceo-ali/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Thank you all so much for joining us today to celebrate a remarkable moment in the longstanding partnership between the United States and the Republic of Malawi.\nMy name is Alice, and I am the CEO of the Millennium Challenge Corporation.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to thank you so much, Secretary Blinken, for convening us and hosting us today in the wonderful State Department.\u00a0 I\u2019d also like to thank you, President Chakwera, and your finance minister, Minister Gwengwe, for being with us.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor to have you with us.\u00a0 Mr. President, thank you for your leadership and your commitment to building a prosperous future for all of the people of Malawi.\nIt\u2019s a great honor to lead the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an agency that has invested $15 billion in grant financing towards programs that boost economic growth and reduce poverty.\u00a0 In Africa alone, we\u2019ve invested more than $9 billion across 25 countries on the continent in programs that are expected to benefit almost 90 million people.\n2022, this year, has been a particularly big year for the agency.\u00a0 All told, we expect to sign investments worth $1.8 billion that will directly benefit more than 13 million people, 75 percent of whom live on the continent.\u00a0 These investments will help deliver clean water, improve sanitation to help fight disease, make transportation more efficient through the construction of roads, boost agricultural yields by bringing irrigation to farmers, and increase access to reliable \u2013 to electricity so that households and businesses can thrive.\nMCC\u2019s partnership with Malawi dates back nearly two decades.\u00a0 In 2004, MCC\u2019s board of directors selected Malawi as eligible for a $21 million threshold program.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we got started.\u00a0 And together, with that threshold program, we tackled key policy areas to help improve public financial management.\u00a0 Then between 2013 and 2018, MCC and the Government of Malawi partnered to undertake a $350 million compact which was designed to overhaul the country\u2019s power sector by constructing and refurbishing 26 sub-stations and 400 kilometers of transmission and distribution lines, delivering an additional 12 megawatts of clean energy and boosting the country\u2019s hydropower generation capability.\u00a0 Those transformative investments in the country\u2019s power sector are expected to benefit over 7 million Malawians, including people like Valison Fira, who\u2019s a butcher who lives in Lilongwe and whose business needs reliable, affordable electricity to thrive.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBuilding on this success and Malawi\u2019s strong commitment to democratic governance, MCC\u2019s board then selected Malawi for a second compact in 2018.\u00a0 And today we are signing that.\u00a0 So it\u2019s a great moment.\nAnd since then, MCC has developed this new compact, again in close partnership with your country, Excellency, and everyone on your team, and also with close consultation with the private sector and civil society.\nAnd so today, Mr. President, Mr. Secretary of State, we are so proud to continue our longstanding partnership by investing another $350 million to reduce transport costs and strengthen land administration in the country.\u00a0 MCC\u2019s $350 million grant is further complemented by a $26 million contribution in-kind from the Government of Malawi.\u00a0 And again, a strong signal of your government\u2019s commitment to the success of the compact.\nThis compact which you will sign today is called the Malawi Transport and Land Compact, and it will reduce transportation costs and improve the ability of farmers to get their products to market by upgrading more than 300 kilometers of roads.\u00a0 This will be a help to farmers like Agnes Kapuka, who told my team that a new road would save her enormous amounts of time and money to help getting her products to market.\nThis program also prioritizes road safety and provides technical assistance to the Malawi Roads Authority to improve maintenance and planning.\u00a0 And further, the compact will support the Government of Malawi in addressing competition policy to help ensure that transport costs over time decrease while promoting sustainable management of the transport sector, including at the local level.\nArable land is one of Malawi\u2019s greatest resources, and this compact will also support reforms to help expand national land-based revenues and key institutional changes needed to increase productivity.\nAfter all the work is completed, MCC and Malawi will have worked together on more than $747 million worth of transformative projects, benefiting a total of 12 million people \u2013 more than half the country\u2019s population.\nI\u2019d like to thank everybody involved who has worked so hard to advance these important investments.\u00a0 I especially want to commend the tireless work of the MCC team \u2013 many of which are there; there\u2019s Joel.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And when we work closely with a team, we also work very closely with people in the countries with whom we work, and I also would like to recognize Dye Mawindo, who has worked tirelessly.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo that\u2019s the team over there that\u2019s done all the hard work to make this a reality.\u00a0 So again, huge thank you.\u00a0 There\u2019s lots to go, though, but huge thank you.\nI\u2019d also like to recognize Ambassador Young \u2013 where\u2019s David?\u00a0 There\u2019s David.\u00a0 Hi, Ambassador Young \u2013 for his tireless support to bring this to fruition.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We also have a lot of work ahead of us, so we\u2019re going to call you a lot, as well as Malawi\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Justice Esmie Chombo.\u00a0 Thank you so much, Madam Ambassador.\nAlso I know that there are two teams in Washington and Malawi that have contributed huge amounts of their technical expertise to making this compact a reality.\u00a0 I can\u2019t name everybody here, but they\u2019ve all done an excellent job, and one of the secrets to Malawi \u2013 to MCC\u2019s success in working with countries, Malawi being a strong example, is how closely our teams work together on technical matters.\u00a0 So you have my huge gratitude, everybody involved to make today a reality, and we very much look forward to making \u2013 to signing and getting on with really the deep, hard work to get on with the success of the compact.\nSo today\u2019s celebration is only a beginning.\u00a0 Much of the challenging work lies ahead.\u00a0 I look forward to working with all of you to ensure that the Malawi Transport and Land Compact delivers and helps give the people of Malawi the tools they need to build a more prosperous future.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019m now going to call a number of our distinguished guests to come and share their remarks.\u00a0 So with that, I would like to first introduce our next speaker, the Malawian minister of finance and economic affairs, Sosten Alfred Gwengwe.\u00a0 He has been absolutely instrumental in getting this compact organized.\u00a0 He\u2019s also a member of parliament in Malawi and has served in cabinet in various positions, including the minister of transport and industry and trade.\u00a0 He was appointed by the minister of finance and economic affairs in January 2022, and we are so pleased to have you with us today, Honorable Minister.\u00a0 Please, Minister, the podium is yours.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMINISTER GWENGWE:\u00a0 The president of the Republic of Malawi, His Excellency Dr. Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera; Secretary of State of the United States of America, His Excellency Antony Blinken; the MCC CEO, Ms. Alice Albright; Ambassador Chombo; Ambassador David; the MCC vice president for the compact operations, Ms. Kim \u2013 think I\u2019ve seen you right there; secretary to the president, Madam Zamba; all protocols observed.\u00a0 Your Excellencies, today is a very special day for Malawi, because this day marks the conclusion of several years of very hard work on the part of our two teams, the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Malawi Millennium Development Trust.\nIf we\u2019re overjoyed therefore, please do understand it is because we can now breathe a huge sigh of relief on the completion of the compact development work.\u00a0 My\u00a0congratulations\u00a0\u2013 (applause) \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 My\u00a0congratulations\u00a0go to all who have contributed in various ways in making today a reality.\nYour Excellencies, I can report that throughout the multiyear compact development process, the MCC and the MMD engaged in regular and inclusive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders.\u00a0 These consultations sought to identify the binding constraints to our economic growth, assess underlying root causes driving these binding constraints, identify potential project opportunities, and make informed design decisions for the various interventions.\u00a0 These consultations included relevant government ministries and departments, local communities likely to be impacted by the program, and related local officials, representatives from the local and international civil societies, and nongovernment organizations, private sector leaders, and also development partners.\nAnd the proposed interventions under this compact include two main projects; firstly, the construction of four corridor roads in the three regions of Malawi, and this proposed activity seeks to reduce travel time and costs for smallholder farmers throughout \u2013 through the improvement of targeted roads in selected transport sector.\u00a0 This will improve road conditions and thereby facilitate greater flow of agricultural products from farm gates to urban, regional, and export markets.\nAnd secondly, the land project that will improve land administration services in our main land institutions \u2013 this is a policy and institutional reform activity that seeks to improve Malawi\u2019s land governance institutions, especially with respect to the revenues that these organizations rely on to operate efficiently and effectively.\u00a0 We are convinced that increased funding at national and city levels and expenditure system improvements will translate into improved land services to our people.\nYour Excellencies, I am aware that the signing of the second compact will mark the beginning of a fresh set of tasks that need to be undertaken before the compact can enter into force.\u00a0 And so, whereas the compact development exercise has been concluded, our two teams cannot afford to lower their guard.\u00a0 We have a long list of conditions that have to be fulfilled and administrative actions that are required to be undertaken.\u00a0 I am advised that the average lapsed time between compact signing and entry into force can range between 12 months or so.\u00a0 We in Malawi are determined to keep this period to the barest minimum.\u00a0 I can promise you, Your Excellencies, that we will leave no stone unturned to do our part.\u00a0 And I call upon all the stakeholders to work together to ensure that this waiting period is kept to the shortest period as \u2013 to as short a period as possible.\nI end my remarks this morning by underscoring our profound gratitude to the American Government for this and other equally life-changing interventions to the people of Malawi.\u00a0 I am also indebted to the compact development team, the MMD, the Malawi side, led by Dye Mawindo, and Joel Wiegert, leading the MCC team on our side.\u00a0 They have worked very long hours.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They have worked very long hours to develop the various activities that now comprise the interventions under the second compact.\nOn that note, it is now my similar honor to invite His Excellency the President of the Republic of Malawi Dr. Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera to address us.\u00a0 Your Excellency, sir.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS ALBRIGHT:\u00a0 Thank you, Honorable Minister.\u00a0 I look forward to working with you to make this compact a success, and you have my full assurance that I and my team will work very quickly, as much as we can, to move things along.\nIt is now my distinct honor to introduce our next speaker, the United States Secretary of State, Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken began his career in public service at the State Department and over the subsequent three decades has served in three presidential administrations and has helped shape U.S. foreign policy to assure that it protects U.S. interests and delivers results for the American people.\u00a0 He\u2019s also been kind enough to host us today.\u00a0 So please join me in welcoming the Secretary of State to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It is wonderful to see you here, to see you at the State Department, on a very happy and positive occasion.\nMr. President, Mr. Minister, thank you for your partnership, but thank you especially for your leadership.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll have more to say about that in a few minutes, but it\u2019s been remarkable and deeply, deeply appreciated.\nAlice, thank you for your leadership of the Millennium Challenge Corporation.\u00a0 It is always a good day at the State Department when an Albright is here in this building.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I just want to say to you and to your MCC colleagues: extraordinary work on this, but also around the world.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure if we need to think about changing what MCC stands for.\u00a0 Maybe \u201cMaking Change Concrete.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 \u201cMaking Change Cool.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But both of those are true, and it\u2019s incredibly powerful, and I\u2019m really so pleased to be able to join all of you in celebrating Malawi\u2019s second Millennium Challenge Corporation compact.\nThis agreement opens a new chapter in the partnership between the United States and Malawi \u2013 one that builds on our close collaboration over decades, as we\u2019ve heard, our shared democratic values, and a joint vision for a prosperous, stable, resilient Malawi.\nAs we\u2019ve heard, this compact will contribute up to $350 million to reduce poverty and support inclusive economic growth in Malawi.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll do this by strengthening two critical building blocks: roads and land administration.\u00a0 You heard Alice talk about this, but this really is in a sense where the rubber meets the road.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredibly powerful.\nFirst, upgrading major roads will make urban markets more accessible, so that people in rural areas can travel quickly and cheaply, and more swiftly bring their products to market.\u00a0 In the doing, we\u2019ll also help combat gender-based violence along these roads and markets, so that women can safely transport and sell their goods.\nSecond, improving government administration will help Malawi make the most of one of its core economic resources, and that\u2019s land.\u00a0 Helping strengthen record keeping, for example, will make it easier for families and marginalized people to prove that they own their land \u2013 and protect themselves from exploitation.\u00a0 For companies, these records will mean that they can invest with confidence, they can grow their businesses, they can create more jobs for Malawian citizens.\nWhat\u2019s so critical and what\u2019s so important about the way the MCC does its work is that we\u2019ve developed these priorities together \u2013 identifying the barriers to economic opportunity, devising ways to solve them.\u00a0 Malawi will take the lead in putting these plans into action.\nLike all MCC endeavors, these projects will be transparent, they\u2019ll be collaborative, and built to meet the highest standards of quality.\u00a0 They\u2019ll provide grants to Malawi, not debt.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And they\u2019ll support Malawi\u2019s development and its efforts to strengthen good governance, accountability, democracy \u2013 the hallmarks of the president\u2019s administration.\nWith these new projects, the United States and Malawi will build upon the progress we\u2019ve made through the MCC \u2013 and through many other partnerships that we have.\nFor decades, we\u2019ve worked with Malawi\u2019s government, with NGOs, with civil society, with the private sector on a broad range of issues, including combatting HIV/AIDS.\u00a0 The United States has contributed $1 billion to this effort over the last two decades, and in the last dozen years alone, we\u2019ve reduced the number of HIV and AIDS-related deaths by 80 percent.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 These partnerships are quite literally changing lives.\nDuring COVID, the United States has been able to donate more than 2.3 million safe, effective vaccine doses through COVAX \u2013 free of charge, with more to come as needed \u2013 to help protect Malawians from death and severe illness.\nWe\u2019ve expanded access to public universities in Malawi, offering scholarships, distance learning programs that have benefitted more than 1,500 students who otherwise might not have been able to attend.\nAnd for years, we\u2019ve collaborated to strengthen Malawi\u2019s food security \u2013 improving nutrition, increasing food production, connecting more farmers to markets.\u00a0 Now, President Putin\u2019s war of choice on Ukraine has contributed to driving up the price of food, the price of fuel, fertilizers, as well as their availability, including in Malawi \u2013 rolling back some of the hard-earned development gains and driving more people back into poverty.\nWe are determined to act effectively against this, to help lift people up to help create their own capacity to produce in a sustainable way the food that not only Malawi needs, but that other countries in Africa and even beyond need.\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced that there is a remarkably positive opportunity to build durable agricultural capacity and production in Malawi so even as we respond to the immediate, we will work together on the long term.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd Mr. President, I want to acknowledge again your leadership, your deep commitment to democratic and economic reform.\u00a0 And to you, to the finance minister, you\u2019ve been stalwart partners, and I know that this is an incredibly challenging time.\u00a0 Malawi\u2019s been on the receiving end of an \u2013 almost a perfect storm of challenges.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had climate change, we\u2019ve had COVID, we\u2019ve had conflict \u2013 that are all having consequences for the Malawian people.\u00a0 And I can just tell you that the United States is committed to working with you, not only to get through the stormy period, but to get to a brighter, enduring day, and this day is one of them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nOne critical component to this is the extended credit facility with the IMF, something the United States strongly supports.\u00a0 We are stepping up to try to help those who are in greatest immediate need.\u00a0 One way we\u2019re doing that is through the President\u2019s decision to significantly expand the Feed the Future program.\u00a0 This is the flagship program that the United States has to end global hunger, to combat malnutrition.\u00a0 We\u2019ve extended it to eight new countries, including Malawi.\nSo what does that mean?\u00a0 Over the next five years, we are working with Congress to invest over $11 billion around the world toward, again, not only responding to the immediate crisis, but \u2013 critically \u2013 building resilience that will better prepare communities worldwide not only to withstand future shocks, but again, to have enduring agricultural productive capacity.\nA few months ago, I was at the United Nations.\u00a0 We convened countries around the food and security crisis that we\u2019re facing.\u00a0 And one of the things that was most striking to me was \u2013 even as we met with a large group of foreign ministers, we seized the Security Council \u2013 I spent some time with 10 colleagues from Africa, and the thing that resonated loudly and clearly with me was the desire and need not only for emergency assistance to combat the current crisis, but even more for helping together, as partners, build sustainable, durable production in Africa by Africans.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn these areas and more, the United States is dedicated to finding solutions to the biggest challenges of our time with Malawi and its people, not for Malawi.\u00a0 That\u2019s the guiding principle.\u00a0 That\u2019s the guiding principle of this administration\u2019s partnership with Malawi; it\u2019s the guiding principle of our strategy for sub-Saharan Africa, which I had a chance to lay out recently in South Africa.\nAnd fundamentally, it\u2019s the only way that any of us can achieve our shared goals, whether it\u2019s creating economic opportunity, ending public health crises, fighting hunger, building a better future of opportunity for all our people.\nWe know that when we work together, we can accomplish real change for our people.\u00a0 That\u2019s what today is about.\u00a0 It is accomplishing real change for the people of Malawi.\nAnd again, we don\u2019t have to look any further than the MCC and the impact that it\u2019s already had.\nWe\u2019ve mentioned a couple of real people, individuals, who will benefit.\u00a0 I want to mention another one, a woman by the name of Judith, who participated in Malawi\u2019s first MCC compact.\u00a0 She used to do small-scale farming, selling peanuts and selling peas.\u00a0 Through the MCC, she learned how to raise and sell tree seedlings \u2013 with her profits, she was able to cover school tuition for her child.\u00a0 One of her business partners was able to build a better house.\u00a0 Their new venture also slowed soil erosion \u2013 which helped protect a nearby river and decrease interruptions to the hydropower it generated.\nSo we can see an incredibly virtuous cycle that this produces, and it starts with a compact and it ripples outward in incredibly powerful ways.\nSo I look forward to continuing this work together and to seeing the new opportunities, the concrete opportunities, the concrete change that this compact will bring.\u00a0 It will open \u2013 help open an even brighter future for the people of Malawi and for the partnership between our countries.\u00a0 So to all of you, Mr. President, Alice, thank you so much for today, and we\u2019re looking forward to many days ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Applause.)\nMS ALBRIGHT:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken, for those remarks.\u00a0 We thank you, again, for your leadership as our relationship with Malawi continues to thrive and advance.\nI\u2019m now pleased to introduce our final speaker for today, the President of the Republic of Malawi President Chakwera.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to have you with us.\u00a0 President Chakwera has also served as a member of parliament in Malawi, served as the chairman of the South African Development Community between August 2021 and August 2022.\u00a0 We are so, so excited to have you here today.\u00a0 President Chakwera, let me respectfully ask you to come join us at the podium.\nThank you.\n(Applause.)\nPRESIDENT CHAKWERA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Good morning.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\nPRESIDENT CHAKWERA:\u00a0\u00a0Honorable Mr. Secretary, Ms. Albright, ambassadors, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, this is an historic occasion.\u00a0 The signing of this second MCC Compact for Malawi is no ordinary event.\u00a0 This is very, very important program for Malawi and a test, not only to the longstanding cordial relations between Malawi and the United States, but also to the progress that Malawi has made in recent months to meet the exacting standards of MCC\u2019s scorecard, the policies we have implemented for the advancement of governance, economic freedom, democracy, people-centered investments, and the fight against corruption.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019m aware that after Malawi\u2019s selection for its first MCC compact in the energy sector before I came into office, progress had stalled for years in securing this second compact for the transport sector because of issues of corruption.\u00a0 But in the past two years, my administration has taken a zero-tolerance stance against corruption, shielding no one from investigation and prosecution, as well as removing and suspending from office those with a case to answer before our independence and credible courts of justice.\nOur desire in doing so is to ensure that everyone understands that on our list of obstacles of Malawi\u2019s development, corruption ranks number one.\u00a0 And so we consider it our biggest enemy.\u00a0 We will therefore continue to fight it and stand against it no matter how long it takes until it is defeated.\u00a0 The fight against corruption ensures that investments like the MCC compact fulfill their intended purpose and yield their intended benefits.\nFrom the first MCC compact, we saw the construction of over 400 kilometers of transmission and distribution lines.\u00a0 We saw the refurbishment of 26 substations, resulting in both extended access to reliable power throughout the country.\u00a0 We saw the upgrading of Nkhula A Hydroelectric power plant through which its generation capacity was increased by 33 percent.\u00a0 We saw progress towards the trading the of power with Mozambique and the SADC region through the Southern African Power Pool. \u00a0We saw creation of an enabling environment for independent private sector power producers to enter the market.\u00a0 And with this second compact, we will see the construction of roads across the country.\nThe MCC second compact for Malawi comes at a very opportune time, as it will augment my government\u2019s effort to create a conducive environment for private sector growth, especially to benefit smallholder farmers in rural areas in Mzimba, Lilongwe, Mangochi.\nAnd so I thank MCC for their unwavering support given to my government to secure this compact development process.\u00a0 May I also take this opportunity to thank all those who participated in constraints analysis process from MCC, government, local government authorities, private sector, and nonstate actors who provided information and technical advice to the compact development team.\nMany names have been mentioned already, and on this note, allow me to refer to an earlier conversation that I had with MCC\u2019s CEO when I was last here in March.\u00a0 I would like to reiterate the point that I made then.\u00a0 During that conversation, I had asked MCC to consider complementing the investment that is to be made through this second compact with one in the three countries of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia by way of a regional compact.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs the immediate past chair of SADC, I believe that enhancing regional integration with our neighbors through foundational infrastructure, such as rail and roads, will have phenomenal economic benefits as safe and reliable rail and road transport investments will certainly help reduce barriers to growth and create opportunities for all of our people.\u00a0 In our case, as a land-linked country, securing a reliable and inexpensive link to the sea would de-risk our economy.\u00a0 This is as request that I\u2019d like to leave with MCC to continue to mull over \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as we think ahead.\nBut I am most grateful once again to the American people and the U.S. Government for their partnership in developing Malawi.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re making strides for everyone\u2019s good.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS ALBRIGHT:\u00a0\u00a0Your Excellency, thank you.\u00a0 Wonderful remarks.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 Your leadership will be absolutely essential to ensuring this compact is a success.\nI\u2019d like to now invite the Secretary of State as well as the minister of finance up to the podium and we will actually sign.\u00a0 Thank you.\n(The memorandum was signed.)\n(Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-tajikistan-foreign-minister-sirojiddin-muhriddin-before-their-meeting-2/",

morning, everyone.\u00a0 Mr. Minister, my friend, welcome back to Washington.\u00a0 It is always a pleasure to meet Minister Jaishankar, whether it\u2019s here, in New York, in Delhi, Melbourne, Bali, or anywhere else.\nAnd I think our own conversations \u2013 deep, extended conversations that have taken place in fact over many years, because we were counterparts when I was last at the State Department as deputy secretary \u2013 I think it reflects the fact that the partnership between our countries, between India and the United States, is simply one of the most consequential in the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s vital to addressing virtually every global challenge that our people face, whether it\u2019s health security, climate change, food security, upholding the free and open international order, to name just a few.\nOver the past years, we have made real progress in elevating that partnership \u2013 bilaterally, that is directly between us, through institutions like the Quad and the G20, and in international organizations, including at the United Nations.\u00a0 Today, we talked about how we can further advance our shared security, economic, and geopolitical goals.\nLast week in New York, we were both witness to genuine unity among the vast majority of UN member-states \u2013 developing and developed, big and small, north and south \u2013 on the need to work together to address the shared challenges that all of our people face, as well as to uphold the United Nations Charter and its core principles, including sovereignty, territorial integrity, and human rights.\nWe\u2019re grateful for the minister\u2019s partnership and leadership on these fronts.\u00a0 That includes in the Security Council, where, as we were together, he underscored the message that Prime Minister Modi delivered recently in Uzbekistan that, and I quote, \u201ctoday\u2019s era is not of war.\u201d\u00a0 And then in the General Assembly, where the prime minister said of India, and I quote, \u201cWe are on the side that respects the UN Charter and its founding principles,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 So is the United States.\nWe recognize that to meet the challenges we face, members of the UN must not only uphold the charter, but also modernize the institution, including by making the Security Council more inclusive.\nThat\u2019s why, in his address to the General Assembly, President Biden expressed his support for increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the Security Council, a long-standing goal of India.\u00a0 This includes permanent seats for those nations we\u2019ve long supported, and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean.\nIn his own General Assembly address, the minister also highlighted the food, fuel, and fertilizer crises that have hit countries as they struggle to rebuild from the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 And indeed, if you look at how we spent most of our week last week at the United Nations, it was focusing on these very challenges.\nWe\u2019ve been working to rally allies and partners not only to help people around the world most affected by these crises, but also to make sure that we are part of the solution to creating durable ways of dealing with these challenges.\u00a0 For example, on food security, not only responding to the emergency need but also helping countries develop durable agricultural productive capacity.\nWe know as well that each of these crises has been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why we continue to marshal international pressure on President Putin to end his war of choice.\nWe also held a Quad ministerial on the margins of the UN, with the minister and I continuing to work with our Australian and Japanese counterparts to realize what is a shared vision of a free, open Indo-Pacific that\u2019s connected, that\u2019s prosperous, that\u2019s secure, and that is resilient.\nAnd here it\u2019s worth emphasizing that we\u2019re bringing complementary strengths to bear on problems none of us can address effectively alone.\u00a0 A few examples \u2013 cyber crime.\u00a0 You saw in the joint commitment that we issued in New York last week our agreement to deny safe haven to ransomware operations emanating from within our respective countries \u2013 because a foothold anywhere can be used to stage attacks everywhere \u2013 and to assist one another in the face of cyber attacks against critical infrastructure.\nOne of the clearest ways that Quad partners can continue to deliver for people across the region is by being there in their times of their greatest need.\u00a0 In New York, we also took a step that will increase our capacity to do that.\u00a0 We signed a set of guidelines to deepen our coordination among the four countries on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nIn today\u2019s meeting, and as well at dinner last night, we also talked about ways to further strengthen our strategic partnership and advance shared objectives.\nThis includes helping one another prevent a climate catastrophe and adapt to the changes to come, because the future of our people, and people everywhere, depends in no small part on hitting the ambitious targets that we\u2019ve both set.\u00a0 That includes India\u2019s goal of installing 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, which would mean more than 60 percent of India\u2019s electricity comes from non-polluting energy sources.\nWe\u2019re helping do that through the U.S.-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership, which is helping to foster joint research and development, mobilizing finance from the private sector and multilateral institutions, and finding ways to scale up innovative clean energy technologies.\nAs the world\u2019s two biggest democracies, we\u2019re also committed to an enduring project \u2013 as our founders put it \u2013 of striving to form a more perfect union.\u00a0 This is a project for both of us.\u00a0 We have to work together to show that our democracies can meet our people\u2019s needs, and we must continue to hold ourselves \u2013 both of us, as well as our fellow democracies \u2013 to our core values, including respect for universal human rights like freedom of religion and belief and freedom of expression, which makes our democracies stronger.\nWe explored ways to keep building our dynamic economic partnership.\u00a0 The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which we launched in May, is one way we\u2019ll do this.\u00a0 Just a few weeks ago, India affirmed its intention to participate in three of the framework\u2019s pillars \u2013 on supply chains, clean economy, and fair economy.\nThe U.S. is India\u2019s largest trading partner, with $157 billion last year in bilateral trade.\u00a0 We\u2019re India\u2019s largest source of foreign direct investment, with a diverse range of U.S. companies investing $45 billion in India \u2013 Google, Microsoft, Whirlpool, Boeing, GE, and I could go on.\nBut we see more room to grow, and to do it in a way that creates jobs for workers in both of our countries.\u00a0 The U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue, the U.S.-India CEO Forum will give us more opportunities to do that in the months ahead.\nSo these are just some of the ways \u2013 multilaterally, regionally, bilaterally \u2013 that we\u2019re bringing this close relationship between India and the United States even closer together.\u00a0 And with India holding the presidency of the Security Council in December, and taking over the presidency of the G20 next year, we\u2019ll be able to drive more concerted global cooperation and action together.\nAt an event this weekend, you called, Mr. Minister, the shift in U.S.-India relations the single biggest change that you\u2019ve observed in decades of service as a diplomat.\u00a0 The minister said, and I quote, \u201cIt did not change only because of government policies; the relationship changed because of Indian Americans.\u201d\u00a0 And I could not agree more.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to have an Indian American community that does so much to deepen ties between our countries, as well as to shape the fabric of this country.\u00a0 And I\u2019d add that we\u2019re also grateful to communities in India, including of American origin, that are doing their part to strengthen the relationship for the good of both of our countries and both of our peoples.\nWith that, Jai, over to you.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 It is really a great pleasure to join Secretary Blinken at this media event at the conclusion of what I can honestly say is a very productive morning of discussions.\nI was last here in April, and obviously a lot of things in the world have changed since then.\u00a0 While we have spent quite some time this morning, I thank the Secretary and his wife for hosting us yesterday at the working dinner.\u00a0 This was really a very gracious gesture, and I think an occasion that both of us put to good use.\nObviously, a large part of our deliberations today were devoted to the strengthening of our bilateral relationship.\u00a0 Most of you would readily understand that it has grown very significantly in scope and depth over the last few years.\u00a0 We engage each other across pretty much every domain, and the quality of our cooperation \u2013 as indeed of our conversations \u2013 have steadily improved.\nIn today\u2019s meeting, we discussed our political coordination, working together in plurilateral and multilateral formats, and exchanging assessments and \u2013 on collaborating on important regional issues and global challenges.\u00a0 I would specifically mention the Ukraine conflict and the Indo-Pacific situation in that regard.\nI share with \u2013 I shared with Secretary Blinken my experience of interactions during the UN General Assembly about the deep anxieties in the Global South on fuel, on food, on fertilizers.\u00a0 The increasing salience of green growth, digital development, and affordable health is today very, very evident.\u00a0 We must not let current developments jeopardize Agenda 2030 on SDGs or to deflect us from climate action and climate justice commitments.\nOur cooperation in different bilateral domains is progressing vigorously.\u00a0 Naturally, Secretary Blinken and I did a comprehensive stock taking.\u00a0 But separately, I met Defense Secretary Austin and Commerce Secretary Raimondo to review their particular areas.\u00a0 I participated in a particularly interesting roundtable organized by the National Science Foundation.\nI will be meeting business leaders over the next two days.\u00a0 And given the bipartisan support that we have long enjoyed in the U.S. Congress, I look forward to interacting with some of its prominent members.\u00a0 There will also be an occasion for me engage think tanks and policy analysts so that there is a better understanding of India\u2019s concerns and interests.\nHaving said that, there are particular issues in the current global context that shape the evolution of our cooperation, and therefore merit your attention as well.\u00a0 Prominent among them is a commitment to address the global volatility which has arisen from the COVID, from conflicts, and from climate events.\u00a0 India and the U.S. have a strong interest in encouraging more resilient and reliable supply chains.\u00a0 This requires policy decisions as well as practical measures involving the business community.\u00a0 We are focused on those goals.\nFurthermore, the digital world mandates a greater emphasis on trust and transparency.\u00a0 This too has been the subject of detailed conversations and follow-up action.\u00a0 When it comes to critical and emerging technologies, we both see the value of expanding trusted research.\u00a0 Our national security, our economic security, our technology security, are all enhanced by closer collaboration.\u00a0 It is also in our mutual interest to facilitate the development and mobility of talent.\u00a0 We agreed that impediments in this regard should be addressed.\nThere is a keen interest in India\u2019s national education policy, and we will explore how that can best serve to expand our partnership.\nOn mobility, specifically visas, this is particularly crucial given its centrality to education, business, technology, and family reunions.\u00a0 There have been some challenges of late, and I flagged it to Secretary Blinken and his team and I have every confidence that they will look at some of these problems seriously and positively.\nAll these issues and more were evaluated not just in our bilateral context but also from the perspective of the Quad and the I2U2.\u00a0 We are keen to move forward on the Indo\u2011Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 I saw some creative thinking on how to repurpose established mechanisms for more contemporary collaboration.\nOur two countries have contributed \u2013 are committed to contributing to the betterment of the global commons.\u00a0 True to our traditions, we rise above narrow national interest to serve the needs of the larger international community.\u00a0 We do so on the basis of our belief in a rules-based order, in our respect for international law, and in our adherence to the UN Charter.\nIndia\u2011U.S. cooperation is today visible across the length and breadth of the Indo\u2011Pacific and perhaps even beyond.\u00a0 It has many facets and expresses itself in different ways.\u00a0 We particularly value closer coordination in the Indian subcontinent, where we perceive that our convergences are very strong.\u00a0 It is essential that democracy, pluralism, progress, development, and prosperity are nurtured.\u00a0 Conversely, we must counter radicalization, extremism, and fundamentalism.\u00a0 India is widening its international footprint, and there are many more regions where we will be intersecting with American interests.\u00a0 It is to our mutual benefit that this be a complementary process.\nComing out of the UNGA, or UNGA, the reform of the UN is a particularly topical subject.\u00a0 We appreciate the positive approach of the U.S. to this issue reflected in the position articulated by President Biden himself.\u00a0 We look forward to working with the U.S. to take this further.\u00a0 I also expressed appreciation at the strong cooperation that we have got from the U.S. on the question of tackling international terrorism.\u00a0 In particular, I refer to the listing of well-known and wanted terrorists by the UN sanction process.\u00a0 In many other formats too, our two countries collaborate to keep the world safer and more secure.\nWe spoke over the last two days of our commitment to practicing and furthering democracy, human rights, and good governance.\u00a0 Each country approaches the set of issues from their history, tradition, and societal context.\u00a0 Our yardstick for judgement are the integrity of the democratic processes, the respect and credibility that they command with the people, and the nondiscriminatory delivery of public goods and services.\u00a0 India does not believe that the efficacy or indeed the quality of democracy should be decided by word banks.\u00a0 This is an area where we look forward to a healthy exchange of views.\u00a0 There will be convergences and best practices that we can both profit by and perhaps even share with third countries.\nIndia will be taking over the presidency of the G20 at the end of this year.\u00a0 I appreciate the expression of support by Secretary Blinken towards making our chairship successful.\nOnce again, I thank the Secretary for his warm welcome, for the open and comfortable conversations we have had, and for his commitment to further what we both believe is the critical relationship of (inaudible).\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Iain Marlow of Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, we\u2019ve seen several reported leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline system that Germany has said could be an act of sabotage.\u00a0 What\u2019s the U.S. assessment of what we\u2019re seeing there, particularly given Russian \u2013 previous Russian moves to curtail gas supplies?\u00a0 And can you speak a little bit more broadly to the pressure that Europe is coming on \u2013 coming under as winter and a potential energy crisis looms?\nAnd External Affairs Minister Jaishankar, thanks for taking our questions.\u00a0 First, I\u2019m wondering if you could offer India\u2019s perspective on U.S. efforts to implement a global price cap on Russian energy.\u00a0 Would India consider joining that kind of price cap mechanism, and do you see it as potentially a way for India as well as other countries in the Global South to get more leverage and negotiate even cheaper prices for fuel?\nAnd just a second question, if I may.\u00a0 Can you talk a little bit about India\u2019s plans going forward for military hardware and equipment given the sanctions that the U.S. and others are putting on Russian industry and given India\u2019s historic reliance on Russian technology?\u00a0 How is India trying to head off challenges related to Russia being potentially unable to service that equipment going forward as a result of sanctions?\u00a0 Can Russia still fulfill all of India\u2019s requirements?\u00a0 And will India look at perhaps more purchases of, say, American or Israeli military equipment?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Iain, thanks very much.\u00a0 On the question on energy security and Nord Stream in particular, a few things.\u00a0 The leaks are under investigation.\u00a0 There are initial reports indicating that this may be the result of an attack or some kind of sabotage, but these are initial reports and we haven\u2019t confirmed that yet.\u00a0 But if it is confirmed, that\u2019s clearly in no one\u2019s interest.\u00a0 Now, my understanding is the leaks will not have a significant impact on Europe\u2019s energy resilience, and what\u2019s critical is that we are working day in, day out both on a short-term basis and a long-term basis to address energy security for Europe and, for that matter, around the world.\nShort term \u2013 just to cite a few examples \u2013 we are working on implementing the oil price cap to keep Russian oil flowing, but at a steep discount.\u00a0 That of course will deny Russia excess revenues that it would use to prosecute its aggression against Ukraine and, at the same time, as I said, keep oil flowing on world markets.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to continue to surge LNG supplies to Europe in cooperation with global partners, including in the Indo-Pacific.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that our own oil production is up by more than 500,000 barrels per day this year.\u00a0 Our LNG exports are up more than 20 percent since last year.\u00a0 In fact, we became the largest LNG supplier to the European Union and the UK this year, and we\u2019ve become the largest overall LNG exporter this year.\u00a0 And of course, as you know, we\u2019ve been tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at unprecedented levels.\u00a0 Others are doing the same.\u00a0 This is having an impact both on supply and on price.\nLong term, we\u2019re supporting efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, including LNG, over the long term, including through a task force that we established with the European Union some months ago on energy security that\u2019s working very actively, looking at ways both to reduce demand, to pursue renewables, to make the transition.\u00a0 And then we\u2019re working with global partners to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewables beyond Europe.\nIt\u2019s a long way of saying that there are clear challenges in the months ahead that we\u2019re addressing, but there is also a very significant opportunity to do two things.\u00a0 One, to finally end the dependence of Europe on Russian energy and thus the position that Europe is in of being on the receiving end of the weaponization of energy by Russia, and also to accelerate the transition to renewables and to make sure that we\u2019re addressing the climate challenge that we face.\nSo we can and we are working to do all of this in a way that provides energy security for Europeans and not only gets us through the next months, but leaves us in a better, stronger position for the years ahead.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 On the price cap, we had a brief discussion on it this morning.\u00a0 More technical people are engaged between the two systems on this particular subject.\u00a0 It is of course a G7 initiative.\u00a0 Now, you have to understand that in the last few months, the energy markets are already under very great stress.\u00a0 Countries in the Global South have found it difficult to compete for limited energy, not just in terms of pricing, escalating pricing, but often in terms of availability.\u00a0 There are tenders \u2013 countries have had tenders for which they don\u2019t even get a reply from suppliers.\nSo our concern right now is that energy markets already under stress must soften up.\u00a0 We would judge any situation, frankly, by how it affects us and other countries of the Global South because, as I communicated to the Secretary, there is a very, very deep concern in \u2013 among developing countries about how their energy security needs are addressed or not.\nOn the military equipment, to the best of my knowledge, I don\u2019t think in recent months we have faced any particular problems in terms of servicing and spare parts supply of equipment that we have got in the past from Russia.\u00a0 Whether we \u2013 where we get our military equipment and platforms from, that\u2019s not an issue, honestly, which is a new issue or an issue which has particularly changed because of geopolitical tensions.\u00a0 I think we look at possibilities across the world.\u00a0 We look at the quality of technology, the quality of capability, the terms on which that particular equipment is offered, and we exercise a choice which we believe is in our national interest.\nNow, in \u2013 if you were to look at the last 15 years, for example, you can see that we have actually procured a lot from the United States.\u00a0 If you maybe consider, for example, aircraft \u2013 the C-17, the C-130, the P-8, or the Apache helicopter or the Chinooks or the Howitzers, the M777 Howitzers \u2013 we have done so from France when we bought recently their Rafale aircraft.\u00a0 We have done so from Israel.\nSo, we have a tradition of multi-sourcing and for us, how to get the optimal deal from a competitive situation is really what this is all about.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next turn to Lalit Jha, Trust of India.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks, Ned.\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Minister.\u00a0 You have been associated with this India (inaudible) for decades and dealt with \u2013 for you, yeah.\u00a0 You have been dealing with this issue since \u2013 for decades and dealt multiple leadership, multiple administrations.\u00a0 What is your overall sense of the trajectory of the relationship?\nAnd Mr. Secretary, I would like to pick a few points from your opening remarks.\u00a0 First, you said there are weekly \u2013 you discussed \u2013 to strengthen the strategic partnership, and this includes helping each other.\u00a0 The recent decision of the U.S. to provide 450 million FMF sales on F-16 maintenance package certainly is not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t help India\u2019s strategic national interest.\u00a0 Everyone knows where F-16 has been used in the past and where it\u2019ll be used.\u00a0 Certainly it\u2019s not being used for counterterrorism operation.\u00a0 If you can help us understand that.\nOn India\u2019s role in Ukraine, can you give us a sense what India role \u2013 India\u2019s can play role in Ukraine peace process given that prime minister\u2019s \u2013 Modi\u2019s recent remarks to President Putin and Mexico\u2019s proposal of a three-member committee including Prime Minister Modi, His Holiness Pope, and the UN secretary-general to help resolve peace \u2013 real peace in Ukraine?\nAnd finally, on your comments on Indian Americans, you know Indian Americans have played a big role in this relationship and they are big supporters of Democratic Party, but there\u2019s frustration brewing up among this community as well because of the 700 days of visa waiting period.\u00a0 Among Indian Americans, when they ask their friends and families and pals to come from India, all the embassies and consulates are giving them next \u2013 first appointment they\u2019re getting of 2024.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Those were six questions bundled in one.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It was very impressive, very impressive.\u00a0 I think you topped our colleague Ian, so \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, look, I think the Secretary was good enough to refer to something I said on the weekend to a group of Indian Americans and Indians who live here, which is that the big change that I have seen in my four decades as a diplomat was actually in the transformation of India-U.S. relations.\u00a0 And your question \u2013 how do I see the trajectory \u2013 quite honestly, I see today a United States very international, very much more to engaging \u2013 very much more open to engaging a country like India, which is actually thinking beyond traditional alliances, which has been very effective at finding common ground with potential or actual partners.\nAnd a very good example of all this is actually in the Quad.\u00a0 I mean, the fact was a Quad was something we tried about two decades \u2013 15 years \u2013 ago.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t work, and it is working very well today and is doing \u2013 it\u2019s grown remarkably in the course of the last two years.\u00a0 So I think for us today the relationship with the U.S. opens up a whole range of possibilities, possibilities not just with the United States, though those are important in themselves because I think at this point of time, there\u2019s so much that India \u2013 and I assume the U.S. too \u2013 stands to benefit from working with the United States for \u2013 whether it\u2019s economy, whether it\u2019s technology, whether security.\nThe \u2013 but the other part is also \u2013 I would say it\u2019s been for us a very positive experience, a very encouraging one with a lot of promise, of working with the U.S. to shape the direction of the world.\u00a0 I mean, to me that\u2019s really the big jump which we have made, and I think the more we work together, the more we engage each other, I think many more possibilities will come.\u00a0 So, very frankly, that\u2019s a long way of saying that I\u2019m very bullish about that relationship.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I can only echo, first of all, what Minister Jaishankar said.\u00a0 I think no two countries have a greater ability and, I think, opportunity and responsibility to try to shape the future of this century than the United States and India as the world\u2019s two largest democracies.\u00a0 And what is very gratifying to me is the fact that in all of these meetings, in all of these conversations in this ongoing dialogue we have, we are thinking together and working together in ways that we haven\u2019t before.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have differences.\u00a0 We do, and we will.\u00a0 But it also means that because of the depth and quality of the dialogue we have, we talk about everything and work closely together on how we can advance the agenda that we have in common, which \u2013 as you\u2019ve heard, I think, from both of us \u2013 extends to virtually every issue that is confronting our own citizens and people around the world.\nOn the specific questions you raised, on the F-16s, to be very clear \u2013 and it\u2019s important \u2013 this is a sustainment program for F-16s that Pakistan has long had.\u00a0 These are not new planes, new systems, new weapons.\u00a0 It\u2019s sustaining what they have.\u00a0 We have a responsibility and an obligation to whomever we provide military equipment to make sure that it\u2019s maintained and sustained.\u00a0 That\u2019s our obligation.\u00a0 Pakistan\u2019s program bolsters its capability to deal with terrorist threats emanating from Pakistan or from the region.\u00a0 It\u2019s in no one\u2019s interest that those threats be able to go forward with impunity, and so this capability that Pakistan has had can benefit all of us in dealing with terrorism.\nOn the question of visas, I\u2019m extremely sensitive to this.\u00a0 If it\u2019s any consolation, I can tell you that this is a challenge that we\u2019re facing around the world, and it\u2019s a product, largely, of the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 Our ability to issue visas dropped dramatically during COVID, and without boring you with all of the details, this is the one self-financing (inaudible) part of the of the State Department.\u00a0 That is, around the world, the fees that we get for issuing visas are \u2013 go to our budget and they go to our capacity to put in place the people needed to process the visas.\u00a0 When COVID hit, the demand for visas fell through the floor, visa fees went away, the system as a whole suffered.\u00a0 And then of course, in actually issuing visas, even with much more limited resources, we had constraints from COVID about the number of people we could have in our embassies at any one time, et cetera.\nWe are now building back very determinedly from that, surging resources.\u00a0 We have a plan when it comes to India to address the backlog of visas that\u2019s built up.\u00a0 I think you\u2019ll see that play out in the coming months, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re very focused on.\u00a0 These connections, these people-to-people ties \u2013 whether it\u2019s students, whether it\u2019s business people, whether it\u2019s tourists, whether it\u2019s family \u2013 this is what really links us together.\u00a0 And the last thing we want to do is make that any more difficult.\u00a0 On the contrary, we want to facilitate it.\u00a0 So bear with us.\u00a0 This will play out over the next few months, but we\u2019re very focused on it.\nFinally, India\u2019s role when it comes to Ukraine, a potential peace process.\u00a0 I really want to emphasize what Prime Minister Modi said, because I think he captured, as well as anyone I\u2019ve heard, fundamentally what this moment is about.\u00a0 As he said, this is not an era, this is not a time for war.\u00a0 We could not agree more.\u00a0 We saw the aggression, the threat of the aggression mounting from Russia against Ukraine last year.\u00a0 We warned the world about it, and we tried everything possible to avert it through diplomacy.\u00a0 Unfortunately, tragically, President Putin pursued his aggression nonetheless, and now the Ukrainian people but also the world are reaping the consequences.\nWe see this not only in the suffering of the Ukrainian people, the decimation of their country by Russian forces, but we see it also in the profound threat to the United Nations Charter that binds us together, the basic principles that are so necessary to keep peace and security around the world that came into being after two world wars.\u00a0 Sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence \u2013 they are being challenged.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeing the consequences in everything from rising food insecurity to the energy prices that we\u2019ve talked about.\nSo it\u2019s profoundly in everyone\u2019s interest for Russia to stop its aggression, but it really is incumbent upon Russia and President Putin to decide that this is what it\u2019s going to do.\u00a0 One person has the ability to stop this aggression tomorrow, and that\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 And as I said last week, if Russia stops fighting, the war ends.\u00a0 If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends, because Russia has seized territory through this aggression that makes it challenging for Ukraine to sustain its viability.\nSo this is incumbent upon President Putin.\u00a0 We are very determined that if there is any opportunity for meaningful diplomacy to try to end the war, we will be part of it. But as of this date, speaking to you today, we continue to see no signs from Russia and President Putin that they\u2019re prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy, in a negotiation that would lead to a just resolution of the aggression.\u00a0 It is on Russia, it is on President Putin, and we will see if they finally respond.\nI think it\u2019s very important, though, that voices as consequential as India\u2019s make themselves heard.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why I thought that the prime minister\u2019s comments were so significant, including as well his strong, clear support for the United Nations charter (inaudible).\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Go to Kylie Atwood, CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019ll start with Minister Jaishankar.\u00a0 Two questions for you.\u00a0 As the Secretary was saying, Prime Minister Modi said earlier this month now is not the time for war.\u00a0 Last week when you were at the United Nations, you said India is on the side of peace.\u00a0 Generally speaking, is there anything that India is actively working on, perhaps with the U.S., to push for the war in Ukraine to end?\u00a0\u00a0And then to follow up on your response to my colleague on conversations about price cap oil, you said that was briefly discussed during your meeting with the Secretary today. \u00a0But it seems that you still have concerns and right now, India is not in favor of a cap on Russian oil.\u00a0 So is that accurate, and what would change that position?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, one question on Iran and one question on Ukraine.\u00a0 With the new Treasury general licenses last week, there are still technical hurdles when it comes to getting internet to Iranians.\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering what more the United States could do and if the United States would work with private companies, if they were to try and physically get hardware into Iran, to make sure that they could facilitate the distribution of internet to the country.\nAnd then the second question on Russia:\u00a0 What cost will the United States impose on Russia if it annexes these Ukrainian territories that are holding these so-called referendums?\u00a0 And will the U.S. still allow Ukrainian troops to use U.S. weaponry to defend against Russians in those territories, no matter what the outcome of these referendums and this \u2013 these possible annexations?\u00a0 Thank you.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0\u00a0May I?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0\u00a0Sure.\u00a0\u00a0Well, we have taken the position privately, publicly, confidentially, consistently from February 24th that this conflict is not in anybody\u2019s interest.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve always advocated that the best way forward is to return to dialogue and diplomacy.\u00a0 Your question, are we actively working on something?\u00a0 In the past, whenever we have been able to contribute something, we have been open to it, and I remain in very active talks with a lot of my colleagues, colleagues in the G20, colleagues in the UN Security Council, some beyond.\u00a0 So just as an example, during the grain shipment discussions in the Black Sea, at that time we had been approached to also weigh in with Russia at a particularly delicate moment of those discussions, which we did.\nRight now, there are some issues.\u00a0 I had a meeting with the prime minister of Ukraine.\u00a0 He did mention some very specific concerns which he thought merited our attention, where he thought we could be of some use.\u00a0 The \u2013 I had, on a different set of issues, a discussion with the UN secretary general.\u00a0 He\u2019s been very active, as you know, on a whole lot of specific concerns pertaining to the conflict, so it\u2019s not necessarily the overarching peace prospect, but even in the current scenario, other issues which we can solve or in some way mitigate or ameliorate.\u00a0 So there was some discussion with the UN secretary general as well.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it would be right for me to kind of go into specifics at this time.\nOn do we have concerns \u2013 this is in respect to your oil question \u2013 look, we have concerns about the price of oil.\u00a0 But we are $2,000 per capita economy.\u00a0 I mean, the price of oil is breaking our back.\u00a0 I mean, that is our big concern.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, first on Iran \u2013 first things first:\u00a0 Mahsa should be alive today.\u00a0 The only reason she\u2019s not is because a brutal regime took her life and took her life because of decisions she should be making about what she would wear or not wear.\u00a0 Women in Iran have the right to wear what they want; they have the right to be free from violence; they have the right to be free from harassment.\u00a0 That\u2019s true in Iran.\u00a0 It\u2019s true \u2013 should be true everywhere.\u00a0 So for starters, Iran needs to end its use of violence against women for exercising what should be a fundamental freedom.\u00a0 And as a general proposition and in this specific instance, we stand with all of those who are exercising the universal right to peaceful protest.\nAs you noted, we\u2019ve also taken action.\u00a0 And two things I would point to:\u00a0 We designated the so-called morality police and specific individuals for human rights abuses, and that imposes sanctions on them and it would impose, as well, sanctions on anyone who seeks to in any way do business with them.\u00a0 And then more specifically to the point you raised, we announced a general license to facilitate the free flow of information inside Iran.\u00a0 So for example, what this does is it authorities companies to provide things like cloud services, privacy technology, security technology, hardware and software to enable the Iranians to better communicate among themselves and also with the rest of the world.\u00a0 Individual companies can come to us, to OFAC in this case, to determine whether their technology fits under the license, and we will certainly look for ways to facilitate technology services being made accessible to people in Iran.\nOn the question of Russia and the sham referenda and annexations that does seem to be proceeding in Ukraine \u2013 one, we\u2019ve been very clear that we are prepared and we will impose additional severe and swift costs on Russia for proceeding with the annexations.\u00a0 And again, it\u2019s important to remember what\u2019s going on here.\u00a0 Russia invaded Ukraine, seized territory, and is engaged in a diabolical scheme on some of the territory seized, where it has moved the local populous out, often through these filtration centers \u2013 where people may be deported to Russia, elsewhere in Ukraine, or they simply disappear \u2013 then they bus Russians in, they install puppet governments, and then they engage in the referendum and manipulate, in any event, the outcome to then claim that the territory belongs to Russia through annexation.\nWe and many other countries have already been crystal-clear:\u00a0 We will not \u2013 indeed, we will never \u2013 recognize the annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve also been equally clear that Ukraine has the absolute right to defend itself throughout its territory, including to take back the territory that has been illegally seized one way or another by Russia.\u00a0 And the equipment, the weapons that we and many other countries are providing them have been used very effectively to do just that, as we\u2019ve seen in northeast Ukraine and as we see as well in the south.\nAnd again, because there is no change at all in the territory that is being annexed by the Russians as a matter for us or for the Ukrainians, the Ukrainians will continue to do what they need to do to get back the land that has been taken from them.\u00a0 We will continue to support them in that effort.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Reena \u2013 from Reena Bhardwaj \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, Nazira, we don\u2019t have time \u2013 from Reena Bhardwaj, Asian News International.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Minister Jaishankar and Secretary Blinken, thank you for doing this.\u00a0 Minister Jaishankar, you\u2019ve had a very busy week at UNGA, meeting all your counterparts.\u00a0 Now, did they express their worries about Ukraine which you mentioned in your remarks, of course, but also Taiwan?\u00a0 And did you discuss the impact of these developments on the global economy with Secretary Blinken?\u00a0 How are the two countries going to work together to address these concerns?\nAnd my second question to Secretary Blinken is:\u00a0 You talked about F-16 and the obligation that the U.S. has.\u00a0 But can you further clarify what counterterror threats does Pakistan face, and why is there a need for these fighter jets?\nAlso there\u2019s a discussion with your Pakistani counterpart to improve ties with India and to make the region more stable.\u00a0 What was their response?\u00a0 You did give them an advice to maintain peace.\u00a0 What was the advice that you gave them?\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 I had, of course, a lot of meetings in the UN that week.\u00a0 I met I guess roughly about half the delegations who were there.\u00a0 And a common concern among them was the anxiety about global economic volatility, an anxiety about sharply increased energy prices, of food inflation and food availability, of fertilizers which will impact food next year, of disrupted trade, of shipping, of insurance, of air-land movements, of travel.\u00a0 So this was, honestly, not an optimistic global mood which you got from your colleagues.\u00a0 And I think in particular the \u2013 what impact the consequences of the Ukraine conflict has been on many of these issues we \u2013 I spoke about, and also I think the prospect of instability on \u2013 in the Indo-Pacific, because today Asia and the Indo-Pacific is so central to global trade and in \u2013 particularly in some very critical areas.\nSo these were very widely prevalent concerns.\u00a0 We had a good discussion about it yesterday evening, and we do think today \u2013 I mean, I speak for India, but I also speak to some degree for the relationship having an impact on the world \u2013 we think the right thing today is to find ways of stabilizing the global economy, of softening prices, of making sure that global trade and \u2013 is more predictable, that the sources of anxieties and tensions are less.\u00a0 Because at the end of the day, that\u2019s really \u2013 Prime Minister Modi of course said this is not an era of war.\u00a0 But this is an era of \u2013 where we seek development, where we seek prosperity, where we seek progress, and I think India nationally and India through its key partners would like to do more to strengthen those trends.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 On the question of the F-16s, again \u2013 and it\u2019s important to be very clear \u2013 this is, as I said, about sustaining an existing program, not adding a new one, and we have a responsibility to do that wherever we\u2019re engaged in the provision of defense equipment like F\u201116s.\u00a0 And second, as to what these are for, there are clear terrorism threats that continue to emanate from Pakistan itself as well as from neighboring countries.\u00a0 And whether it is TTP that may be targeting Pakistan, whether it\u2019s ISIS-Khorasan, whether it\u2019s al-Qaida, I think the threats are clear, well-known, and we all have an interest in making sure that we have the means to deal with them.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this is about.\nMore broadly, we always encourage our friends to resolve their differences through diplomacy, through dialogue.\u00a0 That hasn\u2019t changed.\u00a0 It won\u2019t change.\u00a0 It would not be appropriate for me to characterize Pakistan\u2019s response, just as I wouldn\u2019t characterize our friend\u2019s response in a similar conversation.\nThank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\n\n"}, {"url":

Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 And it is a pleasure to be here to celebrate.\u00a0 It\u2019s also important to be here in this moment for Pakistan, for our friends, not only to celebrate but to support and to work in partnership.\u00a0 And I want to talk a little bit about that, but Foreign Minister, Bilawal, thank you for being here.\u00a0 I am so delighted to see you once again, to see you here at the State Department.\u00a0 We just had a very good, extensive conversation about so many things that we\u2019re working on together, and I\u2019ll touch on a couple of them.\u00a0 But I\u2019m particularly grateful for your presence today with us.\nAnd Dilawar, I just want to thank you not only for those words but for your extraordinary leadership every single day.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for it and it\u2019s making a difference, making a difference around the world.\u00a0 Our trade, our commercial, our economic policies are all designed to try to deliver for American workers and families, but also at the same time for our partners.\u00a0 And you\u2019re making that work, so thank you.\nAnd to everyone here today, whether you\u2019re here from the business community, the philanthropic community, NGOs, alumni of some of our exchange programs, current participants in those programs, the Pakistani diaspora, welcome, welcome, welcome to the State Department, and welcome to this wonderful institution that\u2019s part of the State Department.\u00a0 The museum has \u2013 continues to grow, as you\u2019ve heard from Susan.\u00a0 I hope you have an opportunity if you haven\u2019t already to take a look upstairs to see some of the exhibits that are already there but more much to come in the years to come.\nSo we are meeting at what is a tremendously difficult moment for Pakistan.\u00a0 And as you\u2019ve heard \u2013 the statistic about the expectant mothers I had not heard.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2013 in and of itself tells you all that you need to know.\u00a0 But the fact is a third of the country remains underwater after the historic and catastrophic storms.\u00a0 About 33 million people are affected.\u00a0 Farmers whose entire harvests have been literally submerged.\u00a0 Families whose homes have been washed away.\u00a0 Children whose schools have been ravaged.\nThat has an immediate impact, but unless we\u2019re able together to deal with the challenges, will have a long-term impact as well.\u00a0 So we have a sense of urgency, but we also have a sense of determination.\u00a0 The United States \u2013 all Americans \u2013 extend our deepest condolences and sympathy to our friends in Pakistan, and we send a simple message:\u00a0 We are here for Pakistan just as we\u2019ve been during past natural disasters, both to meet the immediate needs and, as I said, looking ahead to rebuild.\u00a0 And this is something that we talked about just a short while ago.\nSo far, as you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019ve marshaled over $56 million in immediate humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been able to send about 17 planes full of supplies like food and materials to build shelters, tents, tarps.\u00a0 And today I\u2019m pleased to announce another $10 million in food security assistance, which will provide \u2013 (applause) \u2013 this will provide urgent supplies to help farmers recover, like seeds and fertilizer, assistance repairing critical irrigation infrastructure damaged by the floods.\nThese efforts, though, are bolstered significantly by the extraordinary generosity of the Pakistani American community and the U.S. private sector, which together contributed another 27 million in essential goods and services \u2013 food, water, medicine, health care.\nWe will continue to stand by Pakistan, to stand by its people, today and in the days to come, because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done for each other in both directions through much of our shared history.\u00a0 It is fitting today that we\u2019re meeting here at the National Museum of American Diplomacy in the Harry S Truman Building.\u00a0 In 1947, shortly after Pakistan\u2019s independence, President Truman sent a congratulatory letter to Governor-General Jinnah, a leader that he called the originator of the dream that became Pakistan and launched diplomatic relations between our countries that we celebrate now in their 75th year.\nFor decades, we in the United States have been enriched by the culture of Pakistan, through the poetry of Allama Iqbal, to the songs of the legendary Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and a recent Grammy Award winner, Arooj Aftab.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I have to say that we are profoundly, profoundly better off for the immeasurable contributions of Pakistani Americans as civic leaders in their communities, as U.S. soldiers on the battlefield, and across literally every part of our society.\u00a0 They excel in every walk of professional life from medicine to science to engineering to business to government.\u00a0 Pakistan and the United States have worked together to complete incredibly significant development projects like the Mangla and Tarbela dams, which at one time provided some 70 percent of Pakistan\u2019s power.\nWe\u2019ve been able together to launch top academic institutions like the Lahore University for Management Sciences, which is training the next generation of business leaders.\u00a0 And we have worked together to confront global threats.\nWe continue to work closely on counterterrorism issues.\u00a0 We have a shared stake in Afghanistan\u2019s future after two decades of war.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had our differences; that\u2019s no secret.\u00a0 But we share a common objective: a more stable, a more peaceful, and free future for all of Afghanistan and for those across the broader region.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to work together toward that end as well as support the basic human rights of the Afghan people, especially women and girls.\nIn our discussions today, we talked about the importance of managing a responsible relationship with India, and I also urged our colleagues to engage China on some of the important issues of debt relief and restructure so that Pakistan can more quickly recover from the floods.\u00a0 We spoke, too, about the importance of meeting our commitments as democracies, upholding core values like respect for freedom of religion, belief, freedom of expression.\nWe also, critically, talked about ways that we\u2019re deepening our relationship across a number of critical areas, and I just want to spend a quick minute on those, starting with the economic ties that you heard Dilawar speak about just a few minutes ago.\u00a0 I am convinced, we are convinced, that even with some of the positive numbers you\u2019ve heard \u2013 the fact that we had a $600 million increase despite COVID is significant, but we\u2019re convinced that we can do more, much more.\nOne of the most important ways to spur economic growth and prosperity is, for example, through empowering women and girls and ensuring that they can participate fully in the economy.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way not only to help them reach their full potential but to help the economy in the country reach its.\u00a0 It\u2019s also the right thing to do.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019ve supported that goal for the past decade through something you\u2019ve heard referenced, the U.S.-Pakistan Women\u2019s Council, a platform that, as many of you know from having helped create it, fosters cooperation between corporations, philanthropy, civil society from both countries to advance women\u2019s empowerment in Pakistan.\nThrough one of their projects, the Pakistan Million Women\u2019s Mentor Initiative, companies like S&P Global, Deloitte, Citi, and others have provided skills training and mentorship for more than 10,000 women entrepreneurs over just the past year alone.\u00a0 And that\u2019s remarkable in and of itself; I am convinced that the ripple effects from that next year, in five years, in 10 years, in 20 years, are going to be significant.\nBut I think we also both believe deeply that at the heart of our relationship are our people-to-people ties.\u00a0 They continue to grow; they need to grow even stronger.\u00a0 We continue to run 19 Lincoln Corners throughout Pakistan, where more than 300,000 Pakistanis come every year to learn about the United States; to debate ways to improve our society, to both of our societies; to watch some classic American movies, everything from Zootopia to Wreck-It Ralph \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 sometimes all in the same day.\u00a0 It\u2019s something I\u2019d actually like to be able to do.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Maybe we can find time to break away and catch a movie.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd we have a thriving network of more than 37,000 alumni of our cultural programs, our exchange programs, throughout Pakistan.\u00a0 They\u2019re making exceptional contributions to the sciences and business and through public service.\u00a0 In fact, as I said, we\u2019re fortunate this afternoon to be joined by several current Fulbright scholars and participants in our International Visitors Leadership Program.\u00a0 We had a chance to meet them briefly before.\u00a0 If you\u2019re here, would you just stand up for a minute?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThese friends are the future of the relationship, and I\u2019m convinced that the exchange programs that we have will mean that for years to come, decades to come, generations to come, the relationship will be strong and will grow even stronger.\u00a0 So we\u2019re really grateful for your presence here today, but especially for your participation in these programs.\nThe alumni that we\u2019ve seen in our programs have done and continue to do really remarkable things in giving back to their societies, to their countries: standing up for the needs of Pakistanis with disabilities, increasing women\u2019s involvement in politics and policy making, providing counseling and health services to displaced people across Pakistan, and so much more.\u00a0 And now they\u2019re in the United States to work on things like advocacy strategies to be even more effective \u2013 if that\u2019s possible \u2013 in the work they\u2019re doing, but also to share their knowledge, their experience, their perspectives with American students.\nThis is profoundly a two-way street, and one of the things that I love about the exchange programs is, quite honestly, we get more out of them than anyone else.\u00a0 We are learning through the experiences that are being shared, through the perspectives that are being shared, through the knowledge that\u2019s being shared.\u00a0 So thank you for that as well, because it\u2019s making a difference here in the United States.\nUltimately, it\u2019s connections like these that give me the most hope for the future of this relationship.\u00a0 Our people learn with and from one another so that we can make both of our countries better and deliver even more effectively for our people.\nThis is a resilient relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s capable of overcoming challenges that we\u2019ve had to confront.\u00a0 And I am convinced that an even brighter future lies ahead, one that everyone in this room quite literally will be essential to realizing.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re counting on all of you to do, to continue to do.\u00a0 So thank you for all of the work that you do to further this noble goal and for the work that you\u2019ll continue to do to build upon the friendship between Pakistan and the United States.\nNow it is my great pleasure and an honor to hand the microphone over to my friend, the foreign minister of Pakistan.\u00a0 Bilawal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER BHUTTO ZARDARI:\u00a0 (In Urdu.)\n(In English). It is an absolute honor and a privilege to be here today at the State Department and addressing not only our friends from the U.S. Government but the Pakistani American community.\u00a0 And I\u2019m pleased to report, for all those watching back home and everybody witnessing over here, that it is indeed true, indeed true, that diplomacy is back both here at the State Department \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and in the foreign ministry of Pakistan.\nIt has always been a pleasure speaking to the Secretary of State, engaging with the Secretary of State, but I come here at a different time.\u00a0 And I come here at a time when the ground realities in Pakistan have changed fundamentally.\u00a0 We have experienced a climate catastrophe of biblical, apocalyptic proportions.\u00a0 It rained and rained and rained and rained and rained from mid-June till the end of August.\u00a0 And when the rain finally stopped, a hundred-kilometer lake formed in the middle of my country that\u2019s slowly descending to the sea, to the ocean.\nAs a result, a third of my country under water, more than the land mass of the United Kingdom; 33 million people \u2013 more than the population of Australia, more than the population of New Zealand, more than the population of New York State, or 95 percent of the population of Canada.\u00a0 As Dilawar said, 600,000 women, pregnant women, are waiting to give birth in the open.\u00a0 Of the 33 million people affected, 16 million are children.\u00a0 Of the 1,600 deaths that we\u2019ve had so far, a third of them have been children.\nAnd Mr. Secretary of State, the irony of this is that Pakistan has contributed 0.8 percent to the global carbon output, but we are amongst the 10 most climate-stressed countries on the planet.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we look to you for assistance and support so we can get our people climate justice.\u00a0 I think that your president has shown incredible leadership when it comes to the issue of climate both here domestically and congratulate him and your administration on the historic legislation that has been passed at home, but it\u2019s not only important that you build back better here.\u00a0 The opportunity in this crisis in Pakistan is that we must build back better, greener, more climate-resilient back home as well.\nAnd I believe that working together we can do this, working together not only with the Government of the United States and our friends in the international community.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with the private sector, working with the private sector here in the United States and working with the private sector at home.\u00a0 I am convinced that we can build back.\u00a0 We will build a more climate-resilient Pakistan.\u00a0 We will build a greener Pakistan.\u00a0 We will create green opportunities and green jobs, and opportunities not only for our country and not only for our private sector, but for those across the world that will be willing to invest in Pakistan.\nMr. Secretary of State, when my grandfather was the foreign minster of Pakistan \u2013 the commerce minister of Pakistan, the foreign minister of Pakistan, and then the prime minister of Pakistan \u2013 there was what was called the Green Revolution, and that Mangla Dam and Tarbela Dam that you mentioned \u2013 those massive infrastructure projects \u2013 they\u2019re from the 1960s and the 1970s.\u00a0 It is \u2013 now it is the time for a new Green Revolution, and we hope \u2013 nay, we expect \u2013 the American Government, particularly led by President Biden, to lead the way.\u00a0 I think that despite the devastation, despite the destruction, this is the opportunity \u2013 nay, this is the challenge \u2013 for us to be able to act.\u00a0 And we\u2019re incredibly grateful to the U.S. Government for their initial $1 million, then $33 million, then $55 million and today, after your announcement of the $10 million, we have reached the $60 million mark.\nWe\u2019ve been incredibly engaged ever since I\u2019ve been foreign minister with yourself, with your administration.\u00a0 We\u2019re incredibly grateful to Mr. Dilawar Syed, (inaudible), Samantha Power, the congressional delegation, everybody that has come and visited Pakistan so far, and we look forward to the opportunity of hosting you someday soon.\nI absolutely agree that the Pakistan-U.S. relationship is not only resilient, we have stood the test of time.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve proved throughout history that when we work together, we achieve great things.\u00a0 And I believe that when we don\u2019t work together, then we fumble, then we falter, then things go wrong.\u00a0 And I would like the opportunity to once again not only thank you but thank your incredibly hardworking team that have been working with their counterparts, who are also incredibly hardworking, around the clock and that we\u2019ve managed to make this progress and enhance the cooperation between the United States and America[i].\nAnd the sky is the limit.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been engaging with the private sector, particularly those of the Pakistani American community, and they are patriotic Pakistanis and they are patriotic Americans, and they contribute here to America and they are keen to contribute to Pakistan.\u00a0 This is a challenge for the new generation.\u00a0 I believe our relationship that\u2019s in the past is the legacy of the leadership of the past, and now it is a test for us that how we take this relationship forward.\u00a0 Here\u2019s to another 75 years of Pakistan-U.S. relationships. \u00a0(In Urdu).

Foreign Minister Kwape; and Foreign Minister Momen, thank you for your partnership.\u00a0 To everyone joining us today, thank you for your continued dedication to ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and thank you for working to strengthen our global health systems so we can better prevent, detect, and respond to future health threats.\nSince we launched the Global Action Plan seven months ago, we\u2019ve made significant progress toward our goals.\u00a0 Consider vaccinations:\u00a0 Last September, only 13 percent of the people in lower-middle-income countries were vaccinated against COVID-19.\u00a0 Today, that number has more than quadrupled to 56 percent.\u00a0 For our part, the United States has provided more than 620 million vaccine doses to 116 countries and economies, all with no strings attached.\u00a0 So many of you have helped contribute to the vaccination efforts too, but we still have more work to do to address the equity gap in global vaccinations and protect people at risk of severe illness.\nTo close that gap, this pandemic taught us the importance of expanding access to critical medical supplies.\u00a0 We need to shift COVID-19 care from being offered primarily in emergency facilities.\u00a0 That care should be integrated into routine services.\u00a0 That will make vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics more accessible.\u00a0 Similarly, we have to close gaps in our global health infrastructure.\nToday, I am proud to announce three new initiatives that will help us close that gap and make more \u2013 make care more equitable around the world.\u00a0 First, I am pleased to announce today that USAID with the Global Fund and other partners will launch test-to-treat pilot programs in ten countries.\nThese programs will help people get screened for COVID-19 when they have symptoms and receive antiviral medications if they test positive.\u00a0 These programs will also help people avoid severe illness, reduce hospitalizations, and save lives.\u00a0 USAID will work with governments, public health experts, and civil society to make this happen.\u00a0 As we implement these programs, we will track lessons learned with our foreign partners.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll share these lessons with countries around the world, including our providers in the United States.\nSecond, we\u2019re improving access to medical oxygen.\u00a0 Medical oxygen is critical for treating patients with severe COVID-19, and it will help to prepare for health crises to come.\u00a0 Since the pandemic began, oxygen supplies have been put under strain around the world.\u00a0 And even before the pandemic, only roughly half \u2013 half \u2013 of inpatient facilities in Africa had reliable access to medical oxygen.\nThe United States has committed $50 million to tackle this problem.\u00a0 That includes purchasing oxygen, installing storage tanks, and upgrading the physical infrastructure for delivering oxygen, like the piping that brings it to the patients\u2019 bedsides.\u00a0 We\u2019re also helping lower the cost of oxygen for governments across Africa, where prices can be ten times higher than in the United States.\u00a0 We\u2019re starting with nine governments, supporting their negotiations with the private sector to develop market-based approaches.\u00a0 Increasing access to affordable oxygen will also support other global health programs like those that address child and adult pneumonia, safe birth, safe surgery, and new infectious disease outbreaks.\nThird and finally, we\u2019re establishing an implementation group to improve global health access to medical supplies and services through the global clearinghouse mechanism.\u00a0 Our hope is to make supply chains more resilient, efficient, and equitable.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen throughout this pandemic access to these essential supplies can mean the difference between life and death.\nSo together with our GAP partners, the public sector, and the private sector, we will set up a new platform.\u00a0 This platform will bring together countries, medical supply manufacturers, critical components producers, and large procurement agencies.\u00a0 Our goal will be clear: to match surpluses in supplies with those who need them when they need them.\u00a0 We\u2019re aiming to launch this platform next year, and we\u2019re hoping other countries will join us.\u00a0 These efforts are only the latest ways we\u2019re combating COVID-19 and building more resilient global health systems.\u00a0 So let\u2019s continue to work together and let\u2019s do everything in our power to make the world safer, to make the world healthier, and free from pandemics for all.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-with-australian-foreign-minister-penny-wong-indian-external-affairs-minister-dr-subrahmanyam-jaishankar-and-japanese-foreign-minister-hayashi-yoshimasa-before-their-meet/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Palace Hotel", "location": "New York, New York", "date": "September 22, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Jose, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thanks for bringing us together.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to see everyone here.\u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to come together this afternoon.\nTo each of you, both those from the Mineral Security Partnership countries and those from minerals-producing countries, this is I think one of those sessions where, as we say, it gets real.\u00a0 This makes a difference, a concrete difference, and we\u2019re very anxious to hear especially from all of you today.\nLet me just say a few words at the top about why we\u2019re here.\nIn June, the United\u00a0States,\u00a0along with several key partners,\u00a0many\u00a0of\u00a0whom\u00a0are here today, launched this partnership\u00a0because\u00a0we recognize\u00a0that critical mineral supply chains are simply vital to our shared future.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s an understanding that is getting more and more widespread and deeply rooted in all of our countries.\nAs everyone in this room knows very well, we face a profound climate crisis\u00a0that requires us to\u00a0transition to clean energy technologies, like\u00a0electric vehicles, like solar, like wind power, which offer us an\u00a0effective\u00a0way to\u00a0both\u00a0cut carbon emissions\u00a0and create good-paying jobs.\nCritical minerals are at the heart of this transition.\u00a0 They\u2019re essential components of\u00a0the technologies that will power our clean energy future, like\u00a0electric\u00a0vehicles and batteries, wind turbines, solar panels.\nTo ensure that these technologies can actually be deployed quickly, we know that we have to build\u00a0resilient, diverse, and secure critical mineral supply chains\u00a0by supporting more successful critical mineral\u00a0projects.\u00a0 So this, I think, is a shared understanding and one that we are brought together to work on.\nAnother objective of this partnership, the Minerals Security Partnership, is to support projects that adhere to high environmental, social, and governance standards.\u00a0 We want to make this a race to the top, not a race to the bottom.\nToo often, the relationship between minerals-producing and minerals-purchasing countries has been\u00a0extractive and characterized by abusive working conditions.\u00a0 Often,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0left\u00a0behind environmental degradation and devastated communities.\nWe want to\u00a0break this cycle through meaningful collaboration and consultation with\u00a0local communities near mining sites, and especially with groups that have historically been neglected.\u00a0 And we aim to make sure that\u00a0minerals-rich\u00a0countries benefit from all stages of the value chain, from extraction to processing to recycling.\u00a0 That\u2019s ultimately how we can make sure that\u00a0each project\u00a0actually serves\u00a0your\u00a0communities and uplifts your citizens.\nNow, we\u2019re\u00a0already beginning\u00a0to see new projects that are supporting economic growth on all sides.\u00a0 Just to cite one example, a graphite mine in\u00a0Balama, Mozambique, which employs hundreds of local workers, contributes millions of dollars in community development, and undermines the aims of those who would sow conflict.\u00a0 The graphite from this mine\u00a0will\u00a0soon be\u00a0sent for further processing\u00a0to\u00a0a plant in Louisiana, where it will create more jobs and where it will\u00a0provide\u00a0graphite used for batteries by American electric vehicle companies.\nThe United States\u00a0and our MSP partners\u00a0stand ready\u00a0to\u00a0support you as we make more of these projects a reality.\u00a0 That\u2019s, as I say, where it really gets real, where we\u2019re turning the goals of this partnership into practical projects.\nNow what that support will look like varies, of course, from project to project.\u00a0 For some\u00a0projects, it could mean that the United\u00a0States\u00a0or a partner country helps with reducing the risk of the project,\u00a0including by providing a loan guarantee or\u00a0debt financing.\u00a0 And I know that the chair of Export-Import Bank, Chair Lewis, will have a lot more to say about that in a few minutes.\u00a0 For other\u00a0projects, it could mean connecting companies with our countries\u2019 private sectors or\u00a0supporting them with technical assistance through our embassies.\nWe understand that minerals production and processing\u00a0requires lots of\u00a0investment and\u00a0undertaking lots of risk.\u00a0 Through the MSP, we are committed to helping with both.\nSo mostly what we want to do today is to hear from everyone here how we can work more closely together on our shared goals, what challenges you\u2019re facing as you develop these resources, what opportunities are there that you see that are not being fully realized, and how can the United States and other MSP partners\u00a0help advance your critical minerals industries.\u00a0 Those are the questions I\u2019d like to begin with putting on the table, and mostly I\u2019m eager to hear from all of you.\nSo we look forward\u00a0to\u00a0deepening\u00a0the partnership in the months ahead.\u00a0 This is something that I think can make a profound difference on something that is \u2013 the word \u201ccritical\u201d is attached to critical energy minerals.\u00a0 This really is critical, and we\u2019re grateful for everyone being here today and for the work that we\u2019re doing every day together.\nLet me stop there.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken at the United Nations Security Council Ministerial Meeting on Ukrainian Sovereignty and Russian Accountability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "United Nations Headquarters", "location": "New York, New York", "date": "September 22, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Madam President, for having brought this council together at this very grave moment of the crisis of the war of Russia on Ukraine.\n(In English)\u00a0Mr. Secretary General, thank you for your determination and the moral clarity that you\u2019ve brought to ending this brutal war and defending the UN\u2019s core principles, and also for your personal engagement in securing the vital Black Sea route for grain to flow once again from Ukraine.\nMr. Khan, we\u2019re grateful for the efforts of the Office of the Prosecutor to investigate objectively and professionally the atrocities being committed in Ukraine by Russian forces, and for its support for \u2013 and coordination with \u2013 Ukrainian investigators and prosecutors.\nWe hear a lot about the divisions among countries at the United Nations.\u00a0 But recently, what is striking is the remarkable unity among member-states when it comes to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Leaders from countries developing and developed, big and small, north and south have spoken in the General Assembly about the consequences of this war and the need to end it.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve called on all of us to reaffirm our commitment to the UN Charter and its core principles, including sovereignty, territorial integrity, human rights.\nEven a number of nations that maintain close ties with Moscow have said publicly that they have serious questions and concerns about President Putin\u2019s ongoing invasion.\nRather than change course, however, President Putin has doubled down \u2013 choosing not to end the war but to expand it; not to pull troops back but to call 300,000 additional troops up; not to ease tensions but to escalate them through the threat of nuclear weapons; not to work toward a diplomatic solution but to render such a solution impossible by seeking to annex more Ukrainian territory through sham referenda.\nThat President Putin picked this week, as most of the world gathers at the United Nations, to add fuel to the fire that he started, shows his utter contempt for the UN Charter, for the General Assembly, and for this council.\nThe very international order that we have gathered here to uphold is being shredded before our eyes.\u00a0 We cannot \u2013 we will not \u2013 allow President Putin to get away with it.\nDefending Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity is about much more than standing up for one nation\u2019s right to choose its own path, fundamental as that right is.\u00a0 It\u2019s also about protecting an international order where no nation can redraw the borders of another by force.\nIf we fail to defend this principle when the Kremlin is so flagrantly violating it, we send a message to aggressors everywhere that they can ignore it, too.\u00a0 We put every country at risk.\u00a0 We open the door to a less secure, a less peaceful world.\nWe see what that world looks like in the parts of Ukraine controlled by Russian forces.\u00a0 Wherever the Russian tide recedes, we discover the horror that\u2019s left in its wake.\nI had a window into that horror myself when I traveled to Irpin just a few weeks ago to meet with the Ukrainian investigators who are compiling evidence of war crimes committed there.\u00a0 I saw up close the gaping holes left in residential buildings by Russian shelling \u2013 indiscriminate at best, intentional at worst.\nAs we assemble here, Ukrainian and international investigators continue to exhume bodies outside of Izyum, a city Russian forces controlled for six months before they were driven out by a Ukrainian counteroffensive.\u00a0 One site contains some 440 unmarked graves.\u00a0 A number of the bodies unearthed there so far reportedly show signs of torture, including one victim with broken arms and a rope around his neck.\nSurvivors\u2019 accounts are also emerging, including a man who described being tortured by Russian forces for a dozen days, during which his interrogators repeatedly electrocuted him and, in his words, and I quote, \u201cbeat me to the point where I didn\u2019t feel anything,\u201d end quote.\nThese are not the acts of rogue units.\u00a0 They fit a clear pattern across the territory controlled by Russian forces.\nThis is one of the many reasons that we support a range of national and international efforts to collect and examine the mounting evidence of war crimes in Ukraine.\u00a0 We must hold the perpetrators accountable for these crimes.\nIt\u2019s also one of the reasons why more than 40 nations have come together to help the Ukrainian people defend themselves, a right that is enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.\nThe more setbacks Russian forces endure on the battlefield, the greater the pain they are inflicting on Ukrainian civilians.\u00a0 Russian attacks on dams, on bridges, on power stations, on hospitals, on other civilian infrastructure are increasing, constituting a brazen violation of international humanitarian law.\nThis week, President Putin said that Russia would not hesitate to use, and I quote,\u00a0 \u201call weapons systems available,\u201d end quote, in response to a threat to its territorial integrity, a threat that is all the more menacing given Russia\u2019s intention to annex large swaths of Ukraine in the days ahead.\u00a0 When that\u2019s complete, we can expect President Putin will claim any Ukrainian effort to liberate this land as an attack on so-called \u201cRussian territory.\u201d\nThis from a country that in January of this year, in this place, joined other permanent members of the Security Council in signing a statement affirming that, and I quote, \u201cnuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.\u201d\u00a0 Yet another example of how Russia violates the commitments it\u2019s made before this body, and yet another reason why nobody should take Russia at its word today.\nEvery council member should send a clear message that these reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately.\nRussia\u2019s effort to annex more Ukrainian territory is another dangerous escalation, as well as a repudiation of diplomacy.\nIt is even more alarming when coupled with the filtration operation that Russian forces have been carrying out across parts of Ukraine that they control.\u00a0 Now, this is a diabolical strategy, violently uprooting thousands of Ukrainians, bus in Russians to replace them, call a vote, manipulate the results to show near unanimous support for joining the Russian Federation.\u00a0 This is right out of the Crimea playbook.\nAs with Crimea, it\u2019s imperative that every member of this council, and for that matter, every member of the United Nations reject the sham referenda and unequivocally declare that all Ukrainian territory is and will remain part of Ukraine, and no Russian claim to annex territory can take away Ukraine\u2019s right to defend its own land.\nPutin\u2019s invasion is also distracting this council \u2013 in fact, the entire UN system \u2013 from working on the serious issues that we all want to focus on.\u00a0 Like preventing a climate catastrophe, aiding tens of millions of people on the brink of famine, fulfilling the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, shoring up our interconnected health security \u2013 all issues that make a tangible difference in the lives of the citizens that we are here to represent, and that they are looking to us \u2013 looking to us to deliver on.\nThe overwhelming majority of UN member-states are committed to working together on these issues, and our actions show that.\nYet while more than a hundred countries have signed on to a roadmap to provide food aid to those who need it, and partners across Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe are working together to increase the resilience of global food systems, Russia for months blocked the export of Ukrainian grain to the world, until the United Nations and Turkey secured a deal to let the grain go.\u00a0 And Russia continues to bomb and seize Ukrainian farms and silos, line its wheat fields with landmines, raising the cost of food for people everywhere.\nAnd while governments around the world are teaming up with international organizations, with the private sector, with philanthropies to end this pandemic and make sure that we\u2019re better prepared for the next one, Russia is spreading misinformation and disinformation about WHO-approved vaccines \u2013 fueling vaccine hesitancy that puts people in all our countries at greater risk.\nHere is the reality: None of us chose this war.\u00a0 Not the Ukrainians, who knew the crushing toll it would take.\u00a0 Not the United States, which warned that it was coming and worked to prevent it.\u00a0 Not the vast majority of countries at the United Nations.\nAnd neither did our people, or the people of virtually every UN member-state, who are feeling the war\u2019s consequences in greater food insecurity and higher energy prices.\nNor did the Russian mothers and fathers whose children are being sent off to fight and die in this war, or the Russian citizens who continue to risk their freedom to protest against it, including those who came out into the streets of Moscow after President Putin announced his mobilization to chant, \u201cLet our children live!\u201d\nIndeed, it must be asked:\u00a0 How has this aggression against Ukraine by President Putin improved the lives or prospects of a single Russian citizen?\nOne man chose this war.\u00a0 One man can end it.\nBecause if Russia stops fighting, the war ends.\u00a0 If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.\nThat\u2019s why we will continue to support Ukraine as it defends itself, and strengthen its hand to achieve a diplomatic solution on just terms at a negotiating table.\u00a0 As President Zelenskyy has said repeatedly, diplomacy is the only way to end this war.\u00a0 But diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a settlement that cuts against the UN Charter, or rewards Russia for violating it.\nPresident Putin is making his choice.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s up to all of our countries to make ours.\nTell President Putin to stop the horror that he started.\u00a0 Tell him to stop putting his interests above the interests of the rest of the world, including his own people.\u00a0 Tell him to stop debasing this council and everything it stands for.\n\u201cWe the people[s] of the United Nations determined\u2026\u201d\u00a0 That is how the preamble of the UN Charter starts.\u00a0 Let\u2019s not forget that \u201cwe the peoples\u201d still get to choose the fate of this institution and our world.\u00a0 The stakes are clear.\u00a0 The choice is ours.\u00a0 Let\u2019s make the right choice for the world that we want and that our people so desperately deserve.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

many are already acting on those commitments.\u00a0 Action is crucial because the current crisis is one that no individual country or even group of countries can solve alone.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here together.\u00a0 The work before us is clear.\nFirst, we have to get emergency aid to the people who need it.\u00a0 Since February, the United States has provided more than $6.1 billion in humanitarian assistance and $2.3 billion in development aid to combat hunger and strengthen food security.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019re consistently the largest donor to the World Food Program, providing more than half of all contributions.\u00a0 Some countries with the capacity to do more are among those doing the least.\u00a0 That needs to change.\u00a0 And no matter what countries have done so far, every country is called upon to do more.\u00a0 Tomorrow, the United States will do just that when President Biden announces new assistance from the United States.\nAnother way that we can support immediate relief is by pushing for an extension of the deal that the United Nations and Turkey brokered between Russia and Ukraine, which has allowed for grain and other agricultural products to be exported from Black Sea ports.\u00a0 Now, that agreement should never have been necessary in the first place.\u00a0 The only reason it was is because Russia, having invaded Ukraine, was then blockading its ports and preventing food that had been feeding the world from getting out.\nBut we had to deal with the reality before us, and the deal that was brokered by the United Nations with Turkey\u2019s assistance actually enabled the grain to start moving again.\u00a0 And as you heard from my colleagues, despite some of the misinformation that continues to come from Moscow, that grain and other food products are getting where they need to go: to the countries most in need, predominantly in the Global South.\u00a0 It\u2019s also helped lower food prices around the world.\u00a0 So it needs to keep going; it needs to be renewed.\u00a0 That is urgent.\nSecond, we have to strengthen global food systems and help countries develop the capacity to produce their own food so that we can prevent new crises and build resilience to further shocks.\u00a0 You heard President Sall say it very eloquently:\u00a0 We need durable agricultural production.\u00a0 We have to respond to the emergency, but we also have to set ourselves up for the long term.\nBack in May, when we hosted the food ministerial, many of our African colleagues especially made clear that as much as they needed emergency relief, what they really needed was more investment in agricultural innovation, sustainability, self-sufficiency.\u00a0 I am convinced from the time that I\u2019ve spent recently in a number of countries in Africa the capacity is there, but it needs help, and we need to help.\u00a0 We have heard that call.\nOver the next five years, the United States will work with our Congress to invest over $11 billion worldwide toward this goal of durable agricultural production.\u00a0 Last month, we aided \u2013 we added eight new African partners to Feed the Future.\u00a0 This is our flagship program to broaden social safety nets, to strengthen food systems, to improve nutrition.\u00a0 Many of those countries are represented here today.\u00a0 Investments like these are also critical to adapting to the growing effects of the climate crisis that we\u2019re seeing across the globe, from the droughts in the Horn of Africa to the floods in Pakistan.\nThird, we need to better coordinate our efforts \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard this, again, already this afternoon \u2013 across governments, across regional bodies, across foundations, across NGOs, across multilateral organizations, and others.\u00a0 It\u2019s true there are a multiplicity of initiatives.\u00a0 We need to make sure that they are acting, working together, that all of this is coherent and all of this is coordinated.\nOne way that we can do that is to ensure that sanctions do not impair access to food or medicine in any country beyond just Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 And to that end, the United States intends to work with other Security Council members to ensure that food, medicine, humanitarian assistance are always carved out across UN sanctions regimes.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also expand efforts to ensure such humanitarian authorizations are included across U.S. domestic sanctions programs.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we\u2019re already doing, but we need to do this in a consistent way.\nWe can also make clear that our food security efforts are more transparent.\u00a0 The United States will soon publish a report tracking our progress toward hitting the goals in the roadmap that we put out in May, from boosting assistance levels to launching new programs like the Caribbean Zero Hunger Plan, which was created with CARICOM and the Dominican Republic.\u00a0 And we urge others to publish their own reports so that, again, we can better fill gaps and avoid duplication among us.\nThis unprecedented gathering and the leaders\u2019 declaration that we produced is another way that we\u2019re strengthening our cooperation.\u00a0 I hope that all countries here consider it and endorse it and encourage others to do so as well.\nBut maybe most important, beyond what we say, is, of course, what we do \u2013 not only for the good of the people around the world bearing the brunt of this crisis, but also because the health, the stability, the wellbeing of our people depends on the food security that we build together.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the microphone over to our colleague, President Petro of Colombia.\u00a0 Mr. President, the floor is yours.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-usaid-democracy-delivers-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Transparency, anticorruption, rule of law, all of these \u2013 you know this \u2013 create a more level playing field for businesses to compete.\u00a0 And countries that respect human rights and labor rights tend to be more stable and more reliable partners \u2013 especially in a crisis, as we\u2019ve experienced through COVID-19.\nThe private sector, in turn, has extraordinary expertise in many of the areas where emerging democracies need the most support.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll hear about some of these today, like Vodafone\u2019s efforts to improve maternal health in Tanzania.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure that others in this room, around this table, will have ideas of where to pitch in.\u00a0 We\u2019re eager to hear them.\u00a0 We\u2019re also eager, where we can, to help you act on them.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve seen this time and time again, and it\u2019s also incredibly inspiring.\u00a0 We see the practical results when we can build public-private partnerships in actually making progress, in actually making a difference in people\u2019s lives.\nNow one way that we\u2019re able to do that in the government is through the Development Finance Corporation, which partners with the private sector to lower the risk of investment in developing countries, including all the democracies represented here today.\u00a0 And Scott, thank you so much for being with us today, but thank you for what you\u2019re doing every single day.\u00a0 I have to say, from my perspective, one of the most important tools that we have in the United States Government on this agenda is the DFC, and I\u2019m very proud that we\u2019re working together so closely.\nToday, though, is more than just providing support.\u00a0 We\u2019re also here to learn.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to learn from everyone around this table.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to adapt.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to try to share and spread best practices, because another thing that I\u2019ve learned in many years of doing this is that no one has a monopoly on ideas, never mind good ideas.\u00a0 No one has a monopoly on best practices.\u00a0 Somewhere, someplace around the world, for just about any problem that we\u2019re confronting, someone\u2019s probably figured it out.\nBut if we don\u2019t share that information, if we don\u2019t share those best practices, then we\u2019re constantly reinventing the wheel.\u00a0 And the power of bringing so many people together who are focused on different aspects of this challenge is that I will bet that, for just about anything we have to deal with, someone has found a good idea or a good solution.\u00a0 So we want to be sharing them today.\nUltimately, the challenges that many are facing are simply not that different from the ones facing democracies all over the world.\u00a0 Let me just quickly cite one that I know is at the top of just about everyone\u2019s agenda: corruption.\u00a0 That is estimated now to cost up to 5 percent of global GDP.\u00a0 And we all know this, but corruption discourages investment.\u00a0 It stifles competition, it deepens inequities, and maybe most damaging for democracies, it erodes public trust in government, in institutions.\u00a0 And that, that is the most corrosive thing of all.\u00a0 It also greases the wheels of foreign interference, disinformation, transnational repression, and other actions authoritarian governments take to try to weaken democracy.\nEvery country here today is taking meaningful steps to address this scourge.\u00a0 The Dominican Republic passed new legislation that allows the government to seize assets gained through illicit activities and invest them in the Dominican people.\u00a0 Ecuador created the country\u2019s first-ever specialized court tackling corruption and organized crime.\u00a0 Armenia\u2019s Corruption Prevention Commission conducted integrity checks on 261 candidates for judges and prosecutors in the first half of 2022, looking for conflicts of interest and other issues that could actually undermine their independence.\u00a0 These are real, practical ways of dealing with the challenge of corruption.\nNow, much of this democratic renewal is actually being driven from the bottom up \u2013 in Zambia, where last year more youth, women, first-time voters turned out than at any time in that country\u2019s history and brought new leaders to office who are already making positive change, from expanding human rights protections to reducing the country\u2019s crushing debt.\nAnd Moldova, where massive voter turnout to power reform a government that ran on a platform of transparency, anticorruption, and judicial independence brought that government to office.\nAnd I have to say my own admiration for you, Madam President, and all of your colleagues is boundless.\u00a0 You have an extraordinary challenge under the most difficult circumstances, but know that the United States is and will remain strongly your partner in everything that you\u2019re doing.\nOf all the reasons to be optimistic about this progress, the enthusiasm of citizens may be the most inspiring and, ultimately, the most consequential, because when people in other parts of the world, including in closed societies, see citizens holding their leaders to account, when they see government actually working to solve problems that people are confronting in their daily lives, then they too begin yearning for a more free, a more open, a more accountable government in their own countries.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the kind of virus that we\u2019d like to see spread.\u00a0 It\u2019s a good one, a powerful one, one that can make a huge difference.\nThe bottom line is this:\u00a0 I think, more than ever before, the fate of our democracies are intertwined, interconnected.\u00a0 The more vibrant, resilient democracies that we can foster by our side, the more we will be able to do what we\u2019re all here to do, which is to deliver for our people, for our fellow citizens.\u00a0 That\u2019s the mission; that\u2019s the objective.\u00a0 And we are grateful to be able to work with so many who are trying to do just that.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken At the Ministerial Meeting of the Alliance for Development in Democracy\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "The Palace Hotel", "location": "New York, New York ", "date": "September 20, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks for bringing us together this morning, and thanks to each of my friends and other colleagues for being here today.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to see you all and it\u2019s wonderful to see you in this particular setting.\nSome of us met in March, and since then the partnership between the Alliance for Development in Democracy and the United States has only grown stronger.\nAnd I\u2019m particularly delighted that our colleagues from Ecuador have now joined the ADD just earlier this summer, and with their signing of the supply chain MOU I think just a few moments ago, we\u2019ll begin discussions about strengthening our collective supply chains, something that is, I think, of importance to all of us and something that our citizens actually feel strongly in their daily lives.\nWe are coming together to tackle critically important questions in the five focus areas that we\u2019ve agreed on, like how can we collectively strengthen our democracies and other democracies throughout the hemisphere; how can we deal with the root causes of migration, while providing humanitarian assistance to migrants; how can we spur genuinely inclusive economic growth in our countries, especially as we all rebound from COVID.\nWe\u2019re following through on the memorandum of understanding that we signed in July to strengthen our supply chains.\u00a0 And I want to emphasize \u2013 I think we talked about this back in March \u2013 the follow-through on everything that we do and say is maybe even more important than the meetings we have when we get together.\u00a0 It\u2019s actually making sure that we\u2019re making good on the commitments that we make.\nWe\u2019re also growing our economic ties.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0recently\u00a0launched a survey of American CEOs\u00a0to try to get a good picture of companies\u2019 priorities and existing supply chains, so that they could\u00a0find\u00a0business opportunities across the Americas, including in ADD countries.\u00a0 Based on the findings of that survey, the State Department, the Commerce Department,\u00a0the private sector will begin\u00a0working\u00a0together to explore\u00a0a trade mission to ADD countries.\u00a0 So I think this is going to be an interesting initiative that I hope produces concrete results.\nAnd we\u2019re working together on issues that are actually far beyond the hemisphere that we share.\u00a0 All of us\u00a0believe in\u00a0the principles of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 We\u2019re all committed to modernizing the UN so that it\u2019s actually capable of addressing the complex challenges that we face, while staying true to the principles that are at its core.\u00a0 This is a very good week for us in particular to be affirming those principles and those objectives.\nThis group is just one way that we\u2019re bringing together new regional groupings of like-minded allies and partners, and we\u2019re doing that here this week in New York.\u00a0 I think you\u2019ll see that reflected, too,\u00a0in our\u00a0meetings with both the Blue Pacific and Atlantic Basin countries\u00a0this week. \u00a0In fact, I just came from a meeting of many of the Atlantic Basin countries.\nAcross these efforts, we\u00a0are united by\u00a0a\u00a0core\u00a0belief that democracy\u00a0is\u00a0the best way to\u00a0actually deliver\u00a0concrete results for\u00a0our\u00a0people:\nTo uphold\u00a0people\u2019s\u00a0civil and political rights\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including\u00a0through\u00a0holding\u00a0fair and free elections, protecting free speech and assembly.\nTo\u00a0advance\u00a0their\u00a0economic and social rights\u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0by strengthening labor standards, expanding access to education and health, providing more inclusive opportunities.\nTo deliver security and stability\u00a0\u2013\u00a0like\u00a0by\u00a0countering corruption,\u00a0upholding the rule of law,\u00a0and addressing the root causes of\u00a0illicit activity.\nIt is\u00a0no surprise\u00a0that when President Biden first announced the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity \u2013 which we did at the Summit of the Americas \u2013 to drive our hemisphere\u2019s\u00a0inclusive\u00a0economic growth,\u00a0the countries around this table were among the first to\u00a0express strong support.\nAs\u00a0this\u00a0partnership\u00a0is further developed,\u00a0the most important thing is this:\u00a0 We are looking for, we need, we want your ideas to\u00a0make sure\u00a0that we\u2019re actually seizing opportunities\u00a0for our shared\u00a0future.\u00a0\u00a0The power of all of this is in the collective, the different experiences that we have, the different ideas that we\u2019ve been able to test in different ways, and then, in many ways, trying to draw on the best practices that come from each of us.\nThere\u2019s one opportunity I just wanted to highlight in closing, and this comes through something called the CHIPS Act, which some of you will have seen passed our Congress just a few weeks ago.\u00a0 This, among other things, will provide funds to develop resilient semiconductor supply chains right here in\u00a0the\u00a0Americas.\u00a0 It\u00a0allows us to invest in\u00a0building the components that we need for the 21st century in our own hemisphere\u00a0\u2013 including\u00a0in\u00a0Latin American\u00a0and\u00a0Caribbean countries\u00a0\u2013 and, critically, it will\u00a0create good-paying jobs\u00a0while doing so.\nADD countries\u00a0\u2013 which together represent\u00a0our third-largest trading partner in the region, even before the addition of Ecuador\u00a0\u2013 are\u00a0very well-poised to seize these opportunities that come from some of the resources we now have available through the CHIPS Act.\u00a0 So we\u2019re very eager to work with you on that.\nLet me just conclude by saying this:\u00a0 As successful as we believe the first year of the ADD\u00a0has been, I\u2019m\u00a0actually confident that, year two, we will take even bigger strides together and do it in a way that really focuses on how can we together work to improve the lives of the citizens we represent.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is all about, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts and ideas for how we can actually get that done.\nSo thanks to everyone for being here.\u00a0 It\u2019s really good to see you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Two-thirds of the world\u2019s renewable energy is generated in the Atlantic. \u00a0And the Gulf Stream, of course, dictates the Earth\u2019s climate.\nWe see the Atlantic\u2019s influence right here in New York City. \u00a0If you walk just a few blocks from here, you run into the East River. \u00a0Its storied Brooklyn Navy Yard was created by President John Adams in 1801 to protect the Atlantic trade of our nascent nation. \u00a0Fifty years later, a U.S. ship built in that navy yard teamed up with a British ship to lay an undersea telegraph cable, through which Queen Victoria transmitted the very first transatlantic Morse Code message. \u00a0Over a century later, in his first visit to the United States as president, Nelson Mandela announced a new trade office in New York to expand economic ties between our nations and our peoples.\nToday, the Port Authority is working to combat the climate crisis with more aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets and a new generation of fuel-efficient container ships. \u00a0And New Yorkers are working to restore the oyster reefs that once lined the harbor and to bring back the woodlands, salt marsh, and wetlands that once dominated this coastline.\nThe commercial, communications, and conservation challenges and opportunities you see right here in this city are shared by the community of Atlantic nations. \u00a0We know we can\u2019t take for granted the free and open maritime trade that employs so many of our citizens, the undersea cables that connect us, the fish stocks and wildlife that sustain us. \u00a0Only together can we address rising challenges and threats to our Atlantic future.\nPiracy; illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing; transnational organized crime; climate change; pollution; environmental degradation \u2013 these are just some of the challenges that we have to face together.\nConsider just for a minute illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\u00a0 According to the FAO, one of \u2013 one in five fish on the market come from illicit fishing \u2013 one in five fish on the market.\u00a0 That translates to losses of between $10 and $23 billion a year to lawful fishing industries in the region.\u00a0 That harms coastal communities that rely on sustainable fish stocks for their income, for food.\u00a0 It fuels corruption.\u00a0 It threatens the health and biodiversity of our oceans.\nThe joint statement that we\u2019re adopting today affirms our shared responsibility to try to foster a peaceful, prosperous, open, and cooperative Atlantic and protect its richness for future generations. \u00a0We\u2019re also committing to build shared capacity to achieve these goals, drawing on the innovative technologies and best practices developed by Atlantic nations, for the benefit of all Atlantic nations.\nFollowing the ministerial today, we plan to launch a consultative process to develop together a framework for regular cooperation among Atlantic countries through which our countries can carry out a shared approach to advancing our joint development, economic, environmental, scientific, and maritime governance goals.\nWe\u2019re not pre-judging the results of these consultations. \u00a0We want to hear from everyone about your priorities, about your vision for enhancing cooperation, and not only from big countries but also small island nations whose voices need to be heard.\u00a0\u00a0And we hope you\u2019ll join us in encouraging more Atlantic nations to take part.\nThe United States currently spends over $400 million each year on maritime initiatives in the Atlantic. \u00a0Working with the United States Congress, we hope to invest an additional $100 million in the next year in support of shared priorities that we\u2019re discussing today: Atlantic maritime governance, inclusive economic growth, innovative adaptations to the growing impact of climate change.\nLast year, we joined the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy. \u00a0This July, we joined the European Union and six nations from the Western Hemisphere and Africa in the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance Declaration to promote scientific cooperation for the health and sustainable development of the Atlantic. \u00a0And in the coming months, we hope to come together with many of you to conclude years of negotiations on protections of the high sea areas and sharing of the benefits of maritime genetic resources that are collected there.\nWe recognize the importance of expanding support for, and working with, existing Atlantic initiatives \u2013 Portugal\u2019s leadership in creating the Atlantic Center in the Azores, Brazil\u2019s vision of a zone of peace and cooperation in the South Atlantic, the Friends of the Gulf of Guinea \u2013 efforts that continue to make significant \u2013 to have a significant impact.\u00a0 Still, as challenges mount and our innovations and opportunities expand, we believe our partnerships need to grow to meet those challenges.\nSo I\u2019m really grateful to everyone around this table for being here today and for the work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 And I look forward to all that we can actually accomplish together in the months and years to come.\nThanks to everyone for being here.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinken-at-the-launch-of-the-alliance-for-afghan-womens-economic-resilience/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Blinken At the Launch of the Alliance for Afghan Women\u2019s Economic Resilience\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

in fact, I\u2019m tempted to just drop the microphone and say \u201cwhat she said\u201d \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but for your leadership every day around the world, as well as in Afghanistan.\nAnd I also just want to recognize a few really exceptional colleagues who are joining us today, starting with Don Lu, our Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs.\u00a0 Next to him, Tom West, our Special Representative for Afghanistan, and someone I think known to many of you, Rina Amiri, our Special Envoy for Afghan Women, Girls, and Human Rights.\nThe three of them together, along with Kat, and along with so many other colleagues, are making sure every single day that Afghanistan writ large and women and girls in particular remain at the heart of our focus and our determination.\u00a0 And I really want to thank Rina in particular for incredibly dedicated advocacy for the people of Afghanistan.\u00a0 We\u2019re really lucky to have you on our team.\u00a0 You are working tirelessly to stand up for Afghan women and girls, their rights, and all at-risk Afghans.\u00a0 Thank you, Rina.\nAnd I\u2019m really grateful to our partners from civil society and the private sector, including our very exceptional panelists.\u00a0 I had a chance to speak to them briefly a few minutes ago.\nWe\u2019re all here for a particular purpose today, and that is to launch a new initiative:\u00a0 The Alliance for Afghan Women\u2019s Economic Resilience.\u00a0 More to say about that in just a few minutes.\nBut Your Highness, I\u2019m also grateful to you for taking part today, for leading this discussion.\u00a0 Thank you for your engagement not just today, but again, every day.\u00a0 It\u2019s greatly appreciated.\nSo as you heard Kat describe, we are meeting at a deeply challenging time for Afghan women and girls.\u00a0 That is no secret to anyone in this room.\u00a0 Since taking power, the Taliban have severely restricted women\u2019s rights in Afghanistan, turning back two decades of progress that Afghan women themselves built with the support of the international community.\nThe Taliban have denied women freedom of movement.\u00a0 They\u2019ve banned girls from secondary school classrooms.\u00a0 They\u2019ve prohibited women in the workplace, women who last year \u2013 again, as Kat said \u2013 were managing businesses, running schools, serving in government.\u00a0 Many women have had to flee for safety; they face extraordinary challenges in rebuilding their lives in new countries.\nWomen, no matter where they live, should have equal rights in every facet of their lives.\u00a0 Equal opportunities to study, to work; equal access to financial resources; and they should enjoy the same freedoms as everyone else to travel, to express themselves, to choose their own paths.\nThis should be, in the year 2022, self-evident to everyone on this planet.\u00a0 But of course, it\u2019s not, and we have to fight for it.\u00a0 We have to struggle for it every single day.\nBut particularly here this week at the United Nations, where the world comes together at High-Level Week, these rights were enshrined in the preamble of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 This is the founding document of international relations.\u00a0 It\u2019s the founding document that describes not Western-created rights, not something invented here or in any particular country, but universal rights to which everyone is subscribing, or is at least supposed to subscribe.\u00a0 The charter affirms the faith of all peoples of the United Nations, \u201cin fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women.\u201d\u00a0 And that is a direct quote from the charter.\nSo no more better time than today, than this week, to reaffirm those rights, to reaffirm a common understanding and a common commitment to those rights, and no more important a place to do it than with regard to Afghanistan.\nIt\u2019s also, I think, incredibly important to understand that the repression of these rights in Afghanistan is not only setting back women, but all Afghans, the country as a whole, including Afghanistan\u2019s economy.\u00a0 So it\u2019s simply not in the basic self-interest of anyone in Afghanistan, including the Taliban.\u00a0 When women are cut out of the workforce, society loses talent.\u00a0 It loses productivity from half of its population.\nToday, women could contribute $1 billion to Afghanistan\u2019s economy if they were simply allowed to.\u00a0 They could provide lifelines for families facing poverty; they could help create more stable, more resilient communities at a time when those are desperately needed in Afghanistan.\nIn short, equality and economic opportunity actually go hand in hand.\u00a0 And there are prerequisites for sustainable peace and sustainable security.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one reason the United States will continue supporting equality and opportunity for Afghan women and girls.\nSo one way we\u2019re doing this is by providing direct assistance to at-risk Afghans.\u00a0 Just over the last year, we\u2019ve contributed more than $770 million to humanitarian organizations.\u00a0 In addition, USAID recently announced another $30 million in development assistance for Afghan women and girls.\nWe\u2019ve also partnered with Switzerland and Afghan economic experts to launch the Afghan Fund, something you\u2019ve seen and probably read about in recent days.\u00a0 This is going to help protect and make targeted disbursements of $3.5 billion in Afghan Central Bank reserves to support the country\u2019s economic stability.\nFor all that we\u2019re doing with the humanitarian assistance, as desperately needed as that is \u2013 it\u2019s necessary, but it\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 And helping to create basic economic stability is actually vital to making sure that Afghans do not suffer even more in the very difficult circumstances that they\u2019re living.\nWe\u2019re also supporting Afghan women and girls through our diplomacy.\u00a0 We\u2019re organizing with our allies and partners, including in the Muslim world, to present a united front and urge the Taliban to respect women\u2019s rights.\u00a0 And we\u2019re amplifying Afghan women\u2019s voices in international institutions \u2013 including here at the United Nations.\nToday, in partnership with Boston University, we are announcing our newest initiative: the Alliance for Afghan Women\u2019s Economic Resilience.\u00a0 Let me just say a few words about that before turning it over to our panel.\nThis is a public-private partnership that will help improve access to education and training, expand job opportunity, support women entrepreneurs in Afghanistan as well as in other countries.\u00a0 Now, I don\u2019t want to sugarcoat it:\u00a0 This is going to be hard, given the severe restraints imposed by the Taliban, but we are determined to safely deliver this support to women in Afghanistan.\nThe alliance builds on proven models, something we\u2019ve had experience with in other places, and it reflects the resources, the innovation, the speed and expertise that we can harness when we bring together private enterprise, academic institutions, NGOs, and governments.\nSo for example, in partnership with Pod \u2013 this is an American technology company \u2013 the alliance will launch the Million Women Mentors Initiative for Afghan Women and Girls.\u00a0 Mentors from Deloitte will help Pod offer remote career guidance to the first 2,000 of these million Afghan women.\u00a0 I have seen this work in other places, and it is remarkable what you can achieve even doing things at a distance.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to get off to a start with this.\nBoston University\u2019s Pardee School of Global Studies will host the alliance.\u00a0 It will provide staffing, research, technical assistance, and programmatic support to help the alliance run and help it thrive.\nBoston University, Deloitte, Pod, thank you for being part of this crucial effort.\nTo others who see a way to contribute to this alliance, whether it\u2019s from the public sector, the private sector, two words: Join us.\u00a0 We\u2019re eager to work with you on behalf of Afghan women.\nSo there\u2019s a lot more that could be said.\u00a0 I really want to leave it now to some remarkable people who offer their experience, their expertise, and an opportunity to share it with you.\u00a0 But let me simply conclude by saying thank you to everyone in this room who remains invested in the future of Afghanistan and the future of its women and girls.\u00a0 The United States remains invested, and we will continue to work this every single day.\nThank you so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-turkish-foreign-minister-mevlut-cavusoglu-before-their-meeting-4/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Pyatt, Assistant SecretaryBureau of Energy Resources", "audience": "Yale Club", "location": "New York City", "date": "September 19, 2022", "content": "\n\nThank you. Good evening. Thank you very much Ambassador Hoagland for that introduction and to Ambassador Cekuta and Dr. Nifti, ministers and guests. It\u2019s just a huge honor for me to be with you here today to discuss energy resources and infrastructure in the Caspian region. And certainly, this discussion on the margins of the UNGA could not be more timely. As Ambassador Hoagland noted, I was sworn in this morning after having been confirmed on Thursday by the Senate, and I\u2019m just a few hours into my new job. So, this is one of the very first events that I\u2019m doing. But Caspian energy issues were central to my work when I was the PDAS in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs and worked closely, I should note, with Ambassador Hoagland. But also more recently, when I was ambassador to Greece, I worked very closely with my Azeri counterpart, as we worked to support the regulatory approval and construction of the TAP pipeline. And indeed, the whole Southern Gas Corridor looks even more important, in retrospect, as European energy security and the clean energy transition have emerged as two of today\u2019s most pressing economic and geopolitical issues.\nMeanwhile, President Putin\u2019s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine continues to generate extraordinary costs; in the thousands of civilians killed and wounded, in the 13 million Ukrainian citizens forced to leave their homes, and in rising global food and energy prices, and supply demand imbalances, making it harder for people around the world to meet their basic needs. Much of the discussion at this year\u2019s UNGA will be about how we can work together to address these pressing humanitarian and economic challenges, but as the pressures of the war continue, we also need to make sure that we work together to meet global energy demand, while simultaneously addressing the devastating effects and the costs of climate change and the imperative of the clean energy transition.\nThe Biden Administration has consistently demonstrated its commitment to prioritizing the climate crisis. This includes passing the most significant legislation in US history to tackle climate change and strengthen energy security, as well as working with counterparts to encourage everyone to do more to meet climate goals. These are serious challenges, but they also offer opportunities to strengthen our partnerships and reap the economic benefits of new technologies and new markets. Energy diversification, as a central component of the clean energy transition, supports both economic and energy security goals. Part of managing this transition effectively is ensuring people have access to reliable energy to keep the lights on and businesses operating. What this means in terms of the mix of technologies and fuels will be different for every country. Some countries will require continued and diminishing use of unabated oil and natural gas as zero emission and abatement technologies continue to be commercialized.\nCaspian natural gas is already playing a critical role in ensuring European energy security. And the more that resources in one region can be shared with another, the more all will benefit. For this reason, the United States believes that expanding natural gas, as well as electricity interconnections, will bring significant benefits to the Caspian region. The United States is engaged in ongoing dialogue with countries that could increase exports to determine the best ways Caspian states can contribute to broader energy security and diversification goals. The Southern Gas Corridor is a powerful example of what can be achieved with political will, coordinated investment, regional cooperation and technological innovation. In this regard, I\u2019ll always remember my 2017 visit to the TAP pipeline, when it was under construction in Northern Greece, and the fantastic combination of capital, technology, and vision that project represented. Since it came online in 2020, the Southern Gas Corridor has already helped Turkey, Italy, Greece, and now Bulgaria to massively reduce their dependence on a single energy supplier. Its strategic and economic importance will only grow as Europe explores expanding the Southern Gas Corridor\u2019s capacity to further diversify suppliers and routes. This Southern Gas Corridor has literally redrawn the energy map of Southeastern Europe. And at least in Greece, Azeri gas has played an important role in the government\u2019s progress towards reducing reliance on dirty lignite coal power plants, thereby advancing our shared climate goals.\nGreater regional interconnection also means greater stability for electrical grids, the essential infrastructure of modern homes and economies. To further regional energy security, it will also be important to increase energy efficiency. This is one of the easiest and most effective ways to reduce consumer energy costs, lower emissions and improve competitiveness. It can also help Caspian countries to meet their domestic needs and free up additional resources for export. Energy efficiency in buildings and power plant operations and reducing methane venting, flaring, and leaking are all important. And of course, it\u2019s possible to capture more gas for sale just by reducing the amount that is vented and flared. This benefits both the economy and the environment in line with the goals of the Global Methane Pledge announced last year at COP 26. Participants in the Pledge agreed to contribute to a collective effort to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% of 2020 levels by 2030. And I\u2019m delighted that four states in the region are signatories to this pledge.\nOur shared commitment to combating climate change presents opportunity for innovation as well. Developing and deploying renewable energy and battery storage will help bolster sustainability, resilience, and energy security. It also creates good, well-paying jobs.\nMany states in the Caspian region have the potential to expand their use of renewable energy, taking advantage of their abundant resources to provide electricity and meet the needs of their populations. I vividly remember making the drive from Almaty to Bishkek, early in my tenure as PDAS, and being struck by how much the landscape looked like our high plains in Colorado. In the decade since I took that trip, Colorado has more than tripled its renewable energy generation, with four fifths of that now coming from wind power. There is no reason why many Caspian states couldn\u2019t do the same in a way that would deliver multiple benefits. The private sector is and will continue to be an important partner in meeting these complimentary goals of energy security and energy transition. Continuing to provide reliable energy within the Caspian region and Europe, while transitioning to cleaner energy sources for the future, will require significant capital, but also presents fantastic new business opportunities. As I begin my role as Assistant Secretary of State for Energy resources, I am eager to find opportunities to increase cooperation in the fields of clean and renewable energy, and methane mitigation. So please keep in touch and be assured the United States will continue to support initiatives across the region to meet climate goals.\nFinally, I will close by highlighting that the United States takes these relationships seriously and I am eager to again join the team, working to advance our agenda across this fascinating region. We are celebrating 30 years of U.S. relations with the states of the Caspian region, and we want to continue to work together to prioritize regional and international energy goals. Thank you once again for your welcome and I very much look forward to this evening\u2019s discussion.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinken-and-egyptian-foreign-minister-sameh-shoukry-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Blinken And Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry Before Their Meeting\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

Good afternoon, everyone. And look at this turnout \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful to see all of you here. It\u2019s wonderful to be part of an incredibly powerful and growing coalition, as evidenced just by my three colleagues and friends who have spoken.\nTo my friends from the Netherlands and Argentina, Wopke, Santiago: Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your engagement. And let me say as well \u2013 I think we just heard the powerful words from the prime minister \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful to see you, wonderful to be with you in this effort.\nTo all the other partners present, we\u2019re grateful for the sustained work to champion LGBTQI+ rights.\nWe\u2019re meeting at a time when the movement for equality is showing some encouraging momentum. A few examples: this summer, St. Kitts and Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda became the latest governments to decriminalize homosexual acts; a month ago, the Government of Vietnam announced that homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgender identity cannot be considered illnesses, and that LGBTQI+ people cannot be subjected to so-called \u201cconversion therapy.\u201d\nAt the same time, for that progress, which is real and which is worth underscoring, we know that people worldwide continue to experience alarming levels of violence, discrimination, isolation. Risks are the highest for people with disabilities, people of color, refugees, and LGBTQI+ women. Transgender people are often denied access to legal identity documents that reflect their names and gender markers. Intersex people, including minors, continue to be subjected to unnecessary surgeries without their consent.\nAll countries, including those of us in the Core Group, have work to do to ensure that LGBTQI+ people have the same rights, the same protections as all other people.\nDefending these rights is central to the health of our democracies. Any system where some groups are treated as \u201cless than\u201d simply because of who they are is fundamentally flawed.\nStanding up for LGBTQI+ people is a top priority for our administration.\nA month after taking office, President Biden took action to promote LGBTQI+ rights in our diplomacy.\nLast September, he appointed an extraordinary person, Jessica Stern, as our new special envoy to advance the human rights of LGBQI+ persons. Anyone who\u2019s worked with Jessica knows you don\u2019t want to be on the other side of an issue. (Laughter.) Big mistake.\nThis summer, the President issued an executive order to advance equality for LGBTQI+ people \u2013 including by combating so-called \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d supporting LGBTQI+ children and families, protecting health care and programs to prevent youth suicide.\nEverything we\u2019re doing builds on the work of literally generations of advocates who have \u2013 and still are \u2013 risking so much to put LGBTQI+ people and their rights on the map. And I have to say, as I read the history, learn the history, hear of experiences, I\u2019m quite in awe of generations of advocates who have done so much to put us where we are today. The work we\u2019re doing is only possible because of the work they did \u2013 but not only the work they did, the courage that they showed.\nThere\u2019s so many people that one could point to, but I want to just single out a couple of people, and I think they\u2019re here today. People like Liberty Matthyse, who is here from South Africa \u2013 are you here? Right \u2013 right there. Thank you. (Applause.) A champion for the rights of trans and gender diverse people. Thank you for being with us.\nAnd people like the individuals who decided to stand up to the routine and \u2013 harassment and discrimination they endured at the hands of police, at a gay bar not very far from where we meet today \u2013 the 1969 protest at the Stonewall Inn marked a turning point in our nation\u2019s struggle for LGBTQI+ rights and helped galvanize the global movement. This is something that is seared into the memories, seared into the consciousness of so many of us. And particularly for me as a native New Yorker, it\u2019s something that I have seen and been inspired by for many, many years.\nStonewall is also a stark reminder of all the places worldwide where people are still subject to abuse simply for being themselves.\nThat\u2019s why this group\u2019s work is as important as ever \u2013 maybe more important than ever. It\u2019s why we are so proud and determined to be your partners every single step along the way.\nThanks, all of you, for everything that you\u2019re doing, that we\u2019re doing together. Thank you.\n(Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-freedom-of-expression-roundtable/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Before we begin, let me just take a moment to again welcome the safe return of Mark Frerichs, an American Navy veteran who spent more than two and a half years in captivity in Afghanistan. His return is the culmination of many, many months of tireless and effective work by so many colleagues in our government. I especially want to extend thanks to our Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, who\u2019s actually with Mark as we speak, and to our Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West.\nMany national security professionals across the government gave their all to this effort to get Mark out of captivity and ultimately to bring him home, and I want to thank all the people who\u2019ve worked on this over these many months. We care about Mark and we\u2019re profoundly grateful to them. The support that we received from our Qatari partners as well was key in securing his release.\nMark is soon going to be reunited with his family. The President had an opportunity to speak to them a few hours ago. I want the families of Americans who are being arbitrarily detained or held hostage anywhere in the world to know that our commitment to them in bringing their loved ones home is resolute and we will relentlessly continue to focus on doing just that. We bring the same determination and focus to those efforts as we brought to the effort to bring Mark Frerichs out of captivity and home to his loved ones.\nFor the United States, for me personally, there is no higher priority than bringing Americans who are being arbitrarily and unjustly detained, held hostage, back home to freedom, to their families. We\u2019ll continue to work this relentlessly and secure the release of all Americans who are being unjustly held wherever that\u2019s the case. We mean what we say: Mark\u2019s family had my word; every other family has my word as well.\nWith that, I also want to say how pleased we are to be with some extraordinary colleagues today. And it\u2019s fitting that we\u2019re opening the High-Level Week here at the United Nations with an event, a conversation, focused on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. It\u2019s also particularly fitting that we\u2019re doing it at the Foreign Press Center, which actually embodies both of those principles. Our commitment, the United States commitment to freedom of expression, freedom of the press, is unwavering, and it\u2019s unwavering because it\u2019s the bedrock of a healthy democracy.\nIncreasingly, though, we see these freedoms as under threat \u2013 under threat from censorship, from surveillance, from restrictive laws, from propaganda, the use of detention and prosecution, of violence, and we see this quite literally around the world. Even as we condemn the efforts to restrict freedom of expression and freedom of the press, we\u2019re determined to do everything we can to uphold them, including with a number of important U.S. programs that we\u2019ll have an opportunity to discuss today with our colleagues that do just that.\nBut let me conclude by saying \u2013 by saying this: Virtually everything that we\u2019re doing here this week at the United Nations, the issues that we\u2019re putting a spotlight on, from food insecurity to climate to global health, we couldn\u2019t do this without the information, the illumination that freedom of expression and freedom of the press bring to these and every other challenging issue around the globe. The work of the United Nations, the work of our own foreign policy and diplomacy, would be dramatically undermined in a world where freedom of expression and freedom of the press are under threat, under challenge, in decline.\nSo we have a real stake in upholding these principles, in making real defending them against those who seek to dilute them, diminish them, eliminate them. Mostly I\u2019m anxious to hear from all of our colleagues who have in various ways shown extraordinary courage in upholding these principles around the world. I\u2019m anxious to hear from them their experiences and their ideas for what more we can do to support, defend, protect freedom of expression and free press.\nWith that, I thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-yemeni-chairman-of-the-presidential-leadership-council-rashad-al-alimi-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

we\u2019ve done the most important thing, so I\u2019m really delighted, Ayman, to have you back in Washington.\u00a0 The team, our team, have done a lot of good work.\u00a0 But before we get to why we\u2019re actually here today, let me on behalf of the American people extend our deepest condolences to the people of Jordan for the tragic building collapse that you experienced this week in Amman.\u00a0 Our hearts go out to the families of those lost and we wish the injured a swift recovery.\u00a0 To the first responders, to the doctors, we join people around the world in expressing our appreciation and admiration for the work that you\u2019ve done.\nSo this memorandum of understanding that we\u2019ve just signed is a testament to the strength of the relationship between Jordan and the United States.\u00a0 It reflects a shared interest in a more stable, safe, and prosperous Middle East, and our commitment to deepen the partnership between our governments and between our peoples to help achieve that goal.\nThis is now the fourth memorandum of understanding that our nations have adopted, going back to 2010, to deepen our strategic partnership.\u00a0 It will not only cover the longest period, but will also provide more assistance than any prior MOU.\u00a0 The MOU will support key reforms conceived of and led by King Abdullah\u2019s government, focusing on improving the lives of Jordanians in tangible ways \u2013 reforms like improving essential public services; tackling the water crisis, which is being exacerbated by climate change; expanding economic opportunities so that everyone in Jordan, including women, underserved groups, can reach their full potential.\nAmbitious reforms like these take time.\u00a0 They also take courage.\u00a0 With the agreement we signed today, which intends to provide well over a billion dollars in assistance each year for seven years, our Jordanian partners can count on the United States to support them and to help make these goals real.\nThe MOU is also an investment in Jordan\u2019s exceptional leadership on regional and global challenges.\u00a0 Jordan has long offered a refuge to people displaced by regional conflicts and other crises, something that we\u2019ve seen most recently in the extraordinary compassion that the Jordanian Government and its people have shown to Syrians.\u00a0 In addition to humanitarian support and access to health care, Syrian refugees in Jordan also have opportunities to work and to study, which is vital for them to live with dignity and purpose and also vital to help ensure that there is not another lost generation of Syrians.\nHosting such a large number of refugees has demanded a lot from Jordan, particularly as the country emerges from COVID-19.\u00a0 But Jordan\u2019s government and people have not turned their backs on refugees from Syria; they have embraced them.\nAs they continue providing this vital support, so will the United States as reflected in our announcement earlier this week of an additional $756 million in humanitarian assistance for Syrians in need, including those in Jordan.\nAnd Jordan continues to play a key role in promoting regional security and stability.\u00a0 This includes Jordan\u2019s ongoing commitment to continue working for a just, lasting, comprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians on the basis of a two-state solution along the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps.\u00a0 Jordan\u2019s armed forces have long been a key ally in the fight against violent extremist ideology and terrorism, including as a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, or Daesh.\u00a0 And its military is stepping up to counter new threats like combating narcotics trafficking across the country\u2019s northern border.\u00a0 The unprecedented level of foreign military financing reflected in the MOU will support the modernization of Jordan\u2019s military, which is essential to these and other efforts.\nWe can make investments like these with confidence because we\u2019re building on more than six decades of close cooperation between our governments, between our peoples, and between our diplomats.\u00a0 An MOU of this breadth takes a lot of work, considerable effort, even among partners.\u00a0 So to our experts and negotiators whose hard work made today\u2019s signing possible, we say thank you \u2013\u00a0sukran\u00a0\u2013 for what you\u2019ve done together, for all the ways that it will benefit Jordanians, benefit Americans, benefit the region as a whole.\nAyman, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary \u2013 dear Tony \u2013 thank you so much. \u00a0Thank you for your kind words and thank you for the excellent discussion we had today, but most of all thank you for true friendship.\nAs you said, the MOU we just signed is unprecedented in terms of its duration and the size of financial assistance it entails.\u00a0 It does reflect the strength of our relationship, but we are grateful for the unwavering support that you have continued to provide Jordan.\u00a0 This support, as you said, sir, is key to our efforts to mitigate the heavy impact of regional crises\u2014refugees, border security, drug trafficking, pressure on our scarce resources \u2013 and without your help, we will not have been able to do what we did in terms of providing the dignified lives that refugees deserve.\u00a0 They have been victims of conflict; they cannot be a victim of us not doing our bit to help them, so thank you so, so much for all of that.\nAnd the MOU and the EU support is also central to our economic development process as we embark on thorough, wide-ranging reforms that will strengthen the resilience of our economy, improve our \u2013 its competitiveness, create jobs, meet our needs for water and energy, and ensure the better future that our people deserve.\u00a0 So we\u2019re really truly thankful, and we truly value the support.\u00a0 And together as friends and partners, we\u2019ll continue to work to realize our joint objective of resolving regional conflicts, ensuring security, stability, peace, cooperation, and prosperity in our region.\nAnd Mr. Secretary whether in our work to restart the Middle East peace process and put it back on track towards achieving comprehensive, just, and lasting peace on the basis of the two-state solution, the only solution that we believe people will accept and embrace or in our efforts to find political solution to tragic crises in Syria, Yemen, Libya, or ensuring the enduring defeat of terrorism, the leading role of the United States is essential.\u00a0 It is simply irreplaceable.\u00a0 These are difficult challenges, and we know we cannot overcome them unless we work together.\u00a0 Jordan will continue to do its part and work with you in full partnership not only to overcome those challenges but also to harness the many opportunities that peace and cooperation in the region promise.\nAnd dear Tony, as His Majesty and King Abdullah just reaffirmed in their meeting in Jeddah, our partnership is strong, it is enduring, it is strategic.\u00a0 It is a partnership that continues to do a lot of good not only for our two countries but also for the region and for global peace.\u00a0 And today is definitely a day to remember in this historic, deep friendship that our countries have enjoyed.\u00a0 And again, as you said, it took a lot of work to achieve, and a big shout out to all our colleagues who have worked so hard to ensure that we get to this great day and to this great moment \u2013 and a relationship that continues to be key for us, a relationship that His Majesty views as one of the most key and the most strategic partnership that we have.\u00a0 So a big thank you for this and thank you for, again, your new friendship and for your partnership.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Elizabeth Hagedorn of Al-Monitor.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Ukraine has discovered a new mass grave that likely includes hundreds of civilians in a city recaptured from Russian forces in the country\u2019s northeast.\u00a0 The Ukrainians say once again this proves Russia should be labeled a state sponsor of terrorism.\u00a0 Why does the administration oppose that designation despite the kind of war crime discovered this week?\nAnd Foreign Minister Safadi, do you see any hope for a Palestinian state?\u00a0 And how does Jordan view the current escalation and Israel\u2019s actions in the West Bank?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Elizabeth.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen now the reports of this mass grave.\u00a0 And of course, this is part, horrifically, of the continuing and ongoing story.\u00a0 Whenever we see the Russian tide recede from the parts of Ukraine that it\u2019s occupied, we see what\u2019s left in its wake.\u00a0 And this latest discovery of apparently 440 mass graves in Izyum is a reminder of that.\nI was just in Irpin when I was in Ukraine last week, and one of the things that I saw firsthand there \u2013 this is a city just a few miles from Kyiv itself \u2013 buildings bombed out, shelled, mortared, grenaded, shot at, destroyed \u2013 entirely civilian area.\u00a0 And there can be no reason for what occurred there.\u00a0 At best it was indiscriminate; at worst it was intentional.\nSo two things.\u00a0 One, it\u2019s usually important that even as the Ukrainians do everything they can to take back the land that\u2019s been seized from them by Russia in this aggression that at the same time we\u2019re all working to build the evidence and document the atrocities that have been committed.\u00a0 And in many instances, these will amount to war crimes, which I think is the appropriate frame through which to look at this.\u00a0 That work is going on.\u00a0 There needs to be accountability.\u00a0 And whether it\u2019s through the Ukrainian process itself, whether it\u2019s through mechanisms at the OSCE, the United Nations, the International Criminal Court \u2013 all of these things coming together I think will be very important to making sure that those who\u2019ve committed atrocities and those who ordered them are held accountable.\nSo that I think is the way to move forward, and that\u2019s happening.\u00a0 I talked to people on the ground in Ukraine who are working on documenting the evidence and building the cases for war crimes and the atrocities that have been committed.\nI think you know our position on the state sponsorship of terrorism designation.\u00a0 I\u2019d simply say two things.\u00a0 One, all \u2013 virtually all of the penalties, sanctions, and pressure that could be exerted through that designation, we\u2019re already doing.\u00a0 So as a practical matter in terms of what it can accomplish, we\u2019re already doing it and it\u2019s having \u2013 what we\u2019re doing through sanctions, through export controls, is having a profound effect on Russia, one that\u2019s growing every single day.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to get to be a heavier and heavier burden.\nThere are problems in the \u2013 using this particular vehicle, state sponsorship of terrorism designation, that may have unintended consequences that are not only not helpful, they may even be harmful.\u00a0 We\u2019ve talked about that and spelled it out.\u00a0 But what we are doing is working with Congress right now to see if there is another way forward that achieves what could be achieved through the use of the SST designation without any of the unintended consequences that would make it more counterproductive than productive.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0\u00a0Not only will we continue to hope, but we\u2019ll continue to work for the establishment of a sovereign, independent Palestinian state on June 4, 1967 lines to live in peace and security with Israel because if we don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re not going to have the peace that we\u2019ve worked so hard for.\u00a0 The two-state solution remains the only viable option to solve the conflict.\u00a0 We are determined to continue to work again with the U.S., whose leading role is essential, along with other partners to create political horizon and get the parties back to the table so that we can restart meaningful negotiations and achieve the peace that we\u2019ve all worked so hard to achieve.\nThere are unilateral measures that are undermining the viability of the two-state solution, and our position is very clear.\u00a0 We urge Israel to stop all unilateral measures that undermine the two-state solution in terms of settlements, confiscation of land, or encroachment on al-Aqsa, and it is in the interest of all of us to be able to do that because we want to preserve the chances for peace.\u00a0 And nobody is doing anybody a favor by opting for peace.\u00a0 Peace is right for all peoples of the region \u2013 Palestinians, Israelis, Jordanians, and everybody else.\nSo we recognize how difficult the situation is right now, but we cannot throw in the white towel.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to keep working at it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to continue to work for horizon and again, in partnership with our friends in the United States and our brethrens and other partners of the world, we continue to work for that and we\u2019ll hope for better times when Israelis and Palestinians come together in peace and start a new era of cooperation in the region.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Tareq Alass, Mamlakeh TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to ask my question in Arabic, please.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 One second.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, of course.\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, you talked about the firmness of the relationships between Jordan and the United States.\u00a0 What are the horizons of the bilateral cooperation in the future between the two countries, and what are the fields that you work to reinforce bilaterally with Jordan and also regionally?\nAnd also Mr. Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi, what are Jordan\u2019s and United States\u2019 priorities in the region?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, I think it\u2019s very important to remember that this is a friendship that\u2019s endured for more than six decades, and throughout that time we\u2019ve built ties, connections, binds between our governments, but also and especially between our people.\u00a0 And that\u2019s an incredibly strong foundation.\nThe MOU today only strengthens that foundation and will allow us to do even more together.\u00a0 The MOU and the different areas of focus really go to a number of things where I see us working together even more closely in the years ahead.\u00a0 Some of this, of course, is the work that the United States and Jordan have been doing for years regionally to try to advance peace, to try to advance stability, to try to advance prosperity.\u00a0 And there couldn\u2019t be two closer partners in that effort.\nBut also \u2013 and the MOU sets this out and so does \u2013 so do discussions we have on a regular basis \u2013 we\u2019re working on many of the issues that have the biggest impact on the lives of our people in trying to improve those lives: trying to create greater economic opportunity, jobs throughout the entire society; making sure that when it comes to vital resources that people need, including water, energy, that all of these things we\u2019re working to build access to together.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be working on everything from dealing with the effects of climate change to global health.\u00a0 So the agenda is in many ways global, but the impact, we hope, in the work that we\u2019re doing together is going to be profoundly felt in Jordan, the United States, and in the region as a whole.\nThere are a whole series of other regional challenges where we\u2019re working together, but I think a lot of the focus is on making sure that together we\u2019re looking at ways to concretely improve the lives of people in our countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s our fundamental responsibility, and there\u2019s much that we can do, we are doing, and we\u2019ll do even more of as a result of the MOU to do just that.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0 If I may answer \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Please.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0 \u2014 in Arabic.\n(Via interpreter) As His Excellency the Secretary said, our friendship with United States is a historical one.\u00a0 Our partnership is firm, it\u2019s fruitful, and continuous.\u00a0 And signing this MOU today, an MOU that is the longest and largest since we started signing MOUs, is an indicator, a clear and practical indicator of the firmness of this relationship and this friendship.\u00a0 And we highly appreciate the support of the United States continues to offer the kingdom and which will greatly help us expand the economic and administrative reform programs that you know of, and it will also help us to deal with the ramifications of the economic conditions that affect our resources.\nSo our priority is clear.\u00a0 We work together bilaterally on pushing development.\u00a0 And as His Excellency said, there is great American support for our development projects in the fields of water, energy, finding employment opportunities, providing the economic environment to have a better future that our people deserve.\u00a0 And the support that this MOU contains is approximately $1.5 billion for every year for seven years, and that happens at a time when we take serious reforms, and they\u2019ll have a great role to play in this.\nOur regional priority, which we both commit to, is to bring peace, security, and stability in our region.\u00a0 Our region has more than its share of crises, and we work together to bring back peace and the political process to its proper path and achieve a comprehensive solution on the basis of the two countries to solve the crisis in Syria, Yemen, Libya, and achieve the development that gives us the ability to respond to the needs of our peoples in an honorable, dignified life, productive life.\nAnd again, His Majesty the King and President Biden more than once affirmed the important centrality of this relationship, and we commit to work with our friends in the United States, and we thank our friends in the United States for all the support that they offer us.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Shannon Crawford, ABC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, two questions.\u00a0 Recently we\u2019ve seen the leaders of China and India express their concern about the war in Ukraine directly to Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 Do you see this as a significant shift for Russia on the international stage?\nAnd second, family members of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner are meeting at the White House.\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s been more than 50 days since you put forward that substantial proposal for their freedom, but so far it hasn\u2019t been a successful proposal.\u00a0 Now, has Russia given you a serious counteroffer?\u00a0 And given your priorities at this department, when will you do more or will you do more than urge Russia to take the deal that\u2019s already on the table?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to the first part of your question, I think what you\u2019re hearing from China, from India, is reflective of concerns around the world about the effects of Russia\u2019s aggression on Ukraine \u2013 not just on the people of Ukraine, devastating as that\u2019s been, but on countries and people across the entire planet.\u00a0 It\u2019s an aggression not just against Ukraine and its people, it\u2019s an aggression against the very principles of international relations that help keep peace and security.\nThe United Nations Charter \u2013 we\u2019re about to head off to the United Nations for High-Level Week; the charter should be front and center.\u00a0 The number one violator of the charter right now is Russia.\u00a0 So there are real concerns that, I think, are being heard from countries around the world about that, and, of course, all of the impacts that this is having, including, for example, on food insecurity.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent a lot of time and a lot of focus in recent months in trying to address the challenges to food security that have been exacerbated dramatically by Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 We already had COVID, we already had climate change that were having profound effects on food insecurity.\u00a0 Add to that conflict, we now have well over 200 million people who are severely food insecure.\nThis is something that leaders in countries around the world are feeling, because their people are feeling it.\u00a0 And so I think what you\u2019re seeing is just a manifestation of the fact that this aggression has been an aggression against the interests of people across the planet, and I think it increases the pressure on Russia to end the aggression.\nWhen it comes to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, a few things.\u00a0 First, we \u2013 the President, the State Department, this institution, myself, other parts of our government \u2013 are working every single day to try to bring Americans who are being arbitrarily detained or unjustly held anywhere in the world, to bring them home, to bring them to freedom.\u00a0 That applies to Brittney and Paul certainly as well.\u00a0 Securing their release, securing the release of any American who\u2019s being arbitrarily detained is at the very top of my priority list.\u00a0 And as you said, we have put forward a substantial proposal to Russia.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to get into the details or the back and forth in public; I don\u2019t think that serves the interests of getting to an agreement.\nBut suffice to say we are working on it every day, and just because we don\u2019t say something or you don\u2019t see something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\u00a0 So we are working on it, and as you noted, the President has the opportunity to see both families today.\nLet me add, too, that any country that is engaging in wrongful detention is a threat to the safety of everyone traveling, working, and living abroad.\u00a0 And I think, among other things, it\u2019s going to have a profoundly chilling effect on people anywhere being interested or willing to travel to those countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that they need to take account of.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve also discussed before \u2013 and more to follow \u2013 we are looking at additional steps to take to make it clear that countries that engage in these practices will pay a real price.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Final question goes to Hussain al-Adwan, Jordan Radio and Television.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Blinken, I need ask in Arabic.\n(Via interpreter)\u00a0 Mr. Blinken, at the time that we face regional crises, most of which is refugeeism, is there bilateral cooperation to confront this challenge?\nYour Excellency, DPM Safadi, is the support that the United States is offering \u2013 giving to Jordan sufficient to face the refugeeism \u2013 refugees crisis?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Inaudible), would you mind repeating the part \u2013 because I didn\u2019t quite hear the \u2013 the beginning of it.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter)\u00a0 At the time that we face regional crises in the region, Jordan and the United States are two solid partners.\u00a0 Is their cooperation between two sides to deal with the refugees crisis in the region?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much; thank you for repeating it.\u00a0 In short, yes, absolutely.\u00a0 First, I want to come back to something I said.\u00a0 Jordan has demonstrated remarkable generosity and remarkable leadership by welcoming so many refugees, hundreds of thousands, since the start of the war in Syria.\u00a0 But not just welcoming them; also offering them the possibility of going to school, going to work, earning a livelihood, and this is quite extraordinary and remarkable.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen it firsthand on visits to Jordan, and I think countries around the world should be inspired by Jordan\u2019s example.\u00a0 Because, just to take a step back for one minute, we now have more people on the move around the world displaced from their homes \u2013 more than 100 million \u2013 than at any time in recorded history.\u00a0 And among them, of course, are many refugees.\nSo this is a responsibility.\u00a0 It\u2019s a global challenge; it\u2019s a global responsibility.\u00a0 Jordan has stepped up in a very significant way to that responsibility.\u00a0 And yes, we\u2019re proud to be a partner in that effort.\u00a0 Since the war in Syria started, we the United States have provided about 15 and a half billion dollars in humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people, including refugees.\u00a0 More than 2 billion of that has gone to Jordan to assist Jordan in the work that it\u2019s doing to support these refugees.\u00a0 This year alone we announced more than $1.5 billion, including more than $750 million this week, to help Syrians, including those who are in Jordan.\nLike Jordan, we\u2019re also committed to finding an end to the conflict.\u00a0 We want to make sure that work is being done to try to advance a political settlement in Syria that\u2019s consistent with Security Council Resolution 2254.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re working more broadly to try to expand humanitarian access in Syria so that people who are there can be helped.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019re working to keep the pressure on ISIS, on Daesh to sustain some of the local ceasefires that have taken shape, even as we remain committed to ensuring that there\u2019s accountability and respect for international law, given the grievous violations of international law and atrocities that have been committed over so many years in Syria.\u00a0 But all of these things together go to the work that we\u2019re doing in partnership to help Jordan as it helps so many people.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 The short answer is that the United States has gone above and beyond in terms of helping us cope with the challenge of refugees.\u00a0 As the Secretary just said, a tremendous amount of money was sent to help us meet the needs of refugees not just in Jordan, but wherever they are in the region and beyond.\u00a0 But meeting the needs of refugees cannot be the responsibility of the U.S. and Jordan alone.\u00a0 This is a global responsibility; it\u2019s a global challenge.\u00a0 All of us need to come together to ensure that refugees get the dignified lives that that they deserve.\u00a0 The U.S. is doing its part; we in Jordan are doing our part.\u00a0 A lot of our partners are contributing, but I must say that this is a time where we see dwindling amount of support for refugees.\u00a0 And I think all of us need to come together to make sure that refugees and host countries get the resources they need to offer refugees education, health services, and a hope for the future.\nI was just telling my dear friend here that 50 percent of Syrians, of the 1.3 million Syrians in Jordan, are under the age of 15.\u00a0 They need schools, they need universities, they need jobs.\u00a0 And that problem is still there, and we must do everything we can to provide those refugees with the lives they deserve, because the fact is if we provide refugees with hope, with education, with jobs, with a shot at decent lives, they\u2019ll be a \u2013 positive members of the societies in which they are now, and they\u2019ll be the force that will be able to build their countries in the future.\u00a0 But if we abandon them to hate and despair and ignorance, then we\u2019re all looking at a very gloomy future for them and for the region.\u00a0 So that support needs to continue to come in.\nAnd as the Secretary said, we also have to work on a political solution to this crisis.\u00a0 It\u2019s gone on for far too long, caused too much suffering, too much pain, and 2254 is a benchmark against which we all need to work towards realizing an end to this crisis and find a solution that will allow people to go back to their country voluntarily and resume the building of (inaudible).\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0That concludes the press conference.\u00a0 Thank you, Your excellencies.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Purdue University", "location": "West Lafayette, Indiana", "date": "September 13, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 This is an amazing turnout.\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe there wasn\u2019t something better to do.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Is there an extra credit or something?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThank you.\u00a0 Great to be with you.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a wonderful day here at Purdue.\u00a0 I was here with my colleague and friend from the administration Gina Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce, and we spent the morning with President Daniels, with Senator Young and Governor Holcomb, and in part we were here to celebrate and spotlight the passage of some really important legislation, the CHIPS and Science Act, which is going to help ensure that the United States remains the leader in semiconductors and chip technology.\nBut what I had a chance to see here today firsthand is what an extraordinary institution Purdue is. And the thing that came most to mind to me was that it\u2019s got to be one of the leading, if not the leading, human fabs for the next generation of people who are going to lead us, lead this country, into the technological future, into the scientific future, into the innovative future. And that\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing and it\u2019s \u2013 makes a big difference just being here in person, getting a feel for it, and getting to meet so many of you.\nBut there\u2019s a particular reason that I wanted to come to this classroom today, and that\u2019s I\u2019ve got a devious purpose in mind.\u00a0 We want you.\u00a0 We want you to consider coming into government at some point in your careers, doing something in public service, and maybe even something at the State Department.\u00a0 And I want us to talk about that just a little bit because it may not seem like the most obvious connection in the world.\u00a0 Why is someone from the State Department, dealing with America\u2019s foreign policy and our role in the world to coming here, talking to incredible people that were focused in STEM?\u00a0 And it\u2019s pretty simple, and this is what I wanted to share with you, and then I\u2019m really eager to have a conversation.\nI\u2019ve been doing this for nearly 30 years, and as I was moving along and working on all of these different foreign policy challenges that we get, it became more and more apparent to me that so much of what we were working on, so many of the problems that we were trying to solve, actually had a profound connection to science, technology, innovation.\u00a0 And often the answer, or at least part of the answer, had science and tech somewhere as part of it.\nBut here\u2019s the problem.\u00a0 Many of us who are working in government on foreign policy don\u2019t come up through this lens of science.\u00a0 We tend to be humanities majors; too many of us have law degrees \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 don\u2019t need too many more of those.\u00a0 And it really got to the point where I said to myself that we need scientists and technologists around the table just to tell us whether we need scientists and technologists around the table, because we need people to help identify not just the problems but a different angle on the solutions that some of us were used to bringing to the table.\nAnd so we started to do things \u2013 this is back during the Obama administration, when I last served \u2013 to try to do just that, to actually bring more people from STEM disciplines into government, through internships, through fellowships, through new programs.\u00a0 And now that I\u2019m back doing this, we\u2019re in \u2013 even more than we were just six or seven years ago \u2013 I think in an entirely different place in a few ways.\nFirst, virtually all of the technology that is going to be already but will continue in even more profound ways to shape our lives, to shape the way we live, the way we work, the way we interact, the way we compete \u2013 each and every one of those, whether it is quantum, whether it\u2019s AI, whether it\u2019s biotech, whether it\u2019s the chip itself, there is a profound connection between what we do here at home and what we\u2019re doing around the world.\u00a0 Here at home, we\u2019re making the right investments, but around the world we have to find ways to bring others along, because the way this technology gets used \u2013 the rules, the norms, the standards that people agree on that govern their use \u2013 is going to have a profound impact in and of itself on the way that we live and the way that we work.\u00a0 And is it going to happen in a way that reflects, we hope, our basic values of openness and tolerance and respect for privacy, or is it going to happen in a different way?\u00a0 So we need to be at the table when we\u2019re \u2013 all of these things are getting decided, and we need to have people at the table who actually know what they\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one thing.\nThe other thing is so many of the problems we\u2019re trying to solve, as I said, have a clear technology, innovation, science aspect to their solution.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to figure out how to do a better job overcoming profound crises in food security around the world.\u00a0 There\u2019s going to be part of that where the answer is grounded in science, in technology, in agro science.\u00a0 If we\u2019re trying to figure out how to prevent the next pandemic, we know there\u2019s going to be an answer that\u2019s grounded in science and technology as well as in the policies that we pursue to advance it.\nWe\u2019re trying to think about how we protect our economy, particularly dealing with climate change, and how we make an energy transition that makes sense, that keeps faith with keeping people employed but also keeps faith with trying to protect the planet.\u00a0 That\u2019s probably going to have an answer that\u2019s also grounded in science and technology.\nIt\u2019s a long way of saying so many of the things that we\u2019re actually doing day in, day out at the State Department are all about many of the things that many of you are interested in, working on, and becoming expert in.\u00a0 And I\u2019m here to tell you that the State Department is one place where you can actually pursue that passion, pursue that interest, and do it in a couple of novel and interesting ways.\nOne, doing it working for your country.\u00a0 That has its own value that\u2019s hard to really quantify.\u00a0 And two, getting to do it around the world in really interesting ways and engaging with incredibly interesting people.\u00a0 So I really hope this is something that some of you will at least consider as you\u2019re thinking about where you want to go, where your careers will take you.\nI\u2019ve had the experience, as you\u2019ve heard, in working in government, working in the private sector, working in different pursuits.\u00a0 And at least for me, there\u2019s been something unique about getting to go to work every day and either literally or figuratively having a flag behind your back.\u00a0 There\u2019s something particularly special about that, hard to quantify.\u00a0 And yeah, the benefits may be better elsewhere \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but there\u2019s something particularly special about that.\u00a0 So I hope as you\u2019re thinking about it, whether it\u2019s now, in five years, 10 years, 20 years down the road, think about giving some time to public service.\nI said this a little bit earlier today.\u00a0 I know there\u2019s a lot of cynicism about it and sometimes for every understandable reasons, but I can tell you from my own experience that virtually all the people that I get to work with every day, whether it\u2019s in the administration, whether it\u2019s in Congress, Republicans, Democrats, Independents \u2013 they\u2019re all there because they\u2019re trying to do what they think is the right thing to do to make the country just a little bit better, a little bit safer, a little bit healthier, a little bit wealthier, create opportunities for people.\u00a0 We have disagreements about the best way to do that, and that\u2019s fine.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u00a0 But most people are really motivated to try to do the right thing, and if you can find a group of likeminded people, you can actually get a few things done.\nSo that\u2019s really what I wanted to share at the outset.\u00a0 I\u2019m eager to have some questions.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s particularly interesting and important \u2013 I would like to have a colleague join us who has \u2013 I think can speak better than I can to how (inaudible) grounded in STEM and in the sciences actually can make a career in the State Department.\u00a0 So Mahlet Mesfin,\u00a0who is one of my science and tech advisers, let you say a few words and maybe share your own experience.\nMS MESFIN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s truly an honor to be here today with you and all the students at Purdue.\u00a0 A little bit of background about me.\u00a0 I have degrees in chemical engineering, a masters and PhD in bioengineering.\u00a0 I became an engineer because I was interested in solving problems and I wanted to make the world a better place, and I liked science and I liked math.\u00a0 But through my grad degree I realized that I could do that in many different ways.\u00a0 And so I did one of the fellowship programs the Secretary mentioned, came down to D.C., and 10 years later, a few different career moves, here I am at the State Department as a senior advisor speaking next to the Secretary of State of the United States of America.\u00a0 And I can truly say that that is never a path that I ever imagined would come.\nI just want to talk a little bit about different career options \u2013 is it not on?\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 A few different career sort of tracks if you\u2019re interested in policy careers at the State Department.\u00a0 So STEM experts can come to the State Department and actually work in the areas in which you were trained, and that\u2019s what you do day to day.\u00a0 So people I work with on the teams that are out there around the world, sort of helping to address outbreaks of diseases, whether it\u2019s Ebola or COVID or monkeypox or others.\u00a0 There are teams there that are in the middle of negotiating with countries around the world about how we are going to protect our oceans and our biodiversity.\u00a0 There\u2019s people who are thinking through with international partners and domestic agencies as well how are we defining the principles that will dictate how technologies are developed and used.\u00a0 So those are usually civil servants and they\u2019re scattered throughout the department, and that\u2019s one option.\nYou also have people who have STEM backgrounds who can come and not necessarily do anything that they\u2019ve been trained to do, so they\u2019re more generalists.\u00a0 I\u2019m one of those people.\u00a0 On a day-to-day basis some things I think about are semiconductors or biotechnology or water security or internet freedom or kind of anything in between.\u00a0 And so civil servants can be generalists, but we also have a Foreign Service track at the State Department, which is a generalist of a different kind.\u00a0 And it\u2019s exciting because you get to live all over the world; you get to be in embassies, and you get to change jobs, change countries every two or three years.\u00a0 But you can have sort of an environment, science, technology, health portfolio, and we need more of those people around the world as well.\nSo whether it\u2019s a subject matter expert or a generalist or anything in between, I think, as the Secretary mentioned, technology issues will continue to grow and to be so important, and we need people like you in the table \u2013 or at the table, in the room, really helping to shape and drive U.S. policy and diplomacy.\u00a0 And it is a unique experience that you can get really nowhere else.\nAnd so the last thing I\u2019ll just say is I think that sometimes I feel like my career is kind of like a dream that I never knew that I had.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And so I think that it\u2019s really exciting that all of you guys are here, here learning about these opportunities and kind of the realm of the possibilities.\u00a0 And I hope that one day one of those possibilities will bring you to work for the department.\u00a0 So thank you very much, and I turn it back over to you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

This is, I think, the most exciting human fab that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0 And building the next generation of leaders in technology \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly powerful.\u00a0 So I couldn\u2019t agree more, and I\u2019m really, Mitch, just grateful to you, grateful to our colleagues for bringing us here and making sure that we could experience this firsthand.\nSo why am I here, since my portfolio does not usually extend to things domestic?\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty simple.\u00a0 What we do here at home goes directly to our standing and our ability to lead around the world.\u00a0 And when other countries see us coming together in the way we\u2019ve been able to come together with the CHIPS Act, not just across parties, but across academia, industry, government, at the state level, the federal level, that sends a very powerful message.\u00a0 And it says that we\u2019re going to be making the investments that we need to remain the world\u2019s leader in the most critical technology that\u2019s defining our future.\u00a0 And that becomes a really powerful source of attraction. Other countries want to work with us; they want to partner with us; they want to stand with us.\u00a0 So for me, the investments that we\u2019re making at home, they go directly to my ability to help effectively represent the country around the world.\nFinally, I\u2019d say this, Mitch, to your question as well:\u00a0 Look, we are also dealing with other countries around the world that are making massive investments in the industries and technologies of the future.\u00a0 I think one of the things that separates us is when government comes in, what it can do most effectively is to really be a catalyst for the private sector and other stakeholders in our country to move forward.\u00a0 So this is not about government doing and paying for everything.\u00a0 It\u2019s government, hopefully, bringing people together in a smart way, acting as a catalyst, and inspiring the kind of investment we need to carry us forward.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Senator?\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0 Well, I want to thank Purdue for putting on such a great presentation today.\u00a0 And I say that directly to the postdocs we heard from, many of the rank-and-file students, and of course the professors.\u00a0 It really is impressive, and I think it\u2019s indicative of the fact that Indiana is ready to go as it relates to implementing this effort.\nThis effort, from the beginning, it\u2019s been focused on enhancing our economic security and our national security at once.\u00a0 Anyone that \u2013 who needs evidence that our economic security has been undermined by our inability to source especially high-end chips here in the United States, but even some of the commodity chips, need look no further than Fort Wayne, Indiana, where you\u2019ve seen an idling of a GM plant twice this year already.\u00a0 Visit some of our farmers who are unable to get their combines fixed because the essential computer chips that go into those machinery cannot be sourced.\u00a0 Basically anything with an on/off switch these days requires microprocessors, and so our country is going to have to have at least some measure of independence with respect to these to prepare for the next interruption.\u00a0 It could be a global pandemic or it could be a geopolitical rival that, with great intentionality, decides to interrupt sourcing of these computer chips from other countries.\nNow, how do we get them here in the United States?\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty clear what other countries are doing.\u00a0 They were offering some measure of incentives.\u00a0 It\u2019s analogous to a governor offering incentives to get an employer into their state.\nThe happy coincidence that we will reference from time to time is what benefits our economic security also benefits the industrial Midwest, where for generations we\u2019ve prided ourself on making things.\u00a0 These are higher-end things, so we include funding to prepare people to research, to design, and ultimately to manufacture these computer chips here in the industrial Midwest.\nAnd there\u2019s a national security component to this which also cannot go unmentioned.\u00a0 Our missile systems, basically all of our high-end weapon platforms require very sophisticated computer chips, and we need to make those here and ensure that they\u2019re made in a trusted fashion, not tampered with, and so we have the resident capability \u2013 I\u2019m looking at representatives from Crane.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been experts at \u2013 in this area of microchip production and inspection for a generation now, and we\u2019re going to be able to saddle them up and get them more into the game.\nSo it\u2019s at once mentioned \u2013 this is an economic security and a national security play, and one that will have the spillover effect of significantly benefiting people here in this room but really all across the industrial Midwest.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Well, thanks.\u00a0 The \u2013 Madam Secretary, most of the money and most of the attention so far on the CHIPS Act has focused on the manufacturing end and the fact that we have fallen as far as we have in terms of our share of world production, but you\u2019ve made I think the excellent point that the R&D investments, if properly directed and successful, might be just as important over time.\u00a0 Would \u2013 can you elaborate on that a little?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Yes, thank you.\u00a0 So the CHIPS Act is a $50 billion investment, and all of the excitement and coverage frequently focuses on the 39 billion that will be incentives for companies to build fabs in America, which we desperately need.\u00a0 But there\u2019s 11 billion for research and development.\nAmerica has always been and will always be a country of inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs.\u00a0 That\u2019s what makes us great.\u00a0 It\u2019s at core to our strength.\u00a0 And as I said before, we\u2019ve fallen behind.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t been investing enough in basic research.\u00a0 We heard it today.\u00a0 We heard it today on the tour how much of what is happening here began with a federal grant, whether it\u2019s from NIST or the Department of Defense, some collaboration between the federal government and universities.\nSo this 11 billion will be for the National Semiconductor and Technology Center, and it is \u2013 we talked today about going from lab to fab.\u00a0 We talked about how if you want to compete, you have to go fast, you have to reduce the time between lab and fab.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is for.\u00a0 So what we\u2019re envisioning is exactly what you\u2019re doing here, quite frankly, which is bringing together universities with companies, with the federal government, to solve problems \u2013 interdisciplinary hubs of research and development to solve problems.\u00a0 Very applied.\nThink of Bell Labs, right?\u00a0 A lot of you are smiling.\u00a0 The young people are like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 There\u2019s a great book about it.\u00a0 Go google Bell Labs.\u00a0 The loss \u2013 the diminishing of Bell Labs was a real loss for this country.\u00a0 It was a beehive of activity, a place where inventors and innovators could come together to solve problems and produce an enormous amount of research and great products.\nSo I \u2013 yeah, I\u2019m excited about it.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just building stuff.\u00a0 We talked today about packaging, design.\u00a0 It\u2019s all of that.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this will be for.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Did you want to lead the witness with a question about workforce?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0 So a few times today, the Secretary has said this is a human fab, a talent fab, which is true.\u00a0 And every company you talk to, literally every one including the ones in booths, will tell you the thing they\u2019re most worried about is talent.\u00a0 The rate limiting factor to growth is talent.\u00a0 And by the way, it\u2019s at every level.\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 Process engineers, technicians, to the PhD physicists and the like.\u00a0 Your governor has done a lot here around talent and developing workforce development, so maybe you could talk a little bit, Governor, about what\u2019s working here and how we scale it to meet \u2013 to meet the needs.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 A lot\u2019s going on.\u00a0 Let me first say that I share our Hoosier guests\u2019 excitement and enthusiasm about what we saw here today at Purdue.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spent most of my life in this state, and every time I come back to the campus I, too, am blown away because they\u2019re working on current issues and vexing, lingering problems that the nation faces and certainly we do as a state.\u00a0 But I\u2019m reminded as a student of history surrounded by engineers that might \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as a student of history I\u2019m reminded of a famous quote from Colonel George Rogers Clark before our nation was even founded, and I\u2019ll paraphrase.\u00a0 And he said: Great things can be accomplished by men \u2013 and women \u2013 well conducted.\u00a0 And so while this was bipartisan, it was also, as Secretary Blinken noted, a multifaceted, multi-government-level effort.\u00a0 And harnessing not just that purpose but the passion that we all bring to bear has been equally exciting.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And by the way, well-conducted may be the perfect term for this.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0Choosing my quotes carefully.\u00a0 But that leads us to challenges throughout history, certainly Colonel Clark, but also President Kennedy when he laid out a challenge.\u00a0 And to be in this very hall is a reminder of that.\u00a0 And then the objectives, Secretary Raimondo, that you put forward with the CHIPS and Science Act really got us synchronized, and tactically and strategically as a state.\u00a0 And of course, the research has been ongoing.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019ve been reaching out and working with companies like SkyWater and Mediatech for \u2013 on the design and the fab portion of this project.\nBut it really starts much earlier than that if we\u2019re going to truly have a pipeline that\u2019s going to be able to supply that talent on an ongoing basis, and to be able to scale at the rate and velocity that\u2019s required for us not just to compete but catch up and lead.\u00a0 And so we start very early in the state of Indiana, very intentionally, with K through 12 \u2013 and you mentioned lab to fab.\u00a0 We view this as GED to PhD.\u00a0 And everyone has not just a role to play, but an opportunity to play it, and the state of Indiana is putting our money where our mouth is and making those investments regionally to be able to respond to the needs of not just the industry, but of the community.\u00a0 Our community college is here today as well, Ivy Tech.\u00a0 Vincennes University will have a prominent role in this, making sure students that come out of high school have a brightly lit pathway that they can contribute to this national and economic security issue.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Same question to you, President Daniels. You have done extraordinary things here \u2013 country\u2019s first semiconductor master\u2019s degree program.\u00a0 What have you learned and where do we go from here?\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Listening to the question and the answers has me reflecting back \u2013 I\u2019m near the end of 10 years here.\u00a0 But one of the first major speeches I was asked to give was to the National Academy of Engineers in 2013.\u00a0 And at that time, the \u2013 on everyone\u2019s mind was the Augustine Report, a national commission which had reported, oh, within a year or two before that, and its primary finding was the single most important thing to the nation\u2019s competitiveness and future success was to turn out at least 10,000 more engineers a year.\u00a0 Well, that happened to coincide with our plans and dreams for the growth of Purdue University, and specifically in the engineering and the STEM disciplines.\nAnd I remember telling that audience Purdue will speak for the first 7 or 8 percent; you folks figure out the rest.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve done that.\u00a0 We are now by a clear margin the largest engineering college, for instance, in the top five in the world.\u00a0 Similar growth has happened in computer science, the natural sciences, and applied engineering through our newly expanded polytechnic institute.\u00a0\u00a0 So we are trying to do our part \u2013 the governor mentioned our community college.\u00a0 We\u2019re offering our curriculum, all that applies to them, so that they can produce associate degrees.\u00a0 Many of those we hope will advance on to bachelor\u2019s degrees in semiconductor technology, the entire spectrum from materials through design to ultimate manufacturing.\u00a0 So we\u2019re excited about the role.\nI guess the last thing I\u2019ll say is we should all be sober about the challenges here.\u00a0 There\u2019s a labor shortage in this country.\u00a0 This state, largely through some great public leadership, is below the level we have thought of as full employment.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a02.6.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Unthinkable percentage not long ago.\u00a0 And by the way, the participation rate, which is stubbornly low in the country, is higher by a couple points in Indiana.\u00a0 It\u2019s not as though people aren\u2019t willing and eager to work.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve got our work cut out for us, not just because of the newness and complexity of this new \u2013 of this sector, but because we\u2019re going to have to build a semiconductor economy that attracts people when they have a lot of other choices.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, absolutely.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0So let me pick up on something that was mentioned a time or two.\u00a0 Many of us in this part of the country have imagined for a long time that the difference in, I\u2019ll say, business conditions, cost, quality of life, and other factors would lead ultimately to some migration of investment and people from the coasts to the Midwest, and a lot of people are talking about that. We\u2019re excited.\u00a0 We see what happened at Intel earlier this week.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019re thrilled at the SkyWater investment, the only all-American-owned semiconductor company \u2013 (applause) \u2013 planning to come here.\nBut bring us a dose of realism if we need it.\u00a0 Our \u2013 will we look back at these as interesting exceptions or the beginning of a trend that does lead to this Silicon Heartland that people talk about?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I think you have all the ingredients.\u00a0 There\u2019s no reason it shouldn\u2019t be a trend, no reason it should not be a trend.\u00a0 You \u2013 and by the way, that\u2019s why the Midwest was once forever the industrial heartland.\u00a0 It\u2019s in your bones to make things here.\u00a0 And so we have to get back to it, making the next generation of more advanced \u2013 advanced manufacturing.\u00a0 But you have the research universities, the land grant research universities, what we saw today \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get any Big 10 rivalries up, but Ohio State\u2019s pretty good, Michigan\u2019s pretty good, Michigan State.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0They\u2019re really not rivals.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I know \u2013 okay.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I\u2019m \u2014\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t worry.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m tiptoeing into this, but we\u2019ll just say a deep well of public universities which are top notch.\u00a0 Every CEO I\u2019ve talked to today is thinking about climate risk.\u00a0 The Midwest is actually very well positioned in that regard \u2013 not that anywhere is immune from climate disasters and weather, severe weather events, but well positioned, plenty of water, reasonable energy prices.\u00a0 And so I \u2013 and a hub, as you just said, with Intel and SkyWater, so you\u2019re building from a base.\u00a0 So I think that it ought to be a trend.\u00a0 It should be a trend, and I think if you continue to make the right investments in workforce training, investing in your public universities, in having good business practices, good place to do business, I feel great about the opportunity.\nAnd by the way, it\u2019s good for the country.\u00a0 When you walk around and you hear from some of the students, are all the opportunities on the coasts?\u00a0 As someone from the coast, no.\u00a0 The opportunity\u2019s right here, and any of these companies would be lucky to have you.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Governor, you want to say an amen to that?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 Well, thanks \u2013 yeah, thanks for the softball.\u00a0 Yeah, I mean, as a \u2013 the reason I\u2019m most encouraged is this is nothing new to us.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing this since the founding of our state, forging our way out of the forest and innovating and manufacturing and making things, growing things.\u00a0 We\u2019ve figured that out.\u00a0 We\u2019ve developed very mature supply chain lines in multiple sectors.\u00a0 When you think about our state, orthopedics, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, logistics \u2013 all of these areas are dependent on that linchpin, that semiconductor, that transistor that\u2019s going to make, that\u2019s going to power not just our future but our \u2013 the actual companies.\nAnd what the \u2013 I think one of the big items involved in this whole act is the federal government putting skin in the game in such a big way has allowed our companies to now take risks that they maybe couldn\u2019t afford to take before.\u00a0 And so as we coalesce around this mission \u2013 and it truly is just that \u2013 it\u2019s going to attract more FDI, more foreign direct investment, but it\u2019s going to attract more SkyWaters and more designers, and that whole ecosystem will grow as we have been doing over the last couple centuries, tethered to the industries of the future.\u00a0 And, obviously, we have the right tax and regulatory environment, we have the energy, the fresh water, unlike some of our competitors around the world.\nAnd so it really is advantage Indiana, not to mention we\u2019re here at Purdue \u2013 proudly so \u2013 but we also sport, so to speak, Notre Dame and Indiana University and Trine.\u00a0 So we have this network of colleges and universities, public and private, community colleges as well, that really are the feeder system into a SkyWater\u2019s bright future.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 In a moment we\u2019re going to get to a couple of student questions, but I have one more, and if I may, let me start with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 Switching geographies here in a big way, you were among the very first \u2013 along with our good friend Keith Krach and others \u2013 to begin identifying the growing number of ways in which technology issues were intruding on and overlapping with foreign policy issues.\u00a0 We now refer to this under the heading of tech diplomacy sometimes.\u00a0 I \u2013 for all I know, you coined the term.\u00a0 But as an early thought leader in this area, could you talk a little bit about that and how some of the work that will happen here has implications for the work you do every day?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mitch, this really came out of necessity more than anything else.\u00a0 For my sins I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in government \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 now 30 years.\u00a0 And last time I was in government, during the Obama administration, working at the White House and the State Department, sitting around these conference tables grappling with foreign policy problems, challenges we had around the world, it struck me \u2013 and not a novel insight, but it nonetheless struck me that so many of the solutions or at least part of the solution probably had a science or tech component to it, and yet most of us who are working on foreign policy are not brought up in these disciplines.\u00a0 If you look, there are exceptions, but for the most part people are coming from the humanities, coming from law, and so it\u2019s not our natural instinct.\nAnd I came to the point where I thought that I needed scientists and technologists around the table just to tell me whether we needed scientists and technologists around the table to figure something out that we weren\u2019t necessarily seeing.\u00a0 And so we made a real effort to do that, because what we saw is that, look, whether you\u2019re dealing with everything from trying to figure out how to monitor an arms control agreement, to pulling a land mine out of the ground, to tracking refugees around the world, to building stronger food security systems, to electrifying different parts of the planet that need it \u2013 and I could go down the list \u2013 science, technology, engineering, all of that was front and center.\nAnd now, of course, as we are dealing with a world that is shaped \u2013 our lives are literally shaped day in, day out by technology, starting with the chip \u2013 but whether it\u2019s quantum, whether it\u2019s AI, whether it\u2019s biotech, the way we live, the way we work, all of that is shaped by technology.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one piece of it.\nThe other piece of it is that whether we like it or not, in order to make sure that technology is being used in a way that hopefully advances our interests, hopefully reflects our values, we have to be engaged with other countries.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have the luxury of getting to decide this and shape this alone.\u00a0 And so for us, at least, getting into that tech diplomacy, making sure that the United States is at the table when decisions are being made \u2013 for example, about what are the rules, what are the norms, what are the standards that decide how technology is going to be used.\u00a0 Well, a lot of that\u2019s happening in some windowless room somewhere around the world.\u00a0 We need to be there, and not only do we need to be there, we need to be able to carry the debate.\u00a0 And part of that is making sure we have the most talented expert people doing this.\u00a0 Part of it is also making sure that we have the alliances and partnerships of likeminded countries so that our collective weight can carry the day.\nAll of this is part of tech diplomacy, but there is issue after issue where this is front and center in what we\u2019re doing every day.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to protect businesses and the country from cyber attacks, unfortunately something that\u2019s increasingly prevalent.\u00a0 Well, that goes directly to our capacity to understand, deal with, and bring others along when it comes to creating a protective system.\u00a0 We want to make sure that technology is not used for ill.\u00a0 We see technology being used by surveillance states.\u00a0 That\u2019s a huge problem that we\u2019re contending with.\u00a0 We see technology potentially undermining privacy.\u00a0 But again, all of these things, if we\u2019re going to be effective in dealing with them, we have to be doing this on a global scale, not just here at home.\nSo we\u2019ve been inspired by that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve actually tried to build a State Department that\u2019s more fit for purpose.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t our natural bread and butter.\u00a0 We\u2019re usually in the business of trying to prevent conflicts or bring peace, and that\u2019s still the bread and butter, but technology may be a big piece of that.\u00a0 But we need to make sure that we actually have the organization and the talent to do it.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is just a few months ago we set up \u2013 the State Department\u2019s organized around bureaus.\u00a0 These are the most important components of the organizational structure of our department.\u00a0 We established a bureau for cyber security and digital policy.\u00a0 We now have a senior envoy for emerging technology.\u00a0 We want to make sure that we can play our part, we can do what we need to do, to help advance the national interest when it comes to this.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 By fascinating coincidence, we\u2019re having to learn something about your world too.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud to tell you that Purdue has thrown its arms open.\u00a0 We have welcomed more Ukrainian scholars than any other school we\u2019re aware of, and I look forward, of course, to them being able to go home safely, but for now they can continue their work here.\nAnd in addition to that, we welcome on an annual basis a number of refugees from the state of Illinois \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 who I\u2019m always proud to greet. \u00a0And one of them is our questioner this morning, so let me introduce Denae Galloway, an ECE student from Orland Hills I believe it is.\u00a0 Denae.\u00a0 And thank you for joining us this morning, and your question, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you for having me.\u00a0 Secretary Raimondo, we\u2019ve heard a lot this morning about the need to fill jobs in the semiconductor industry.\u00a0 So how can young students, especially women as myself, prepare to be competitive in this growing market?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Yeah, great question.\u00a0 So let me say a few things about this.\u00a0 The Governor and President referenced the talent shortage and the tight labor market, and you asked for some \u2013 a sobering comment.\u00a0 We have to be very real about the fact that if we don\u2019t as a country, as industry, figure out how to fully tap into and unleash the talent of women in tech companies, we will not compete.\u00a0 We cannot compete if we leave our most talented women out of the equation.\u00a0 And now, maybe when I say that you\u2019re thinking: Well, it\u2019s hard; women don\u2019t stick with it, this that and the other.\u00a0 I will stipulate that.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard.\u00a0 I agree with you.\u00a0 You\u2019re in the business of solving problems.\u00a0 Solve the problem.\u00a0 We have to solve the problem together.\nLet\u2019s think about teaching engineering differently.\u00a0 Let\u2019s think about mentorship initiatives.\u00a0 Let\u2019s think about starting earlier.\u00a0 The Governor talks about from pre-K and such \u2013 start when girls are four, five years old.\u00a0 I \u2013 prior to this gig, I was the Governor of Rhode Island, and one of the things I did there was we became I think the first state in the country to teach computer science in every public school, in every grade, starting in kindergarten.\u00a0 And we did that by partnering with companies to do it \u2013 innovative.\u00a0 And since we did that, not surprisingly, the number of women and students of color taking and succeeding on the AP Computer Science exam skyrocketed.\u00a0 So we just have to do it.\u00a0 We have to find ways to have more women at every level of science, technology, engineering, and math in academia and in business.\nAnd for the women, obviously what you need to do is what you\u2019re doing: Go to a world-class institution, work as hard as you can, seek out mentorship, and if you\u2019re trained here and you do well, you will get a job and you \u2013 as I said before, a company will be lucky to have you.\u00a0 And I would say, on a more personal level, although I\u2019m not a scientist \u2013 my dad was a chemist; he always wished that I could be, but I don\u2019t know, that wasn\u2019t my path \u2013 politics, every business, a lot of industries \u2013 I used to be in the business world; I sat on a dozen corporate boards, never with another man.\u00a0 I was the first female governor of Rhode Island.\u00a0 You\u2019ve just got to stick with it.\u00a0 Stick with it, because the world needs you to stick with it, because you have the talent and ability to solve the problems that we need to be solved.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Thank you, Denae.\u00a0 Great question.\u00a0 And we have a question from Jack Brewer, from right here in West Lafayette, a political science major.\u00a0 Jack.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I\u2019d first like to start off by saying thank you on behalf of the entire student body for being here today.\u00a0 And my question is: As you had the opportunity to see today, Purdue is currently hosting the Industrial Roundtable, which is one of the largest student-run job fairs in the nation.\u00a0 And I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the Department of State is currently looking for new talent, and I was wondering, what sorts of skills or attributes are you guys looking for out of new hires?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 I love this.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Asking for a friend?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Happy to take a look at a CV right after this.\u00a0 We can talk.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIt really flows exactly from what we were talking about a few minutes ago, which is \u2013 it\u2019s pretty simple.\u00a0 We need and we are looking for folks who are not just trained and experienced in the humanities; we need STEM.\u00a0 We need engineers. \u00a0We need technologists.\u00a0 We need folks who are steeped in AI and biotech, you name it.\u00a0 And we need that because of what we were just talking about.\u00a0 So many of the issues that we are actually dealing with every single day are crosscutting and bring in science and technology in ways that we have to make sure we\u2019re ready and effective in doing our jobs.\nSo one of things that we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re here at Purdue.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to open people\u2019s eyes to the possibility of not only public service, which by the way, whatever it is, if you \u2013 any of you get a chance to do that, please consider it.\u00a0 We need the most talented people in public service.\u00a0 And what I\u2019ve experienced, just as a parenthesis, as I know there can be a lot of cynicism about it at times, but most of the people that I\u2019m fortunate enough to work with, including everyone on this platform today, are just trying to do what they think is the right thing to make the country a little bit healthier, wealthier, wiser, stronger.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what really counts.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut if you\u2019re interested in climate policy, come to the State Department.\u00a0 We are trying to \u2013 John Kerry is leading efforts by now to make sure that we are bringing the rest of the world along with us as we try to grapple with this issue.\u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in cyber security and cyber policy, well, we\u2019re trying to be at the leading edge of that.\u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in any one of the many challenges that we\u2019re \u2013 that we face that have technology and science at their heart, come on down to the State Department.\u00a0 We need you.\nSo I\u2019m really glad that we\u2019re here, but I\u2019m especially glad that you asked the question because I know it might not be the natural instinct of people to say, \u201cOh, the State Department\u2019s a place that I can work.\u201d\u00a0 But if you look at the many things that we\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll probably find an avenue to actually do what you\u2019ve been trained in and want to do and actually make a difference \u2013 make a difference here in the United States for our country, but also make a difference around the world.\nSo we really welcome hearing from people.\u00a0 We have \u2013 we\u2019re bringing in fellows from the sciences.\u00a0 We have, as I said, new bureaus that are focused on science and technological pursuits.\u00a0 We want to make sure that we have the talent to actually fill those bureaus, run those bureaus, and carry us into the future \u2013 so \u2013 and I\u2019ll see you just around the corner.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Thank you, Jack.\u00a0 We\u2019re down literally to our last few minutes, so let me just offer each of the group, lightning-round style, a chance to address this general question:\u00a0 This new achievement in which each of you played a significant role of the CHIPS Act, if and when it succeeds and meets its expectations, what will Americans notice that\u2019s different?\u00a0 What will Americans see kind of ten years from now that they wouldn\u2019t have seen absent that accomplishment?\u00a0 Senator, would you go first?\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ll see a broadening and deepening of our startup and technology economy.\u00a0 It won\u2019t just include some of our coastal states and hot beds of venture capital investment, but we\u2019ll see it across the industrial Midwest and other areas.\u00a0 We\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re planting the seed corn, as we speak, to ensure that\u2019s the case.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see more opportunities for investors, entrepreneurs, and researchers and in places like Indiana.\nAnd I think we\u2019ll see enhanced national security.\u00a0 You\u2019ll see the United States of America leading the way when it comes to development and, as we work with partners and allies, co-development of the technologies of the future, which hopefully will allow us to prevent wars, but if ever called upon will allow us to fight and win the wars of the future with many of these technologies.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Governor.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0I think we\u2019ll see \u2013 just to echo the Senator\u2019s point \u2013 I think we\u2019ll see a continued broadening of our kind of seven sector development here in the State of Indiana.\u00a0 I\u2019m reminded by Secretary Blinken\u2019s comment earlier that as we get around the world, certainly part of my job is to try to bring more investment to the state of Indiana.\u00a0 And although I don\u2019t do foreign policy \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get on the wrong side of the Logan Act ever, wouldn\u2019t dream of it \u2013 but I am trying to bring back partnerships and solve problems together.\u00a0 And that requires a diverse perspective and that\u2019s going to help us get there faster as well.\u00a0 And so I\u2019m reminded with every visit I have that everyone has a neighbor to the north, south, east, or west and some are hostile; some are very friendly.\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0 Illinois?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 And they\u2019re looking for, seeking places of certainty and predictability and stability and continuity.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we offer, and so it truly is an exciting time to partner with Purdue, to partner with the corporate sector and local, state, and federal governments and see it actually work and make a difference.\u00a0 And I\u2019m confident it will.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0Madam Secretary.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I think when history writes about this, it\u2019ll be the beginning of a new chapter of American manufacturing, innovation, research and development.\u00a0 I really do.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been on the decline, and this is the beginning of the incline.\u00a0 And if we do it right, all these hundreds of thousands of jobs we create will go to people who look like America, to your question.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Last word, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think it\u2019s been covered incredibly well and comprehensively.\u00a0 I\u2019d just say that what I would expect to see, if we sustain this \u2013 if we carry it forward, if we do it, if we actually implement it \u2013 I think you\u2019ll see a lasting recognition that America\u2019s back, America is back on the world (inaudible).\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to see that countries respond to the fact that we\u2019re making these investments in our future.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to want to work with us.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to want to partner with us.\u00a0 And they\u2019re going to want to look to our leadership too.\u00a0 And that is going to have a material impact on our ability to provide for the safety, the wellbeing, the prosperity of our people.\u00a0 So if we get this right \u2013 which is not a guarantee, but if we get it right \u2013\u00a0 I think it does wonders over time in strengthening our standing around the world and really strengthening American leadership.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Over recent years, Purdue University has been privileged to play host to some spectacular leadership from all sectors of all society, but never a day that I recall in which we\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve felt more fortunate to have leaders as relevant both to our national success and to the mission we\u2019ve attempted to adopt here at Purdue University.\nSo to Secretary Raimondo, Secretary Blinken, as well as our own Hoosier public servants, thank you for a day we\u2019ll remember a long time at Purdue and do all we can to live up to.\u00a0 Thank you all for coming.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\n"}, {"url":

BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It is incredibly exciting to be here at Purdue at the Birck Center.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen this morning is for me an incredible source of optimism, optimism about the future of our country, optimism about the leadership of our country around the world on the most important technology that\u2019s going to power this century and beyond.\u00a0 And I really just want to say mostly thank you to President Daniels, who was with us earlier, to the governor, the senator, for \u2013 not just for today, but I have to say for your remarkable leadership across the board in making sure here at Purdue that the United States remains the great technology leader in the world.\nThis place is maybe one of the most inspiring human fabs that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0 And we know that some of the students that we met today are going to go on to do extraordinary things in the years ahead.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is this:\u00a0 Why am I here as Secretary of State?\u00a0 Simply because what we\u2019re doing at home, and particularly what is happening here, goes directly to our standing and leadership in the world.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve seen in American technological leadership in general and what we\u2019ve seen just in recent weeks with the passage of the CHIPS Act, that is resonating around the world.\u00a0 And I really want to applaud in particular Senator Young for his extraordinary leadership from the takeoff to the landing of the CHIPS Act.\u00a0 This is one of the most significant things that we\u2019ve done as a country, and just speaking as someone who has the responsibility of representing our country around the world, it is making a big difference around the world as well as here at home in the jobs of the future that we\u2019re going to be creating too.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Gina.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Thank you and good morning.\u00a0 Thank you all, Boilermakers, who welcomed us today.\u00a0 We had a fantastic tour this morning, and thank you to President Daniels, who welcomed us.\u00a0 Thank you to my colleagues \u2013 fantastic partner in Tony Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you to the governor, who has helped us get the CHIPS Act over the finish line.\u00a0 But big thank you to Senator Young.\u00a0 Truly without whom CHIPS would not have happened.\u00a0 He was an early sponsor and stuck with it all the way through.\u00a0 So thank you.\u00a0 It was a bipartisan effort, which I think is a critical thing to point out.\nAnd the CHIPS Act is a \u2013 it\u2019s an investment in America.\u00a0 It\u2019s actually the biggest investment in kind of industrial policy, research, and development that we\u2019ve seen in a generation in America.\u00a0 And it will unleash not only R&D, but the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of high\u2011paying jobs in the semiconductor industry all over America, including in the heartland, right here in Indiana.\u00a0 And Purdue, what\u2019s happening here, is at the heart \u2013 is at the heart and soul of that, the center of that.\u00a0 We talked today about going from lab to fab.\u00a0 It\u2019s about taking research and development that starts in research university and bringing it through to products that power American innovation.\nI also want to announce this morning that the Department of Commerce through NIST, the National Institute of Standards, which is in the Department of Commerce, is announcing a partnership with SkyWater right here in Indiana, a semiconductor company, and Google to provide free-of-cost, open source wafer designs to universities, so that we can do exactly the kind of research that\u2019s happening here in this facility.\u00a0 By providing these designs for free, open source, this is a public-private federal government collaboration that will help us to fuel this sort of wafer technology in research and development.\u00a0 So exactly what the CHIPS Act was meant to do, and exactly what you\u2019re doing so well here at Purdue.\u00a0 So thank you for having us.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 Thank you, Madam Secretary, and I think it\u2019s fair to say our longtime friendship has taken us to many places both past, present, and most importantly, maybe most excitingly into the future.\nAnd Secretary Blinken, it is truly a proud moment for all Hoosiers to welcome you to our state.\u00a0 President Daniels, thank you for rolling out the red carpet yet again.\u00a0 This is \u2014\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Not red.\n(Laughter.)\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0Roll out the golden carpet.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He makes a habit of correcting me.\u00a0 But let me just say what this highlights to me, and what the source of my pride is:\u00a0 just the collaboration and being able to harness the synergy of local (inaudible), state government, all of our institutions, all of our investments \u2013 building communities from rural to urban settings and then the federal partnership that has allowed us not just to compete in this new opportunity but also to take a \u2013 have a sense of responsibility about where we will end up five years, ten years, 20 years from today.\u00a0 Indiana won\u2019t look the same; indeed, the country won\u2019t look the same.\u00a0 We\u2019re not just catching up, we\u2019re leading the way.\u00a0 Purdue has proven that over the years with the technological advancements that they have discovered and created and shared with the world (inaudible).\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0\u00a0The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act is the sort of economic and national security win that really only comes together once every couple of generations.\u00a0 This is a bipartisan initiative.\u00a0 I\u2019m very excited to have played a leading role in authoring this and getting it through the process, but now it\u2019s time for implementation.\u00a0 I am so happy that we have our Secretary of State and Secretary of Commerce on the ground here on Hoosier soil to see how Hoosier workers and our universities and our state government and other stakeholders are poised to take advantage of the many provisions in this legislation to ensure that we outgrow, out-innovate, and out-compete the Chinese Communist Party to ensure that American values prevail.\nThe technologies that are funded from the research to design to the manufacturing incentive level that are \u2013 that\u2019s incorporated in this legislation are going to be technologies that define our 21st-century economy that we work and live but also they\u2019ll define the future of our national security.\u00a0 And to give rank and file Hoosiers a golden opportunity to participate in that meaningful work during a time when many people are wondering where they fit in economically because of the dynamism of this 21st-century economy is really exciting to me.\nAnd so having Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo here, who I partnered with very actively as we work together to get this legislation passed, is heartwarming.\u00a0 Of course, President Daniels, the leadership that you and so many others have shown here at Purdue University is also encouraging as Indiana looks to benefit maximally from this legislation.\u00a0 And my friend the governor with his continued leadership, there is no stopping Hoosiers as it relates to ensuring that the American taxpayer and rank and file Hoosiers get the maximum possible benefit from this effort.\u00a0 So thanks, all.\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 (Inaudible), sir.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0We all know how deeply honored we are to have these two great public servants \u2013 these four great public servants with us today.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to the brilliant world-class faculty and the students at Purdue University whose work has attracted them, and we hope to bring them back for kind of status updates in the future.\nLet me just say that as a public university, a land grant university, we feel profoundly our responsibility to turn out as many high-class new talents for this state and nation as we can, and we\u2019ve grown quickly in order to do that here.\nLastly, I\u2019ll just point out that one of our most, we think, profound responsibilities is to contribute to the economic vitality of the state and the nation through our research and through those young talents I mentioned.\u00a0 Here all around you, you can see our latest venture.\u00a0 This will be, I do truly believe, the center of semiconductor advance and production in the decades ahead.\nAnd finally, we also embrace, as not all universities frankly do, a duty to assist the national security in any way we can in areas like hypersonics, energetics, and now, what we believe is a \u2013very genuinely a national security imperative: to have self-sufficiency and leadership in semiconductors.\u00a0 We hope to play a role.\nSo today I think is emblematic of all those missions that Purdue accepts, and we\u2019ll deepen our resolve to do a good job at all of them.\u00a0 Thanks for coming.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 All right, we\u2019ll take a couple of questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with CBS4.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 For any of you:\u00a0 How are you hoping to ensure that Indiana and the United States as a whole has the skilled workforce it will need to fill these jobs?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0So I\u2019ll begin with that.\u00a0 Having a skilled workforce is critical.\u00a0 It\u2019s a rate-limiting factor to growth.\u00a0 So as we implement the CHIPS Act, there is a component for investing in apprenticeships and workforce development partnerships.\u00a0 Additionally, as we accept applications from partnerships who want \u2013 from companies who want the CHIPS Act funds, we are requiring them to show us that they will be making investments in workforce development partnerships.\u00a0 And we know from experience \u2013 the governor knows this and President Daniels \u2013 the best way to do workforce development is in partnership between the companies who hire people and colleges, community colleges, high schools that are training them so that when we are implementing the CHIPS Act, we are going to fund and prioritize exactly those kinds of training partnerships.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s go to AFP.\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0 The only other point \u2014\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Oh, please.\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0 \u2014 I\u2019d add to the Secretary\u2019s is that I want to make clear we are funding workforce training from the associate\u2019s level to the post-doctoral level through this legislation.\u00a0 So we\u2019re bringing opportunities for all Americans, all Hoosiers who want to meaningfully engage in this effort.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 Could I \u2013 it\u2019s too important to miss, because it\u2019s such a central part of realizing this CHIPS and Science Act.\u00a0 This is, fortunately, nothing new to us in Indiana, and I\u2019m sure other states as well.\u00a0 But we\u2019re making investments very early on \u2013 their first steps, you might say \u2013 K through 12.\u00a0 This is about GED to PhD, and making those investments along the way.\u00a0 And so those pipelines or those pathways that are in place, we seek to further accelerate our advancements and our investments so that we can in fact lead the way.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s go to (inaudible) with AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0 A question for Secretary Blinken, please.\u00a0 Sir, you were just in Mexico and you spoke about the semiconductors, and you\u2019re here now visiting this university.\u00a0 We understand the economic challenges, the technological challenges, but what about the geopolitical challenges?\u00a0 And of course, the elephant in the room is China, so could you speak to that, please?\u00a0 Is this really mostly about going after China after the U.S. lost its leadership in semiconductors?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Look, first and foremost, this is about investing in ourselves.\u00a0 And the fact is that when we invest in ourselves that has very positive and powerful effects on our standing in the world.\u00a0 Yes, we\u2019re in a competition with China, among other things, and our ability in that competition to offer the best choice, the best alternative is what ultimately is going to carry the day.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what these investments will do.\nSo we\u2019re seeing more and more countries looking, again, at the United States for our leadership in technology, the fact that, as we\u2019ve just demonstrated, we can bring our country together, we can bring academia, we can bring industry, we bring the federal government, we can bring state government together in order to advance this and create the strongest possible foundation for continuing and even expanding our technological leadership.\u00a0 That\u2019s incredibly attractive to other countries around the world who want to partner with us.\nAt the same time, I think we\u2019ve experienced \u2013 for example, through COVID \u2013 what disruptions to our supply chain can mean for virtually every single person in this country, not to mention around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all been talking this morning about how \u2013 what we were looking at today, as we look at \u2013 as we look at chips, as we look at semiconductors.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s your smartphone, whether it\u2019s your dishwasher, whether it\u2019s your automobile, that supply chain gets disrupted and your life is going to be disrupted.\nSo the fact that we\u2019re able to build our own resiliency, that we\u2019re able to do that ourselves, that we\u2019re able to do that with many likeminded countries, including Mexico in our region, but also beyond, that makes a big difference.\nAnd finally, one of the things that we\u2019re working on around the world in different parts of the world is, look, to the extent we\u2019re in a competition, we want to make it a race to the top \u2013 the highest possible standards for labor, for the environment, for intellectual property.\u00a0 And if we make it a race to the top, I\u2019m extremely confident we\u2019re going to do very well.\u00a0 And again, that is going to bring other countries along.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll go to Channel 13.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Governor Holcomb, where do you see Indiana in five years?\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0Even more of a leadership position, occupying that pole position, you might say, and not just looking to the coasts for these type of advancements.\u00a0 Again, this is a manufacturing powerhouse patch of property in the middle of the country.\u00a0 And Silicon Heartland is not a stretch to envision in 5,10,15 years.\u00a0 And to be able to play a part in turning a supply chain pain into a supply chain gain, this is an enormous source of pride as well.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Indiana has had issues with workforce recruitment and workforce retention.\u00a0 How do you plan on fixing that issue when it comes to keeping people in state?\nAnd then, Senator Young, you mentioned that it\u2019s time for implementation to happen with the CHIPS Act.\u00a0 When do you expect that to happen, and how is it going to affect Indiana?\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0Indiana plans to continue to do what we\u2019re doing in a very \u2013 with purpose and intent all along the way from, again, K through 12, through re-skilling, through recruiting.\u00a0 Look, we find ourselves in the state of Indiana at peak private sector employment, and that\u2019s because people are getting the skills they need to \u2013 and sometimes double or triple their salaries. The jobs are there, and these aren\u2019t just jobs that we\u2019re talking about today.\u00a0 These are truly careers, and might I say life-saving careers.\u00a0 And so for a state like Indiana, regionally developed, whether you\u2019re talking about orthopedics or RV production or our five auto OEMs, our ag bioscience, pharmaceuticals \u2013 semiconductors play a central role in all of that.\u00a0 And so this is just a natural extension of the very mature supply chain that we already offer not just Hoosiers for careers, but the world for advancement.\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0\u00a0So with respect to implementation, Indiana got to work before this legislation was signed into law.\u00a0 I mean, we have been preparing for years for this moment, setting the table for an opportunity to receive federal investment in these cutting-edge technology projects to ensure that Indiana\u2019s longstanding talent in making things is recognized when it comes time to make these next-generation technologies and ensuring we have the workforce development pipeline to support those private sector industry sectors.\nAnd so I commend our state leadership going back a number of years, our university partners, and all the way down to the local government level and, of course, our private sector leaders as well.\u00a0 They\u2019ve all been collaborating so that we can seize on a moment like this, and we\u2019re in the process of implementation.\nIn terms of brass tacks, that is going from my standpoint to mean continuing to work with the Department of Commerce, Department of State on ensuring that we\u2019re interpreting the law in a way that\u2019s consistent with legislative wishes but also doing whatever we can to remove obstacles so there are \u2013 if there are additional requests along the way, to ensure that the goals of this initiative are met and we\u2019ll certainly get the revenue to assist.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We have time for one more.\u00a0 We\u2019ll go to CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Governor Holcomb, you were recently in Taiwan to discuss cooperation on things like semiconductor production.\u00a0 Are you concerned that rising tensions between the U.S. and China could imperil that cooperation?\nAnd then Secretary Blinken, on the Armenia-Azerbaijan tensions, you spoke with both leaders overnight.\u00a0 How were those calls?\u00a0 And Russia has claimed they\u2019ve brokered some sort of ceasefire.\u00a0 Are you concerned about their role in trying to end these hostilities?\u00a0 Thank you.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 Well, what I heard in both Taiwan and South Korea was that they are ready to invest, and part of our objective as a state is to not just grow our own here and expand but also to attract \u2013 attract more foreign direct investment, and that\u2019s true with those two governments but also true around the world.\u00a0 So when you look at a state like Indiana that\u2019s poised for this exact kind of growth, we\u2019re in a catbirt seat, as you might say, to lead.\u00a0 They\u2019re ready to invest and we\u2019re ready to welcome them into our \u2013 or onto our fertile soil.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And as to Armenia and Azerbaijan, yes, I spoke to Prime Minister Pashinyan of Armenia and President Aliyev of Azerbaijan last night; pretty early in the morning for them.\u00a0 We\u2019d seen the outbreak of hostilities again, something that is in no one\u2019s interest.\u00a0 It\u2019s not in the interest of the people of Azerbaijan, it\u2019s not in the interest of the people of Armenia, it\u2019s certainly not in the interest of the larger region.\u00a0 And I spoke to both, urged them to do everything possible to pull back from the conflict and to get back to talking about building a lasting peace between their countries.\nWe have our special envoy in the region right now working with both countries.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be in close touch with them going forward, and my hope is that we can move this from conflict back to the negotiating table and back to trying to build a peace.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Any concerns about Russia\u2019s involvement?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, always, always concerned, because whether Russia tries in some fashion to stir the pot, to create a distraction from Ukraine, is something that we\u2019re always concerned about.\u00a0 But if Russia can actually use its own influence for good, which is to, again, calm the waters, end the violence, and urge people to engage in good faith on building peace, that would be a positive thing.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-secretary-of-commerce-gina-raimondo-mexican-secretary-of-economy-tatiana-clouthier-and-mexican-secretary-of-foreign-affairs-marcelo-ebrard-at-a-joint-pre/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State Antony J.

HLED.\u00a0 We were so happy last year; we went to Washington, and being there we made the commitment of moving forward on very concrete activities for us to have concrete actions and accomplishments.\u00a0 I remember \u2013 and this is something that I tell Gina about in a meeting we had in her office \u2013 and we said we have to really do things that will be moving forward very fast.\nWell, today the second meeting time becomes an increasingly important factor because we have to show results.\u00a0 We have to have deliverables, and we have to move faster because the moment it is of our country, the moment of our region, and this is also the moment of our relationship.\u00a0 And we believe this moment is going through a fundamental moment right now, and we have the possibility of making trade and commerce grow in our two countries.\u00a0 And to a certain degree right now as well, we have a situation that becomes even more important \u2013 first, to continue working on semiconductors, for instance, cyber security and everything that has to do with information and communication technologies, ICTs.\nWe\u2019ve set this on the table to continue moving forward on border infrastructure, where both nations and our activities are going to be important for us to continue developing our borders and for us to continue closing the gaps in terms of our trade activities, our commerce activities.\u00a0 One of the important items we mention is the importance of developing our labor force and many issues.\u00a0 The two main ones, however, that have to do with the technical work for semiconductors and ICT technologies and cyber security, that\u2019s of the utmost importance; and also for us to do follow-up on the different agreements, and the commitment is here now.\u00a0 We have established this commitment for our meetings to have weekly meetings now for us to continue having very important results.\nAnother important item we are going to be working on \u2013 and this is something that our friends are going to be talking about and Secretary Ebrard will be mentioning this \u2013 this has to do with work in south, southeastern part of Mexico and Central America, and the importance of our continuing and moving forward in this relationship.\u00a0 All we have to do now is we want to thank and we want to congratulate and we want to really thank Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Blinken for the efforts made to be here with us, especially the commitment for this relationship between our two nations to continue growing, and especially for all of us to have trade and commerce and the supply chain increasingly stronger, resilient, and strengthened, where competitiveness of North America will continue being right at the core of the work we do in this U.S.-Mexico bilateral economic dialogue.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 Thank you so much, Mrs. Clouthier.\u00a0 Now Secretary Blinken, yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much, and good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Secretary Clouthier, thank you so much for your hospitality today and the work that we\u2019re doing every single day that you\u2019ve laid out, and to my friend Foreign Secretary Ebrard, Marcelo, to our colleagues, and especially to President L\u00f3pez Obrador for the very good time that we spent with him today.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for the time that he gave us.\nI think today\u2019s meeting reflects the very strong partnership between our countries that has developed from day one of the Biden administration, and you see that across the administration.\u00a0 I\u2019m joined today by my friend and colleague the Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\u00a0 We have the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jayme White.\u00a0 We have other leaders across the U.S. Government.\u00a0 You can see the breadth of Mexico-U.S. cooperation by the sheer size of our delegation today, which also includes representatives from U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. Customs and Border Protection \u2013 so many colleagues who are not only here today but are quite literally doing this every day \u2013 building, strengthening our cooperation.\nAs many of you know, this December Mexico and the United States will celebrate the 200th anniversary of our bilateral relations.\u00a0 Over that time, our countries have been bound by deepening familial, cultural, diplomatic, and the subject of today\u2019s discussion, economic ties.\u00a0 Mexico is the United States\u2019 second largest trading partner.\u00a0 The United States is Mexico\u2019s largest trading partner.\u00a0 Together we have among the world\u2019s most skilled and integrated workforces, advanced industrial centers, a wealth of innovation hubs.\u00a0 When we put our strengths together, each of us becomes more competitive, our region becomes more prosperous.\u00a0 And what that means in concrete terms for our people is more jobs, better jobs, better schools for our communities, more opportunities for small businesses.\u00a0 And I could go down the list.\nThis partnership has grown stronger over the last couple of years.\u00a0 The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement remains our best tool for promoting North American economic competitiveness and actually delivering results for our workers.\u00a0 The High-Level Security Dialogue that we will be picking up again in October is helping us tackle shared challenges like narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, as well as violence and insecurity.\nAnd the High-Level Economic Dialogue that we held today, relaunched by our presidents, is making our economies more resilient and ensuring that we can actually take advantage of some of the opportunities that are out there, not just dealing with the challenges but the real opportunities that we have.\u00a0 That was the primary topic of discussion when Secretary Raimondo and I met with President L\u00f3pez Obrador today with our colleagues.\nI shared and thanked President L\u00f3pez Obrador for the commitments Mexico made at the Summit of the Americas, including adopting the Los Angeles Declaration, which reflects a new regional approach to migration.\u00a0 We discussed shared efforts to address irregular migration in the Americas, including through humane border management policies and through expanding legal pathways and protections as together we address the root causes of migration \u2013 something that Mexico and the United States are collaborating on in ways that we\u2019ve not seen before.\u00a0 For example, our development agencies are working hand in hand in Central America, Northern Central America, to do just that.\nYou just heard from Secretary Clouthier about some of the progress that we made today \u2013 the initiatives we\u2019re driving to boost competitiveness, to create good-paying jobs, to accelerate North America\u2019s transition to clean energy.\u00a0 One of those initiatives that I think is important to underscore \u2013 and I\u2019ll also leave it to Secretary Raimondo to talk more about this \u2013 is the CHIPS and Science Act, which will provide funds to develop resilient semiconductor supply chains in North America.\u00a0 Major elements of the semiconductor supply chains are already well-established in Mexico with U.S.-based companies like Intel and Skyworks conducting research and development, design, assembly, and test manufacturing in parts of Mexico.\nThe CHIPS Act will incentivize more of this type of work.\u00a0 It will ensure that we can build these and other components that we need for the 21st century right here in North America.\u00a0 Tomorrow, Secretary Raimondo and I will travel to Indiana to visit a semiconductor factory and see the work already well underway to build the future in North America.\nAnother initiative comes through the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides among other things tax incentives for electric vehicles and battery components manufactured in North America.\u00a0 It\u2019s a smart investment in a shared future \u2013 a way to create more jobs for our people, combat the global climate crisis, strengthen our energy security.\u00a0 And this is something we discussed with President L\u00f3pez Obrador today.\nLike all partners, especially those with relationships as wide-ranging as ours, there are areas where we differ.\u00a0 We\u2019re secure enough in our relationship to acknowledge those differences and also to work through them in very practical ways so we can serve the best interests of our people.\nThe discussion that we had today was shaped immeasurably by the engagements that we\u2019ve had over the past year, not just between our governments but also with labor leaders, the private sector, civil society.\u00a0 Each step of the way, they\u2019ve made us better by sharing their experiences on the ground, pushing us to do more and to do better for underserved populations, partnering together to implement sustainable solutions.\u00a0 Ultimately, that\u2019s how we\u2019ll build inclusive, broad-based economic growth that delivers for all of our people.\nSo I just simply want to say thanks once again to our Mexican friends, partners, neighbors, for the incredibly warm hospitality we\u2019ve had today, but especially for the terrific partnership.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking good to making \u2013 looking forward to making good on the commitments that we\u2019ve made today, which I believe, we believe, will produce benefits for many, many years to come.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Now we give the floor to Secretary Marcelo Ebrard.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you so much.\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone, ladies and gentlemen.\u00a0 I greet once more Secretary Raimondo and welcome Gina Raimondo, welcome to Mexico.\u00a0 And my friend Antony Blinken, and who has saved the necessary time to go across the world to be here in Mexico, we highly appreciate it.\u00a0 Those of us in this type of positions know what this means.\u00a0 He has been sleeping on the plane for about three days now, and so we highly value your presence and \u2013 both of your presence here.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nWell, this has been a very successful meeting, and not only because of the cordiality but also because we share very transcendental objectives and there\u2019s a working plan, an action plan to do everything we have set out to accomplish at the standards of this type of dialogue and international meetings.\u00a0 We are facing an evident success.\nMexico is taking the U.S. up on its offerings.\u00a0 This is really something through which we have received the invitation of participating as partners, as allies that we are, in different initiatives implemented by President Biden\u2019s administration.\u00a0 They have to do with semiconductors.\u00a0 They have approved a very important package on this, and Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Blinken have invited us to participate in a more intensive fashion possible, and this is a big door opening for Mexico, for the Mexican economy years to come, starting with this year.\u00a0 Electromobilty, for instance, computers, laptops, and telecommunications.\u00a0 And in other words, we do have an invitation and we are receiving it maybe once in a lifetime.\u00a0 This is the type of invitation, just once in a lifetime, so thank you.\u00a0 We are taking you up on your word, and we\u2019re accepting your invitation.\u00a0 This is what President L\u00f3pez Obrador told you personally, and that\u2019s why he wanted to be present.\u00a0 He invited the delegation from the United States to the national palace.\u00a0 This is a historic opportunity for Mexico, and we are going to continue participating with great enthusiasm and gratitude to President Biden\u2019s administration and the U.S.\nWell, this means more jobs for Mexico, more integration in the future and right now as well.\u00a0 And we perhaps think Mexico could grow twice as much with what was proposed to Mexico today.\u00a0 And this means we can reduce poverty even faster in our country, and that infrastructure in Mexico can grow faster.\u00a0 And this is really where this dimension of this partnership between our two countries acquires its true impact, its true face.\nAnd we spoke about many issues.\u00a0 As Secretary Blinken has already mentioned, migration \u2013 we\u2019re working together on migration security.\u00a0 We\u2019re holding a meeting in October because there\u2019s a bicentennial understanding uniting both our countries, a single action plan, a single strategy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been invited to go to Washington; we are going to go to D.C.\u00a0 And I think what we\u2019re building through those different initiatives, President Biden and President Obrador\u2019s initiatives, is that we have certainty about the future.\u00a0 And this is something we share \u2013 security, certainty, predictability, and everything.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be working a world that has no certainty.\u00a0 This is a very big value for Mexico, a very valuable principle for Mexico to have shared certainty.\nWe have the security dialogue in October and also the summit of North American leaders in December.\u00a0 There, we are going to be reflecting everything I\u2019m telling you here today.\u00a0 So we want to thank President Biden for his interest for Mexico and the U.S. to be very close to each other, especially Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Antony Blinken.\u00a0 I know he has done everything for this to become a reality.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Secretary Ebrard.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s give the floor to Secretary Gina Raimondo to take the floor.\u00a0 Madam.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 I also want to join Secretary Blinken in thanking our Mexican colleagues for such warm hospitality and for such a productive day of meetings.\u00a0 So thank you, Secretary Clouthier and Ebrard.\u00a0 And a special thank you to President L\u00f3pez Obrador for meeting with Secretary Blinken and I.\u00a0 We met for more than two hours.\u00a0 The president was extremely generous with his time, and we\u2019d like to thank him.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to thank Secretary Blinken, my partner in this work and a dear friend and colleague.\nAs has been said, the United States and Mexico, we know, have one of the world\u2019s largest trading relationships, which is growing and surpassing its pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0 The best is yet to come.\u00a0 The relationship of course is not limited to trade and economics.\u00a0 It includes strong historical, familial, and cultural ties.\u00a0 And as Tony said, as our countries prepare to celebrate 200 years of bilateral relations, we will continue to build back together as neighbors and as longstanding partners.\nJust a year ago, our two governments restarted the High-Level Economic Dialogue to re-engage in positive economic and commercial dialogue and advance our shared prosperities.\u00a0 Our first meeting was in Washington, D.C. about a year ago, and here we are today, thrilled to be here in Mexico.\u00a0 The goal of this High-Level Economic Dialogue is to make it easier for our countries to trade, invest, and innovate.\u00a0 And when you trade, invest, and innovate, you create prosperity and you create jobs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this is about: shared prosperity and job creation for the people of Mexico and the people of the United States.\u00a0 And as we discussed today with President L\u00f3pez Obrador, that means opportunity for everyone at every level.\nI\u2019m thrilled with the progress we made today on issues ranging from climate change to semiconductors to supply chains.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re bolstering our supply chains and our energy security while creating jobs on both sides of the border.\u00a0 Huge thanks to President Biden\u2019s leadership.\u00a0 Because of that leadership, the United States is making massive new investments in both our domestic semiconductor industry and clean energy.\nBut the benefits of those investments in the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act will not be limited to the United States.\u00a0 These investments are going to create jobs and opportunities for Mexican workers and businesses, small businesses in Mexico as well as large businesses.\u00a0 And of course, I\u2019m especially pleased that the CHIPS and Science Act includes funding that will help us work with partner countries to strengthen our semiconductor supply chains.\nSo over the weeks and months ahead, we\u2019re going to continue our engagement with the private sector, with labor, education, and civil society, all of whom are essential to our success.\u00a0 And today, we agreed in our meetings to have a strong commitment to a transparent process and a lot of stakeholder engagement.\u00a0 We also reaffirmed our commitment to have continuous weekly dialogue as among our teams and a commitment to meet annually in person at the cabinet level so that we can build on the progress we\u2019ve made.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re building a secure and prosperous North America that stands ready to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 To continue with the press conference, the Q&A session, yes, let\u2019s begin with Ivette Salda\u00f1a,\u00a0El Universal\u00a0newspaper.\u00a0 Please, Ivette.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Hello.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 My question is for \u2013 I\u2019m right here, and it\u2019s for Secretary Antonio Blinken.\u00a0 Do you think the energy environmental policy in Mexico, does it go against the impetus or promotion of clean energies?\u00a0 Do you think it does that, and also protection of the environment?\nThis is for Secretary Clouthier.\u00a0 My question is: what are the topics of concern, the issues of concern for the United States?\u00a0 Did you include in your discussions today the solar panel situation?\u00a0 There\u2019s an agreement between Mexico and Canada, but there\u2019s no agreement between Mexico and the United States.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Two things.\u00a0 It\u2019s evident from the conversations that we had today, as well as the work that we\u2019ve been doing over many months, that we see \u2013 the United States and Mexico see \u2013 a shared opportunity to build an energy future that advances our climate goals, that advances sustainable growth, and that creates new opportunities.\u00a0 And one of the things that we focused on in our conversation today with President Lopez Obrador is something that has been, I think, a driving vision for him, and that is the integration of our economies and the integration of North America.\u00a0 And one of the ways that we\u2019re doing that is through clean energy.\nWe have the potential, as you heard Secretary Raimondo discuss, including through some of the facilities made available and new legislation in the United States, to be leaders in, for example, producing electric vehicles together.\u00a0 Our countries have a shared commitment, for example, to see that by the year 2030, 50 percent of vehicle sales are electric vehicles.\u00a0 But we should be making them together, and we now have further incentives to do just that.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be strengthening our supply chains more broadly, but a lot of the focus will be on producing clean energy, but also in doing that, producing good jobs, and in fact, in many cases better-paying jobs that will really be the jobs of the future.\nSo this was very much a part of the conversation that we had with the president today, and I believe very much part of Mexico\u2019s vision as he described it to us.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to put words in his mouth, but that was certainly what I heard, and I would invite my friend the secretary to elaborate on that if you\u2019d like.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Well, the truth is that we didn\u2019t talk about concerns or preoccupations; we spoke about occupations.\u00a0 And this is what we are occupying our time in, part of the things we discussed today and things we\u2019ve been working on.\u00a0 I said this from the beginning.\u00a0 In the morning, for instance, we were working with the private sector, with the academy, and with the governments to create a road map for us to solve problems.\u00a0 This means occupying our time in this.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a year now working on semiconductors and the supply chain for semiconductors how to integrate the supply chain, how to continue working in the development of our labor force capable of facing new challenges on semiconductors.\nSo Gina invited us to expand this margin, for us to go get more things, and to develop \u2013 and to develop our labor force in cyber security, for instance.\u00a0 And right now, well, we\u2019re working on this next week.\u00a0 We are going to \u2013 M\u00f3nica Duhem is going to Palo Alto to work on semiconductors with an academy that can be strengthening development of our labor force in Mexico.\u00a0 Monica has been working with area of Deputy Secretary de la Mora and the supply chain for semiconductors.\nAnd just to go into what Secretary Blinken was just saying, well, the president said something that is very interesting.\u00a0 This is something I think you had already heard in the president\u2019s morning press conference: the Sonora plant.\u00a0 This is a very important development for Sonora to become a space of clean energy, a space where we are going to be working with the entire supply chain, from the extraction of lithium with the value chain to reach electromobility and zero-emission vehicles.\nSo we\u2019re not worried, we\u2019re not preoccupied; we\u2019re occupied.\u00a0 And we shall continue being occupied in those issues.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s give the floor to Ana Swanson,\u00a0New York Times.\u00a0 Please, go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, on the energy dispute between the United States and Mexico, I understand there is a formal dispute settlement process under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but were there efforts made outside of that today to resolve the issue?\nSecretary Raimondo, on the energy issue, did you share any concerns with Mexico that U.S. businesses have about government interference or fair treatment when operating here?\u00a0 And Secretary Ebrard and Secretary Clouthier, I\u2019d welcome your response on the energy issue.\u00a0 I\u2019m also curious: did your discussion today touch on Mexican security issues and any disruptions that it\u2019s caused to trade or border security?\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Dispute settlement under international agreements is a normal part of trade relationships, even among the closest of partners.\u00a0 And the USMCA has this mechanism.\u00a0 Mexico has used it.\u00a0 We\u2019re using it.\u00a0 And if there\u2019s a difference, it\u2019s a very good way to resolve it and to do it in a way that actually inspires confidence in investors in predictability and stability in the application of the agreement and the broader relationship.\nSo that \u2013 that is going forward.\u00a0 But I think what\u2019s very important, and it\u2019s something that Secretary Clouthier said as well, is that even as we might have an issue or we\u2019re we\u2019re trying to resolve a difference, we are moving full speed ahead in the further integration of our economies and in building the most competitive region in the world, and we\u2019re doing that, as you\u2019ve heard, through the work on supply chains strengthening, the work that we\u2019re doing together in building a clean energy economy, the work on semiconductors, et cetera.\u00a0 So I think the most important thing to say is we\u2019re making very demonstrable and clear progress in a whole host of areas, many of which were covered by the economic dialogue today.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I truly love the way Secretary Blinken is saying this, because he says USMCA has dispute settle mechanisms.\u00a0 We have to use them in case there are any differences or a dispute.\u00a0 Nonetheless, part of what we said this afternoon \u2013 I think that was very important and it\u2019s not in vain \u2013 I mean that the High-Level Economic Dialogue starts with the word \u201cdialogue,\u201d and this is part of the things we discussed with President L\u00f3pez Obrador in terms of energy, to solve things through this \u2013 disputes through this dispute settle mechanism.\u00a0 And the USMCA has that, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing right now.\u00a0 There\u2019s interest on both parts to walk together to find solutions, and this is what I wanted to say.\nI give the floor to Foreign Minister Ebrard.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, I coincide with Secretary Blinken and Secretary Clouthier.\u00a0 The consultations are part of an already established process with foreseeability or predictability.\u00a0 It allows us to have this mechanism to settle disputes, and this is the way it was foreseen in USMCA.\u00a0 And today that wasn\u2019t the objective of the meeting.\u00a0 We are in the process of a dialogue, and we hope we\u2019ll reach an agreement in terms of that dialogue.\u00a0 I cannot reveal anything else because it\u2019s confidential information.\nAnd now, in terms of security, I wanted to say briefly that there\u2019s an action plan for the first time.\u00a0 This is a joint Mexico-U.S. \u2013 for the first time in the meeting we\u2019re going to be holding in October to exchange results we have \u2013 where are we at?\u00a0 What else can we do?\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working so much with a common action plan, and this is very important because Secretary Blinken is co-author of that understanding, which is translated into actions and a common plan.\u00a0 And yes, we are very optimistic and we see it very positively.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 To answer your question on \u2013 as has been said, we didn\u2019t talk extensively about it, but I would only add that what businesses are seeking is predictability, fairness, and transparency.\u00a0 And I think that that is true of every business everywhere in the world.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Now let\u2019s give the floor to Ernesto Gloria, Enfoque Noticias.\u00a0 One question, please.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, good afternoon.\u00a0 My question is for Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 In the conversations you\u2019ve had with Mexican officials, do you have a date for the arrival of investments you\u2019ve announced \u2013 the $50 billion, for instance?\u00a0 Did you talk about the beneficiary states that are going to be getting those investments?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So we have already started the process of engaging with stakeholders in the United States, and we expect that the first money will be invested in the first half of next year.\u00a0 But I can tell you that the fact that Congress passed the legislation has already unlocked billions of dollars of capital from businesses.\u00a0 So today, for example, as we\u2019re here, a company called Micron made a multibillion-dollar investment of a new manufacturing facility in Idaho.\u00a0 That\u2019s one example.\u00a0 Intel has already made a big investment.\u00a0 So the fact that these companies have the certainty that the CHIPS Act passed has already unlocked a great deal of capital.\nThe opportunity I think for Mexico is not just in the manufacturing facilities but in testing, packaging, and assembly.\u00a0 Now in China and Taiwan, there\u2019s about 60 \u2013 the testing, packaging, and assembly industry for semiconductors is a $60 billion industry.\u00a0 In North America it\u2019s $3 billion.\u00a0 So there is a huge opportunity for growth in North America and job creation just in the semiconductor supply chain.\u00a0 And as we discussed today, that doesn\u2019t even include the jobs for printed circuit boards, printers, computers.\u00a0 So we\u2019re really very excited about the opportunities for job creation in Mexico and in the United States on account of the CHIPS Act.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you.\u00a0 The last question for Iain Marlow, Bloomberg.\u00a0 Yes, one question, please, from Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, just moving to global events now, we\u2019ve seen some stunning developments on the battlefields in Ukraine with Ukrainian forces making unprecedented gains in recent days.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if you could give your perspective on what the last few days mean for the overall direction of the war, the role the U.S. and allies have played in the leadup to the counteroffensive, and what it might mean for broader efforts to eventually end the conflict.\nAnd just one other question on the JCPOA:\u00a0 There appears to be growing pessimism not just in Israel but also now in Europe about the prospect of a deal, particularly in the near term, with some suggesting any negotiated settlement may have to wait until after the U.S. midterm elections.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering if we could get your own assessment of the current timeline on those negotiations and your own view on any eventual settlement.\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (Inaudible) very much.\u00a0 Let me take the last part first on the JCPOA.\u00a0 What we\u2019ve seen over the last week or so in Iran\u2019s response to the proposal put forward by the European Union is clearly a step backward and makes prospects for an agreement in the near term, I would say, unlikely, and you\u2019ve heard the European Union and in particular you\u2019ve heard the so-called E3 \u2013 Germany, France, and the UK \u2013 pronounce themselves on the latest developments.\u00a0 I can\u2019t give you a timeline except to say, again, that Iran seems either unwilling or unable to do what is necessary to reach an agreement and they continue to try to introduce extraneous issues to the negotiation that make an agreement less likely.\u00a0 But certainly what we\u2019ve seen in the last week is a step backward away from the likelihood of any kind of near-term agreement.\nIn terms of Ukraine and the situation there, a few things.\u00a0 As you know, I was there last week and had an opportunity to spend time with President Zelenskyy and members of his administration, to hear in detail about the work that they were doing on the counteroffensive that was recently initiated in southern Ukraine but also, as we\u2019ve seen, in the northeast in and around Kharkiv.\u00a0 And what they have done has been very methodically planned out and, of course, it\u2019s benefited from significant support from the United States and many other countries in terms of making sure that Ukraine has in its hands the equipment it needs to prosecute this counteroffensive, which has one clear purpose, to take back the land that has \u2013 that was seized by Russia\u2019s aggression.\nAnd this is early days still, so I think it would be wrong to predict exactly where this will go, when it will get there, and how it will get there.\u00a0 But clearly we\u2019ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the northeast, and that is a product, as I said, of the support we provided, but first and foremost, it\u2019s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 That\u2019s the biggest difference maker.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve had the occasion to say, fundamentally, Ukraine is fighting for its homeland, for its future.\u00a0 The Russians who are there are not.\u00a0 Ukraine is not theirs.\u00a0 Ukraine does not belong to Russia.\u00a0 It belongs to the Ukrainian people, and that\u2019s the single biggest difference maker, as I said, that I think we\u2019re seeing play out now.\nHaving said all of that, it is too early to tell exactly where this is going.\u00a0 The Russians maintain very significant forces in Ukraine, as well as equipment and arms and munitions.\u00a0 They continue to use it indiscriminately against not just the Ukrainian armed forces but civilians and civilian infrastructure, as we\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 The brutalization of the country continues by the Russian aggressor, and there is, I think, unfortunately the prospect that this continues to go on.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s encouraging to see the progress that Ukraine has made, and what I said to President Zelenskyy on behalf of the United States \u2013 and what many other countries have continued to reaffirm \u2013 is we will continue to do what is necessary to support Ukraine, to maintain pressure on Russia so that it ends it aggression, and of course, as necessary, to shore up our own defenses.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is this.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that this aggression by Russia, an attempt to erase Ukraine\u2019s existence as an independent, sovereign state, has also created tremendous challenges in virtually every corner of the world, not only in Ukraine but \u2013 and not only in Europe but all around the world, including in our own hemisphere.\u00a0 We see it in higher food prices, higher energy prices; we also see it in the assault that Russia\u2019s engaged in on the very principles of the international system that are necessary for keeping peace and security that should be of interest to every country \u2013 the notion that sovereignty matters, territorial integrity matters, independence matters.\u00a0 And I think what you\u2019re seeing from countries around the world is a strong desire that this aggression cease and that the second and third-order consequences are as a result diminished.\u00a0 That\u2019s very important too.\nSo bottom line is this:\u00a0 Russia committed this aggression.\u00a0 I think, given the price that it\u2019s paying, it can and should stop it.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via

interpreter) So good afternoon.\u00a0 What a pleasure to be here once more after this very good meeting with the president of Mexico and with Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 Ambassador Salazar and all our friends from Mexico, welcome, everyone \u2013 want to welcome you once more to this Ministry of the Economy of Mexico.\u00a0 First of all, we want to thank you for understanding because we did change the venue.\u00a0 This is the first anniversary of this first edition of the High-Level Economic Dialogue, which signifies promoting cooperation in our relationship.\u00a0 As we said this morning, Dr. De la Mora had an extraordinary meeting with stakeholders, with the academy, with the business community, and governments.\u00a0 She said that in such a broad relationship as the one we have between Mexico and the United States, well, there are all sorts of situations that arise, but we also have the very big commitment to address controversies and differences and to look for new ways to cooperate with each other.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re moving forward.\nAnd within one of these mechanisms is the High-Level Economic Dialogue, which is very good for us institutions to be able to find mechanisms of collaboration and how to continue moving forward.\u00a0 In this case, we\u2019ve set conditions to have a great region of competitiveness, and this is part of what Secretary Raimondo was telling us a few minutes ago with President L\u00f3pez Obrador.\nWe\u2019re convinced that today we\u2019re going to be holding a very productive discussion that will allow us to share vision of each one of the participants on the HLED for the second year, and we can thus agree a better path for us to continue moving forward and collaborating between our two countries.\nOnce more, thank you so much.\u00a0 I want to thank all of you for your presence.\u00a0 Let me now give the floor to our foreign minister of Mexico, Marcel Ebrard.\u00a0 You have the floor, Marcelo.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Tatiana.\u00a0 Very well, I cordially welcome all of you.\u00a0 Secretary of the Department of State Mr. Antony Blinken, Secretary Raimondo, thank you so much.\u00a0 I am delighted to have you in Mexico.\u00a0 Welcome, everyone.\nI simply wanted to say this is a meeting, a strategic vision.\u00a0 It\u2019s a common vision between Mexico and the U.S. to build a strong region, a prosperous region as well, and that will maintain its political weight in the world \u2013 North America, and we\u2019re just so happy to have all of you here where we\u2019re going to be discussing today has to do with progress we\u2019ve made.\u00a0 This is a very positive meeting and also invitations that we have to expand integration between Mexico and the United States on common issues as for instance clean energies, electronic vehicles,\u00a0 semiconductors, technology, and also this electromobility, which is an enormous topic, and this is the agenda.\nSo I do think this is a wonderful occasion and I really celebrate the fact we\u2019re discussing this.\u00a0 This has to do with a common vision for the future.\u00a0 Welcome, everyone, your respective delegations \u2013 your delegation from the U.S. and the Mexican friends that are here with us.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0 Yes, Secretary Blinken, you have the floor, sir.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary Clouthier.\u00a0 Thank you for your hospitality here as well.\u00a0 Marcelo, Secretary Ram\u00edrez de la O, thank you so much for hosting us here today in Mexico City.\u00a0 It\u2019s just great to be back with all of you.\nLast year, our two presidents agreed to relaunch the High-Level Economic Dialogue.\u00a0 They recognized together that a strong Mexico-U.S. relationship was vital for ensuring that our countries could actually take advantage of the opportunities of this century for our people.\u00a0 And since then we\u2019ve been working together on an incredibly wide range of issues, new areas, and deepened our cooperation in places where we had already been working together.\nTo name just a few very quickly, Mexico and the United States, our auto industry leaders are sharing information and best practices to speed up the transition to electric vehicles, which along with other clean energy technologies are critical to creating new jobs and addressing the global climate crisis.\u00a0 Our development agencies, AMEXCID and USAID, are working together to provide skills and training to young people in Central America so that they can find more opportunity at home and not feel compelled to leave their countries.\u00a0 Our governments are finding new ways to strengthen cyber security, which is increasingly central to the lives and livelihoods of our citizens, from the resilience of our supply chains to the success of small and medium enterprises increasingly reliant on a digital economy.\nAnd I think we\u2019re seeing results.\u00a0 Total trade between our countries recent surpassed even pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0 Mexico is our second-largest trading partner with trade between our countries exceeding $7 billion, supporting over a million jobs.\u00a0 And all of this is not just about abstract numbers: good-paying jobs, quality benefits, better schools, stronger small businesses, brighter futures for our people when we do it right.\u00a0 We have our differences, as any countries with relationships and deep and wide as ours are, but we work through them in a pragmatic way \u2013 and I\u2019m pleased about that as well \u2013 based on mutual respect.\nI will let Secretary Raimondo address this.\u00a0 But as we\u2019ve discussed today, we have some remarkable new opportunities before us in part because of some progress we\u2019ve been able to make in the United States with the CHIPS Act and then with the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act.\u00a0 These create, I think, new perspectives to go even further in some of the work that we\u2019ve already started to do, but I\u2019ll leave it to Secretary Raimondo to discuss that.\nBut the issues that we\u2019ll talk about today \u2013 expanding inclusive opportunities and jobs in North America, accelerating North America\u2019s clean energy transition, modernizing our border infrastructure, promoting an open and secure internet, among others \u2013 aren\u2019t simply issues that matter to our governments; profoundly, they matter to our people.\nTogether we can make North America the most competitive, dynamic region in the world.\u00a0 Both of our presidents share that vision, and it\u2019s our responsibility to actually try and make good on it.\u00a0 Delighted to be here and working with all of our colleagues.\u00a0 Thank you.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you so much.\u00a0 Now with the Secretary of Commerce of the United States.\u00a0 You have the floor, Gina, please.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon and thank you \u2013 thank you to our hosts, our Mexican partners.\u00a0 We\u2019re having a fantastic day.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you in person in a very productive session.\nAs Tony said, a year ago our governments agreed to restart this High-Level Economic Dialogue to re-engage in positive economic and commercial dialogue to advance our shared priorities, to increase trade, to increase cross-border investment; but fundamentally, what it is all about is creating opportunity for the workers of our countries, as we just spoke with your president.\u00a0 And we are moving forward on our shared priorities of supply chains, information and communication technology, cyber security, and workforce development.\nWe\u2019ve already made progress, of which I am very proud.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already identified the areas of the supply chain that are the most ripe for collaboration.\u00a0 We\u2019ve shared best practices to strengthen cyber security.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve implemented an Academy of Women Entrepreneurs program supporting 800 women across 13 Mexican states.\u00a0 So this isn\u2019t just talking.\u00a0 This is doing.\nBut obviously, there is so much more to do.\u00a0 And as Secretary Blinken just said, in the past month the United States Congress passed two pieces of game-changing legislation.\u00a0 One, which we\u2019ll talk about later, is the semiconductor act, the CHIPS Act, which will make a $50 billion investment in the semiconductor supply chain in the United States, and we have already heard from all of the semiconductor companies that as they build new manufacturing facilities in America, they would like to see the rest of their supply chain in North America.\u00a0 And so we want to explore with you how do we align our policies as between America and Mexico to maximize that entire supply chain and the jobs that go with it in North America, in Mexico specifically.\nThe other piece of legislation is the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the single largest investment that the United States of America has ever made in fighting climate change:\u00a0 $400 billion of incentives to move us towards green technology and electric vehicles, and very importantly, incentives for vehicles assembled in North America.\u00a0 So I can speak for President Biden and for Secretary Blinken and our teams:\u00a0 We are just bursting with enthusiasm and ready to get to work.\nThe one word of caution I have is we do need to move quickly.\u00a0 Companies are moving quickly.\u00a0 Congress has passed this legislation.\u00a0 The Commerce Department is already at work figuring out how to invest the $50 billion in semiconductors.\u00a0 We have a moment in time now, and so together we\u2019ll get to work and seize this opportunity.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you so much, Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 We\u2019re so happy to have our Finance Minister of Mexico Rogelio Ram\u00edrez de la O.\u00a0 Doctor, you have the floor.\nFINANCE SECRETARY RAM\u00cdREZ DE LA O:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you.\u00a0 Good morning \u2013 good afternoon, rather.\u00a0 What a pleasure to be here with you.\u00a0 I want to greet the U.S. delegation today, especially DOS Secretary Mr. Blinken and Secretary of Commerce Mrs. Raimondo and Jayme White, who is the deputy secretary for economic growth, energy, and the environment; distinguished ambassador, our friend, Ken Salazar, welcome \u2013 yes, ambassador of the United States to Mexico.\u00a0 I want to also thank you for being here.\u00a0 What a pleasure to have all of you here in Mexico.\u00a0 And I would also like to greet with great affection the Mexican delegation, Secretary Tatiana Clouthier and \u2013 secretary of economy \u2013 Foreign Minister Mr. Marcelo Ebrard, and Esteban Moctezuma, ambassador of Mexico to the United States.\nI also want to thank \u2013 after a year of reactivation of this dialogue, I want to thank for the commitment shown through this mechanism of collaboration, which reveals not only the strategic vision of our cooperation at the economic level but also the capacity that our two administrations have to go over and beyond the traditional concerns at the bilateral level.\u00a0 And I want to congratulate and commend both delegations for this great progress being made and the work we\u2019re all doing.\nAnd today in this annual meeting we\u2019re going to be discussing results we\u2019ve been able to reach in this first year of work in each one of the four pillars, and I am certain that this will allow us to reflect on our priorities for the future and the importance for those accomplishments to generate a positive impact on bilateral trade, but especially the well-being of our citizens.\u00a0 And as already said by Secretary Raimondo, well, especially for workers, yes.\u00a0 And we shall also look into new actions that will be complementing those that we\u2019ve already implemented in key areas for both administrations, as for instance supply chains, climate change, and integration of our labor markets.\nI conclude reasserting the commitment of the Mexican administration so that through the Ministry of Finances, we can work as a team with the purpose of having greater regional cooperation and integration between both countries to increase the well-being of our peoples.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you so much, Secretary.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s give the floor to \u2013 yes, Jayme White, you have the floor.\nDEPUTY TRADE REPRESENTATIVE WHITE:\u00a0 I also want to echo my colleagues by saying thank you for hosting.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a great day so far collaborating, especially with the stakeholders that have so much valuable information.\nIt\u2019s an honor to be here to represent the United States.\u00a0 Ambassador Katherine Tai and I remain excited about serving as co-leads for the United States in this important dialogue.\u00a0 As deputy United States trade representative, one of my chief responsibilities is the North American relationship, including the continued implementation and enforcement of the USMCA, which is the foundation of our economic and trade relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s been two years since we entered into this new agreement.\u00a0 Along with our neighbor and ally to the north, Canada, we are all recommitting to our regional economic partnership.\u00a0 The USMCA represents a high-standard, high-ambition trade agreement that promotes the rights of workers, advances our environmental priorities, and creates new opportunities for our producers.\nThe bottom line is this:\u00a0 The HLED provides a framework to engage collaboratively with Mexico on key projects to complement and fortify the foundation of the USMCA.\u00a0 The HLED helps advance our regional economic integration and our collective prosperity.\u00a0 Our partnership under the HLED supports the development and implementation of a worker-centered economic policy, a top priority of the Biden-Harris administration.\nFor example, we are coordinating joint efforts in a number of areas, including, number one, promoting innovation and our efforts to invest in entrepreneurs and SMEs, who we all know are the backbone of our economies; number two, expanding access to economic opportunities for underrepresented groups; and number three, pursuing strategies for joint workforce development that prioritize the tech skills and training needed to meet the demands and seize the opportunities of the 21st century.\nThese objectives can only make us stronger as a region and reflect the values of the Biden-Harris administration to ensure that all citizens can participate in and benefit from our economic policies.\u00a0 USTR remains committed and ready to help guide this relationship forward along with Secretaries Blinken and Raimondo.\u00a0 Thank you for your time.\u00a0 Thanks.\n\n"}, {"url":

The Secretary General and the Secretary of State will make introductory remarks, and then they\u2019ll be happy to take a few questions.\u00a0 Secretary General.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, welcome back to NATO.\u00a0 It\u2019s always great to see you here and thank you for your personal leadership and your personal commitment to our transatlantic Alliance.\nToday, the NATO flag and the flags of 30 allies are at half mast to honor Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\u00a0 She was a strong supporter of our transatlantic Alliance, of our armed forces, and our values.\u00a0 She knew and worked with all NATO secretaries general, since the founding of NATO.\u00a0 She visited NATO headquarters and hosted NATO leaders at Buckingham Palace.\u00a0 I\u2019ll always remember her wisdom, her warmth, and her strong personal interest in transatlantic security.\u00a0 Our heartfelt condolences to King Charles III, the royal family, and the people of our allies, the United Kingdom and Canada.\nWe have just concluded a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, where we addressed NATO\u2019s strong and united response to Russia\u2019s brutal war on Ukraine.\u00a0 This includes unprecedented military, financial, and humanitarian aid from allies so that Ukraine can uphold its right to self\u2011defense. \u00a0The United States is leading the way, and I welcome the billions of dollars of additional support announced this week.\nYesterday, I participated in the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Russia.\u00a0 We all agree on the importance of stepping and sustaining our winter support so that Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign state.\nIn June, NATO leaders agreed a strengthened package of assistance with fuel, food, medical supplies, military gear, secure communications, and equipment to encounter mines and drones.\u00a0 We will support Ukraine in the long term and help its transition from Soviet-era to modern NATO equipment.\nThe war in Ukraine is entering a critical phase.\u00a0 Ukrainian forces have been able to stall Moscow\u2019s offensive in Donbas, strike back behind Russian lines, and retake territory.\u00a0 Just in the last few days, we have seen further progress \u2013 both in the south in Kherson, and in the east in the Kharkiv region.\u00a0 This shows the bravery, skills, and determination of Ukrainian forces, and it shows that our support is making a difference every day on the battlefield.\nIn the coming months our unity and sovereignty will be tested with pressure on energy supplies and the soaring cost of living, caused by Russia\u2019s war.\u00a0 But the price we pay is measured in money, while the price Ukrainians are paying is measured in lives \u2013 lost lives every day.\u00a0 And all of us will pay a much higher price, if Russia and all the authoritarian regimes see that their aggression is rewarded.\nIf Russia stops fighting, there will be peace.\u00a0 If Ukraine stops fighting, it will cease to exist as an independent nation.\u00a0 So we must stay the course for Ukraine\u2019s sake and for ours.\u00a0 At the same time, we are sending an unmistakable message to Moscow about our readiness to protect and defend every inch of our territory.\u00a0 We are significantly enhancing our presence in the east of the Alliance, putting hundreds of thousands of troops on high readiness, supported with significant air and naval forces, and continuing to invest in cutting-edge capabilities.\nAll of this makes clear that our commitment to Article 5 is unshakeable.\u00a0 Europe and North American must continue to stand together in NATO, in defense of our people, our nations, and our values.\nSo Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, thank you again for leadership, for being here, and for a strong personal commitment to our Alliance.\u00a0 Please, start, of course.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Jens, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you especially for your remarkable leadership of our Alliance in what is the decisive period of the Alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come out of the NATO Summit with a new Strategic Concept.\u00a0 We\u2019ve faced Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done it together, and that\u2019s in no small measure because of your leadership.\nBefore speaking about what brings me here today, I\u2019d like to join Jens in taking a moment just to honor the truly extraordinary life of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\u00a0 On her 21st birthday, then Princess Elizabeth committed to dedicating her life to serving the people of the Commonwealth.\u00a0 For more than 70 years \u2013 a period during which the United Kingdom and world witnessed unprecedented change \u2013 the Queen did just that, while personifying a sense of stability and continuity in turbulent times.\u00a0 She was a powerful, unifying force, a source of comfort and resilience to millions of people from all walks of life.\u00a0 On behalf of the United States, I extend our deepest condolences to our British friends, to the Government of the United Kingdom, to the royal family.\nSo as Jens noted, we just finished a session with our NATO Allies, where I had an opportunity to share a readout of my talks in Kyiv with President Zelenskyy, Foreign Minister Kuleba, and other senior Ukrainian officials.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have an opportunity to speak to President von der Leyen from the European Union tomorrow to continue the strong transatlantic cooperation that we\u2019ve had on Ukraine and on so many other things.\u00a0 These consultations are just the latest example of the unity and strength of our Alliance.\nYesterday, as I was in Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Austin convened the fifth meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\u00a0 More than 50 countries took part, including Ukraine\u2019s defense minister as well as the Secretary General.\u00a0 Support from that group continues to make a decisive difference on the battlefield, where Ukraine\u2019s great defenders are not just holding ground, they are retaking their sovereign territory in a two-front counteroffensive.\nAs I told President Zelenskyy, the support of the United States is unwavering.\u00a0 I announced more than $2.8 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine and also for its neighbors.\u00a0 That support includes $675 million in new military aid to Ukraine.\u00a0 This is part of the twentieth drawdown of military equipment that President Biden has initiated, going back before the Russian aggression.\u00a0 It includes more guided multiple launch rocket systems, artillery ammunition, high-speed anti-radiation missiles, anti-tank systems.\u00a0 The twentieth drawdown now totals $14.7 billion.\nThat sum also includes approximately $2.2 billion in what we call foreign military financing for Ukraine, but also for European allies and partners.\u00a0 That will allow them to begin to begin to acquire assistance for the medium and long term that will be essential to deterring and, if necessary, defending against further Russian aggression in the years to come.\nOur unity here at NATO, across our alliances and partnerships at the United Nations and other international institutions, is essential to advancing our objectives \u2013 shared objectives of supporting Ukraine\u2019s capacity to defend itself, sustaining pressure on Russia for its aggression, ensuring that Ukraine is in the strongest position when conditions are ripe for negotiations.\u00a0 As President Zelenskyy has said, and rightly said, diplomacy is the only way to definitively end Russia\u2019s war of aggression.\u00a0 We see in this moment no indication from Russia that it would be prepared to seriously pursue such diplomacy, but if and when that time comes, Ukraine has to be in the strongest possible position.\nNow, President Putin thought that he would divide and weaken NATO.\u00a0 Today, the Alliance is stronger, more unified, better resourced than ever before, and I heard further evidence in our session with NATO partners today.\u00a0 We\u2019ll soon welcome Finland and Sweden as new allies. We\u2019ve approved a new Strategic Concept to meet twenty-first century threats, and more allies are meeting their pledge to spend two percent of their GDP on defense.\nPresident Putin thought that he would divide the Ukrainian people and swiftly absorb their nation into Russia, but the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to impose its will by force on Ukraine have only further united its people around the goal of defending their sovereignty and preserving a free and open democracy.\nPresident Putin thought his invasion would showcase the Russian military\u2019s might and sophistication.\u00a0 Instead, the Russian army is turning to North Korea and Iran for badly needed supplies, while Ukraine\u2019s military capability continues to get stronger, thanks to its leadership, thanks to the courage of its fighters, and thanks to the robust support from allies and partners.\nPresident Putin thought that our willingness to apply economic pressure would fade with time.\u00a0 Instead, we and our partners and allies have stuck together in the face of Moscow\u2019s coercion and threats, imposing unprecedented costs on Russia\u2019s economy.\u00a0 To date, over 1,000 foreign companies have quit the Russian market.\u00a0 Export controls on semiconductors and other advanced technologies mean that Russia cannot sustain \u2013 never mind modernize \u2013 key sectors, from automobile manufacturing to military exports, to energy exploration.\nRussian imports parts and finished products, have been cut in half from a year ago.\u00a0 What does that mean?\u00a0 It means that they can\u2019t replace the weapons that they\u2019re using up in Ukraine, that they can\u2019t make products for their domestic market, that their people are accustomed to buy.\u00a0 They can\u2019t produce things for export, which will shrink their foreign markets.\nHalf a million people \u2013 half a million people, many of them highly skilled workers \u2013 have left the country.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are estimated to have fallen by $75 billion and an additional $300 billion are currently frozen abroad.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Russia is cut off from the international lending market.\nAll of this is building.\u00a0 It\u2019s cumulative.\u00a0 It will get to be a heavier and heavier burden, as long as Russia\u2019s aggression continues.\nAnd yet, even as President Putin has failed in virtually all of his objectives, the human suffering he\u2019s inflicted on Ukrainians and other people around the world is staggering.\u00a0 I saw some of those consequences up close on my visit yesterday in Ukraine, including to Irpin, whose very name, like the battle of Bucha and Mariupol has become synonymous with Russian war crimes, including indiscriminate violence and the intentional targeting of civilians.\nI saw the costs in my visit to the children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv, where I met kids who will spend the rest of their lives without limbs, with enduring brain injuries, or with other trauma that may be invisible to the eye, because of atrocities committed by Russian forces.\u00a0 Hundreds more Ukrainian boys and girls have been killed by this unprovoked war.\nIt\u2019s not just Ukrainians who are bearing the costs.\u00a0 As Russia falls short of its battlefield aims and is increasingly isolated on the global stage, President Putin has turned to blunter tools to try to peel off support from Ukraine.\u00a0 He\u2019s weaponized energy against European countries standing up to his aggression, raising the costs on families, on businesses, on entire nations.\nPresident Putin is betting that these actions will break the will of countries to stand with Ukraine.\u00a0 He\u2019s betting that the Kremlin can bully other countries into submission.\u00a0 He\u2019s already lost that bet, because the last six and a half months show a growing recognition around the world that while the costs of standing up to the Kremlin\u2019s aggression are high, the costs of standing down would be even higher.\nThat\u2019s why the United States is doing everything in its power to support people around the world who are shouldering the greatest cost of Russia\u2019s aggression, like our comprehensive efforts to help Europeans get though a winter during which they\u2019ll face heavy energy costs, making it hard for many to heat their homes.\u00a0 We won\u2019t leave our European friends out in the cold.\nIt\u2019s also an opportunity to make a decisive shift finally \u2013 once and for all \u2013 away from dependence on Russian energy, which Putin will never stop trying to weaponize to Europe\u2019s detriment; and to make the transition to renewable sources, necessary as well to combat the climate crisis.\u00a0 We can \u2013 we will \u2013 emerge stronger and in a better place.\nAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so vital that we stay the course, that we stay united \u2013 united in support of Ukraine, united with our allies and partners, united for as long as it takes.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take questions now.\u00a0 I see\u00a0Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\u00a0(inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks a lot.\u00a0 Thomas Gutschker,\u00a0Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\u00a0 My question to you, Secretary Blinken:\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen this astonishing move of Ukrainian forces in the northeast of their country, pushing possibly 50 kilometers into Russian occupied territory.\u00a0 How do you explain that?\u00a0 It appears that the Russian army is hardly even fighting.\u00a0 Is that \u2013 is it on the brink of collapse in that area.\u00a0 Do you have an explanation for that?\u00a0 And do you see this potentially as a turning point in this war?\nAnd the question to the Secretary General, if I may:\u00a0 You are constantly making the case for member states to send more ammunition, more arms to Ukraine.\u00a0 One of the replies we are constantly hearing from our defense ministers is that it will compromise capacities that they have pledged to NATO.\u00a0 So, when push comes to shove, and member states do have to make a decision on either supporting Ukraine or holding up their commitments to NATO, what is your suggestion?\u00a0 What\u2019s the right decision to take?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, so happy to start.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Let me say two things.\u00a0 First, what we\u2019re seeing is that the counteroffensive that the Ukrainians have put in place with strong systems and backing from many countries is now underway.\u00a0 It\u2019s early days, but it is demonstrably making real progress.\u00a0 It\u2019s focused in the south, around Kherson, in that area.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also seeing Ukraine not only hold the line in the Donbas and in the northeast, but as you noted, make a significant advance moving some 45 to 50 kilometers in one area past what had been the existing Russia line.\nI think it\u2019s too early to say exactly where this will go, when it will get there, and exactly where it will end up.\u00a0 But I think we can say that Ukraine is proceeding in a very deliberate way with a strong plan, and critically enabled by resources that many of us are providing.\nBut fundamentally \u2013 and I think this may explain more directly the answer to your question \u2013 why am I absolutely confident in the success of the Ukrainians in pushing back the Russian aggression, whether it\u2019s in the northeast, the Donbas, or in the south?\u00a0 For one simple basic reason:\u00a0 This is Ukraine\u2019s homeland, not Russia.\u00a0 People are fighting for their homeland; they\u2019re fighting for their future.\u00a0 And while we can calculate the benefits of weapon systems and financial resources, it\u2019s hard to put a value on that determination to fight for one\u2019s own country, except to say that it\u2019s invaluable and the single biggest difference maker that I think we\u2019ll see play out over the weeks and months ahead.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0\u00a0NATO has had provided unprecedented support to Ukraine with the weapons, with the ammunition and other capabilities.\u00a0 And of course, they have done that bolstered by reducing existing stocks.\u00a0 And you are right that, of course, our allies are now raising the issue of whether these stocks are depleted too much.\nMy answer to that is actually twofold.\u00a0 One is to realize that weapons, ammunitions that we are providing to Ukraine are used to stop the aggressive actions of Russia against an independent, sovereign nation in Europe which is a close partner of NATO.\u00a0 And if President Putin wins in Ukraine, it\u2019s not only bad for Ukrainians, but it is also dangerous for all of us.\u00a0 So actually, by ensuring that Russia, that President Putin doesn\u2019t win in Ukraine, we\u2019re also increasing our own security and strengthening the Alliance by proving that we don\u2019t allow that kind of behavior close to our own borders.\u00a0 So, the use of these stocks actually helps to increase our own security and reduce the risk of any aggressive actions by Russia against NATO Ally countries.\nLet me also add that more than 80 percent of Russia\u2019s land forces are now dedicated to the war in Ukraine.\u00a0 So for what happens there, not just for the total capacity of Russia to pose any threat to any NATO Ally from here.\nSo, my first message to the Allies is that we welcome the unprecedented support.\u00a0 We are calling for even more support, and we urge them to dig deeply into the inventories, to the stocks, to continue to provide the supplies that Ukraine need immediately.\u00a0 And we see that this is making a huge difference on the ground, because as Secretary Blinken \u2013 Tony \u2013 just referred to, there are \u2013 we see progress on the ground in Ukraine.\u00a0 But make no mistakes, you have to be prepared for the long haul.\nThe second answer to the concern about the level of stocks is of course to produce more.\u00a0 Therefore we are now in close contact with the defense industry, with capitals.\u00a0 We have established structures here at NATO on defense planning, on capabilities, to ensure that we are now ramping up production, that we are replenishing the stocks, both to be able to continue to provide support to Ukraine, but this is not only about supporting Ukraine; it\u2019s also about ensuring that we have the weapons, the munitions, the capabilities in place for our own deterrence and defense.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Okay, with\u00a0Agence France-Presse.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary General.\u00a0 Can I follow up on my colleague\u2019s question a bit on the state of where it is?\u00a0 Russia has just announced that they\u2019re sending reinforcements into the Kharkiv area.\u00a0 How do you see this going?\u00a0 Do you think this is a sign of \u2013 how do you see this as a sign in terms of the direction that Russia\u2019s going in?\u00a0 And how do you see this as a \u2013 in terms of where it could be seen in Kharkiv?\nCould I ask you also, since you\u2019re talking about the Alliance and unity among the \u2013 within the Alliance, the question of Turkey.\u00a0 Turkey, there was some concerns raised previously on Sweden and Finland.\u00a0 This past weekend there were comments from President Erdo\u011fan regarding Greece and comments perceived as threatening.\u00a0 How do you see the role of Turkey in this?\u00a0 Do you have any specific reaction to President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s remarks this weekend?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Shaun, thank you.\u00a0 On the first question, following up on our German colleague, look, the counteroffensive, again, is in its early days, so I don\u2019t want to prejudge, as I said, where it will go and how far it will get.\u00a0 But the initial signs are positive, and we see Ukraine making real, demonstrable progress in a deliberate way.\nBut fundamentally, what we\u2019re also seeing \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen this throughout \u2013 even as President Putin threw as much as he could against Ukraine earlier this summer, Ukraine absorbed the blow and now is pushing back, enabled by our partners and allies, the United States.\nBut the single most important factor, I believe, is this: Ukrainians are fighting for their own country.\u00a0 The Russian forces in Ukraine, many of them have no idea why they\u2019re there.\u00a0 Some didn\u2019t even know where they were being sent.\u00a0 We see reports that their morale is low, and when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re fighting for, that is something that\u2019s not sustainable.\nNow, Russia has significant resources, military resources.\u00a0 It is acting in horrific, indiscriminate ways.\u00a0 Ukrainians are bearing an incredibly heavy cost, as Jens alluded to.\u00a0 Their lives are on the line.\u00a0 And even on the front lines now, in and around the Kherson area \u2013 even as they\u2019re making progress, they\u2019re bearing real costs.\u00a0 But fundamentally they are fighting for their own homeland, they\u2019re fighting for their future; the Russian forces in Ukraine are not.\u00a0 And I am convinced that that is the most decisive factor, and we\u2019re seeing some manifestations of that.\u00a0 But this is likely to go on for some significant period of time.\u00a0 There are a huge number of Russian forces that are in Ukraine, and unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, President Putin has demonstrated that he will throw a lot of people into this, at huge cost to Russia, at huge cost to its future.\nAnd let me just add something I\u2019ve said from the beginning.\u00a0 How is what Putin is doing doing anything to improve the lives of the Russian people?\u00a0 How is this helping them?\u00a0 How is this assuring their own future?\u00a0 How is this creating opportunity for them?\u00a0 Not only is it not; it\u2019s doing just the opposite.\u00a0 It\u2019s cutting Russia off from the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s denying opportunity.\u00a0 It\u2019s depleting its resources, resources that could go to help the Russian people.\u00a0 In a closed information society that Putin has created in Russia, that information doesn\u2019t get there as quickly as it otherwise might, but I believe it will.\u00a0 And Russians have to ask themselves why in the world they are losing so many lives trying to take another country that is not theirs.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0 Just briefly on that, yes, we see some encouraging signs.\u00a0 The Russian offensive in Donbas has been stalled by the Ukrainian forces, and they are retaking some territory both in the east and in the south.\u00a0 But make no mistake.\u00a0 This can last for long time, and at least we have to be prepared for long haul and be ready to provide support to Ukraine for as long as it takes.\nWars are, by nature, unpredictable; and we know that Russia has a lot of military capabilities, and they are willing to use them to attack a sovereign, independent democratic nation, as we are seeing over the last months in Ukraine.\nThe first task is actually to be prepared for the winter.\u00a0 The winter is coming, it\u2019s going to be hard, and therefore we need both to continue to supply weapons and ammunition, but also winter clothing, tents, generators, and all the specific equipment which is needed for the winter.\u00a0 Partly because the size of the Ukraine army has just increased so much, they need more of these kind of winter equipment; and NATO is particularly focused on how can we provide tens of thousands of, for instance, winter uniforms to the Ukrainian army.\nOn Turkey and Greece, Turkey and Greece are two highly valued Allies.\u00a0 They participate and contribute to NATO in many different ways.\u00a0 Any differences between them, of course, should be solved by diplomatic means.\u00a0 We have also at NATO established what we call a deconfliction mechanism where Turkey and Greece can engage and have used this previously to provide information to provide also ways to deconflict any dangerous situation or behavior in, for instance, the Aegean Sea.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to follow up on Shaun\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d like to follow up on Shaun\u2019s question about Turkey and just press a little bit more.\u00a0 You talked about the importance of unity to the Alliance.\u00a0 President Erdo\u011fan in many ways, not only with this recent threat to Greece, seems to be threatening that unity.\u00a0 He\u2019s talked about another incursion into northeast Syria.\u00a0 He renewed over the summer his threat to block the admission of Sweden and Finland into the Alliance, and then this latest issue with Greece, among others.\u00a0 Just can you talk a little bit more about the effect this has on the unity you say is so crucial?\nAnd specifically Secretary Blinken, I believe I heard you say in your introductory remarks that you\u2019re confident or looking forward to Sweden and Finland being admitted into the Alliance.\u00a0 Can you tell us what your basis for that optimism is given that President Erdo\u011fan, as I said, renewed his threat over the summer to block their admission?\nAnd if I just might briefly ask you to talk a little bit about where things stand with the Iran nuclear negotiations.\u00a0 They appear to have stalled out, perhaps once and for all.\u00a0 Can they be revived?\u00a0 And what comes next?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Michael, thank you.\u00a0 And I\u2019m really going to defer to the secretary general on questions fundamentally related to NATO.\u00a0 Let me simply say this.\nFirst, with regard to Finland and Sweden, I think it\u2019s very clear that there is a strong Alliance consensus, strong support for their admission.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the ratification of the protocols process move forward with land record speed, and there\u2019s strong support in the United States, of course, from both political parties.\u00a0 I had the honor of depositing the instruments of ratification last month.\u00a0 So I\u2019m very confident that this is moving forward, moving forward deliberately, but I would defer to Jens on anything further on that.\nMore broadly, I can only repeat what Jens said, for example, about Greece and Turkey \u2013 both vital, important Allies, friends of the United States.\u00a0 They have differences, and of course we\u2019d like to see them resolve these differences in a constructive way through dialogue.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done so in the past, and we would expect them to do so going forward.\nAnd it is precisely because we have a fundamental challenge before us when it comes to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, a challenge that matters to every single ally and many countries well beyond the Alliance, well beyond the transatlantic area.\u00a0 And so, we should be making sure that we\u2019re focusing all of our attention and our resources as necessary in supporting Ukraine and pushing back against Russia\u2019s aggression.\nNow, what I\u2019ve heard in the room today with all of our NATO partners present was a very strong reaffirmation of that focus, of that unity \u2013 unity of purpose, unity of action.\u00a0 President Biden heard that very clearly in the conversation that he initiated just yesterday with many of our partners.\u00a0 Secretary Austin heard that and saw that at Ramstein where for the fifth time this coalition of countries has come together to further support Ukraine.\u00a0 So what I\u2019m seeing as a practical matter is an Alliance that is united and is focused on the biggest challenge that many of our countries face right now.\nWith regard to Iran and the JCPOA, a few things.\u00a0 First, it\u2019s a negotiation.\u00a0 It\u2019s back and forth.\u00a0 We have a response from Iran to what was put forward most recently by the European Union.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been looking at that along with the European partners, and needless to say, I\u2019m not about to negotiate anything in public.\u00a0 In past weeks, we\u2019ve closed some gaps.\u00a0 Iran had moved away from some extraneous demands, demands unrelated to the JCPOA itself.\u00a0 However, the latest response takes us backwards, and we are not about to agree to a deal that doesn\u2019t meet our bottom line requirements and/or that tries to continuously introduce extraneous demands that are not relevant to the JCPOA itself.\u00a0 If we conclude a deal, it\u2019s only because it will advance our national security.\u00a0 The President is focused on that, and what we\u2019ve just seen again would appear to move us backward, not forward.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0\u00a0On differences in NATO \u2013 yes, of course, there are differences in NATO.\u00a0 We are 30 different Allies, 30 different democracies, and of course we don\u2019t always agree on all issues.\u00a0 And that has been the case since this Alliance was founded more than 70 years ago, dating back to the Suez Crisis in \u201956 or the differences on the Iraq War 20 years ago.\u00a0 And of course, we also see differences today.\u00a0 What makes NATO the most successful alliance in history is that we\u2019re able to overcome those differences, and then make decisions together, and then implement them together.\nAnd we saw that demonstrated at the NATO summit in Madrid just a few months ago.\u00a0 We made big decisions on further increasing our presence in the eastern part of Alliance.\u00a0 We only had 40,000 troops under NATO command as a direct response to the Russian attack on Ukraine.\u00a0 And we have also agreed to strengthen deterrence and defense across the whole Alliance.\nWe made also the decision to invite Finland and Sweden.\u00a0 That\u2019s an historic decision.\u00a0 And all Allies agreed to invite them.\u00a0 And I also welcome that, so far, this has been the fastest accession process in NATO\u2019s modern history.\u00a0 Up to now, 24 Allies have already ratified, in national parliaments, the accession protocols, and including the U.S. \u2013 the United States Senate.\nAnd I also think it\u2019s important to recognize that we have to take the security concerns of all Allies seriously, meaning that we need to address the fact that no other Ally have suffered \u2013 has suffered more terrorist attacks than Turkey. \u00a0And therefore, I welcome that as part of the agreement in Madrid \u2013 it was a trilateral agreement between Finland, Sweden, and Turkey to strengthen cooperation when it comes to fighting terrorism.\u00a0 They have established a permanent mechanism to exchange more informations, to exchange intelligence, and to work more closely together.\nSo, I\u2019m confident that we will move forward, and that Finland and Sweden will become members; and so, far this has been the fastest accession protocol process ever in NATO\u2019s history.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0I know there are more questions; unfortunately, we have run out of time, so this concludes this press conference.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-to-traveling-press-before-departing-poland/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemarks to Traveling Press Before Departing

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Rzeszow Airport", "location": "Rzeszow, Poland", "date": "September 9, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I just thought I\u2019d say a few words before we head off to Brussels and reflect for a minute about what we did yesterday in Ukraine as well as what we can expect today in Brussels.\u00a0 This was my fifth trip to Ukraine as Secretary and in many ways the most meaningful because it took place coincident with the beginnings of this counteroffensive that Ukraine is engaged in to liberate the land that has been seized by Russian forces as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nWe had a chance yesterday to hear directly from President Zelenskyy and his team about the state of their efforts in this counteroffensive, and I had an opportunity to share with him and his team additional significant assistance that the United States is providing both in the near term and longer term on the security side \u2013 an additional $2.8 billion. This assistance combined with the extraordinary courage and resilience of Ukrainian forces and the Ukrainian people has been the recipe for success thus far in the Ukrainians pushing the Russians back, and now engaging in this counteroffensive.\nI told President Zelenskyy on behalf of President Biden and the American people that we have been with Ukraine. We\u2019re with Ukraine today. We will be with Ukraine tomorrow and for however long it takes to deal with Russia\u2019s aggression. And I come away, again, very confident in Ukraine\u2019s future because the Ukrainians are fighting for their homeland.\u00a0 It\u2019s their homeland, not Russia\u2019s.\nWe head now to Brussels. I think I\u2019ve spent more time in Brussels than in any other city other than Washington, D.C., these past 18 months or so, and there\u2019s good reason for that. It\u2019s home to the NATO Alliance, the European Union. Allies and partners come together in Brussels to work together on the major challenges of our time; Ukraine now being at the top of the list.\nSo, I\u2019ll have an opportunity in Brussels to debrief NATO Allies, other partners, on what I learned in Ukraine and to work with them on a number of issues that are of concern to everyone, starting with the situation in and around Zaporizhzhia, where Russia has seized as part of its aggression a nuclear facility, and that\u2019s of real concern to many of us; making sure that food which needs to get out of Ukraine after it\u2019s been blocked by Russia \u2013 make sure the agreement that was reached continues; support for Ukraine, not just security support but economic support and humanitarian support; thinking about longer-term reconstruction needs \u2013 all of this is going to be part of the agenda in Brussels.\nAnd I think I\u2019ll have a chance to reflect a little bit on what I saw yesterday just in terms of the human toll of Russia\u2019s aggression \u2013 seeing kids at the children\u2019s hospital who are victims of that aggression; going to Irpin, a city that was devastated by Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 You see just miles from downtown Kyiv these bombed-out buildings, civilian dwellings.\u00a0 The only thing you can say when you see it is, at best \u2013 at best, these were indiscriminate attacks on civilian buildings, and at worst, intentional, deliberate, designed to terrorize the population.\u00a0 It\u2019s important that we remember this, because all of this comes down to the effect it\u2019s having on the lives of real people in Ukraine.\nBut finally, the most important reason I think we\u2019re in Brussels is because what has worked so well for us thus far has been our unity \u2013 unity of purpose, unity of action.\u00a0 When it comes to helping Ukraine defend itself, when it comes to making sure that there\u2019s significant pressure on Russia to end this aggression, when it comes to making sure our own Alliance is as strong and resolute as it can be to deter any additional Russian aggression, I think you\u2019ll see that unity in action, once again.\u00a0 And I\u2019m confident that based on every conversation I\u2019ve had, every engagement I\u2019ve had, it\u2019s going to continue.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, going into the Brussels visit, how concerned are you that the energy challenges facing European countries, including the high prices and the supply challenges, are going to erode the unity that you just mentioned of the anti-Russia coalition and the support of Europeans for what\u2019s happening in Ukraine?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Look, President Biden said from the start that standing up for what\u2019s at stake with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was not going to be cost-free.\u00a0 And countries have stepped up.\u00a0 They stepped up because, in the first instance, the aggression on a human level is abhorrent but also because, fundamentally, it\u2019s an aggression against the basic principles of the international system that helped us keep the peace, that helped us maintain security, that allowed countries to grow and move forward.\u00a0 And if we allow this to stand, this aggression to stand with impunity, it opens a Pandora\u2019s box for a world of conflict, for a world of hurt going forward.\nBut it comes with costs, but the cost of inaction, of not doing anything, of allowing this to go forward, would be far greater.\nNow, when it comes to energy, we have taken and we\u2019re taking significant action to deal with the challenges that exist.\u00a0 The United States has released significant oil from our strategic petroleum reserve.\u00a0 We have redirected liquefied natural gas to Europe to help alleviate some of the challenges that Europe is facing with the reduction in energy coming from Russia.\u00a0 We have a task force with the European Union looking at how we do this effectively not just in the immediate, but for the long term.\u00a0 And of course the fact that Russia has cut off the Nord Stream I pipeline, again, is further evidence that it is so vital strategically for Europe to move away from dependence on Russian energy, because Putin has shown repeatedly that he will use it as a weapon.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not going to stop now.\nSo, the challenge is to get through the coming winter.\u00a0 Europe has taken very significant steps to put itself in a position to do that, and I\u2019ll hear more about that later today.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing everything we can to help.\u00a0 But there\u2019s also a tremendous opportunity born of necessity.\u00a0 The opportunity is finally, once and for all, to move away from this dependence on Russia \u2013 to get rid of the chokehold that Russia has on Europe, using energy as a weapon, and to diversify supply, diversify roots, but also do it in a way that addresses the climate challenge.\nThis is a real, genuine opportunity.\u00a0 We see decisive action being taken by Europe.\u00a0 And again, from what I\u2019ve seen and heard so far, I\u2019m confident this is moving in a good direction.\u00a0 Is there going to be a cost to this?\u00a0 Is it going to be challenging?\u00a0 Yes, but I think we\u2019re looking at landing in a place where manifestly Europe, the United States, countries around the world will be better off.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, on the offensive in the east and south, what would have to happen?\u00a0 You talked with Mr. \u2013 President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 What would have to happen?\u00a0 What would they have to achieve with those offensives for it to make sense to go to the negotiating table, and for the West to support negotiations between Ukraine and Russia?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 That is for Ukraine to decide.\u00a0 That\u2019s for President Zelenskyy, the democratically elected leader of Ukraine, to decide.\u00a0 They have to decide the terms upon which they would want to engage and pursue diplomacy.\u00a0 President Zelenskyy said very clearly that when this ends, it will end with diplomacy, but it takes two to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 And one is not \u2013 it\u2019s not present and shows no signs of being present, and that\u2019s Russia.\nSo, unless and until Russia demonstrates that it\u2019s serious about engaging in diplomacy, there\u2019s not much, alas, to be done.\u00a0 And as to the specific terms, that is up to Ukraine.\u00a0 Their country has been aggressed.\u00a0 Russia has seized territory in southern and eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s Ukraine, it\u2019s not Russia.\u00a0 And ultimately, territory needs to go back to Ukraine. \u00a0Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence needs to be reaffirmed. \u00a0I have no doubts with \u2013 about that.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve already seen that Putin\u2019s efforts to erase that sovereignty, to erase that independence, to try to make good on his conviction that Ukraine is not its own country and belongs to Russia \u2013 that\u2019s already game over.\u00a0 Putin\u2019s lost on that, but, meanwhile, doing tremendous damage to Ukraine, to lives, to livelihoods.\u00a0 That has to stop.\u00a0 The exact terms upon which it stops, again, will be up to Ukraine.\nMR PRICE: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, all of this is up to the Ukrainian people through their democratically elected representatives.

an exodus of more than 1,000 international companies from Russia, a brain drain of the most talented people from Russia; a huge decline in their imports so that they are unable to replace the weapons that they are using.\u00a0 They are unable to produce the products for their own people that they\u2019ve expected in the past.\u00a0 They\u2019re unable to make the things that they used to export to other countries, and their markets will dry out as a result.\u00a0 And they\u2019re unable to borrow money against their sovereign debt.\nSo it\u2019s gotten to a point where Moscow is now seeking military assistance from North Korea and Iran as we have systematically choked off their access to inputs elsewhere, and we will continue to exert that pressure until the aggression ceases and Ukraine is fully sovereign and independent.\nAcross all of these measures, our support \u2013 the pressure on Russia, the humanitarian and economic assistance \u2013 I think together we\u2019ve proven very effective, and we will keep (inaudible).\u00a0 You have our word and our track record.\u00a0 I should also add this:\u00a0 The rest of the world, of course, has felt the consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 And one of the consequences has been an increase in food insecurity that was already severe because of climate change and because of COVID.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s aggression added to that problem.\nThe agreement that was reached that lifted the blockade by Russia on Odesa has already resulted in 100 ships bringing grain and food products to the world, and most of that has gone to what we call the Global South \u2013 countries in Africa and elsewhere who are the most in need.\u00a0 President Putin\u2019s threat to discontinue that agreement I think will deeply anger and upset the countries that are benefiting now from Ukraine\u2019s right to export its own food.\nVery quickly, Mr. President, in April I pledged that we would reopen our mission at the first possible opportunity.\u00a0 Today, joined by Ambassador Brink, I spent some time with our team at the embassy.\u00a0 It was very meaningful to me to see the American flag flying over the United States embassy.\u00a0 We are committed to it, and I\u2019m glad we did it.\nSecretary of Defense Austin and I also promised that we will continue to provide security assistance at the president\u2019s request, and as I mentioned, we\u2019ve since provided billions of dollars.\u00a0 Today, the Secretary of Defense Austin is in Ramstein, Germany where he has been working and coordinating with countries around the world in providing assistance to Ukraine.\nI said we\u2019d continue to step up with economic assistance.\u00a0 Since April, we\u2019ve provided about $7.5 billion in economic support that goes directly to your (inaudible), including support for 600,000 teachers, and the school year has now started.\u00a0 And so for your future, for our future together, this is so important.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to be there for you.\nFinally, Mr. President, I visited a children\u2019s hospital today, and that made very real the costs (inaudible) that you\u2019re suffering, but also what\u2019s at stake \u2013 quite literally the future of the country, as represented by those children who are victims of Russian aggression.\u00a0 Their bravery, their courage is incredibly inspiring.\u00a0 It\u2019s clear, Mr. President, that Ukrainians both young and old have extraordinary resolve.\u00a0 So does the United States.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-an-event-in-honor-of-the-anniversaries-of-the-thomas-r-pickering-foreign-affairs-fellowship-charles-b-rangel-international-affairs-program-donald-m-payne-internatio/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

looked up to for guidance, for wisdom for so many years.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve heard today why he\u2019s such an effective diplomat.\u00a0 A hundred percent, okay.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We know where we need to go.\u00a0 So, Tom, thank you.\nBut this is really remarkable, because \u2013 again, I want to come back to something that Tom said.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at 30, we\u2019re looking at 20, we\u2019re looking at 10, we\u2019re looking at 5.\u00a0 And to the ambassador\u2019s point, not that many things actually survive institutionally in this town for as long, but not only survive, thrive.\u00a0 And this is the evidence of that.\u00a0 And it\u2019s incredibly powerful.\nIf you go anywhere in the corridors of this department, AID, around town, the halls of Congress, and you hear the names Pickering, Rangel, Payne, and now FAIT, you know what people are talking about.\u00a0 This has resonated throughout this town, and it\u2019s resonated not simply because we have these extraordinary programs, but because of the extraordinary people that have been able to participate in them and that have enriched our institution, enriched our foreign policy, enriched our development work in ways that are, quite frankly, immeasurable, but so incredibly powerful.\nSo for me, this is an easy thing to celebrate these anniversaries, but also to dedicate, dedicate ourselves to doing even more, going even further, digging even deeper, because it makes a profound difference.\nMilestones like the ones we\u2019re celebrating today are reached because a lot of people work to make them happen.\u00a0 So our program partners at Howard University, the Washington Center, thank you, thank you, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you to Wayne Frederick, president of Howard University, Kim Churches, president of the Washington Center, for joining us today.\u00a0 And I have a special affinity for the Washington Center; my uncle Alan was long a participant and supporter of its efforts.\nSam I think had to go on to carry out her work day, but she has been remarkable as a supporter of the Payne Fellowship \u2013 a fierce commitment to making our nation\u2019s development workforce even stronger, even more capable, even more resilient.\u00a0 And I see that every single day.\nAnd a huge thank you to the team here at the State Department who run these fellowships, starting with our great director general of the Foreign Service, Marcia Bernicat.\u00a0 Marcia, my thanks to you.\nWe also have, I think, with us today the \u2013 I think the word \u201clegendary\u201d is appropriate \u2013 Ambassador Ruth Davis, who\u2019s done so much to champion these fellowships not only in her time as director general, but later, too, as a member of the Rangel selection committee, a mentor to quite literally generations of fellows.\nAnd I want to come back to the trailblazers whose names adorn these programs and who really have blazed an incredible trail for this department and for our country.\u00a0 Tom, a legend here at the department, but as you\u2019ve heard, and this \u2013 there really is something to getting your name on something when you\u2019re still able to lead, because you feel a sense of responsibility; you don\u2019t let us forget it, every single day.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nCongressman Rangel.\u00a0 There was a special pleasure I\u2019ve got to say I took in hearing his voice across the video.\u00a0 It\u2019s a voice that resonates with me powerfully.\u00a0 I\u2019m a native New Yorker.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Charlie Rangel \u2013 wow.\u00a0 This is someone that I\u2019ve looked up to and revered for so many years as an extraordinary leader.\u00a0 And that voice gets you every single time, and it was really great to hear it today.\u00a0 He has been a leading force for so long in making us more diverse.\nAnd the late Congressman Don Payne, who, as we\u2019ve heard, set an incredibly powerful example in his dedication to equality, and we\u2019re lucky to have his son, Congressman Don Payne, Jr., here with us today.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nNow, in my experience, devoted public servants like these don\u2019t actually think about their legacies.\u00a0 They\u2019re actually focused on doing good work, and that\u2019s what becomes their legacy.\u00a0 These fellowships represent living legacies for these remarkable people.\u00a0 And then, as I said, we heard from Melanie, we heard from Krina, we heard from Jared, we heard from Hermes about how these programs transformed their lives and careers.\nI don\u2019t think you need any better evidence of the incredible power and impact and value of these programs than hearing from the four of them.\u00a0 They are the powerful living evidence of why this has been so important, why this has added so much value to what we do.\u00a0 So thank you each for your testimonies, for sharing with us, and thank you for what you continue to do every day to make us better and stronger.\nWe heard how the fellowships have transformed their lives.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also heard how these fellowships have transformed our department.\u00a0 If you look around \u2013 and I see this every day; not a day goes by, and this is almost literally true, when I don\u2019t come across a Rangel or Pickering Fellow here \u2013 we see them advancing our work in critical roles around the world, from special assistants to ambassadors.\u00a0 Payne Fellows are advancing the work of development, creating tangible change for communities.\u00a0 When I visit our embassies around the world and I\u2019m with colleagues from USAID, I see the incredible work that they\u2019re doing every day.\u00a0 This is where the rubber meets the road, actually making a tangible difference in people\u2019s lives.\nAnd our FAIT Fellows, they\u2019re making sure that we have the technology we need to actually carry out 21st century diplomacy.\u00a0 When I started at the department and Tom was one of the people I looked up to, technology was not exactly a hallmark of this institution.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I inherited an office in the front office of the European Affairs Bureau that, as I\u2019ve said before, its previous occupant had been a very large safe.\u00a0 Then I took the office and the large safe was gone because they needed to make room for me, and there was a very large \u2013 remember these, Tom? \u2013 Wang computer on the desk.\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ve made a little progress since then, but we need to do more and FAIT Fellows are making sure that we have the technology that we need to carry out diplomacy in this century.\u00a0 Without them, quite literally so much of what we do would be a heck of a lot more difficult if not actually impossible.\nAnd here\u2019s the thing that I really want to focus on for a few minutes today.\u00a0 Our fellows deliver for America; they reflect America.\u00a0 Secretary Powell said back in 2002 when he announced the then-brand new Rangel Fellowship, our diplomats, and I quote, \u201csend a powerful, positive signal around the globe that differences do not have to be divisive, and that freedom works.\u00a0 They send that message not just by doing what they do \u2026 but also being who they are \u2026 personifying America in its beautiful diversity.\u201d\nSo you\u2019ve heard, starting with Marcia, why we\u2019re so focused on this.\u00a0 We used to talk about our foreign policy after the Second World War as being animated by enlightened self-interest.\u00a0 Well, this, too, is enlightened self-interest.\u00a0 It is not only the right thing to do, it\u2019s the smart thing to do.\u00a0 You\u2019ve heard from all of our speakers how diversity, how inclusion makes our foreign policy that much stronger, that much more innovative, that much more effective.\nWe know, simply put, that in a diverse world it would be to penalize ourselves not to draw on our full diversity.\u00a0 It simply makes no sense.\u00a0 But for decades, American diplomats pretty much all looked the same.\u00a0 Many came from the same parts of the country, even the same schools.\u00a0 Just about everyone else \u2013 people of different genders, different faiths, different racial and ethnic backgrounds, nations of origin \u2013 they were relegated to supporting roles if they could find a place here at all.\nGenerations of public servants worked diligently, determinedly to change that.\u00a0 They faced a lot of headwinds, sometimes very, very strong.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard how Congressman Rangel and the Congressional Black Caucus fought to pass legislation creating the Pickering and Rangel Fellowships; how dedicated leaders inside the department moved these programs forward, like Ambassador Edward Perkins, who implemented the Pickering Fellowship as director general of the Foreign Service.\u00a0 Even after leaving office, he continued to watch over the program, including threatening to go to Congress himself when he heard that funding might be cut.\nI think you can get a sense of how cherished the program is, how much good it\u2019s doing, by how hard people are willing to fight for it.\u00a0 Many people have fought hard for these fellowships because they know how vital they are.\u00a0 They know how important they are.\u00a0 They know what a difference it makes for our diplomacy and for our standing and effectiveness in the world.\nSo, as you heard, just the last two years these four fellowship programs together have increased their numbers by 50 percent or more.\u00a0 In total, we now welcome more than 100 fellows a year between the four programs.\u00a0 Thirty years ago, when all of this started, we had eight exceptional people.\u00a0 So that\u2019s progress, that\u2019s moving forward, but I\u2019m inspired by Tom\u2019s \u2013 (laughter) \u2013\u00a0 admonition that we\u2019re going to do more and do better.\nToday \u2013 and this is remarkable.\u00a0 Think about this for a minute \u2013 one in nine \u2013 one in nine \u2013 active Foreign Service officers participated in Rangel or Pickering.\u00a0 Thanks to them, the number of generalists from underrepresented backgrounds has increased by 33 percent.\u00a0 Among Payne Fellows, 75 percent are racial or ethnic minorities; 75 percent are women.\u00a0 And 65 percent of FAIT Fellows come from underrepresented backgrounds.\nSo this is progress.\u00a0 These numbers represent progress.\u00a0 But \u2013 and this is what I want to focus on and finish on \u2013 we still have a lot of work to do.\u00a0 We still have a lot of work to do to create a department that truly reflects the people that we\u2019re here to represent, that\u2019s truly as diverse and inclusive as it needs to be if we\u2019re going to fulfill our mission on behalf of this country and on behalf of its people.\nSo in that spirit, I do have some good news to share today, and I\u2019m happy to announce that we have two new fellowships to put forward today.\u00a0 Next month we will launch the Colin Powell Leadership Program to recruit college students.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 This program will recruit college students and recent graduates to the Civil Service.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 These participants are going to join fellowships and internships that lead to full-time employment with the State Department.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to get training, mentoring to prepare them for the world of diplomacy.\nWe\u2019re also creating a new fellowship for something that is very near and dear to me, and that is our Diplomatic Security Service.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Graduate students from underrepresented communities will receive scholarships, professional development training, and mentoring.\u00a0 And after completing the program, they will enter the Foreign Service as DS special agents.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Now, this fellowship is going to be named for another exceptional public servant, William D. Clark, Sr.\u00a0 He was the first member from Diplomatic Security to achieve the rank of ambassador.\nSo beyond these fellowships, we will keep driving progress on diversity, on inclusion, on equity, on accessibility.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be driving it across the department, working with the leadership of another remarkable person, Ambassador Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, our first chief diversity and inclusion officer.\u00a0 Gina has been leading an extraordinary effort from almost day one.\u00a0 We created this office \u2013 it was one of the very things that I did as Secretary \u2013 reporting directly to me to make sure that every single day we are driving the work, driving the agenda of building a department that reflects this country.\nThere has been a lot of good work done over the last 18 to 20 months.\u00a0 I won\u2019t rehearse it all.\u00a0 But simply put, standing up this office, having senior leadership in every bureau at the deputy assistant secretary level reporting to and connecting with this office, having a senior advisory board across the department working together to make sure that we are advancing this agenda.\u00a0 We have for the first time ever a remarkable data set where we\u2019ve disaggregated data, and we have a picture of virtually every single office in the department, where we are, where we\u2019re not, where we need to go.\u00a0 We have a five year strategic plan that will soon be published \u2013 it\u2019s at the White House now \u2013 that reflects commentary, ideas from almost a thousand Foreign Service officers and civil servants.\nTogether, we\u2019re looking at every single aspect of how we need to carry this \u2013 forward this agenda, from recruitment, which is vital, and particularly reaching out to communities that have been underrepresented here in high school, in college, opening hearts, opening minds to the idea that this could be a career \u2013 this could be a place where they want to spend their working lives.\nBut we know from experience that even as people come through the doors of C Street \u2013 and thanks to these fellowships more and more have done so \u2013 that that\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 Because if you don\u2019t have a genuinely inclusive workplace, then people won\u2019t stay.\u00a0 We\u2019ve learned that and we\u2019ve learned that the hard way.\u00a0 So even as we\u2019re focused on opening the doors wider and bringing more people in, we want to make sure that we\u2019re building a culture at the State Department that makes everyone not only feel welcome but genuinely included and convinced that they can aspire to do any job in this department.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of work that goes into that, a lot of effort, and it\u2019s not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 It is moving an aircraft carrier, but we\u2019re moving it.\u00a0 Relentlessly, it is moving.\nI want to close with a shout out to one particular Pickering Fellow, who I happen to work with every day, and this is one of my special assistants, Bryan Furman.\u00a0 Bryan, where are you?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo \u2013 and a group of us had lunch just yesterday and catching up and learning some of the stories.\u00a0 And the question I\u2019m always asking people, especially the younger folks among us, is what brought you here; how did you wind up here?\u00a0 So in college Bryan studied languages.\u00a0 He studied psychology.\u00a0 He also practiced martial arts.\u00a0 So when he thought about his future, he thought maybe I\u2019ll keep studying languages, maybe I\u2019ll go into the health field, maybe I\u2019ll open a martial arts studio, which tells you a little bit about the multi-talents that he brings to this job.\u00a0 And by the way, having some background in martial arts is extremely helpful in the work that we\u2019re doing every day, and it makes me feel a lot better.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut then Bryan spent a year in Tajikistan on a Fulbright and saw all of the extraordinary work that our embassies and our diplomats are doing.\u00a0 So he applied for a Pickering.\u00a0 He was accepted.\u00a0 He joined the department, and now we travel the world together, and he\u2019s making sure that this office \u2013 the office of the Secretary \u2013 runs smoothly, which, as you can imagine, is not necessarily a job for the faint of heart.\u00a0 So Bryan, thank you.\u00a0 It\u2019s just one more powerful example of how wonderful these fellowship programs are.\nWhen you ask Bryan what Pickering meant to him, he says that it helped him break into this world of diplomacy, learn to navigate this bureaucracy \u2013 something I\u2019m still trying to figure out \u2013 and to hit the ground running when he became a Foreign Service officer.\u00a0 But perhaps even more important, the Pickering Fellowship showed him how diplomats at their best spot problems and then work together to fix them.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what these fellowships have done.\u00a0 They\u2019ve taken on a serious problem, and they\u2019ve helped us make real progress towards solving it.\u00a0 So we will keep working together in the days to come, in the weeks to come, in the months to come, in the decades to come, to make sure that this department is a place that genuinely reflects our values, that looks like America, and that is equipped to do the best possible work on behalf of America.\nThank you all so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/to-african-diaspora-youth-and-exchange-alumni/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo African Diaspora Youth and Exchange Alumni\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

want it to end, so we found a way to sort of continue it \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 today.\u00a0 And I\u2019m really grateful to each and every one of you for coming out.\nErv, by the way, who doesn\u2019t look it unless you consider that we had a grade school program has actually been in this line of work for 27 years.\u00a0 So \u2014\n(Applause.)\nSo as Erv said, we did just get back from the trip.\u00a0 Actually, truth be told, we started on another continent.\u00a0 We started in Cambodia, we went to the Philippines, and then we transitioned to South Africa, to the DRC, to Rwanda.\u00a0 We made a couple of pit stops, too, on the way home, a quick pit stop in Ghana to refuel, but managed to see the president in the waiting room at the airport.\u00a0 Very good.\u00a0 Even hit Cabo Verde; it was our very last stop.\u00a0 And then finally, finally back home.\nBut this is an ongoing story, which is really why I wanted to have the chance to be here with all of you today.\u00a0 The trip, my second to Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 and in a sense the third, because the very \u2013 I think the second trip that I did as Secretary was actually a virtual trip to Kenya and Nigeria very early on when we weren\u2019t actually traveling.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve had extensive engagement, and I\u2019ll come to it again later.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have an African Leaders Summit that President Biden\u2019s hosting at the end of the year.\u00a0 So there\u2019s a lot of work leading and ramping up to that.\nBut I think, as Erv suggested, this is evidence that for us, Sub-Saharan Africa is a major force for the future.\u00a0 And it\u2019s the very numbers that Erv cited that go to the heart of this, the fact that, as he said, in the next couple of years virtually half the population will be under the age of 25, and by 2050, one in four people on this planet from Africa.\u00a0 That is the definition of the future, and we have a profound stake in trying to get that shared future right.\nOne of the opportunities that I had during the trip was to lay out our Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa, and we tried to focus on a simple proposition.\u00a0 For us now, this is not about what we do for Africa; it\u2019s what we do with Africa.\u00a0 And it comes down to a \u2013 I think a simple, powerful recognition.\u00a0 There is not a single issue that is really having an effect on the lives of our people and on Africans \u2013 whether it is COVID that we\u2019ve all been grappling with and global health more broadly, whether it\u2019s climate change, whether it\u2019s the impact of emerging technologies on all of our lives \u2013 not a single one of these issues can we effectively address alone.\u00a0 We have to find ways to cooperate, find ways to coordinate.\u00a0 We have to find ways to do more with other countries.\nAnd precisely because Africa represents so much of the future as well as the present, it\u2019s in our interest to find ways to deepen our cooperation.\u00a0 The partnership that we\u2019re looking for extends well beyond government.\u00a0 It goes to civil society and NGOs; it goes to the private sector; it goes to citizens more broadly.\u00a0 And we had an opportunity on the trip to connect across these many different groups, and that\u2019s part of the reason I was so anxious to in effect extend the trip by talking to all of you.\nAnd in effect, these partnerships are actually going to be driven by whether you wind up or are in government, whether you\u2019re in civil society, whether you\u2019re in business, whether you\u2019re in academia, whatever the case may be \u2013 the arts \u2013 you\u2019re at the heart of the kind of partnerships that we hope to build.\nIn particular, we have here, as Erv said, folks from the diaspora and the Mandela Fellowship, something I\u2019m very excited about.\u00a0 You are, as a result, already in fact building the partnerships that we\u2019re trying to build.\nLet me just say a couple of quick words about the extraordinary power of the fellowship program.\u00a0 Since President Obama launched the fellowship program, over 5,800 rising leaders from Sub-Saharan Africa have actually taken part.\u00a0 That\u2019s remarkable in just a few short years.\u00a0 But what\u2019s even more remarkable \u2013 because I\u2019ve had a chance to talk to a number of you over the years, including most recently on this trip \u2013 is that I think the Mandela Fellowship does a couple of very powerful things.\u00a0 One is that it actually allows you to create networks that will endure long after your fellowship and, I think, are going to power change far into the future.\nI met some alums in South Africa just this past trip.\u00a0 Fellows are tackling issues like getting more girls into STEM, just to cite one example.\u00a0 But what is fundamental to the fellowship is that it goes both ways.\u00a0 Ideas, innovations are flowing in both directions.\u00a0 That\u2019s true of the fellows who are here among you today.\u00a0 You actually manage to enrich our college campuses, universities, even as you study there.\u00a0 So American students who are there got as much, if not more out of this, I would say, than you did.\nAnd it\u2019s also true of members of the diaspora who are with us today.\u00a0 You\u2019re doing work that bridges our countries, our cultures, our communities, the arts, public health, education, human rights, democracy \u2013 all of that is what you\u2019re doing.\nThe last thing I wanted to share is this, because I\u2019m mostly anxious to hear from you and have a conversation.\u00a0 One of the things that I hear some of the time when I\u2019m meeting with young people is: how can the U.S. talk about the importance of democracy \u2013 which is one of the things we talked in the strategy \u2013 when you face your own challenges here at home in the United States when it comes to democracy, challenges that I think are visible every day?\u00a0 And actually, that\u2019s part of the answer.\u00a0 The very fact that they are visible, that you see us grappling with them every single day, that it\u2019s not pushed under the carpet, it\u2019s not pretended that these problems don\u2019t exist, we\u2019re actually confronting them openly, transparently \u2013 that is actually part of the answer.\u00a0 Because as long as you can do that, I think you\u2019ll come out on the right side of things.\nBut the main point for our strategy is this:\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t treat democracy as an issue where Africa has problems and the United States has solutions.\u00a0 On the contrary, it recognizes that we all have challenges in strengthening our democracies, making sure they\u2019re resilient, and it\u2019s everything from misinformation to inequity.\u00a0 And we have a real stake in learning from each other.\nOne of the things that I found over almost 30 years of being engaged in foreign policy and so getting to travel the world in one way or another \u2013 first with President Clinton, and then with President Obama, and now with President Biden \u2013 is on just about everything that we\u2019re trying to figure out, someone somewhere probably has.\u00a0 And if we can just find ways to share that information so we don\u2019t have to keep reinventing the wheel, we\u2019re going to make progress a lot faster than what people can imagine.\nWe need to draw on the best ideas, we need to draw on the best innovations no matter where they\u2019re from.\u00a0 And that is the spirit of the Summit for Democracy that we initiated last year \u2013 President Biden did \u2013 and it\u2019s the spirit that will animate the Africa Leaders Summit at the end of the year.\u00a0 And that summit is going to have a big role for young people, rising generations, and a big role for the diaspora.\nSo stay tuned.\u00a0 A lot more to come in the next few months.\nThe last point is this. \u00a0This trip, again, underscored for me that so many issues that we now consider global priorities and that we\u2019ve talked about \u2013 including, for example, the interconnectedness of our health and our climate \u2013 are actually championed first in Africa by African citizens and nations.\u00a0 In South Africa and beyond, we heard how our respective civil rights movements had inspired and energized each other over the generations, and we still find that today.\nSo let me end with this: two requests.\u00a0 First, the 2023 Mandela Washington Fellowship application opens tomorrow.\u00a0 So help us recruit.\u00a0 If you had a good experience, if this is something that\u2019s been beneficial to you, spread the word.\u00a0 Share it.\u00a0 We want to get the best of the rising generation to take part.\nSecond, from day one I have made it a priority to try to recruit and retain a workforce at the State Department that actually reflects the country that we represent.\u00a0 So if any of you Americans here are interested in a career in foreign policy, the Foreign Service, the Civil Service, come on down.\u00a0 We need you; we want you.\u00a0 This is a time \u2013 it\u2019s the most exciting time, as challenging as it is to be engaged in diplomacy, because of the very reason that I cited at the outset.\u00a0 None of the problems that really matter can be tackled by any one country acting alone.\u00a0 The role of our diplomacy, the role of our diplomats, is to build that cooperation, that coordination among countries.\u00a0 There\u2019s never been a more important time to do it, so come on down.\nLet me stop talking with that, because I\u2019m really anxious to hear (inaudible).\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda", "date": "August 11, 2022", "content": "\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, members of the press, good morning.\u00a0 I would like to start by welcoming Secretary Blinken and his delegation to Kigali.\u00a0 And this visit is an opportunity to enhance bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Rwanda and discuss matters of mutual interest.\nEarlier today, His Excellency the President of Rwanda received Secretary Blinken and his delegation.\u00a0 We had productive discussions about the partnership between our two countries.\u00a0 At the bilateral level, we appreciated our substantial cooperation in various sectors, including defense and security, trade and investment, peacekeeping, and health.\u00a0 The Government of Rwanda appreciates the significant support of the U.S. Government in the fight against COVID-19 in Rwanda, where the U.S. Government contributed more than 5 million doses of vaccines and 100 medical ventilators to Rwanda.\u00a0 The U.S. continues to be, indeed, a strong partner in Rwanda\u2019s efforts to build a strong and resilient health system.\nWe are also very pleased with our cooperation in the defense sector.\u00a0 Our military cooperation has continued to grow, and we were happy to co-host with the U.S. the 11th Annual African Air Chiefs Symposium earlier this year in Kigali.\nWe also discussed the security in eastern DRC, the very real consequences for Rwanda, and reaffirmed our support to regional efforts, including the Nairobi and the Luanda initiatives toward peace and stability in our region.\u00a0 We agreed on the need to eradicate all illegal armed groups operating in eastern DRC, including the FDLR and its factions.\u00a0 We noted the resurgence of hate speech, public incitement, and genocidal ideology in DRC, and the need to address this issue.\u00a0 We also reaffirmed the importance of respect of territorial integrity by all the countries in the region.\nAt the global level, this visit was an occasion to discuss the consequences of the war in Ukraine on Africa, and Rwanda in particular.\u00a0 We look forward to working with the U.S. Government on addressing the challenges we are facing in relation to the consequences of this conflict.\nOnce again, we are happy to host you, Secretary Blinken, and your delegation in Rwanda, and we look forward to continuing our work together and strengthening our partnership with the U.S.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Minister, thank you very much, and thank you for hosting our delegation today.\nA few days ago in South Africa, I set out our administration\u2019s new Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa, a strategy that recognizes African nations and peoples as equal and vital partners in advancing our shared priorities, tackling together global challenges, and being able to deliver for our citizens.\nYou see those same goals reflected in the relationship between Rwanda and the United States. \u00a0The journey that Rwanda has taken over the past two decades has been remarkable. \u00a0You\u2019ve risen from the ashes of genocide to become a global destination for innovation, for investment, for tourism. \u00a0You lead internationally on priorities that we share: making critical contributions to the United Nations and regional peacekeeping missions; speaking up for Ukraine\u2019s right to sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia\u2019s unprovoked and brutal invasion; co-sponsoring a resolution at the United Nations to start negotiations on a legally binding global agreement on plastic pollution \u2013 with scores of countries\u2019 support, including the United States.\nAnd our two countries have worked closely together on the issues that matter a great deal to Rwanda\u2019s future: improving the quality of your health care system; strengthening your agricultural production and food security; expanding economic opportunities; bolstering the education system, so that Rwandan youth are empowered to seize opportunities in the 21st century economy.\nIn partnership with COVAX, as the minister mentioned, the United States has donated more than five and a half million doses of safe and effective vaccines to Rwanda, which has helped the country vaccinate nearly 70 percent \u2013 fully vaccinate nearly 70 percent of its population.\nIn the last six years, we\u2019ve helped more than 2.8 million Rwandans get access to electricity for the first time \u2013 electricity generated using renewable energy.\nSo the relationship between our peoples is deep and diverse, as is evident in the collaboration between Rwandan and American nongovernmental organizations, students, entrepreneurs, doctors, and others.\nAs the foreign minister said, we just came from a meeting with President Kagame, where we covered a wide range of issues, including many of the ones that I\u2019ve just discussed. \u00a0I also raised issues where we have real concerns. \u00a0On those, our discussions were direct, candid, respectful. \u00a0The president candidly conveyed his views as well.\u00a0 I discussed the credible reports indicating that Rwanda continues to support the M23 rebel group and has its armed forces inside the DRC.\u00a0 We recognize that Rwanda has security concerns of its own, including reports of cooperation between the Congolese military and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, the DFLR, an armed group.\nMy message to both President Tshisekedi and President Kagame this week has been the same: any support or cooperation with any armed group in eastern DRC endangers local communities and regional stability. \u00a0And every country in the region must respect the territorial integrity of the others.\u00a0 The United States has the same message for all neighboring countries.\nWe\u2019ve seen where the failure to respect these principles can lead in the immeasurable consequences of the decades-long conflict in eastern DRC, which has taken the lives of more than 5 million people and displaced millions more.\nComing out of the discussions, both presidents have agreed to engage in direct talks with each other.\u00a0 They\u2019re both ready to resume the talks in the context of the Nairobi Process with armed groups, and both welcome the continued U.S. engagement in support of African-led mediation efforts.\nWe know that Rwandans are also alarmed \u2013 justifiably \u2013 by the increase in hate speech in the DRC targeting Rwandaphones. \u00a0The United States will continue to condemn such unacceptable and dangerous rhetoric, and I encouraged President Tshisekedi, his government, to do the same.\nLeaders in the region \u2013 particularly Kenya and Angola \u2013 are working hard to lower tensions and address the problem of armed groups in the eastern Congo. \u00a0We\u2019re deeply grateful for these efforts. \u00a0These initiatives are crucial for getting the actors to resolve their differences peacefully, through diplomacy rather than through violence, and to address the underlying drivers of the conflict.\nIn our discussions, I also raised serious concerns about human rights. \u00a0As I told President Kagame, we believe people in every country should be able to express their views without fear of intimidation, imprisonment, violence, or any other forms of repression. \u00a0That\u2019s true whether they are political opponents, human rights defenders, journalists like the ones in this audience, or simply citizens. \u00a0These are values cherished by the American people and people around the world; that\u2019s why I raised them, as have members of the U.S. Congress.\nI raised the case of Paul Rusesabagina, who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States, and underscored our concerns about the lack of fair trial guarantees provided to him.\nLater today, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to visit the Kigali Genocide Memorial. \u00a0It will provide a chance to reflect on the unimaginable horrors of the genocide, which reverberate to this day; to reaffirm the importance of standing up, rather than standing by, in the face of atrocities; and to ask ourselves what history teaches us about the need to prevent hatred and fear from taking hold again and squandering the progress the people of Rwanda have made since that time.\nWe have the deepest admiration for the people of Rwanda, their courage, their resilience, all that they have built. \u00a0And we hope the conversations we\u2019ve had today will help our partnership grow even stronger.\nFinally, Mr. Minister, if you would indulge me just a point of personal privilege, as we say back in the United States.\u00a0 One of the most important tools in our arsenal is the power of the spoken word \u2013 what we say both at home and on the world stage.\u00a0 In the past 18 months, our voice, my voice, has been shaped and sharpened by our chief speechwriter, Megan Rooney.\u00a0 I raise this now because Megan will soon be leaving the department.\u00a0 Others\u2019 gain is our profound loss, and that loss is especially pronounced when it comes to me.\u00a0 Not only is she a master wordsmith who can make what can sometimes be a dry policy soar, she\u2019s a wonderful person.\u00a0 Kind.\u00a0 Funny.\u00a0 Fun to be around.\u00a0 To put her in the vernacular, she brings a trademark\u00a0joie de vivre, which has been a light for me and our entire team, especially the case when we\u2019re traveling around the world.\nSo, Megan, thank you, thank you, thank you, and I\u2019ll end by saying that going forward should I happen to say something, I don\u2019t know, less than artful, we\u2019ll know why. Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you Minister, thank you Secretary Blinken. Now, we\u2019ll take a couple of questions now starting with RBA.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Isabelle Masozera from RBA.\u00a0 I have a question for both officials.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, the State Department has designated Paul Rusesabagina as wrongfully detained.\u00a0 What does this mean in this case?\u00a0 Also, we understand that you are unable to meet the victims of FLN attacks due to your tight schedule, but what would you say to the victims and their families?\nAnd also, to Minister Biruta, on the same issue \u2013 President Paul Kagame last night tweeted, saying there are things that just won\u2019t work here.\u00a0 Was this discussed this morning in the meeting, and what does the government plan to do about this issue of putting pressure on releasing Rusesabagina?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 We have been clear about our concerns related to Paul Rusesabagina\u2019s trial and conviction, particularly the lack of fair trial guarantees.\u00a0 We continue to urge the government to address our concerns about the legal protections afforded to him in his case and establish safeguards to prevent similar outcomes in the future.\u00a0 I had an opportunity to discuss this matter with President Kagame this morning.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to get into specifics, but we\u2019ll continue to engage on it.\u00a0 And I also had an opportunity just a few days ago to talk to Paul Rusesabagina\u2019s family, and we\u2019ll continue to be in contact with them as well.\u00a0 Thank you.\nOh, and I\u2019m sorry, the second part of your question.\u00a0 One of the most profound reasons that we are engaged in support of African-led mediation efforts in the eastern Congo as well as in other parts of the region is precisely because at the heart of everything is human suffering and real people, individuals, men, women, and children who are the victims of conflict, the victims of violence, the victim of armed groups of one kind or another.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very easy to get focused on big questions of policy, but what this comes down to is actual lives \u2013 real human lives.\u00a0 That\u2019s what motivates me.\u00a0 That\u2019s what motivates us to seek to help wherever we can resolve conflict, preserve peace, and give people a chance.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019ve seen far too many victims of violence and conflict, and that\u2019s why we have a strong incentive to do whatever we can to end it.\nI have opportunities wherever possible to meet with those who have been victimized by violence of one kind or another, who have been victimized by conflict, who have been victimized by a lack of opportunity that results from places and societies being in conflict.\u00a0 And if I don\u2019t have an opportunity with an individual group, I usually have a pretty good idea of their stories, what\u2019s happened to them.\u00a0 And that is the motivating factor for me every single day.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0\u00a0And listen, on the question about Rusesabagina, as far as the Government of Rwanda is concerned, Paul Rusesabagina is a Rwandan citizen.\u00a0 And he was arrested.\u00a0 He was tried and convicted along with 20 others \u2013 20 other accomplices for serious crimes they committed against Rwandan citizens and which he committed while residing in the United States.\u00a0 And this was done lawfully under both Rwandan and international laws.\u00a0 Therefore, Rwanda will continue to abide by our rules, and the decisions that were made by our judiciary.\u00a0 And we request our partners to respect Rwanda\u2019s sovereignty, Rwanda\u2019s laws, and its institutions.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I can state about your question on Rusesabagina.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, next question, Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m going to sit so I can read my questions so excuse me.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, as you mentioned in your opening remarks, there have been reports of \u2013 regarding harassment and arrest of domestic dissidents by the Rwandan Government along with reports of transnational aggression, including the use of spyware and alleged attacks against opponents in South Africa and Mozambique and elsewhere.\u00a0 Some members of the U.S. Congress are calling on the Biden administration to withhold foreign assistance and employ the Khashoggi Ban.\u00a0 At the same time, these messages have been made before U.S. officials.\u00a0 Did you hear anything today that indicates there will be a change in these actions?\nAnd going back to Paul Rusesabagina, now deemed as wrongfully detained, based on what I heard from the Foreign Minister, it doesn\u2019t seem like the Rwandan Government is prepared to release him.\u00a0 How do you believe this can be resolved?\u00a0 And do you believe this issue \u2013 along with the others I mentioned \u2013 will pose a threat to the two countries\u2019 ability to work together smoothly?\nAnd for you, Mr. Minister, what is your response to the allegations of domestic and transnational repression and to U.S. advocacy on these points?\u00a0 And what is your \u2013 how do you see the U.S. response to your government statements about Paul Rusesabagina\u2019s alleged actions?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Missy, thanks very much.\u00a0 First, let me start by saying this: we recognize Rwanda\u2019s incredibly difficult history, the 1994 genocide.\u00a0 And we know the ongoing legacy of that history of the genocide.\u00a0 But criminalization of some individual\u2019s participation in politics, harassment of those who express opposition to the current government, we believe underlie future peace, stability, and success \u2013 success which has already been extraordinary in the case of Rwanda over the last 20 plus years, but which will not reach its full potential if those who express disagreements \u2013 criticism of whatever the current government happens to be are repressed in their ability to do that whether that is here in Rwanda or abroad.\nAnd to that point, as you noted, we established what is called the Khashoggi Ban to make clear that any country that engages in repressive actions against those who criticize it, if those persons are in the United States, they face consequences for those actions.\nI\u2019ve shared all of this with President Kagame today.\u00a0 It\u2019s not for me to characterize his response, but these are concerns that I shared.\u00a0 And I did that, again, in the context of making clear our desire for an even stronger, even more productive relationship between the United States and Rwanda, building on what Rwanda has done so successfully, building on what we\u2019ve already done together.\u00a0 But these are issues that we care deeply about, our Congress cares deeply about, the American people care deeply about.\nI also shared with President Kagame that in many ways our own focus and motivation on these issues goes back to our very founding.\u00a0 It\u2019s maybe a little bit particular in some ways to the United States, but it\u2019s in our DNA.\u00a0 As you heard President Biden discuss, we come \u2013 we came together as a country, not around any particular group, any particular race, religion, ethnicity.\u00a0 We came together around an idea, a shared idea that all are created equal and that all are entitled to the same basic inalienable rights.\u00a0 And of course, we have never made fully good on that ideal.\u00a0 We\u2019re in constant search of it, constant efforts to form our own more perfect union, which is an acknowledgment that we\u2019re not perfect and this is a constant, ongoing effort.\u00a0 But we do it openly, we do it transparently, we deal with our challenges, as I think the world can see.\u00a0 And so by way of explanation as well why we care so deeply about what we believe to be universal rights, not simply those that pertain to Americans.\nAnd again, on the \u2013 on the matter and the case of Paul Rusesabagina, all I can share with you today is that I raised this with President Kagame.\u00a0 We had a discussion about it.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to, again, characterize that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to engage, and I\u2019ll also follow up with the family.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 When Rwanda deals with people who commit crimes against our country and our people, we abide by laws, both national and international.\u00a0 We know some other countries have their own method to deal with those kind of people, those criminals who commit crimes against their own countries.\u00a0 But as far as Rwanda is concerned, we do it along with, in respect of our laws, and in respect of international laws.\u00a0 Any other people could qualify these as international repression or whatever, but when we deal with people who commit crimes against our country, against our people, we abide by the laws, both national and international with total (inaudible).\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Our next question,\u00a0New Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 My name is Edwin Musoni from\u00a0The New Times.\u00a0 I\u2019ll ask the minister and the Secretary of State.\u00a0 Minister, a (inaudible) UN group of experts report indicated that the DRC army was supplying arms to FDLR, and it\u2019s also \u2013 it also indicated that the FDLR commander under that arrangement ordered the shelling of Rwandan territory in May.\nNow, this happens at a time when Rwanda is under pressure that it is allegedly supporting M23.\u00a0 What is your take on that, and how can Rwandans be assured of their security?\nMr. Secretary, now given \u2013 given the fact that FDLR gets support from the Congolese army, how does the U.S. expect Rwanda to protect its borders against any attacks that happen like what happened in May?\u00a0 And also at the same time, you cannot talk about FDLR without talking about the genocide.\u00a0 They are responsible for the genocide.\u00a0 Today, the United States remains the only country in the world that has deliberately refused to adopt the official definition of the genocide, the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.\u00a0 Now, what\u2019s the logic behind this deliberate stubbornness of the U.S. not adopting the genocide?\u00a0 Yet as you said you stand by Rwanda.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0\u00a0Rwanda is not the cause of longstanding instability in eastern DRC, where we have over 130 armed groups, including the M23.\u00a0 And the presence of the FDLR in the close collaboration with the army of the DRC has always been the most significant cause of insecurity.\u00a0 And this enables the FDLR to conduct terrorist operations on Rwandan territory, something the Government of Rwanda cannot accept.\u00a0 In Rwanda we always reserve the right to take necessary measures to protect its territorial integrity, its sovereignty, and to ensure the security of its people.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve said, Rwanda remains committed to the processes mandated by the African Union, and the other regional organization, which we hope the United States will continue to support for all of us to bring lasting peace to eastern DRC and to the entire region.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 There are very credible reports of support for armed groups by all sides, including the FDLR by Congolese forces and M23 by Rwandans.\u00a0 And our position is clear.\u00a0 Whoever it\u2019s by, whoever it\u2019s to \u2013 that support needs to cease for any \u2013 any armed group.\nWhen it comes to the FDLR, it has sought to conduct attacks on Rwanda and it\u2019s supported hateful ideologies.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen support, as I said \u2013 we\u2019ve seen reports of cooperation between Congolese forces and the FDLR.\u00a0 I raised this directly with the president in the Congo, and we are pressing again for that support to cease, just as we\u2019re pressing for any support to M23 to cease.\nThese groups need to end the violence, demobilize, and pursue talks with the government.\u00a0 And as I noted, both leaders \u2013 here in Rwanda and in the Congo \u2013 made clear to me that they\u2019re prepared to engage in talks with the various armed factions as necessary in order to pursue their demobilization in the context of the process led by President Kenyatta and others, the Nairobi process.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to support that.\nAnd when it comes to recognition of the genocide and the horrors committed, we\u2019ve been very clear about that.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have an opportunity to visit the memorial in just a few hours and to continuously take note, to take account of the almost unfathomable suffering of so many people that remains present in people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to work at the United Nations for every appropriate recognition of history, even as we do everything possible every single day to make sure that that history is never repeated.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Final question from (inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Following up on that same issue, Mr. Secretary, you mentioned your conversations with both the president of Rwanda and of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\u00a0 And in Congo, you heard many complaints about the violence in eastern Congo and the support of Rwanda supposedly for some of the armed groups to the extent that they demanded sanctions be imposed against Rwanda.\u00a0 And yet here, you probably heard a certain amount of popular support for the M\u00a0deux trois\u00a0group.\u00a0 So how do you reconcile those two very disparate positions in your quest for negotiations as you described?\u00a0 Did you specifically ask President Kagame to end the support for M23?\u00a0 And then finally, do you now put the M23 and the FDLR on the same ground?\u00a0 It seems like they\u2019re almost making a \u2013 an equivalency between the two.\u00a0 So I\u2019m interested about that.\nAnd then Mr. Minister, the U.S. Government is asking you to end support for M23.\u00a0 How do you respond to that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So it\u2019s a matter of principle that applies equally.\u00a0 This is not a question of weighing one group against another.\u00a0 There\u2019s a basic principle that there should not be support coming from governments or coming from their entities like their armed forces for arming groups like \u2013 non-state groups like M23 or like FDLR.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a basic principle, because to the extent that that happens, that\u2019s likely to perpetuate conflict and violence, not end it.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t suggest one way or another equivalence between groups or some valuation, but the basic principle is very important and it\u2019s very important here.\u00a0 And yes, I specifically raised that with President Kagame just as I raised it with President Tshisekedi\u00a0in the DRC.\nWe also raised another principle, which is the territorial integrity of states and the need to protect that.\u00a0 And we also raised another principle, which is that leaders have a responsibility to speak out against hate speech \u2013 something that we\u2019ve seen, unfortunately, increasingly in recent months with regard to the Congo, and in particular, directed at certain communities, including Rwandaphones, and directed at the UN and its mission there.\nSo this is something that I raised in both \u2013 both meetings with both leaders.\u00a0 And the question, of course, is now turning principle into practice, and that\u2019s what we talked about.\u00a0 And the best way to do that, in our judgment, is to pursue the African-led mediation efforts through the Nairobi process.\u00a0 President Kenyatta has now been designated by the East African Community to carry on that mission, even when he is no longer in office as president of Kenya.\u00a0 President Louren\u00e7o from Angola is also very engaged.\u00a0 And what we heard from both presidents is their appreciation for our own efforts, the United States efforts to support that African-led mediation effort.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to do that just as we\u2019ve been doing in the months leading up to this visit.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0\u00a0Whatever Government of Rwanda could do in DRC or in our region would be about protecting our people and protecting the territorial integrity of our country and its sovereignty.\u00a0 It is not about supporting M23.\u00a0 And if we want a lasting solution for the problems in eastern DRC, in our region, we just need to deal with the root causes of the problem, which is the presence and the preservation of the FDLR, the FDLR in eastern DRC and their cooperation with FRDC.\u00a0 Let me remind you that they have together, jointly they have shelled the Rwandan territory three times \u2013 on 18th March, on 27 May, on \u2013 and on 10th June.\u00a0 And we have always warned the Government of DRC \u2013 we ask them to stop those attacks.\u00a0 And if we need to get a lasting solution, we should go to the root causes of the problems, which is the genocide they acknowledge being spread in our region from \u2013 the genocide which took place here in 1994 \u2013 and the preservation of the FDLR, which is a genocidal force.\nAnd there are mechanism in place, the original mechanism which were agreed on by the African Union, by the East African Community, by the ICJR, and we just need to go to those mechanism (inaudible) us with them, and you permit them.\u00a0 And we find solutions to the existing political issues in DRC, and hopefully we achieve peace for all of us.\u00a0 Eastern DRC \u2013 DRC needs peace, but we also need peace for us to develop our countries.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you, Minister.\u00a0 Thank you much \u2013 thank you very much, everybody.

Tshilombo suggested to conduct an official visit to DRC, and you accepted the suggestion, the proposal.\u00a0 And on June 2nd of last year, during our meeting in our cabinets, the Department of State in Washington, then after the decision of the chiefs of states, we communicated officially the invitation of the government of my country and to actually accept that visit.\u00a0 And you told us, dear Antony, that you will come to DRC before the end of this year.\u00a0 And given words and taken words (inaudible).\nSo this is evidence of the interests United States has to DRC to willing \u2013 the will of its leaders to develop with our country a cooperation and partnership, strategic partnership, and fruitful for American people and Congolese people.\u00a0 Thank you very much for keeping your words, and thank you very much for this interest, and this will confirm today officially.\u00a0 So we ensure that the chief of state, His Excellency Felix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo are in the same dispositions of mind or of state of mind.\nLadies and gentlemen of the press, it\u2019s based on this, on political will shared, to advance our old friendship that resists to the time and different challenges that we\u2019ve faced throughout history, whatever they have been.\u00a0 And it\u2019s on \u2013\u00a0 it\u2019s based on this and still based on it that have been marked by determination of the United States and of DRC to consolidate their partnership in a period that you actually know which is really, really turbulent.\u00a0 And either in the international level or on the eastern side of the country, always in trouble, facing challenges with terrorists and an armed group that is \u2013 are killing our populations since two decades ago now.\nAnd it\u2019s based on this that we have exchanged and discussed bilaterally with the delegation, the American delegation, conducted by the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and exchanging \u2013 exchanged on common interests, particularly in the following fields:\u00a0 defense and security, focusing on security in the eastern side of the Congo, and military cooperations, finance and economy, precisely regarding the program of reform \u2013 economic reforms and foreign investment of the government, and the exploitation of natural resources industries.\u00a0 We also exchanged on environment, mining, and democracy.\nAnd based on all those materials, we have exchanged our analysis to develop a common understanding.\u00a0 And more importantly, we have underlined new perspectives based on the reciprocal engagements.\u00a0 And the hardest part remains to come, is yet to come.\u00a0 And the main challenge that we are facing is actually on the implementation \u2013 the implementation of these new perspectives and this involvement in order to give real content to \u2013 tangible content to our cooperation or friendship, but also a content \u2013 a profitable content to Congolese and Americans, and that will give legitimacy to democracy and the fate and the well-being that you actually know in Democratic Republic of Congo, the ultimate goal, the outcomes of all political actions.\nAnd on his part, Mr. Secretary of State, DRC will make biggest effort to honor his engagement and involvement, and I say it on the behalf of the chief of government that DRC has not \u2013 doesn\u2019t have any reason, objective reason, to not believe that it will be \u2013 it will be likewise on behalf of Americans\u2019 government.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Dear Minister, dear Christophe, I\u2019m happy to meet with you and to be in Kinshasa, and I would like to thank you and thank your President Tshisekedi for this very deep and productive meeting that we just had about an hour ago.\nIf you may, allow me to continue in English.\nGood afternoon.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 And just to repeat, it is a real pleasure to be here in Kinshasa.\u00a0 This is my first visit as Secretary of State.\u00a0 And as my friend Christophe said, I\u2019m following up on a very kind invitation from the president and from the foreign minister, and now we\u2019re here and very pleased to be so.\u00a0 I again want to thank the president, the foreign minister, the entire team for the excellent conversations that we had this afternoon.\u00a0 I was able to spend some time just one-on-one with the president.\u00a0 The teams got together, and I think the fact that we have a very strong delegation here and we were able to spend time with our counterparts reflects the strength \u2013 the growing strength of the partnership between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United States.\nThe DRC is central to pursuit of peace and prosperity in Africa and beyond.\u00a0 Your commitment to democracy will shape not only your future but the region\u2019s as well: the fight against corruption and the promotion of transparency, for example in the mining sector, these are critical to regional stability.\u00a0 The Congo\u2019s stewardship of its part of the Congo Basin, the rainforest, one of the largest on Earth, is vital to dealing with the climate crisis.\u00a0 Your response to infectious disease protects people beyond your borders as well as within them.\u00a0 In short, what happens here is felt in many places.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the work that our countries do together is so important.\nToday, we had a chance, as the foreign minister said, to discuss a broad range of issues, to include our efforts \u2013 shared efforts to bring peace to the eastern DRC, our support for free, fair, and on-time elections next year, efforts to promote respect for human rights, to protect the environment, to promote clean energy, to improve the investment climate, to strengthen food security \u2013 all critical steps for the DRC to become the anchor of stability and prosperity that it can become.\u00a0 And in these efforts, the United States is your steadfast partner.\nYesterday in South Africa, I had a chance to speak about what being a partner to countries across Africa actually means to us.\u00a0 And as I said \u2013 but it\u2019s worth repeating \u2013 too often African nations have been treated as instruments of other nations\u2019 progress rather than as authors of their own progress.\u00a0 Resources have been exploited for other countries\u2019 gains.\u00a0 People of the DRC know this all too well.\u00a0 That is not what the United States will do.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want a one-sided transactional relationship.\u00a0 Instead, we want to work with you on shared priorities in pursuit of shared goals.\nOne of those goals is strengthening democracy.\u00a0 And we discussed reforms that reflect the will and aspirations of the Congolese people, including, as I said, preparations for next year\u2019s free, fair, and on-time elections.\nThe DRC was a strong participant in the Summit for Democracy last year.\u00a0 The work that\u2019s already been done here to advance the rule of law, good governance, citizen participation, and human rights is commendable, but there\u2019s more to do and I know that the DRC is committed to going forward.\u00a0 To reduce the allure of joining armed groups, the young people of the DRC must see that there is a true path forward, a better path, a brighter future.\nOn the situation in the eastern DRC, we share a strong desire here \u2013 and that of so many people across the region and beyond \u2013 for the violence and suffering there to end at long last.\u00a0 As we discussed, an enduring peace will require a political solution that respects the DRC\u2019s sovereignty and its territorial integrity.\u00a0 To that end, the United States strongly supports the mediation efforts led by Angola and Kenya, and we urge continued cooperation with the UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO and agree on the importance of its mandate to protect civilians.\u00a0 And we fully endorse the pursuit of dialogue and cooperation between the DRC and its neighbors.\u00a0 I intend to build on our discussions when I visit Rwanda tomorrow.\nOn climate, the Democratic Republic of Congo is vital to the future of the planet.\u00a0 It\u2019s as simple as that.\u00a0 The Congo Basin rainforest absorbs more carbon than is emitted by the entire continent of Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s a place of tremendous biodiversity.\u00a0 Its rainfall helps sustain agriculture across the region.\nWe appreciate the short-term economic challenges confronting the Congo \u2013 the challenges facing countries all over the world, including the United States.\u00a0 We agreed to work together to establish a formal working group to help Congolese achieve a balanced approach to responsible development of the country\u2019s resources that contributes to Congo\u2019s economic growth and to generating jobs.\u00a0 By conserving irreplaceable forests and other ecosystems and by undertaking development projects only after carrying out rigorous environmental impact assessments, the DRC can act on behalf of all the world\u2019s people to protect our shared home.\nWe talked about reforms to the mining sector.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to work together to ensure that investments in the DRC support best practices, that companies are engaged in a race to the top on environmental protections, labor rights, good governance, and transparency, not a race to the bottom that ends up hurting workers, hurting the environment, fueling armed conflict.\nAnd on food security we\u2019re very pleased that the DRC joined the Feed the Future program this summer.\u00a0 This is a flagship program for the United States.\u00a0 And even as we respond to some immediate humanitarian challenges and the crisis that has been created in food insecurity as a result of climate, of COVID, of conflict \u2013 Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine \u2013 we\u2019re also very focused on working in partnership with countries around the world to invest in sustainable, resilient food production for the long term.\u00a0 That\u2019s what Feed the Future is all about, and we\u2019re very pleased that the DRC is a part of that.\nAt a moment when COVID-19, climate change, and conflict are all doing their part, as I said, to intensify food insecurity, it\u2019s more important than ever that we tackle the root causes of hunger, poverty, and malnutrition, and we do it together.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking forward to working closely with the DRC on this in the months ahead.\nThe United States is committed to this partnership.\u00a0 We see tremendous potential for us to do more together to advance stability, opportunity, democracy, health, and security for the people of Congo, our people, people in many other countries and regions whose lives will be shaped in part by your success and by your progress.\nSo that\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to Kinshasa, and why, again, I\u2019m so pleased to be here.\u00a0 And Christophe, thank you very much for your hospitality and for the very good meetings we\u2019ve had so far.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you, Excellencies, for your respective opening remarks and (inaudible) conference of press, and I\u2019ll associate my dear fellow also be conveyed or invited to give (inaudible) interventions, and there will actually be four interventions on the side of media, two from the American side and two others from the Congolese side.\u00a0 And I would then invite my colleague to choose two reporters that are ready for the questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Tracy Wilkinson,\u00a0LA Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, you just mentioned that you will be raising the issue of the violence in eastern Congo tomorrow when you are in Rwanda.\u00a0 Will you be raising allegations that Rwanda is, in fact, backing the militias that have been attacking civilians in Congo?\u00a0 Do you \u2013 does your government concur with the United Nations report that makes those allegations and seems to substantiate them?\nAnd finally, here in Congo there is a public clamor for the United States to do more and help with this issue, to the extent that there are some people who believe that the United States is sort of turning a blind eye to this issue.\u00a0 How do you respond to that?\nAnd Mr. Minister, have you received assurances from the Secretary that he will seriously raise this issue of Rwanda\u2019s support for the militias?\u00a0 And do you have confidence that that\u2019s going to help?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re certainly not turning a blind eye.\u00a0 In fact, I\u2019m here.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to Rwanda tomorrow, and a big focus of this trip \u2013 but not just this trip, the work that we\u2019re doing day in, day out \u2013 is to make sure the United States is doing everything it can to support the very important African-led mediation efforts, particularly processes that are being led by Kenya and Angola, to bring peace, security, and stability to the eastern Congo.\nWe are not only following this very closely and carefully, we\u2019re engaged on it.\u00a0 And I had the opportunity to speak at length to the minister about this a couple months ago in Washington.\u00a0 Of course, it was a focus of my conversation with the president today.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be a focus of the conversation with President Kagame when we\u2019re in Rwanda.\nWe are very concerned by credible reports that Rwanda has provided support to M23.\u00a0 We call on all parties in the region to stop any support or cooperation with M23 or, for that matter, any other non-state armed group.\u00a0 That is essential to actually bringing peace and security to the region.\u00a0 And we urge the groups themselves \u2013 M23, all non-state armed groups operating in the eastern DRC \u2013 to cease violence, to demilitarize, to pursue talks, as necessary, with the government.\nLet me simply add that all countries have to respect their neighbors\u2019 territorial integrity.\u00a0 This is a proposition that we take very seriously around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent some time talking about that when it comes to Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s equally important here.\u00a0 Any entry of foreign forces into the DRC must be done transparently, with the consent of the DRC, de-conflicted from the UN mission, and pre-notified to the Security Council, consistent with the UN resolution.\nSo to circle back to where you were, this is a front and center, part of the reason I\u2019m here, as well as deepening and expanding the broader partnership that we have with the DRC on the issues that the minister and I talked about.\nVICE PRIME MINISTER LUTUNDULA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) (In progress) regarding to what the Secretary of State just said.\u00a0 So I want to \u2013 also to remind you in reality the United States was \u2013 were our first \u2013 the first country to care about the presence and to support of Rwanda to the M23.\u00a0 And remember that the declaration that has been delivered by the representative, diplomatic representative of United States in Kinshasa, and initiated the talk or discussion with the representative of member-states\u2019 ambassadors and the Secretary (inaudible).\u00a0 And the embassy was expressing its \u2013 the appreciation of the United States regarding to this information that we have received.\nSo I followed today the interview of the Secretary of State.\u00a0 I think it was (inaudible) from Johannesburg.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t hide it at all, the way Americans perceive the issue, and he said it himself that it\u2019s thematic, in fact, that will it be discussed, and he\u2019s done well to state it again.\u00a0 He said he would talk about it in bilateral meeting.\u00a0 And as I say, there is no reason not to believe to what the Secretary of State said, and more again because it\u2019s the truth.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Next question, American side.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Edward Wong,\u00a0New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Minister, last year, the \u2013 your government pledged to help protect the rainforest resources here in the DRC, but your call for companies to step forward on \u2013 and bid for up to 30 blocks of rainforest land to do energy extraction from there seems to undermine the pledge from the government.\u00a0 How do you address the criticism of that?\u00a0 And what would you say to the international organizations and donors that stepped forward to support your pledge when it was made?\nAnd Mr. Secretary, the DRC has made the argument that it needs the revenue from this energy to help bring its citizens out of poverty and to get its economic engine going. You mentioned that yourself and acknowledged that.\u00a0 You said that you were forming a working group.\u00a0 Are there any concrete plans or proposals related to trade or economics that you\u2019re putting forward to the DRC to try and stem this auction that they\u2019ve called for?\u00a0 Thank you.\nVICE PRIME MINISTER LUTUNDULA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) So our commitment to protect, as I said, the biodiversity and to ensure \u2013 I want to assure everybody here that we will stay firm regarding to the commitment and we\u2019re not going to settle (inaudible).\u00a0 So the call for the \u2013 I think which is (inaudible) 27 petroleum blocks and gas blocks (inaudible) recissions.\u00a0 So the first one we\u2019re not selling them.\u00a0 There are concessions that will be (inaudible).\u00a0 We\u2019re not selling the public auction ones.\nSo the second is generally we\u2019re protecting the ecosystem for the well-being for mankind.\u00a0 That mean (inaudible) here to eat, to enjoy, to heat \u2013 heat electricity, water, and so forth.\u00a0 So today, DRC finds paradox that\u2019s \u2013 conduct as to \u2013 the DRC is \u2013 is rich, is a wealthy country, but with a very poor population.\u00a0 But the challenge is to find an equilibrium, a balance between the well-being of Congolese people and also the necessity to guarantee the \u2013 a framework, a development framework, an ecological framework (inaudible).\nAnd what we have done is exactly to make sure that the nature in (inaudible) as is wealth in our country to protect it without \u2013 preventing the destructions.\u00a0 But as you know, we know that there are some countries that are exploiting DRC\u2019s riches as for \u2013 since years now and not respecting at all the biodiversity.\u00a0 And so what we are trying to do is not to damage the ecosystem.\u00a0 So they\u2019re in Africa, in Europe, and so on.\nSo what is important for us is that \u2013 it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about.\u00a0 What we talked about with the American delegation is that whoever has the technology, I mean, that we need to do a lot \u2013 to save and secure our ecological system, the ecosystem, are welcome in our country.\u00a0 We\u2019re counting on (inaudible) capacities, technology capacities of countries like United States (inaudible) and so on to actually help us securing nature diversity and biodiversity.\u00a0 This is how we conceive or perceive the issue and certainly did in conditional \u2013 in the standards that we\u2019re going to establish in (inaudible) over \u2013 it won\u2019t be \u2013 it\u2019s enterprises that will come to exploit the resources we not allow them to kill, to destroy the nature.\u00a0 But what we\u2019re doing is to put the nature into the service of the human Congolese people and humanity entire.\nSo this is what I wanted to say, and once more I was satisfied to the same \u2013 the same understanding \u2013 to share the same understanding with the Secretary of State, and then we are also happy that we\u2019re going to work together.\u00a0 And I also seize the opportunity to say that United States and DRC will quickly set a working group on climate change and which going to be our consultation framework where we share a common interest.\u00a0 And that\u2019s also a guarantee, a structure that is going to help us to (inaudible) necessity to see Congolese people profiting from this.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And just to follow up on the minister, President Tshisekedi very eloquently talked about Congo as a solution country when it comes to climate change, when it comes to protecting the environment, conserving and protecting the Congo Basin, the rainforest in particular.\u00a0 DRC is home to vast forests and peatlands, and this is a critical habitat for plants, wildlife, and it\u2019s crucial for us to avoiding climate catastrophe.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a strong track record of leadership on conservation and climate as part of our relationship.\u00a0 Back at COP26, the world made a collective pledge, $1.5 billion, to support the Congo Basin\u2019s forest.\nSo in that context, we had concerns about the announcement of the auction of these oil and gas exploration blocks.\u00a0 Some of the blocks infringe on sensitive rainforest and peatland areas, including in the Virunga National Park and Salonga National Park.\nBut what you just heard from the foreign minister is exactly what the president said to me: a commitment to make sure that DRC is a solution country when it comes to protecting the environment and combating climate change, and in particular to make sure that everything contemplated will proceed \u2013 or not proceed, I should say \u2013 in the absence of full environmental impact assessments and studies and making sure that any development that is done is not done in a way that harms the environment or that undermines the important role that DRC plays in combating climate change.\nBut to that end, as the minister said, as I noted earlier, we agreed today to form a working group on this issue.\u00a0 Because as the minister said, here\u2019s the challenge:\u00a0 The DRC needs additional resources, support, financing in order to do what is necessary to fully protect the rainforest and the peatlands, which are already under tremendous challenge, irrespective of any energy exploration or exploitation.\u00a0 We see deforestation that\u2019s already taking place; we see a challenge to the resources that are already there.\u00a0 And the government wants to be able to act on that.\u00a0 But it needs assistance, it needs help to do that.\nThat\u2019s exactly the commitment that was made by countries around the world at COP26.\u00a0 So what we want to do is now get together and work this very closely together to make sure that on the one hand these resources are being protected and that what\u2019s irreplaceable is not damaged, but at the same time that the necessary support is there for the DRC to do the work that it needs to do to preserve the rainforest, the peatlands, and to create opportunity for its people.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Excellencies.\u00a0 And now we are going to submit our (inaudible) question.\u00a0 We\u2019ll begin with Madam Tudieshe of VOA.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\u00a0 Mr. Blinken, would you prefer me to ask the question in English or in French?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Either way.\u00a0 (inaudible)\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good morning, Mr. Blinken, (inaudible).\u00a0 Secretary of State, you are visiting for the first time the biggest countries of \u2013 French-speaking countries in Africa, and you\u2019re staying 24 hours.\u00a0 And it seems that you are staying \u2013 you stayed \u2013 you will stay is twice this time, like 24 hours, 48 hours, in Rwanda.\u00a0 So do you understand that the short stay that \u2013 in DRC is not really appreciated as we wished in DRC?\nAnd to you, Mr. Lutundula, you have been a star in social medias in Congo and abroad, and when you are intervene at the Security Council of UN you made last May.\u00a0 And meanwhile, there were this UN report that explained clearly that Rwanda was still behind M23.\u00a0 So we \u2013 our (inaudible) has been established in the (inaudible) regarding the (inaudible) are clear in the rest of the world, and stand and say what\u2019s come of this and been talked about decades ago.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (In French.)\nIn fact, just for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m spending pretty much the same amount of time in the DRC as I am in Rwanda, and we\u2019re here for \u2013 I wish we could be here longer.\u00a0 But we\u2019re here for about 24 hours; we\u2019ll be in Rwanda for about 24 hours.\u00a0 So if we\u2019re comparing schedules, it\u2019s pretty much the same thing.\nBut what is most important is the work that we\u2019ve gotten done today, we\u2019ll continue to get done tomorrow between the United States and the DRC, and both of us have talked about it.\u00a0 There is an extraordinary breadth as well as depth to the work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 It covers numerous issues of concern to the people in both of our countries, the region, and the world.\nAnd while the focus of this trip is eastern Congo and the United States doing what it can to support efforts to mediate and prevent a crisis from erupting, as we both discussed, there was a lot more that we talked about today and that we\u2019re working on together today, including work that we\u2019re doing together to combat climate change, to provide economic opportunity here in the DRC, to deal with the food insecurity crisis, to pursue democratic reforms, and many other things that we talked about.\nSo I would simply invite you to look at everything that the minister set out as part of our agenda today as evidence of the breadth and depth of this partnership and the commitment that we both have to growing it even stronger in the months and years ahead.\nVICE PRIME MINISTER LUTUNDULA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) (In progress) talked about the (inaudible) so we do not (inaudible).\u00a0 So as you know in this field and in \u2013 as it in other fields, the responsibilities are not claimed (inaudible).\u00a0 They \u2013 we prove them, but we don\u2019t claim them.\u00a0 So to prove them, so there are some trust issues (inaudible) state of (inaudible) that state of (inaudible) is some pillars over construction of Democratic State of Congo, is authority the chief of states (inaudible).\u00a0 And then all that\u2019s can support to establish this enforcement the goal is to identify the other, as we\u2019ve said previously to our neighbor, that whoever is going to be caught with being in a lie over those M23 armed forces will be, and the persons haven\u2019t (inaudible).\u00a0 So the sanction will fall in compliance with what\u2019s (inaudible).\u00a0 The work has to be conducted on the level \u2013 at a level of the ones who have the responsibilities of DRC, the DRC like military \u2013 the army and the justice (inaudible) \u2013 and will have sanctions for them.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I would to invite Mr. Jacques Kini of Univers TV to ask his question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 The first question is addressed to Mr. Blinken.\u00a0 Mr. Blinken, (inaudible) yesterday morning in South Africa (inaudible) you\u2019re worrying about a possible advance in the conflict in Rwanda.\u00a0 And of course, the \u2013 because of the war caused by the M23 you tried to reduce, mitigate the conflict.\u00a0 So I want to know how the United States want to make it into a good decision between DRC and Rwanda.\nMy second question is addressed to Vice Prime Minister Mr. Lutundula.\u00a0 (Inaudible) of DRC, as stated, are established, but what are DRC (inaudible) of Rwanda in supporting M23 (inaudible)?\u00a0 Where is DRC regarding United Nations and also to \u2013 regarding all the war materials?\u00a0 And the second question is: Are we going to expect acknowledge from the United States as \u2013 as they stated, the inventory is terrorism problem.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, thank you.\u00a0 As I noted earlier, the big focus of my visit here and then tomorrow\u2019s visit to Rwanda is to support the important medication efforts that are already underway \u2013 African-led \u2013 to try to stop conflict, violence in the eastern DRC.\u00a0 And this is an opportunity for me, of course, to speak directly with the president, with the foreign minister.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have the same opportunity with President Kagame in Rwanda.\u00a0 And our focus right now is on supporting the efforts that are underway, notably by Angola and Kenya, to bring this challenge to an end, to cease violence and demobilize armed group, to pursue talks as well.\nSo I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself any further because I\u2019ll have an opportunity to pursue this as well in conversations with the Rwandan Government over the next 24 hours.\u00a0 But we\u2019re in very regular contact about this.\u00a0 I\u2019m in very regular contact as well with partners in Africa, to include the Kenyans, the Angolans.\u00a0 And our hope is to do whatever we can in support of these mediation efforts to prevent further violence, to end conflict, to preserve the territorial integrity of the DRC as we do it.\nVICE PRIME MINISTER LUTUNDULA:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) (In progress) the report of the experts group proved that the support of Rwanda to M23 and the presence of its military on Congo soil.\u00a0 I think that we have to acknowledge that diplomacy for peace, for cooperations, and friendship between people that President Tshisekedi is conducting since his (inaudible) is moving forward and bearing fruit.\u00a0 It\u2019s obviously the \u2013 it\u2019s obviously the (inaudible) can notice\u00a0 (inaudible) where we have \u2013 is conducted so far by the President Tshisekedi.\nAnd today, the problem that reports \u2013 that we highlight in the report that we want \u2013 need to be examined by the Council of Security.\u00a0 In Congo we have an unfortunate experience.\u00a0 The mapping reports that has been submitted, I think, about 10 years ago now, hasn\u2019t been examined.\u00a0 They were talking about it, and we did not know at last what we\u2019re going to do with it one day.\u00a0 So we\u2019re asking and (inaudible) that the Security Council firstly publish the report as it is integrally and then examine it.\u00a0 And then we have written yesterday to the president of Security Council.\u00a0 The letter has been sent, delivered yesterday.\u00a0 And today, we received the commission\u2019s \u2013 African Commission.\nSo the Government of Republic of Congo under the authority of (inaudible) has started this exam, examination of this report and its contributions.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important \u2013 its contribution by all the (inaudible) bilateral and multilateral in order to remove (inaudible) of greater share that are created deliberately, and find a solution, a sustainable solution.\u00a0 This means that the report is actually the diagnosis that will allow us to find medicines that we need.\nSo of course, it\u2019s a big issue that \u2013 of course, the resolution that have been voted lately didn\u2019t please everybody.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also true that we have technology that we could at least try to manage the issue in order that some kind of weapons that are no longer used.\u00a0 So it\u2019s an \u2013 I can say an improvement, but the real \u2013 the challenge is still real, still effective.\u00a0 So it is that there\u2019s a suspicion on DRC that\u2019s made that the trust \u2013 the convenience, banks, and even (inaudible) that we can legally to (inaudible) and to buy weapons.\u00a0 We do not do it because at level of United States and the Security Council, we are on the blacklists.\u00a0 We are blacklisted and it\u2019s not a small thing.\nSo we can see the (inaudible) of the republic is (inaudible) and we continue to insist to our partners like United States, who is with us all the time, and in order to remove this barriers, in order to be completely clean, in order to allow this to become \u2013 to start building a powerful defense system and also to equip us with instruments, defense equipment through our army.\nSo the folder is still open.\u00a0 The issue is open.\u00a0 So can we expect that the United States acknowledge the M23 as a terrorist group \u2013 is that the question?\u00a0 I hope \u2013 it\u2019s not to me that you need to ask.\u00a0 I cannot respond to that question.\u00a0 But what I know, I can \u2013 I will say it.\u00a0 The first country before the global coalition\u2019s (inaudible) acknowledges at Marrakesh, where we have participated to a session to that organization to which we belong, the United States and \u2013 let me say are the first to acknowledge and tell to the world that there is \u2013 how can I say it \u2013 cancer, I can say cancer test, cancer disease kind of in DRC, on the eastern side of DRC.\nSo I think the United States will really take it in consideration.\u00a0 So this is what I can tell \u2013 I can tell you regarding \u2013 to your questions.\u00a0 So we\u2019re trying to make sure that every \u2013 our partners understand that M23 are not difference to terrorist movement.\u00a0 So still on that point, you can bet on the \u2013 you can watch the conversion of the African Union, I think it was, of 2002.\u00a0 That conference classify M23 as a terrorist group and it\u2019s inside of our country.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what I can say.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) So Excellencies, on the behalf of all the media here present, we thank you for your availability, and good evening to you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-a-jazz-cultural-event/", "title":

We have spent most of the day speaking, and so I don\u2019t really think we need to say more except to confirm that we\u2019ve had extensive and excellent deliberations on a wide range of issues, some of which I\u2019m sure will form the substance of the questions that you wish to pose.\u00a0 We\u2019ve confirmed the good standing of the relationship between South Africa and the United States of America.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very extensive partnership in which we cooperate in a wide range of sectors.\u00a0 We had reports from four commissions that are part of our bilateral strategic structure.\nWe should have this kind of political dialogue on a regular basis, but we\u2019ve had a hiatus for almost eight years.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve agreed that this is going to be a \u2013 an interaction that takes place on a regular basis.\u00a0 I have had many opportunities to hold meetings and discussions with Secretary Blinken, and I\u2019ve always found him open to listening and to sharing perspective on various world affairs.\u00a0 So having said that, I\u2019ll now hand over to him.\nSecretary Blinken, over to you, and then I think we should allow the (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Naledi, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 I may slightly abuse the privilege of having a captive audience in saying\u00a0a few\u00a0things, starting with the fact that it\u2019s just an honor and a pleasure to be with you, to be here in Pretoria.\u00a0\u00a0We have a joint vision, a\u00a0Strategic Dialogue to get together, and I would just underscore there were nearly 50 officials and experts from across the U.S. Government, and that really is a testament to our commitment to the partnership between South Africa and the United States.\u00a0 And I\u2019m also extremely pleased to be joined today by our ambassador-designate to South Africa, Reuben Brigety, who arrived at his new post just in time for this visit and will be presenting his credentials to the president very soon.\nI think for so many Americans \u2013 and I include myself among them \u2013 South Africa holds a special place in our hearts.\u00a0 I was last here in 2013 with President Obama, and I remember still his words about how South Africa and the United States have been bound together throughout our history, how the freedom fighters of our Civil Rights Movement back in the United States inspired those fighting for freedom and equality here in South Africa, and how the movement against Apartheid here in turn inspired a generation of activists in the United States and well beyond.\nAnd I had a chance to reflect on that a little bit yesterday \u2013 those of you who were with us at the Hector Pieterson Museum in Soweto honoring the 12-year-old boy who was killed by police in 1976 during anti-Apartheid protests.\u00a0 His remarkable sister, Antoinette, met us at the museum, and one of the things she talked to me about was how badly her brother wanted an education for himself, for her, for all the children in the community.\u00a0 Hector and others valued something every child everywhere is entitled to.\u00a0 That profound wrong galvanized global action in support of justice and equality \u2013 another demonstration of how what happens in South Africa reverberates well beyond South Africa, indeed around the world.\nAnd still today, as two great constitutional democracies, our countries face the challenge of ensuring that all of our people can participate fully and freely in our political systems and have equal access to justice and economic opportunity.\u00a0 Here too, I think our countries can learn from each other and I hope make progress together.\nToday, South Africa is a leading global voice on global health, the climate crisis, democracy, security, so much else.\u00a0 The South African economy is renowned for its cutting-edge tech sector, for pioneering work in medicine.\u00a0 A very vibrant press is ranked as one of the freest in the world.\u00a0 Cultural contributions are vast.\u00a0 Universities draw students from pretty much everywhere.\u00a0 In short, what happens here and the reason we\u2019re here is because what happens in South Africa really does shape the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so committed to this partnership, because fundamentally we believe that together we can deliver more progress for the people of our two countries and many others across a whole range of issues that matter most to their lives and their futures.\nSo we had the Strategic Dialogue this morning, and I won\u2019t go through it in detail.\u00a0 We talked a little bit about it with all of you present at the start.\u00a0 I think you know that it covers the four areas that President Ramaphosa and President Biden laid out after their conversation earlier this year \u2013 \u00a0\u00a0health, climate, infrastructure, trade \u2013 issues that are critical to the well-being of our countries, to their security, to the strength of our economies, but especially to the well-being of our people.\u00a0 So a number of things came out of this that I know we will put out and summarize in each of these areas, so I won\u2019t belabor that for today.\nBut I think what\u2019s so important is we agreed not only to shared approaches on a number of issues but also to concrete steps that we are going to take to deepen our cooperation.\u00a0 And the foreign minister and I talked about the importance not only of trying to forge a shared perspective, but actually implementing what we say and holding ourselves accountable to the progress that we\u2019ve agreed to make.\nSo I think that\u2019s the most important thing coming out of today.\u00a0 Let me just add quickly that beyond our bilateral relationship, which is what the Strategic Dialogue focused on, our countries are poised to drive progress together across the region and around the world.\u00a0 We talked about a whole range of leading global issues today, including regional security challenges, the future of multilateralism and the United Nations, and global food security.\nWe\u2019ve seen the repercussions of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine which are felt across the planet and especially across Africa in rising food and energy prices.\u00a0 We\u2019ve supported the efforts by the United Nations and Turkey to broker a deal so that Ukraine can start shipping all of the agricultural commodities that had been held back by Russia blocking their export.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to helping as many people as possible suffering from rising food insecurity.\nSince the Russian aggression began, we have provided $5.5 billion in food aid worldwide.\u00a0 A few days ago, our Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced an additional $150 million in humanitarian funding for Africa.\u00a0 But we also want to strengthen the foundation of food security across Africa, to increase local agricultural capacity, local resilience, so that more people have access to affordable, nutritious food over the long term, not just in response to an emergency.\nFinally, a little bit later today I\u2019m going to have an opportunity to speak to our broader approach to Sub-Saharan Africa.\u00a0 For now, let me say this:\u00a0 Across all of the work that we\u2019re doing together, what we seek most of all is a true partnership between the United States and Africa.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want an imbalanced or transactional relationship.\u00a0 And our commitment to a stronger partnership with Africa is not about trying to outdo anyone else.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all heard that narrative, that South Africa and the continent as a whole are the latest playing field in the competition between great powers.\u00a0 That is fundamentally not how we see it.\u00a0 It\u2019s not how we\u2019ll advance our engagement.\nThe truth is South Africa is a powerful, dynamic country helping write the future of the region and the world.\u00a0 We know in the United States by working together in the spirit of a true partnership we can advance a whole host of mutual interests and the collective interest.\u00a0 We can do good for our people, we can do good for our countries, we can do some good for the world.\u00a0 So that\u2019s really what today is about, and that\u2019s what we want this relationship to be about.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Excellencies.\u00a0 We will now take a question from the SABC\u2019s foreign editor, Ms. Sophie Mokoena.\u00a0 There\u2019s a roving microphone in front of you.\u00a0 Please, go ahead, Ms. Mokoena.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, my name is Sophie Mokoena from the South African Broadcasting Corporation.\u00a0 Secretary of State and Minister, you spoke about world affairs.\u00a0 As we speak, the war in Ukraine, South Africa and the U.S. holding to frank views, and then you have a situation in the Middle East, the Gaza conflict.\u00a0 We saw what happened a few days ago.\u00a0 And finally, in Asia, the visit of the Speaker of the U.S. Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan has also caused a major tension between the U.S. and China.\u00a0 What is it that both countries can do in maintenance of peace and prosperity, looking at these three issues?\nAnd finally, the elections in Kenya, your message on the eve of the elections, the biggest economy in East Africa?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Naledi, would you like me to start?\nMINISTER PANDOR:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, please..\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s a lot there.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if I can \u2013 first of all, on the eve of elections, we, and I think everyone in the region and beyond is watching to see that they go forward peacefully, freely, openly, and that\u2019s certainly our expectation.\nLet me try and put this in broader context because in our conversations that we\u2019ve had over many months but also that we had today, there is a fundamental agreement between us.\u00a0 And that is that this is a time of tremendous challenge across a whole host of issues that are affecting our people \u2013 obviously COVID, also climate change, also the impact of new technologies on all of our lives.\u00a0 And the shared desire of the United States and South Africa is to focus our energies, our attention, our resources, our time, to engaging these issues.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I think our people expect, and that\u2019s where \u2013 what we prefer to be doing.\nSo we don\u2019t seek conflict anywhere.\u00a0 We did not want the Russian aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 We tried very hard to \u2013 diplomatically to ward it off because that\u2019s not how we want to be spending our time.\u00a0 And similarly, the reaction now by China with regard to Taiwan and the military actions it\u2019s taken allegedly in response to the peaceful visit of a member of our Congress, that too doesn\u2019t help things.\nNor does the fact that China has said it\u2019s ceasing cooperation with the United States on dealing with climate change.\u00a0 That\u2019s not punishing the United States; that\u2019s punishing the entire \u2013 the entire world and especially the developing world, and notably Africa, because China and the United States are the number one and number two emitters in the world.\u00a0 We have a special responsibility to make sure that we\u2019re leading on dealing with climate change.\u00a0 It\u2019s deeply unfortunate that China has chosen, for now at least, to stop that engagement.\nSo my point is I think there is profound agreement between us that we want to be spending our time focused on the issues that are really having an impact on the lives of our people, and together \u2013 that\u2019s what we did with the Strategic Dialogue today \u2013 we can make a real difference.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also important that when some of the basic principles of the international system, of the international order are being challenged, that we stand up and defend them.\nSo the problem that we have with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine is that it\u2019s not only an aggression against another country, it\u2019s an aggression against the foundational principles of the international system.\u00a0 Multilateralism is something that we both believe in and invest in.\u00a0 The United Nations Charter, which puts at its heart the sovereignty and independence of nations, and it was created in large part to try to \u2013 after two World Wars to make sure that there wasn\u2019t another one.\u00a0 And the basic principles that it established were designed to do that.\nBut if we allow a big country to bully a smaller one, to simply invade it and take its territory, then it\u2019s going to be open season not just in Europe but around the world.\u00a0 It will have repercussions here and repercussions everywhere, which is why we\u2019ve felt it important to stand up for those principles.\u00a0 And we hope to see, as the Ukrainian president has said, this resolved diplomatically over time.\u00a0 But meanwhile, we have to defend the proposition that Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence matter.\u00a0 They matter to Ukrainians, but they also matter to the world.\nOn the Middle East, I\u2019ll just say that we\u2019re pleased to see that there is apparently a ceasefire now, and I want to note the important role that Egypt has played in helping to achieve that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve talked about this a lot over these months and again today.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important that all of the parties also find ways to pursue peace, to pursue a resolution of their differences.\u00a0 It\u2019s been very encouraging to see, for example, Israel and so many countries in the region normalize their relationships.\u00a0 That\u2019s good for peace.\u00a0 That\u2019s good for security.\u00a0 It\u2019s good for the well-being of people.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also not a substitute for resolving the differences between Israel and the Palestinians.\u00a0 And we believe strongly in the need to find a two-state solution that has, for Palestinians and Israelis alike, equal measures of democracy, dignity, and opportunity, and we\u2019ll keep working toward that.\nMINISTER PANDOR:\u00a0 Thanks very much, Tony, and thank you, Sophie.\nFirstly, on the matter of Russia and Ukraine, there is no one in South Africa who supports war.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made that very clear.\u00a0 And we have said that we wish to see intensified efforts at increased diplomacy utilizing the good offices of the United Nations, particularly the secretary-general and other leaders who may be of weight in terms of persuading the interlocutors to come around a table and negotiate a settlement of this awful conflict.\nThis is the position of South Africa.\u00a0\u00a0 We support a search for peace.\u00a0 We are appalled by war.\u00a0 We abhor war because it brings untold suffering, which is something we experienced under Apartheid.\u00a0 So this is the position that we have.\nWith respect to the role that multilateral bodies such as the United Nations should play, we believe that all principles that are germane to the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law must be upheld for all countries, not just some.\u00a0 Just as much as the people of Ukraine deserve their territory and freedom, the people of Palestine deserve their territory and freedom.\u00a0 And we should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine.\nWe\u2019ve not seen an even-handed approach in the utilization of the prescripts of international law, and we encourage that the world should have greater attention to ensuring that we are equal to everybody else.\u00a0 This has been a concern, and this is what at times leads to cynicism about international bodies and a lack of belief in their ability to protect the weakest and most marginalized.\u00a0 We have to change that belief and cynicism and ensure that all international institutions treat all human beings in a fashion that shows them\u00a0\u2013 whether we are ICC, ICJ, UN Security Council, G20, EU, whoever we are \u2013 we will protect those interests.\nAlso, on Taiwan, clearly as South Africa we have very clear separation between the executive and the legislature.\u00a0 And recently, the speaker of the national assembly was invited to be part of a group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a group of speakers who were a delegation that would visit Ukraine.\u00a0 I could not say to the speaker, \u201cSpeaker, don\u2019t go there, don\u2019t go there.\u201d\u00a0 It is parliament\u2019s decision as to what they do.\u00a0 This is what separation of power means.\u00a0 So I think for us, decisions by presiding officers, whether we agree with them or not, as the executive they would have to live with our decisions, we have to live with their decisions and repair any breaches in relations that they may cause.\u00a0 That\u2019s our duty to do that.\nOf course, we welcome the ceasefire in Palestine.\u00a0 However, we do express concern that many civilians have been killed, infrastructure that provides services to ordinary civilians has been destroyed, the people of Palestine are living in buildings that are shells.\u00a0 And this worries us, having experienced Apartheid ourselves and living in corridors.\u00a0 So we do think there\u2019s world for the work\u00a0\u2013 work for the world to do insuring that we create peace in the territory of Palestine and have a two-state solution where you have two nations existing in peace side by side.\nWe also think we\u2019re not satisfied that there\u2019s been an independent investigation of the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh, and we still call for a full, independent investigation and a full report on who actually shot her, because you can\u2019t say bullets shot a person.\u00a0 It\u2019s an individual who wields the gun, and we need to get to the truth of that.\u00a0 This is what will show that we are truly committed to being honest and even-handed toward all people, and in particular toward media practitioners, who must be given the security to practice their craft.\nOn the elections in Kenya, we\u2019ve been very pleased that thus far the campaign up to its end yesterday seemed to have been largely peaceful.\u00a0 We hope that the election which occurs on our Women\u2019s Day in South Africa, that it will result in a stable, free, and fair election.\u00a0 We wish the people of Kenya well in this process.\u00a0 We recall the last election, and we are hoping that tomorrow everyone will be able to exercise their democratic right to vote in a condition of peace and security.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Missy Ryan from\u00a0Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 First for you\u00a0\u2013 oh, sorry.\nFirst for you, Minister Pandor, the U.S. Government has been adamant, as Secretary Blinken just reinforced, that it is not asking African nations to choose between Russia and China and the West.\u00a0 At the same time, the United States clearly is hoping to marshal support at the UN and elsewhere for its isolation of Russia along with American allies.\u00a0 You made reference in a recent article to the failure on the part of some to appreciate the principles of sovereignty and freedom of choice that African nations must consider in this regard.\u00a0 Do you think that the United States and its European allies sufficiently appreciate the complex interests of African nations in this arena, and did you discuss that today with Secretary Blinken?\nAnd then, Secretary Blinken, for you:\u00a0 One thing we noticed during Foreign Minister Lavrov\u2019s recent African visit was his promotion of Russia\u2019s model of arms sales with few strings attached, and the fact that Russia typically refrains from criticizing African nations on human rights.\u00a0 I know you\u2019ve talked about an affirmative American vision for the continent, but how do you see that competing with the appeal that easy access to arms or state-backed loans from China might have to some leaders in Africa?\u00a0 And just really quickly, how would you respond to the minister\u2019s statement she just made about inconsistency on the part of some global actors in regard to principles the U.S. is advocating for in the Ukraine conflict, which seemed to be an allusion to the U.S. position in the conflict in the Middle East?\u00a0 Thanks.\nMINISTER PANDOR:\u00a0\u00a0Well, let me start this time.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad that Secretary Blinken has confirmed that America is not asking us to choose.\u00a0 I don\u2019t recall any attempt by the United States to do that.\u00a0 But in terms of our interaction with some of our partners in Europe and elsewhere, there has been a sense of patronizing bullying toward \u201cyou choose this or else,\u201d and the recent legislation passed in the United States of America by the House of Representatives we found a most unfortunate bill that we had hoped the media would say more about.\u00a0 Because when we believe in freedom \u2013 as I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s freedom for everybody \u2013 you can\u2019t say because Africa is doing this, you will then be punished by the United States.\u00a0 So that\u2019s been a disappointing passage of legislation by one house, and we hope the other house will not agree to such offensive legislation.\nSo indeed, it is important that all of us accept our ability to hold different opinions.\u00a0 We are, after all, sovereign nations that are regarded as equal in terms of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 We may differ in terms of economic power and economic ability to influence development in different parts of the world, but what will make the world work is if we respect each other.\u00a0 This is very, very important.\u00a0 And one thing I definitely dislike is being told \u201ceither you choose this or else.\u201d\u00a0 When a minster speaks to me like that, which Secretary Blinken has never done but some have, I definitely will not be bullied in that way, nor would I expect any other African country worth its salt to agree to be treated.\nOn Russia, I\u2019ve tried so many times to explain to so many people, Russia is a very negligible economic partner for South Africa.\u00a0 Our trade with Russia is less than $4 billion annually compared to the $20 billion that I referred to earlier with respect to the United States.\u00a0 So this fear that we exist under some push is, I think, a totally \u2013 a really unfounded belief in the relationship that we have with either country.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been quite clear in saying we really advocate peace because we knew what would happen.\u00a0 We knew there\u2019d be destruction, there\u2019d be death, there\u2019d be desolation.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re all seeing.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve always asked is: where is this going to end?\u00a0 Let us make every effort to get peace.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think the most important point I would want to emphasize is what Neladi just touched on and also what you noted in your question, which is, first, as we\u2019re here in South Africa \u2013 we\u2019ll be going on to the DRC and Rwanda; I\u2019ve spent time in Nigeria, Kenya, other places \u2013 and again, the purpose of our engagement, which I\u2019ll talk about at some length a little bit later this afternoon in laying out our broader approach to Africa, is about Africa, is about the relationship between us, is about what we can do together as partners to the benefit of our own people and I think to the benefit of people around the world.\nBy 2050, one in four people on this planet will be African.\u00a0 Over the next couple of years, half the population of this continent will be 25 years old or younger.\u00a0 So this is the future, quite literally.\u00a0 And what we\u2019re investing in is that future.\u00a0 And this gets to the point that when it comes to other countries that may be engaged here, our purpose is not to say you have to choose; it\u2019s to, in effect, offer a choice.\u00a0 And the choice that we offer \u2013 at least that we hope and expect to offer \u2013 is an affirmative one, a positive one, where we hope together to engage in a race to the top, not a race to the bottom, whether it\u2019s infrastructure, whether it\u2019s health, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s security.\nAnd on security, I think what we\u2019re seeing Russia mostly export to the most challenged places on the continent is its proxy, the Wagner Group, which is resulting in increased death and destruction in far too many countries.\u00a0 But part of the reason that the Wagner Group has some traction is that in the absence of an alternative to building security, countries may sign on and sign up.\u00a0 So this comes to offering an alternative.\u00a0 Congress passed and we\u2019re implementing something called the Global Fragility Act, which allows us to focus resources in a sustained way and in a comprehensive way in helping countries, mostly in Africa, address challenges in a way that does not lead to violence, to insecurity, to terrorism; that tries to get ahead of the problem.\nAnd our perspective on security is, yes, there is obviously an important part for the hard security element of this, including arms sales with principles that we attach to it.\u00a0 But that is, while necessary, totally insufficient.\u00a0 And what we really need and what we\u2019re focused on is a much more holistic approach that gets at some of the root causes that lead to state failure, that lead to people having deep frustration and seeing no hope for the future, and changing that trajectory.\u00a0 So that\u2019s our focus.\u00a0 I\u2019ll speak a little bit more about it in just a little while.\nIn terms of inconsistency, sure, I think it\u2019s \u2013 we have these conversations, and we like to think that we\u2019re engaged consistently on every issue.\u00a0 But we all have our shortcomings, and we can probably look back at a number of things that suggest that we\u2019re applying principles in one place in one way but not the same way in another.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a really important conversation to have, and I learned a tremendous amount from my friend and colleague in having these conversations.\nBut in the case here, whether it\u2019s Ukraine and the aggression by Russia, whether it\u2019s Taiwan and China, or whether it\u2019s the Middle East, we are working to uphold some of these basic principles.\u00a0 We may have different ways we think it most effective to do it in a given case.\u00a0 But again, in the case of the Middle East, we both believe strongly in a two-state solution; we both believe strongly in the need for Israelis and Palestinians to live with equal measures of democracy, of opportunity, of dignity; we both believe strongly that diplomacy is the most important tool that we can bring to bear on any problem, any challenge.\nNow, within that there may be different tactical approaches.\u00a0 There may be concerns that we\u2019re spending too much time on one thing and not enough on another, and that\u2019s exactly what we talk about.\u00a0 And one of the great strengths of the relationship that we have is we talk about things and lay out our differences in how we approach problems.\u00a0 And what I find is I learn a tremendous amount from each one of these conversations.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Right, last but one question, Ziyanda Ngcobo, Newsroom Africa.\u00a0 There\u2019s the microphone behind you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Ziyanda Ngcobo from Newsroom Africa.\u00a0 Quite important that Minister Pandor mentioned the Section 232 tariffs which I think would speak to the implementation part of the two countries\u2019 cooperation.\u00a0 Was there any discussion, then, on the removal of these \u2013 the Section 232 tariffs on aluminium and steel inputs?\u00a0 How soon would that happen as well, and at what percentage?\nAnd then with regards to Rwanda and the DRC, Secretary Blinken, you\u2019ll be heading there next, but of course, you\u2019ll know about that report which basically said that there\u2019s hard proof that Rwanda is funding the M23 rebels in the eastern part of DRC.\u00a0 So what will your approach be as you\u2019ll also be visiting both these countries?\u00a0 As you prepare for that visit, what kind of stance will you be taking going in?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t want to put words in my colleague\u2019s mouth.\u00a0 I think I can safely say that, yes, this question of the tariffs was raised, but I\u2019ll let the minister address that.\u00a0 And similarly, my colleagues back home in the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office are looking at this as we speak, and \u2013 but I\u2019ll defer to them about that process.\nI also don\u2019t want to get ahead of the visit to the DRC and to Rwanda except to say that I think there are deep concerns about the violence that we\u2019ve seen, about the potential for that getting worse and spreading in eastern Congo.\u00a0 And there is a shared determination to see if, through our own diplomacy in coordination with other partners, we can help reduce the tension, reduce the violence and help put these countries on a path to both resolving their differences, but also looking at what steps can be taken to actually address the well-being of the people who live particularly in eastern Congo, and to make sure that we\u2019re focused on that.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll have a lot more to say about this in the next couple of days.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Edward Wong,\u00a0New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hello.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, our understanding is that the Blinken administration\u2019s approach to Africa and its Africa strategy is predicated on democracy promotion and a promotion of open society as the underpinning for its priorities here.\u00a0 There\u2019s been a history of many American projects that are done under the name of democracy promotion ending poorly or with disastrous outcomes, whether it\u2019s during the Cold War or more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u00a0 How will that approach be different here in Africa and lead to different outcomes?\u00a0 And why is the approach seemingly different in a place like the Middle East, where you don\u2019t have the same demands of partners like the UAE or Saudi Arabia compared to your approach in Africa?\nAnd for Minister Pandor, do you think that this emphasis on democracy will be well received across all of Africa given the different political systems and traditions here on the continent, or do you think there will be some pushback against this?\u00a0 And in the case of what Secretary Blinken views as America\u2019s main challenger, which is China, that country doesn\u2019t make these kinds of demands of political assistance or governance in its diplomatic relations, so do you think that will give China an advantage in some areas in its dealings in Africa?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Ed, very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m tempted to say stay tuned because we\u2019ll talk about this in a couple of hours, I think at the minister\u2019s alma mater, which I\u2019m really looking forward to.\u00a0 And this \u2013 the question you raised is part and parcel of what I\u2019ll be talking about, but maybe for now just a couple of things.\nFirst, this is not our demand, insistence, whatever you want to call it, for democracy.\u00a0 It\u2019s a reflection of what people in Africa want and are looking for.\u00a0 And that\u2019s clear in poll after poll.\u00a0 They want openness.\u00a0 They want the ability of \u2013 on an individual basis, of communities, and countries for that matter, to choose their own path.\u00a0 And that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\nBut fundamentally, our proposition is that as a democracy \u2013 and we happen to be two of the leading constitutional democracies \u2013 or countries that aspire to strengthen their democracies, or for that matter countries that may be falling back from democracy, the challenge is, as we\u2019ve said and President Biden has talked about a lot, the need to demonstrate in very concrete ways that democracies actually deliver for their people.\u00a0 That\u2019s what our focus is.\nAnd so as we\u2019re focused between us in this Strategic Dialogue on these core issues that go to the heart of what people are looking for now, similarly in Africa writ large you\u2019ll see a focus on similar issues and an effort to demonstrate that in partnership we can actually make a difference in the lives of our citizens.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the approach is about.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the strategy is about.\u00a0 And we happen to believe that in order to do that effectively, in order to do it equitably, that democracy is the best system for doing that.\u00a0 But it has to continuously prove itself, and that\u2019s a lot of what we\u2019ll be talking about this afternoon.\nSo let me leave it there for now and just ask you to stay tuned, and we\u2019ll come back to it in a few hours.\nMINISTER PANDOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 I think that when you approach a strategy you need to think very carefully about the kinds of tactics that you would utilize.\u00a0 So your overall strategic intention might be to advocate for democracy and support its presence on the African continent.\u00a0 However, if your tactic is to approach African countries and say that, listen, you must be democratic either and use our model, it works, I think it\u2019s bound to lead to some failure.\nI do agree with Tony that all countries and peoples deserve the right to exercise their civil and political rights, but I think given history the approach has to be somewhat different.\u00a0 And I would recommend a greater attention to tools that Africans have developed, such as the African Peer Review Mechanism, as a way into broader discussions about governance and democracy, rather than we will \u2013 there are 44 African countries that have now agreed to be transparent and evaluated under the African Peer Review Mechanism principles of democracy and good governance.\u00a0 It\u2019s extremely important too \u2013 we\u2019ve already had over 40 such evaluations.\u00a0 Let\u2019s discuss the outcomes of those reviews with each of the African countries and look at areas where it was found there are gaps that must be addressed, and look at how we work together.\nAnd in that way, you build a platform toward the objective you eventually seek to achieve.\u00a0 But to come in and seek to teach a country that we know how democracy functions and we\u2019ve come to tell you, you do it, it\u2019ll work for you \u2013 I think it leads to defeat, so we need to think in different ways.\nI also think that one of the lessons we also need to learn and perhaps draw lessons from \u2013 one of the experiences we should draw lessons from is the reality that there has been a lot of external interference in Africa.\u00a0 And a lot of that external interference has fueled conflict in many African countries, has fueled instability and supported opposition groups against liberation fighters and so on.\u00a0 You know the history perhaps better than myself.\u00a0 This is a reality.\nSo in my view, while there may be concern about Wagner Group or Van Dyck, which is another security group which was in Mozambique, there\u2019s also a concern about countries that have mineral interests in African countries and are there as a destabilizing force.\u00a0 So I think we need to look at the full plethora of problems that give rise to insecurity, bad governance, and the absence of democracy on the African continent.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a one country problem.\u00a0 It\u2019s a world phenomenon which is \u2013 results from Africa\u2019s rich mineral wealth that has made it a significant target of external players that don\u2019t always have the interests of Africa at heart.\nThen countries are free to establish relationships with different countries.\u00a0 African countries that wish to relate to China, let them do so, whatever the particular form of relationships would be.\u00a0 We can\u2019t be made party to conflict between China and the United States of America, and I may say it does cause instability for all of us because it affects the global economic system.\u00a0 We really hope that the United States and China will arrive a point of rapprochement where all of us can look to economic development and growth for all our countries because that\u2019s extremely important for all of us.\u00a0 And these are two great powers, the two biggest economies in the world.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got to find a way of working together to allow us to grow.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Your Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you everyone.\n\n"}, {"url":

We didn\u2019t really want to come here because we were enjoying our discussion so much, but we took pity on you and decided that we should come out. So allow me to begin.\nSecretary of State Mr. Antony Blinken; Ms. Heather Merritt, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria; Ambassador-Designate Ruben Brigety II; Excellencies; Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Ambassador Molly Phee; Assistant Secretary of Global Health Affairs and Department of Health and Human \u2013 Assistant Secretary for Global Affairs Ms. Pace; Ambassador Nkengasong \u2013 where are you? You\u2019re a \u2013 you\u2019ve deserted us. I don\u2019t want to call you a traitor but \u2013 Ambassador Nkengasong, U.S. global AIDS coordinator and head of PEPFAR; National Security Council \u2013 National Senior Director for Africa Mr. Devermont; Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Mr. Fernandez; senior officials of both the governments of South Africa and of the United States of America; ladies and gentlemen \u2013 and Secretary Blinken, you don\u2019t have to repeat all of this. I\u2019m doing it for both of us.\nI\u2019m really pleased, Secretary, to welcome you and your delegation to our beautiful country and to the department of international relations and cooperation. You\u2019ll remember that in our many conversations, we\u2019ve discussed a possible visit by you several times, and I\u2019m very happy that we\u2019ve achieved our agreed objective.\nI also wish to welcome Ambassador-Designate Reuben Brigety II. I am glad, Ambassador, that you\u2019re able to observe this meeting and visit. I hope our deliberations today will set the tone for your tenure in South Africa, and I wish you a productive and enjoyable term as U.S. ambassador to South Africa. It will be enjoyable as long as you don\u2019t tweet about me. I hope you will contribute to strengthening the already strong links between South Africa and the United States of America.\nMr. Secretary, the United States is one of South Africa\u2019s most valued partners. I appreciate the commitment you have shown to expanding our bilateral relations. The bonds that were forged between the United States and South Africa during our struggle for democracy and racial justice in our country are enduring bonds and created a firm foundation for advancing people-to-people cooperation between the two countries, including in the spheres of education, cultural, and tourism exchanges.\nWe\u2019ve established many positive initiatives since our freedom in 1994. Our areas of cooperation include trade and investment, technology transfer, education, health, environment, safety and security, institution building, and many other areas. Our country continues to be confronted by deep challenges linked to our Apartheid history and its legacy. They center on three main elements: inequality, poverty, and unemployment. These are challenges we have to address to avoid social strife.\nThrough the generous support of the Government of the United States of America and its people, we\u2019ve been able to make progress in addressing many of the socioeconomic challenges faced by the majority in our country, be this in providing access to equal and quality education, decent housing, or basic health services to the most vulnerable in our society. We have seen support. Our bilateral cooperation is broad and deep and aligned to South Africa\u2019s national priorities. We are determined as a nation and working hard to set our economy on a new trajectory of growth and development to satisfy our people\u2019s desire for a better life.\nI\u2019m especially pleased at our scientific cooperation at the Square Kilometre Array site in Carnarvon, in the Northern Cape, where the United States has a very important HERA astronomy research initiative.\nWhat stands out in particular in our journey was the timely and significant support given to South Africa and the region to address the original pandemic of HIV/AIDS through the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. This has indeed been a gamechanger, as it set the marker for the way we bilaterally as government and civil society came together to turn around the devastating impact of the HIV/AIDS scourge, which threatened to derail our development progress and set us back many decades. For me, our cooperation in HIV vaccine development stands out as our most significant medical sciences research initiative, with Professor Glenda Gray and Professor Shisana achieving outstanding results in collaboration with American research partners.\nIt\u2019s clear, Mr. Secretary, that the United States Government makes a significant contribution to our own development efforts, as set out in our national development plan. These do assist us to address the triple challenges I referred to. South Africa is the largest United States trade partner in Africa. The significant presence of United States companies operating within our borders, including historic long-term investors such as General Electric and Ford to name just two, has helped to upskill our young people, create jobs, livelihoods, and has made the United States private sector a key partner in supporting South Africa\u2019s socioeconomic growth.\nMore recently, the tremendous support shown by United States companies for President Ramaphosa\u2019s investment drive has demonstrated our belief that the United States still has a future in our country, and an interest in our future and the value proposition that we offer as a key investment destination and trade partner. This is even in the context of the setback of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI\u2019m really pleased to welcome the growth in two-way trade in goods, which has gone from 13.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2010 to 21 billion U.S. dollars in 2021. In 2021 the United States ranked as the second-largest destination for South Africa\u2019s exports globally. South African firms have also become significant foreign investors. Investments from South Africa into the U.S. are also on the increase, with the U.S. accounting for 17.4 percent of total South African outward FDI to the world.\nBut we believe there\u2019s much more we can and should do. As we discussed in our meeting of the 12th Annual Bilateral Forum this year, our objective should be to significantly expand two-way trade and investment, which will contribute to shared growth and prosperity of our people. A good start in this vein would be to speedily resolve the longstanding unresolved trade issues around market access, including the removal of Section 232 tariffs on South African steel and aluminium imports into the United States. We\u2019ve discussed this on the phone previously.\nSouth Africa is proud to count on the U.S. Government and its private sector as partners in our efforts directed at post-pandemic economic recovery. Our president and his economic team have been hard at work making it easier for foreign investors to invest in our country and to advance our trade and investment relations for mutual benefit. The support we received and continue to receive from the U.S. to combat COVID-19 and its effect, as well as America\u2019s support for the WTO TRIPS waiver deliberations which have enabled South Africa and Africa to begin production of vaccines locally, is a tangible demonstration of the international solidarity we all need to overcome the global challenges of our time. I would like, through you, to thank President Biden for understanding this imperative and for his efforts to make Africa an equal partner in the global community\u2019s plans to address the most pressing challenge of our time.\nSecretary Blinken, as I\u2019m sure you will say, our world is going through an extraordinarily difficult period. Many countries are having to contend with high costs for fuel, food, and transport, all of which are basic necessities. The current global economic environment, which is marked by rising inequality, by conflict, unequal technological advances, environmental degradation due to climate change, all have huge implications for food security and agricultural systems, particularly here in Africa where the pandemic has reversed the gains that have been made under the African Union socioeconomic development blueprint, Agenda 2063.\nThe present moment, which has given rise to widespread uncertainty and fear, requires us all as leaders to come together and chart a way forward that will give hope and inspiration to our respective peoples. We must ensure that the undertakings we make at the United Nations, the G7, and the G20, which include addressing food insecurity, global health, peace and security, sustainable and just energy transition, as well as human security, that all of these are meaningfully addressed. We must also reinforce our common commitment to multilateralism, democracy, and human rights, and use the proven tools of diplomacy, peacebuilding, dialogue, and mediation to resolve conflict and end the intolerable and unnecessary human suffering which results from wars and other forms of conflict.\nWorking together, we must identify a path to greater prosperity and human-centered development, which would improve local communities\u2019 self-reliance, social justice, and inclusive decision making. We are keen to play a role in such an endeavor. This is informed by our own foreign policy principles, which are based on our value of ubuntu: I am, because you are.\nI believe, Mr. Secretary, that our strategic partnership, which is based on common values and aspirations, is the foundation for our strengthening of bilateral relations between our two countries. Our gathering here for this Strategic Dialogue after a quiet period of almost seven years, as well as the arrival of Ambassador Brigety, presents an opportunity for us to reinvigorate our relations on the various fronts I have referred to. I believe we should place economic recovery for Africa at the front and center of our agenda. The implementation of the African Continental Free Trade agreement and the convening of the AGOA Forum in South Africa next year present both our governments, our private sectors, and civil society with numerous opportunities to advance our trade and investment relations.\nWe really hope that on our path to economic recovery we will ensure that both South Africa and the United States of America do not leave behind women, youth, and the disabled. I\u2019m really thrilled by the continued support that President Biden has given to the Mandela Washington Fellowship through the Young African Leaders Initiative, and the good work that is being done by the United States-South Africa Higher Education Network, as well as support for our technical/vocational education and training institutions, which have formed exciting partnerships with community colleges in the United States. I also acknowledge support for training and capacity building for our law enforcement, defense, and security agencies, including in the important fight against wildlife trafficking.\nI would like to conclude by conveying my sincere thanks and appreciation to your embassy in Pretoria under the able leadership of both Mr. Todd Haskell and Ms. Heather Merritt, who\u2019ve worked very hard to support our efforts against COVID-19 and to ensure that we remain focused on our common goal to maintain and strengthen bilateral cooperation, even during such a challenging period. I\u2019m looking forward to our discussion with our officials and our discussion later at lunch today. I believe that it is only through open and frank dialogue, through \u2013 on matters on which we do not share similar views that we could perhaps begin to understand each other\u2019s positions, dispel misunderstandings, enhance our trust, and find solutions that will benefit both our countries and peoples.\nI think I\u2019m correct if I share with our colleagues that we have had very frank discussions where at times we don\u2019t agree, but it\u2019s not broken this friendship. In fact, it\u2019s made it stronger. We look forward to participating in the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, which will be hosted by President Biden in December. And I also look forward to your talk this afternoon on the revised Africa strategy, and really wish to thank you for choosing our country to make this very important statement.\nMr. Secretary, once more, welcome to my country. Your visit is far too short for my liking, but I\u2019m certain that it will be productive, and I look forward to seeing you again in our beautiful country in the future. Thank you very much, and I now invite you, Secretary Blinken, to make your opening remarks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good morning, everyone. And Foreign Minister Pandor, Naledi, thank you. Thank you for your remarkable hospitality, for the warmth of the greeting we\u2019ve received, and yes, especially for the dialogue that we\u2019ve had for many, many months on so many different issues, and we\u2019re profoundly joined and connected in, I think, a basic outlook as two great constitutional democracies with a shared set of values. But to your point, we bring different perspectives on some issues, and I have to tell you, as a result of our many conversations, you\u2019ve helped me rethink things and look at things in a different light. And I\u2019m really grateful for that and, and it\u2019s an ongoing conversation.\nI think the fact that so many American policymakers have traveled to take part in this Strategic Dialogue \u2013 from the White House, from the State Department, from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, from the Department of Health and Human Services, from bureaus in our departments dealing with economic growth, global health, policy planning. That, in and of itself, is a signal, evidence of the importance that we attach to the relationship with South Africa and the importance that South Africa has in our work at home and also around the world, and how committed we are to making the ties between us even stronger.\nOn one level, it\u2019s simple. Given your economic heft, your leading global voice, your membership in the G20, your influence among the G-77 countries \u2013 and the critical role that South Africa plays on global health, on climate, on democracy, regional security, and so much else \u2013 what South Africa says, what South Africa does has powerful global implications.\nAnd that makes this Strategic Dialogue a vital forum, marking a serious commitment by both of our governments to this bilateral relationship and to the work we\u2019re doing together not only between us, but regionally and globally. And as we\u2019re going to get briefed in a moment on some of the work of the Strategic Dialogue, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the breadth and depth of the topics covered here today reflect the scope of our shared priorities. You said it very well and powerfully; we\u2019re dealing \u2013 both of us \u2013 with an incredibly challenging time. The world faces threats from disease, from climate change, from food insecurity, from violence. What we can achieve together as two leading democracies I think is even more urgent, and that\u2019s also why so many colleagues are here and so invested in this process.\nSo I\u2019m very much looking forward to hearing from our teams about, particularly, the focus areas set out by Presidents Ramaphosa and Biden when they spoke a few months ago: health, climate, trade and investment, infrastructure. These are critical areas of both of our countries, and our teams have done important work in advancing our work in each of these areas.\nLet me just say very quickly, even before we hear from them, I think on health we have reaffirmed the longstanding partnership through the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. I have to say this is something, as an American, I am proudest of over the last 25 or 30 years. It\u2019s hard to think of a more significant initiative that has saved more lives, changed more lives than PEPFAR: 21 million lives saved over nearly 20 years. And we continue to work toward epidemic control of HIV and TB and an AIDS-free generation.\nOur work on HIV/AIDS and TB has given us a strong foundation to collaborate effectively on COVID-19 and other emerging health threats. So we\u2019ll keep working together \u2013 including under the COVID-19 Global Action Plan \u2013 on this pandemic, but critically, and as you said, to try to strengthen global health security going forward and more broadly, because even as we get through this pandemic we know that there will be others lurking, and if we don\u2019t learn the lessons and act on the lessons from this pandemic and create a stronger global health system, then, really, bad on us. So we\u2019re both committed to doing that together.\nAnd I especially want to thank South Africa and its world-class scientists for your role in identifying the Omicron variant and immediately, immediately alerting the world. It\u2019s no wonder that you\u2019re becoming a hub of vaccine development to help Africa generate its own production and to help the world prepare, as necessary, for the next pandemic.\nOn climate and energy, very much look forward to hearing the details of how today\u2019s discussion advanced our robust joint efforts. Energy access and production are critical to South Africa\u2019s future \u2013 while at the same time, both our nations have been affected by the ravages of the climate crisis. We\u2019re feeling it, you\u2019re feeling it, every single day. And part of the challenge over many years in dealing with climate is it always seemed to be: well, yes, it\u2019s a problem but it\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s problem. No longer the case \u2013 it\u2019s today\u2019s problem. And I think we all feel the fierce urgency of now when it comes to dealing with climate. We see that just in the recent floods in Durban and in Kentucky.\nSo we know that to preserve our planet and protect our citizens, we have to find a way to an energy transition that allows us to meet those goals while supporting those who have been most affected by the climate crisis. The United States and other partners are committed to a Just Energy Transition Partnership with public-private investments in renewable energy and in supporting South Africa\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy.\nInfrastructure: South Africa is so well-positioned to lead development of transportation and digital infrastructure throughout the region. We\u2019re looking for ways that the G7\u2019s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, announced by the G7 leaders at President Biden\u2019s initiative just a couple of months ago, can support these goals through access to financing, project preparation, and facilitating partnerships with the private sector.\nAnd on trade, Naledi, as you\u2019ve said, we have a vital economic relationship. And it is very encouraging that even with COVID, trade and investment between South Africa and the United States reached, as you said, a record $21 billion last year. But we know that we can make something good even better. As South Africa\u2019s second-largest trade partner, we\u2019re committed to continuing this robust, dynamic, and mutually beneficial partnership.\nToday was not the culmination of our partnership, but I think the start of a new chapter. President Biden is very much looking forward to welcoming President Ramaphosa to Washington next month. And in December, we\u2019re incredibly excited to be hosting the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, picking up something that President Obama started, and we welcome South Africa\u2019s input on making that summit a success.\nWe have between us a long history of cooperation, from regional peace and security to promoting democracy and global health, to shaping our technological and economic futures. And our shared values and interests extend beyond our two governments. They\u2019re woven through the fabric of our societies through partnerships between our private sectors, exchanges between our cultural and educational institutions, and especially, ties of friendship and family among our people, especially our young people.\nSo to conclude and say simply as we hear from our colleagues, my team and I very much look forward to continuing to work closely with you to overcome the challenges that we both have to face, to engage frankly and meaningfully on issues where our views might differ, and to chart a course toward a promising future that will benefit the people of both South Africa and the United States, and I think beyond.\nSo thank you again for today, thank you for the (inaudible), and thank you for the invitation to come back. We\u2019re going to take you up on that. Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-to-the-press-3/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

We\u2019re not fated to any particular (inaudible).\u00a0 We can make change.\u00a0 And young people, especially, are the most powerful agents of change.\nAnd this is \u2013 there\u2019s a photograph in the museum that went around the world, and it probably did as much to open hearts and open minds \u2013 and raise consciousness about Apartheid and about the struggle for equality and freedom \u2013 as anything.\u00a0 So to see this today, to have you share it with us, thank you.\nMS SITHOLE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s incredibly meaningful to me.\nMS SITHOLE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much. \u00a0And actually, the museum is a reminder of \u2013 like, for generations to come.\u00a0 Even us as adults, you\u2019re like: we must know where we are coming from and where we are going to. \u00a0And don\u2019t forget that the youth actually took a stand for us to live better today. \u00a0That means we\u2019re opening the path, we\u2019re opening the doors for youth as generations to come to take a stand in whatever problem that they have, but with responsibility.\u00a0 That is very, very important. \u00a0So we are relying on our youth to really take a stand.\u00a0 We are there to support and motivate them that really, we want to live in peace but not in pieces.\nThank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you all.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0What\u2019s your message to the South African Government while you\u2019re here?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll have more to say about that in the next couple of days.\u00a0 I really want to keep the focus on this extraordinary place, extraordinary story. \u00a0That\u2019s what today\u2019s about.\u00a0 And this extraordinary woman, this is someone who, despite her experience, which is \u2013 which is hard to \u2013 I think hard for any of us to wrap our minds around \u2013 who has the most open heart that I\u2019ve found.\u00a0 And that\u2019s inspiring, too, so thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nThank you all very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-u-s-trade-and-development-agency-offshore-wind-grant-signing/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken  At a U.S. Trade and Development Agency Offshore Wind Grant Signing\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Ayala Gardens", "location": "Manila, the Philippines", "date": "August 6, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, and thank you, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful, first of all, to be here in the Ayala Triangle Gardens, and I hope you had an opportunity, however briefly, to look at some of the work that\u2019s on display over to my left.\u00a0 It really is remarkable, and I\u2019ll come to it again in a minute.\u00a0 But I think what it demonstrates, among other things, is that somewhere in the\u00a0\u2013 thank you \u2013 somewhere in the world, we have problems that are shared.\u00a0 Someone is finding a solution, and if we can make sure that that information is shared, spread the knowledge, it\u2019s going to make a big difference everywhere.\nAnd so something happening here in the Philippines\u00a0\u2013 innovation, ingenuity \u2013 can make a difference not only here, but literally around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredibly impressive to see the\u00a0\u2013 not only the brilliant ideas, but the actual achievement of those ideas in having an effect and an impact on people here in the Philippines and, I believe, well beyond.\nAnd thank you to all of our esteemed colleagues who are here.\u00a0 Mr. Ambassador, it\u2019s very wonderful to be with you \u2013 all of our colleagues from the government, thank you for being here today.\u00a0 And thank you as well to everyone joining us from companies here in the Philippines.\nSo as we were going around, it was almost a series of what we would call \u201celevator pitches\u201d in business \u2013 but entrepreneurs, innovators, making a powerful difference.\u00a0 And they were all outstanding.\u00a0 Bringing power, solar power to fishing communities; expanding access to hydro power; developing microgrids, which make electric grids more flexible and more efficient; and so much more, all over there.\nThese efforts are more important than ever because every region in the world is experiencing the dangerous effects of the climate crisis.\u00a0 The Philippines is especially vulnerable.\u00a0 You\u2019re dealing with more intense typhoons, extreme rainfall, rising temperatures and sea levels.\u00a0 This is a threat by definition that no one country, no one government can solve alone.\u00a0 We have to tackle it together.\u00a0 And investing in clean energy is one very powerful way to do that.\nLast year the Philippines announced an ambitious clean energy goal\u00a0\u2013 to produce 35 percent of the nation\u2019s energy from renewable sources by 2030 and 50 percent by 2040.\u00a0 The United States commends these goals, and we\u2019re committed to helping the Philippines achieve them.\nToday, with a grant from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, we will lay the groundwork together for one of the first offshore wind projects in the Philippines.\u00a0 In time, that project will produce up to 3,000 megawatts of clean energy every single year.\u00a0 And to put that in perspective, 3,000\u00a0megawatts of clean energy, that\u2019s enough to power more than two million homes.\u00a0 We hope it will galvanize more investments in wind power.\u00a0 That\u2019s an industry with tremendous potential for growth here in the Philippines.\nThis new collaboration that we\u2019re announcing today is only the latest example of our work in clean energy together.\u00a0 This summer we helped support your first competitive bidding program with energy providers committed to producing another 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy by 2025.\u00a0 This past March, the Philippines joined the Clean Energy Demand Initiative.\u00a0 That\u2019s a program run by the United States that connects countries looking to switch to clean energy with companies that can help them do that.\u00a0 So far to date, 12 companies representing $2 billion of investments have signed letters of intent to partner with the Philippines.\nLast year our countries launched the Energy-Secure Philippines Initiative.\u00a0 That mobilizes private-sector investments and more clean energy generation throughout the Philippines.\nWe\u2019re working together to develop a nuclear energy sector in the Philippines with our recent agreement to facilitate cooperation between our nuclear experts.\nAnd as a founding member of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the Philippines joins 13\u00a0countries across the region who are committing to clean energy, decarbonization as a key pillar of a stronger, fairer, more resilient economy.\nThis work is critical, and we are grateful to our partners across the Philippines \u2013 the government, the private sector, and civil society for their dedication to this nation\u2019s clean energy future.\u00a0 Together we\u2019re reducing carbon emissions while creating jobs.\u00a0 We\u2019re sparking innovation.\u00a0 We\u2019re producing affordable, reliable energy for families and communities throughout the country.\nSo it\u2019s fitting that we\u2019re marking this new partnership here in these gardens.\u00a0 As some of you may know, this location was actually an international airport until 1948.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s an oasis in the middle of a bustling, busy city, a living reminder that with the right policies and investments, we can improve on our past, we can honor our planet, and we can deliver tangible benefits to our communities.\nSo thanks very much to everyone for being here today.\u00a0 Thanks for all the good work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I\u2019m honored to invite on the stage Ambassador Romualdez.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR ROMUALDEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Betty.\u00a0\u00a0 Well, first of all, I\u2019d like to greet Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to see you in Manila instead of the usual Benjamin Franklin Room at the State Department.\u00a0 Great to see you here.\nAmbassador MaryKay Carlson, you\u2019ve been here two weeks, but it looks like you\u2019ve been here for a year already with everybody.\nBut I\u2019d like to also like to thank our hosts of for this beautiful triangle here \u2013 good friends Jaime Fernando Z\u00f3bel de Ayala \u2013 for hosting this event here; of course, Madame Ebong, the director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency; and Betty Chung, the Acting Mission Director of the USAID; (inaudible) the Philippine department of energy; our other colleagues in the Philippine and U.S. governments, our partners in the private sector; ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon to all of you.\nI am honored to be joining you today for this clean energy expo.\u00a0 This event speaks very well of the importance of our two sides we place on addressing climate change and to the invaluable role of a private-public partnerships in making progress on this gargantuan task.\nThe Philippines takes climate seriously, being one of the three most vulnerable countries in the world when it comes to climate change.\u00a0 Betty and the USAID team here at Manila know that very well that we are receiving the end of the natural \u2013 number of natural disasters annually, super typhoons, earthquakes \u2013 we just had one recently \u2013 including the most recent one, the volcanic eruptions also.\nThe USAID is usually among the first of our international partners that come to our aid and support the emergency response and recovery efforts of the Philippine Government in the aftermath of this crisis.\nThank you very much, Betty, for the USAID\u2019s Temporary Shelter Program, support for our communities in northern Luzon following last week\u2019s earthquake.\u00a0 Beyond humanitarian assistance and disaster response, we need to zero in on the root of the problem and pursue solutions that would have significant impact in the long run.\u00a0 For this reason, the Philippines very much welcomed the first act of the Biden administration in rejoining the Paris Agreement.\u00a0 That reaffirmed, at the highest levels, the United States\u2019 commitment to climate efforts, and we are proud and very grateful for the continuing partnership in this regard.\nThe United States remains a steadfast partner and supporter of emerging economies like the Philippines in facilitating job creation and building of a high quality and environment friendly energy infrastructures that support initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change.\nDirector Enoh, in April last year I witnessed virtually the signing of the USTDA grant for the Metro Pacific Intel and Transportation System master plan technical assistance.\u00a0 I am very pleased to witness in person today another ceremonial signing of a new USTDA project for this grant \u2013 this time will be Aboitiz Renewables Incorporated, which we hope will translate to new and better wind energy infrastructures that could provide Filipino homes in the near future economical, high quality, and sustainable, of course, or sourced electricity.\nAccording to the World Bank estimates, the Philippines has over 170 \u2013 or 178 decawatts of technical offshore wind protection, which, if harnessed, would significantly help in meeting the increasing demand for energy in our country.\u00a0 I am confident that the Aboitiz Group, one of the largest power generation companies in the country, will be able to accomplish the goal of this grant and deliver the desired outcome of the project.\u00a0 I salute the USTDA\u2019s Global Partnership for the Climate-Smart Infrastructure Initiative, and we certainly are looking forward to seeing more of that take shape here in the Philippines.\u00a0 Again, thank you very much and thank you to all of you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\n(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Ambassador Romualdez.\u00a0 We\u2019ll now move to the grant signing portion of the event.\u00a0 May I invite Director Ebong to please sit here up at this table?\n(Off-mike.)\nMS EBONG:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Betty, and Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Romualdez, Ambassador Carlson, our partners across the Philippines Government.\u00a0 It\u2019s such a pleasure to be here meeting such innovative and impactful renewable energy companies.\u00a0 It is so clear that the ecosystem for innovation, creativity, and partnership remains very strong here in the Philippines.\u00a0 The U.S. Trade and Development Agency is well suited to meet the needs of the Philippines clean energy transition.\nOur mission is to support the development of high-quality, sustainable infrastructure in emerging economies in collaboration with U.S. industry.\u00a0 This includes broad-based funding for feasibility studies and technical assistance, which are critical tools for ensuring that infrastructure products are financed, implemented, and sustained.\nUSTDA\u2019s model of assistance is based on partnership and trust and shared priorities.\u00a0 Perhaps there\u2019s no greater shared priority than tackling the climate crisis.\u00a0 In June, President Biden and the leaders of the G7 launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment to deliver game-changing projects to close the infrastructure gap and support a clean energy transition in countries like the Philippines.\nWe are committed to delivering on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to strengthen our ties and build more resilient economies for our countries, our businesses, and our families.\u00a0 These are some of the reasons why USTDA is working with Aboitiz Renewables, Inc. to support the development of an offshore wind power project with the potential to deliver clean energy solutions in the Philippines.\nColorado-based Rocky Mountain Institute will perform the USTDA-funded feasibility study and provide incoming resources towards its completion, as will Singapore-based (inaudible) Capital.\nI am grateful for their contributions and partnership, and I am proud of USTDA\u2019s role in supporting the Philippines and its ambitious climate agenda.\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-covid-19-assistance-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

On behalf of the people of Manila, we would like to welcome the Honorable U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, officials from the U.S. Government, the United States Agency for International Development, and our friends from the department of health.\u00a0\nCountries from all corners of the world were stunned with unexpected influx of COVID-19 cases since 2019.\u00a0 But everybody worked hard to immediately develop systems to address the crisis, from tracing, treating, and preventing the spread of this virus among their countrymen.\u00a0 The city government of Manila, as the capital city of the Philippines with almost 2 million people, tried to respond to the pandemic by implementing (inaudible) COVID-19 \u2013which stands for contain and delay COVID-19 \u2013 through lockdowns and curfews as the pandemic hit in early 2020.\nWe make the most out of our health cluster comprised of the city health department and six city-run hospitals to face the challenges to test, trace, and treat patients.\u00a0 In this instance, we saw more the importance of having allies and partners with whom we can forge and sustain relationship, partnership including the U.S. Government and USAID, to help our citizen get lifesaving care and access to the rollout of vaccines.\u00a0 We thank the U.S. Government for providing such extensive support to the city government of Manila.\nWith your help, we were able to administer more than 300 doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the deployment of mobile (inaudible) and donations of IT equipments to enhance our vaccine data reporting and management.\u00a0 We are proud to share that during the early phases of the nationwide vaccination rollout, we were actually one, if not the first among the local government units in the national capital region with the fastest vaccination rate.\u00a0 Again, we are grateful for your help.\nWe also appreciate the U.S. Government\u2019s donation of BIDA campaign materials and the installation of hand hygiene stations in 16 health facilities.\u00a0 This has provided free hand-washing access to 290 people per day, thus giving Manile\u00f1os additional layers of protection from COVID-19.\u00a0 USAID \u2013 the U.S. Department of Defense also provided more than 19,000 PPEs and essential medical supplies and 10,000 rapid antigen testing kits which helped us weather the last Omicron surge early this year.\u00a0 All these collaborations are in synch with the national government\u2019s \u201cprevent, detect, isolate, treat\u201d reintegration and COVID-19 vaccination program.\nWe are honored and grateful to have the United States Government and USAID here with us today, and I would like to extend my warmest gratitude to Secretary Blinken and our U.S. Government partners for being our key ally during these most challenging times.\u00a0 And we hope that we can further enhance this partnership to ensure that our health systems are better equipped for the crisis of the future.\u00a0 We say welcome (in Filipino).\u00a0 Thank you and\u00a0mabuhay.\n(Applause.)\nEsteemed guests, friends, ladies, and gentlemen, let us now listen to the Honorable U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Madam Mayor, thank you so much for that wonderful introduction.\u00a0 I have to say I think we\u2019ve seen first-hand just a moment ago why Manila is so fortunate to have a former physician leading its COVID-19 response.\u00a0 Talk about constituent services \u2013 I think some of you saw the mayor administer a vaccine to a young child.\u00a0 That\u2019s impressive.\nAnd let me just give a special thanks as well to everyone who has been involved in fighting COVID in the Philippines, including those of you from the department of health, the Manila City Health Office, the Philippines Genome Center, the Bulacan Medical Center, the many community health care workers and other civil society leaders who stepped forward to save lives.\nSo I just had the opportunity to some of the extraordinary efforts underway to get shots into arms, particularly for children.\u00a0 In a few minutes, I\u2019ll also get to meet some of the civil society leaders who have been involved in the Philippines response.\u00a0 They\u2019re also alumni of American exchange programs like the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative \u2013 known as YSEALI \u2013 and the International Visitors Leadership Program, something that we at the State Department are also very proud of.\u00a0 So we share in their nation\u2019s pride in their public service.\nThe organizations that they lead are playing a critical role in fighting COVID-19 here in the Philippines.\nTo name just a couple two examples, Joie Cruz is the founder of a design agency.\u00a0 It\u2019s called Limitless Lab.\u00a0 She and a group of other YSEALI alumni created AdaptPH, a nationwide campaign that encourages people to observe public safety protocols like wearing masks and social distancing.\u00a0 More than 240 local governments across the Philippines are now using her materials to try to flatten the curve of COVID cases.\nGabriel Billones\u00a0is the co-founder of the Break the Fake Movement.\u00a0 That works to try to debunk disinformation that\u2019s out there about the pandemic, about COVID-19.\u00a0 He partnered with our embassy here in Manila to create the \u201cMedia Civics Lab,\u201d training elected officials to understand how disinformation threatens the pandemic response.\u00a0 Hundreds of officials are now better equipped to counter disinformation in their communities as a result of working in this partnership.\nSo there are many other stories that I could tell, but the main thing is this:\u00a0 The civil society leaders who are here with us are protecting people\u2019s lives, protecting their livelihoods, and helping speed the Philippines\u2019 recovery from COVID.\nAnd we\u2019re seeing very encouraging signs of that recovery all around us.\u00a0 More than 70 million Filipinos have been vaccinated.\u00a0 Infections have gone down.\u00a0 Fewer people who get COVID are hospitalized or dying from it.\u00a0 And soon, children will return to school in person.\nBut there is still work to do.\u00a0 There are approximately 2,500 new cases of COVID-19 each day all across the Philippines.\u00a0 Sixteen million people have received their booster shots.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot, but more need to get it if we\u2019re going to stay protecting against all of the variants.\u00a0 Fewer than four million children ages 5 to 11 are fully vaccinated, and that\u2019s about six million below where I know the Philippines wants to be.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it was so encouraging just a moment ago to see all the children who are here, ready to get their vaccines.\nAs the Philippines continues to work to vaccinate people, to reduce the spread and save lives, my message is simple:\u00a0 The United States is with you.\nWe\u2019ve been proud to have donated more than 33 million safe, effective vaccines to the Philippines, no political strings attached.\nWe\u2019ve provided more than $50 million to your COVID-19 response to help train healthcare workers, to boost the vaccine rollout, to support the economic recovery.\nWe\u2019re also providing supplies for the continued fight against COVID-19, and we have some here with us here today \u2013 testing kits, laboratory equipment.\u00a0 All of that will go to the Philippines Genome Center, the Bulacan Medical Center, and our other partners who are here with us today.\nUltimately \u2013 ultimately \u2013 we will end this pandemic and emerge better prepared for future health crises by working together not only across governments, but across private sectors and across civil society.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind something we started called the Global Action Plan \u2013 we launched in February.\u00a0 And the idea was to identify the remaining gaps in global COVID response and then match countries that have unique capabilities to help fill those gaps.\u00a0 The Global Action Plan focuses on six key lines of effort: getting shots into arms, bolstering supply chains and their resilience, addressing the information gaps and dealing with misinformation, supporting healthcare workers, improving testing and treatments, and strengthening the global health security architecture for the long term because we know, even as we get through this pandemic, there will be more to come.\u00a0 And we have to learn all of the lessons from this experience to make sure that we\u2019re better prepared, more effectively prepared next time to see if we can prevent \u2013 and if not prevent, prepare for and mitigate \u2013 any future pandemics.\nIf the world can make strong progress along those six lines of effort that I\u2019ve described, we can end the acute phase of COVID-19.\u00a0 But that requires a great deal of coordination and cooperation among countries.\u00a0 No single one of us can do it alone.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why strong health partnerships \u2013 like the one between the United States and the Philippines \u2013 are so critical.\nSo again, I simply want to thank everyone who contributed and continues to contribute to that partnership \u2013 simply put, if for the sake of people in both our countries and people around the world.\nAnd now, Dr. Maria Rosario Vergeire from the department of health, the microphone is yours.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS VERGEIRE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much for Honorable Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2013 (in Filipino) \u2013 for being here and attending and joining us in this event.\u00a0 To our U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, MaryKay Carlson; to our USAID colleagues headed by acting Mission Director Betty Chung; to the acting health director, Katherine Tilout, our colleague Dr. Yolanda Oliveros; Dr. Ernesto Bontuyan, and also Ms. Consuelo Anonuevo; of course to our honorable mayor, our very good friend, very dynamic worker, Mayor \u201cHoney\u201d Lacuna-Pangan; and also to their Vice Mayor Yul Servo.\nAs the world embraces the new normal, the Department of Health continues to work tirelessly to ensure that the Filipino people are equipped with accurate health information, preventive health care services, treatment, and vaccination.\u00a0 Since 2020, we have received several donations from the United States to support the country\u2019s COVID-19 prevention and control efforts: 33.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility; different equipment such as mechanical ventilators, ICU beds, and ultra-low freezers; and medicines and hospital supplies.\u00a0 We also received support to our sub-national laboratories for vaccine-preventable diseases.\u00a0 We have also received supplies and equipments coming from the World Health Organization.\nToday we are pleased to witness the ceremonial turnover to the Philippines of these following laboratory equipments and medical supplies coming from the United States: one automated extraction machine for Bulacan Medical Center; 13,000 rapid antigen tests for the Bulacan Medical Center; (inaudible) COVID testing reagents for Philippine Genome Center; 5,000 test kits for the Manila health department; and assorted PPEs and 103 wash kits for the schools of the city of Manila.\nThese donations equate to a massive improvement of the capacity of our public health care system to deliver critical care as part of our arsenal in the fight against COVID-19. \u00a0We express our sincerest gratitude to the United States Government for its unwavering assistance to the Philippines in responding to COVID-19 and protecting Filipinos with much-needed vaccines and technical assistance.\u00a0 Your support helped save the lives of many, many Filipinos.\u00a0 Today, the department of health has administered more than 168 million doses of vaccines.\u00a0 Our BIDA, Resbakuna, and now the Pinas Lakas campaign would not have been successful without your help.\u00a0 We cherish this longstanding health partnership, and we hope that this level of commitment is sustained beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the next few months we will be working to meet Mr. President Bongbong Marcos\u2019 directive, which is to vaccinate 90 percent of our senior citizens and also to administer at least 50 percent to our eligible population for these first booster shots.\u00a0 The department of health aims to achieve this in the first 100 days of this current administration, and your help would be of great aid.\u00a0\u00a0 Recently, we just launched the Pinas Lakas campaign encouraging everyone to get fully vaccinated \u2013 Pinas Lakas campaign encouraging everyone to get fully vaccinated, particularly our senior citizens or our elderly population.\u00a0 We are working hand in hand with other national agencies, our local government units, and our public and private stakeholders, and of course our development partners including USAID, to help prepare our communities \u2013 especially our teachers and children \u2013 as we are opening our schools one hundred percent face to face this school year.\nMore than ever, the pandemic has also emphasized the importance of having universal health care for all, and as we aspire for our universal health care for all Filipino people, DOH is also grateful to USAID for providing technical assistance in preparing us for UHC\u2019s rollout.\u00a0 The DOH, USAID, and others development partners are working collaboratively to establish the management, technical, and financing mechanisms for such an endeavor, strengthening local government capacity and providing technical resources to roll out this priority legislation here in the Philippines.\u00a0 We envision that with this cooperation with the U.S. Government and other partners, we can make health accessible to every Filipino in the coming years.\nFurther, we look forward to sustaining and expanding our partnership to ramp up booster vaccinations, better integrate COVID-19 activities with our universal health care efforts, and thus strengthen our health systems to prevent and respond to further pandemics in the future.\nOn behalf of the department of health, I would like to extend my most fervent gratitude to the United States Government helping the Philippines get back on its feet and build back better.\u00a0 The Filipino people will never forget the kindness you have shown during these trying times.\u00a0 (In Filipino.)\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-philippine-secretary-of-foreign-affairs-enrique-manalo-at-a-virtual-press-availability/",

our friends from the media, both local and the U.S. traveling press corps \u2013 ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\u00a0 It is with great pleasure that I address you today, although only on this virtual platform.\nSecretary Blinken and I just held our first meeting since I assumed my post as secretary of foreign affairs.\u00a0 This was also the Secretary\u2019s first visit to the Philippines and the first of a U.S. Secretary of State since March 2019.\u00a0 What stood out from our discussion was our resounding commitment to sustaining the positive momentum and trajectory of Philippine-U.S. relations.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and I talked extensively about the alliance between our two countries.\u00a0 We also discussed the steps we can take to build on our two-way high-level engagements over the past year, including the 9th bilateral Strategic Dialogue last November where we adopted the Joint Vision for a 21st Century Philippine-United States Partnership.\nWe agreed to work together over the next couple of months in firming up opportunities for our presidents for a possible meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York next month, as well as a possible visit by President Marcos to Washington, D.C. \u2013 their schedules permitting \u2013 in response to an open invitation extended by President Biden.\nIn November, we look forward to hosting here in Manila the 10th bilateral Strategic Dialogue, where we hope to advance our discussions on the full range of political, security, and economic cooperation between our two countries.\u00a0 We also agreed to reconvene the 2+2 Ministerial meeting in early 2023 to further cement the outcomes of these and earlier defense and strategic engagements and ensuring action plans and initiatives.\nWe looked at strengthening our cooperation to better address current and emerging security threats and cross-cutting challenges.\u00a0 We welcome the U.S. Government\u2019s assurances of their readiness to work closely with the new Philippine administration, recognizing the Philippines as a United States equal, sovereign partner in advancing our shared objective of promoting peace and prosperity in the region.\nWe acknowledge the significant challenges we face and the amount of work that still needs to be done in the post-pandemic recovery.\u00a0 The Philippines is grateful for the substantial and critical support of the United States in our COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.\u00a0 The over 33.6 million donated vaccine doses to date is the largest we have received from a single country partner, and these have saved millions of lives and supported our economy and health system.\u00a0 We hope the United States will extend its support to also facilitate investments and capacity building for our local vaccine development, manufacturing, and distribution industry.\nI echo the message of President Marcos on the imperative of attracting capital investments and infrastructure, as well as to mitigate the effects of the food security issues arising from climate change and the conflict in Ukraine.\u00a0 We recognize the important role that the United States can play in ensuring that developing countries like ours can have access to key commodities, including fertilizers.\u00a0 We agreed to continue our discussions to how we can cooperate on accessing fertilizers, lower prices for our farmers, as well as technology that will allow us to modernize and make agriculture in the Philippines more efficient, cost effective, and climate smart.\nIn line with a greater push towards economic cooperation between our two countries, we agreed to flesh out further opportunities for enhanced cooperation that would support efforts to promote resilient supply chains, health systems, and infrastructure, as well as opportunities to collaborate in marine resource management and clean energy, especially nuclear energy. \u00a0We will do so bilaterally and within the context of the United States-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, where the Philippines is a country partner.\nFinally, we touched on the very foundation of our partnership, our common values and shared commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.\u00a0 Recognizing that democracy, whether in the Philippines or the United States, will always be a work in progress, we agreed to maintain open lines of communication.\u00a0 We\u2019re discussing human rights issues.\u00a0 To demonstrate our commitment to dialogue on this matter, I announced today the designation of DFA Undersecretary Theresa P. Lazaro as the Philippine representative to the (inaudible) group preparing for the 2nd U.S.-led Summit for Democracy to be hosted by President Biden in early 2023.\nOur request made to our American partners is also to actively contribute to cultivating a constructive environment within the UN Human Rights Council.\u00a0 Recognizing the importance of financial and technical assistance to support national institutions in the areas of human rights, I urge Secretary Blinken to support Philippine work in the UN joint programme in the Philippines.\nI would like to take this opportunity finally to thank Secretary Blinken for this visit.\u00a0 Indeed, from our meeting, it is clear the U.S. and the Philippines are allies, partners, and friends.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everyone, and Secretary Manalo \u2013 Ricky \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 My thanks to you, to President Marcos, to the people of the Philippines for an incredibly warm welcome.\u00a0 This is a somewhat unusual format for a press conference, but these are unusual times.\u00a0 And I\u2019m simply grateful that you\u2019re feeling well, looking good, and that we\u2019ve been able to meet and have a very good meeting virtually just a little while ago, and now to be able to address our colleagues from the media together as well.\nI wanted to come to the Philippines at the start of the Marcos presidency because the Philippines is an irreplaceable friend, partner, and ally to the United States.\u00a0 This is our oldest alliance in the Indo-Pacific region.\nAs you heard from the Secretary, we share interests, we share values, and we\u2019re profoundly connected by ties of family and friendship that go back literally generations.\u00a0 The United States seeks to work closely with President Marcos, Secretary Manalo, and all of their colleagues to carry forward our alliance \u2013 and make sure the proud history we share into a living history for the benefit of Filipinos and Americans alike.\nToday\u2019s itinerary reflects the scale and scope of our relationship, our partnership.\nThis afternoon, in a short while, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to visit a COVID-19 vaccination clinic to say thank you to the public servants and civil society activists who are leading the fight against COVID here in the Philippines.\u00a0 The United States has been proud to support their excellent work, including by donating more than 33 million doses of safe, effective vaccines with no political strings attached.\nWe\u2019ll continue to work together to end the acute phase of this pandemic and strengthen our shared health security.\nI\u2019ll also visit a clean energy fair, where our countries will sign a new agreement laying the groundwork for one of the first offshore wind power projects in the Philippines.\u00a0 This is the latest in a long line of clean energy collaborations between us, because clean energy is vital for economic growth, it\u2019s vital for innovation, and of course, it\u2019s vital for responding to the climate crisis.\nFood security is another priority that joins our two countries.\u00a0 At a time when food prices are rising and availability is scarcer in many parts of the world \u2013 in part because of the combination of climate change, the effects of COVID-19, and now the consequences of conflict: Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine \u2013 we want to work more closely with the Philippines, both to alleviate any short-term food insecurity, but especially to help continue to build food production capacity here in the Philippines for the long term.\nIn my conversations today with President Marcos and Secretary Manalo, we spoke about deepening our economic relationship.\u00a0 The United States remains a top three trading partner and investor in the Philippines.\u00a0 American firms are among the largest employers, the biggest taxpayers, and highest value exporters here.\nWe want to expand those ties \u2013 through private sector investment, public-private partnerships, and by working together to address leading challenges of the 21st century economy, like shaping emerging technologies, strengthening our supply chains, accelerating the transition to a green economy.\u00a0 These are all pillars of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which the Philippines joined this spring and which reflects our shared vision of a region that\u2019s free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.\nI was struck by something President Marcos said in our meeting today: this is not about getting back to where we were before COVID-19; it\u2019s about moving forward and transitioning all of our economies to the needs, the demands, and the opportunities of the 21st century.\nWe also talked about strengthening democracy.\u00a0 The United States is committed to working collaboratively with the Philippines to defend the rule of the law, protect human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2013 including freedom of expression \u2013 and safeguard civil society.\nThese values are critical to our alliance.\u00a0 They\u2019re essential to building the future that the people of the Philippines want and deserve.\nWe talked as well about our security partnership, and I reiterated our ironclad commitment to the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty and reaffirmed that an armed attack on Philippines\u2019 armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke U.S mutual defense commitments under that treaty.\nIn addition to working with the Philippines to help secure its maritime domain, we also partner with Filipino fisherman and scientific researchers to preserve and protect the Philippines\u2019 precious maritime resources, which are under threat from illegal fishing and environmental destruction by outside actors.\nWe always stand by our partners.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to underscore that because of what\u2019s happening north of here in the Taiwan Strait.\nSince the People\u2019s Republic of China launched nearly a dozen ballistic missiles toward Taiwan two days ago, we\u2019ve been hearing from allies and partners across the region who are deeply concerned about the destabilizing and dangerous actions.\nMaintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is vital, not just for Taiwan but for the Philippines and many other countries.\u00a0 What happens in the Taiwan Strait affects the entire region.\u00a0 In many ways, it affects the entire world because the strait, like the South China Sea, is a critical waterway.\u00a0 Almost half the global container fleet, nearly 90 percent of the world\u2019s largest ships, pass through the Taiwan Strait this year.\u00a0 Since their missile launches, Beijing has taken an irresponsible step of a different kind:\u00a0 They\u2019ve shut down eight different areas where our two countries have been able to work together.\nThose include several military-to-military channels which are vital for avoiding miscommunication and avoiding crisis, but also cooperation on transnational crime and counternarcotics, which help keep people in the United States, China, and beyond safe.\nThey\u2019ve also suspended all climate cooperation with the United States.\u00a0 The world\u2019s largest carbon emitter is now refusing to engage on combatting the climate crisis.\u00a0 Suspending climate cooperation doesn\u2019t punish the United States; it punishes the world, particularly the developing world.\nWe should not hold hostage cooperation on matters of global concern because of differences between our two countries.\u00a0 Others are rightly expecting us to continue to work together on issues that matter to the lives and livelihoods of their people as well as our own.\nThe Philippines knows how alarming this is \u2013 as a nation of thousands of islands, they\u2019re especially vulnerable to climate change.\u00a0 China walking away from climate talks could have lasting consequences for the future of the region \u2013 the future of our planet.\nOur allies and partners across the region have told us in no uncertain terms that they are looking for responsible leadership right now.\u00a0 So let me be clear.\u00a0 The United States doesn\u2019t believe that it\u2019s in the interest of Taiwan, the region, or own national security to escalate this situation.\u00a0 I conveyed that directly to Wang Yi, the PRC\u2019s foreign minister, at the East Asia Summit just yesterday.\nWe\u2019ll keep our channels of communication with China open with the intent of avoiding escalation due to misunderstanding or miscommunication.\nIn the days to come, you will see the United States remaining steady.\u00a0 We\u2019ll stand with the Philippines, with all our allies and partners.\u00a0 We\u2019ll work through regional organizations like ASEAN to enable friends in the region to make their own decisions free from coercion.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to support Taiwan and cross-strait peace and stability because we know that a free and open Indo-Pacific demands it.\nLet me just conclude on a personal note to say it is great to be back in Manila and to say thank you, as well, to our embassy team, led by Ambassador MaryKay Carlson, who only just got here but has already hit the ground running, fully energized, engaged, and I can see that in the meetings that we\u2019ve had today.\u00a0 She and the team are doing outstanding work on behalf of our country.\u00a0 I and we are very grateful to them.\nSo my thanks again, Ricky, to you, to the government, to the people of the Philippines, for the warm hospitality but, even more, for the ongoing partnership and friendship that joins us together.\nThank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Inaudible)\u00a0 I\u2019m going to read the first question that has actually been sent us.\u00a0 This comes from Celerina Monte of NHK.\u00a0 It\u2019s addressed to Secretary Manalo.\u00a0 Her questions reads:\u00a0 \u201cWill the Philippines and the U.S. undertake further defense and military cooperation under the Marcos administration?\u00a0 Please specify.\u00a0 A related question is:\u00a0 Can we expect a regular joint patrol between the Philippines and the U.S in the West Philippines Sea?\u201d Secretary Manalo.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Regarding the first question \u2013 well, first of all, let me begin by saying that our defense and security engagements with the United States continue to be a pillar of our bilateral relationship, and our defense relations are really anchored on the Mutual Defense Treaty, succeeding agreements like the Mutual Logistic Support Agreement, Visiting Forces Agreement, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, as well as the other mechanisms which go along with these various agreements.\nNow, one of these mechanisms is the conduct of joint activities between the Philippines and the United States security forces, including training, military exercise, as well as subject matter exchanges, technical assistance, as well as assistance aimed to facilitate interoperability, improvement of capabilities, as well as readiness to address security concerns, and consultations at different levels on mutual security concerns, to assess security threats,\u00a0 planned activities as well as update procedures and policies are also part of this.\u00a0 A transfer in the nation of defense material to the \u2013 by the United States to the Philippines, including corresponding training and maintenance services in support of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program, is another element of this.\nSo the cooperation facilitated by all of these existing agreements also extends beyond the traditional security issues of defense and maritime security but now also include cooperation areas such as terrorism, cybersecurity, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, as well as pandemics.\nOn the second question regarding the defense and military cooperation, well, first \u2013 oh, excuse me \u2013 on the issue of joint patrols between the Philippines and the United States on the West Philippines Sea \u2013 well, first, let me say very succinctly that in our view, joint patrols between the Philippines and the United States can take place.\u00a0 They are under the ambit of the MDT and also within the context of the Mutual Defense Board and Security Engagement Board.\u00a0 So I think this is an issue which will be continued to be explored bilaterally.\u00a0 And, as I mentioned, there are existing, multiple platforms for which the discussions of this nature could be held.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Our first question, we\u2019ll go to Ryohei Takagi of Kyodo News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I have question for both of you.\nSecretary Blinken, China has suspended regular communications channels with the United States military as well as climate talks in retaliation for Speaker Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan this week.\u00a0 How can the United States keep open lines of communication with the PRC?\nYesterday, you mentioned you talked to Chinese foreign minister in Bali, and not to use \u2013 urged not to use the visit as a kind of pretext of escalation \u2013 for escalation.\u00a0 But China did it.\u00a0 Is there room for diplomacy to work?\u00a0 Will you reach out again to Chinese foreign minister to reduce the tension of Taiwan Strait in the near future?\nAnd then Foreign Minister Manalo, you have mentioned the potential President Marcos visit to\u00a0 Washington.\u00a0 Can you hear me okay?\nFOREIGN MINISTER MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 Yes.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 So when exactly will he go to Washington?\u00a0 Next month?\u00a0 And secondly, the President Marcos mentioned today he didn\u2019t think Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan raised the intensity between the United States and the PRC.\u00a0 So what do you think the root cause of the intensity in Taiwan is?\u00a0 As ASEAN member, how can the Philippines contribute to reduce the tension?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Ricky, I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, let me say that we and the world have an abiding interest in keeping lines of communication open.\u00a0 Even before this unnecessary crisis, we placed an important emphasis on that.\u00a0 As you may recall, I spent about five hours with \u2013 speaking with Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Indonesia, in Bali, just a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0 President Biden has spoken with President Xi, I think, five times over the last 18 or 19 months, including just a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0 The National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Treasury, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs all have engaged their counterparts one way or another and done so repeatedly in past months.\nI think maintaining dialogue is arguably even more important when we\u2019re in a period of heightened tensions, as we are now because of China\u2019s activities around Taiwan.\u00a0 We seek to de\u2011escalate those tensions, and we think dialogue is a very important element of that.\nAnd then I would simply say this:\u00a0 What I\u2019m hearing from countries around the region and countries around the world is that they expect us to maintain our channels of communication.\u00a0 They respect\u00a0\u2013 expect us to responsibly manage our differences.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the United States is determined to do.\nRicky, over to you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Right.\u00a0 Thank you, Tony.\u00a0 On the first question on the possible visit to the United States, yes, President Biden has already invited President Marcos to visit the United States.\u00a0 The issue, of course, now is when that visit will actually take place, which will depend, of course, on the scheduling\u00a0\u2013 on the schedules of both presidents.\u00a0 And if we can come up with a mutual date, then obviously we\u2019ll be able to push through with that visit.\u00a0 So talks will be on trying to find what date might be suitable for both.\nOn the issue of the Taiwan, well, the Philippines and ASEAN have always been ready to see how we can help in any way to reduce the tensions.\u00a0 May I just say at this important point, as mentioned by Tony, it\u2019s \u2013 from a Philippine perspective \u2013 very important that the lines of communication be maintained between the parties concerned, especially as a way of trying to prevent matters from escalating and reducing tensions.\u00a0 And the Philippines will always see how we can encourage to maintain such lines of communication.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Secretaries, the last (inaudible) from our side, it comes from Federico Segarra, EFE, Spanish press agency.\u00a0 \u201cThe harassment from Chinese paramilitary vessels of Philippine fishermen has increased this year, according to diplomatic protests based by the Philippines.\u00a0 Was this issue talked through?\u00a0 And is there any political or military advice from the U.S. to avoid this continuous harassment?\u201d\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Ricky, do you want to start?\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, I think the question here refers to the Chinese maritime militia vessels that appear to be private fishing vessels.\u00a0 Well, we have protested their activities in various areas \u2013 in the one Julian Felipe Reef, the (inaudible), the Pag-asa Island \u2013 and they\u2019ve all been subject to appropriate diplomatic action.\u00a0 And one of our concerns is some of these vessels have been conducting illegal, unregulated fishing, and this is an area where the Philippines certainly has concerns, especially in protecting our legitimate sovereign rights and jurisdiction (inaudible) enforcement, particularly against IUUF.\u00a0 And we have now issued various notes (inaudible) to this effect to China.\nNow, this is an area at the same time where we can have ongoing discussions with the United States in the context of our bilateral relationship, and of course with regional partners.\u00a0 But at the same time, we continue to hold bilateral negotiation or discussions even with China within the framework of our existing dialogue mechanisms so that we can come up with ways to cooperate in this area.\u00a0 So I think it\u2019s in that respect utilizing existing bilateral dialogue mechanisms, as well as regional, where we seek to further address this issue.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And I don\u2019t have much to add because I agree with everything that the secretary said.\u00a0 I would only put one point of emphasis on this problem of illegal fishing.\u00a0 This is something we see here; we see it much more broadly in the South China Sea and beyond.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a direct threat to the livelihoods of thousands, tens of thousands, of people engaged in fishing to support themselves and their families.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a threat because it threatens fish stocks, it threatens the environment in the way it\u2019s done, and what I\u2019m hearing from countries across the region and beyond is this is an issue of particular concern and one that I expect we will all continue to bring focus to.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Dan Flatley of Bloomberg News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I also have a question for you, Secretary Blinken, and for you, Mr. Secretary Manalo.\nSecretary Blinken, you mentioned the ASEAN statement as making the case that the U.S. is not alone in condemning China\u2019s actions.\u00a0 But many in ASEAN were also clearly concerned that Pelosi\u2019s visit provoked China into acting.\u00a0 Now China\u2019s actions are seen as at least understandable by some countries.\u00a0 How do you respond to criticism that Pelosi\u2019s visit did nothing to help the U.S. and Taiwan strategically?\nAnd Secretary Manalo, if I may, last month President Marcos signaled a openness to the idea of doing some military cooperation or coordination with China.\u00a0 Can you tell us a little bit about the status of those talks?\u00a0 I believe they were in the context of trying to reduce tensions.\u00a0 And what is the status of those talks, and how would that affect your relationship both with the U.S. and with China?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Dan, thank you.\u00a0 On the one hand, you have the peaceful visit of Speaker Pelosi and other members of Congress to Taiwan.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had, I think, something like a dozen congressional delegations of one kind or another in this calendar year alone, and there is a long, long history of members of Congress visiting Taiwan.\u00a0 So you have that on the one hand.\nOn the other hand, you have \u2013 allegedly as a reaction to the visit \u2013 the use of the Chinese military; the launching of 11 ballistic missiles, including five that, according to Japan, landed in the sea very near Japan itself; you have military maneuvers, including maneuvers that threatened to impede passage of ships through the Taiwan Strait, something that is vital to global commerce.\u00a0 So the total disproportion between a peaceful visit on the one hand and escalatory military maneuvers on the other I think is very clear, and very clear to countries throughout the region.\u00a0 And certainly that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been hearing as I\u2019ve been here for the last few days.\nBut I think what\u2019s also important to note is that, as we\u2019ve said to our counterparts in Beijing over the last weeks when the possibility of this visit was in the air, don\u2019t use it as a pretext to do what you\u2019ve just done because this is not something that\u2019s happened overnight or in a vacuum.\u00a0 What we\u2019ve seen over the last few years is China engaging in increasingly destabilizing and potentially dangerous actions with regard to Taiwan, and this follows from that.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we say that the change to the status quo that\u2019s prevailed with regard to Taiwan for more than 40\u00a0years is coming from Beijing, not from the United States or anyone else.\nThat status quo is founded on something that was clearly understood for decades, and that is: the differences between Taiwan and the mainland need to be resolved peacefully.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve seen China do over the last few years is move away from a peaceful resolution of differences to doing so coercively and, potentially, forcefully.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s changed.\u00a0 And I think countries throughout the region and around the world are very concerned about that development, and I think what we would hope Beijing would focus on is the fact that for 40 years plus, we\u2019ve managed this problem, this challenge well.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done it in a way that\u2019s avoided any conflict.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done it in a way that\u2019s allowed Taiwan itself to flourish.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s the expectation that countries around the region and around the world have.\u00a0 They certainly expect us, the United States and China, to manage our differences responsibly.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re determined to do.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, thank you.\u00a0 Well, in response to that question, what I can say is that in our discussions when Foreign Minister Wang Yi came here last month, we discussed essentially how to enhance our cooperation by reviving a number of our existing bilateral dialogue mechanisms, such as foreign ministry consultations, and also to consider reviving also or continuing our discussions on the bilateral consultation mechanism, where we discuss issues covering a wide range of areas on the South China Sea.\nSo I think these are the ones which we have\u00a0\u2013 we discussed extensively and as \u2013 in addition, of course, to various areas of economic cooperation.\u00a0 And those are the ones\u00a0\u2013 those are the areas which we will be pursuing with China.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0That concludes (inaudible) press conference\u00a0between Secretary Manalo and Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon.\u00a0 To our visitors, safe travel.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 Ricky, thank you.\u00a0 Good to be with you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY

it just demonstrated how the intensity of the conflict has been.\u00a0 It actually has been at that level for a good while now, but we sort of got used to the idea and then put it aside.\nBut nonetheless, this just demonstrates how volatile the international diplomatic scene is not only in the region \u2013 the obvious \u2013 obviously the events in the Ukraine have been of significant \u2013 of significant importance to, surprisingly, even countries like the Philippines, which we would imagine was very far away.\nSo again, this just points to the fact of the importance of the relationship between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines.\u00a0 I hope that we will continue to evolve that relationship in the face of all the changes that we have been seeing and the changes that are between in our bilateral relationship with the United States.\u00a0 The Mutual Defense Treaty is in constant evolution, as I \u2013 I\u2019d like to think of it.\nAnd as we \u2013 the other, with the United States \u2013 as I spoke \u2013 as we spoke with your ambassador at some length when she came to present her credentials, is that the \u2013 we cannot \u2013 we can no longer isolate one part of our relations from the other.\u00a0 We are too closely tied because of the special relationship within the United States and the Philippines and the history that we have shared, and of course all the assistance and help and support that we have received from the United States over the years.\u00a0 And they can no longer be categorized as one thing or another because they cover such a large \u2013 a large scope.\nSo I am glad that you are able to come and visit the Philippines once more.\u00a0 Unfortunately, with your crushing schedule, I don\u2019t know if you will be able to do any actual visiting, but perhaps you can do some good work while you are here.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. President, thank you so much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great pleasure for me to be back in the Philippines, and it\u2019s an honor for me to have this opportunity to meet you and to speak with you.\u00a0 Thank you so much for receiving us \u2013 so talking about busy schedules, especially with your recent election, I know that you take office, the inbox is very high.\u00a0 The outbox, not quite as high \u2013 so I very much appreciate it.\nAnd I think it really is evidence of exactly what you\u2019re saying, Mr. President.\u00a0 The \u2013 our relationship is quite extraordinary because it is really founded in friendship, it\u2019s forged as well in partnership, and it\u2019s strengthened by the fact that it\u2019s an alliance as well.\u00a0 To your point, the people-to-people ties between us are almost unique, and it\u2019s something that we tremendously value in the United States, just as I know you do here.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also working together as partners in so many different areas, particularly economically, and of course, the alliance is strong and, I believe, can grow even stronger.\nWe\u2019re committed to the Mutual Defense Treaty.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to working with you on shared challenges.\u00a0 But I think what\u2019s so striking to me, Mr. President, is that we are working together on bilateral issues between us, we\u2019re working together in the region, and increasingly, we\u2019re working globally because so many of the challenges we face are global in nature \u2013 whether it\u2019s COVID-19, and we\u2019ve been proud to be your partner in working on that and protecting all of our people; whether it\u2019s climate and the need to deal with that existential challenge; or whether it\u2019s the impact of all of these new technologies on the lives of our people.\nIn these and so many other areas, the work we\u2019re doing together matters.\u00a0 It matters to people back home in the United States, and I hope and believe it matters to people here in the Philippines.\u00a0 So I\u2019m grateful for this opportunity to deepen everything we\u2019ve already been doing, and we\u2019re grateful to be working with you and your administration.\nPRESIDENT MARCOS JR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-philippine-secretary-of-foreign-affairs-enrique-manalo-before-their-virtual-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken At a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Raffles Hotel", "location": "Phnom Penh, Cambodia", "date": "August 5, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019ve had a productive and meaningful two days here in Cambodia.\u00a0 We\u2019ve still got a few meetings to go this afternoon, but it\u2019s been a very productive couple of days so far, and then we\u2019re heading, as you know, to the Philippines later today.\nWe covered a lot of topics here in Phnom Penh, but let me begin with the situation in the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 Yesterday the People\u2019s Republic of China launched nearly a dozen ballistic missiles toward Taiwan.\u00a0 They landed in waters to the northeast, the east, and southeast of the island.\u00a0 Japan reported that five of those missiles landed in its exclusive economic zone, understandably causing them and all of us grave concern.\u00a0 The People\u2019s Liberation Army has now declared seven restricted zones near Taiwan and say that they will extend a range of military exercises through Monday.\nThese provocative actions are a significant escalation.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen how Beijing has attempted to change the status quo on Taiwan for some time \u2013 for example, more than doubling the number of aircraft flown over the centerline that separates China and Taiwan over the past two years; pursuing economic coercion, political interference, cyber-attacks against Taiwan.\u00a0 Now they\u2019ve taken dangerous acts to a new level.\nThe United States has conveyed to the PRC consistently and repeatedly that we do not seek and will not provoke a crisis.\u00a0 President Tsai has said the same thing.\u00a0 China has chosen to overreact and use Speaker Pelosi\u2019s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 We anticipated that China might take steps like this.\u00a0 In fact, we described this exact scenario.\u00a0 The fact is the Speaker\u2019s visit was peaceful.\u00a0 There is no justification for this extreme, disproportionate, and escalatory military response.\nLet me say again that nothing has changed about our \u201cone China\u201d policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Communiques, and the Six Assurances.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want unilateral changes to the status quo from either side.\u00a0 We do not support Taiwan independence.\u00a0 We expect cross-strait differences to be resolved peacefully, not coercively or by force.\nWe\u2019re not alone in this.\u00a0 ASEAN released a statement yesterday about the need to de-escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 The G7 has rejected Beijing\u2019s attempt to coerce and intimidate Taiwan.\u00a0 There are serious concerns not only for Taiwan but for the possibility that these actions by Beijing will destabilize the broader region.\nFor our part, the United States will not be provoked.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to do what we\u2019ve done for a long time.\u00a0 We\u2019ll support cross-strait peace and stability and a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 You\u2019ll see that in the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0 We will stick by our allies and partners and work with and through regional organizations to enable friends in the region to make their own decisions, free from coercion.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take further steps to demonstrate our commitment to the security of our allies in the region, including Japan.\u00a0 We will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to conduct standard air and maritime transits through the Taiwan Strait, consistent with our longstanding approach to working with allies and partners to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, which has enabled the region\u2019s prosperity for many decades.\u00a0 Almost half the global container fleet and nearly 90 percent of the world\u2019s largest ships passed through the straits this year.\u00a0 That\u2019s just one reason why these actions by Beijing are so disruptive.\nWe\u2019ll continue to support Taiwan in cross-strait peace and stability.\u00a0 Secretary Austin has directed that the aircraft carrier\u00a0USS Ronald Reagan\u00a0remain on station in the general area to monitor the situation.\u00a0 In short, the world will see us continue to support the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and advance our shared goals throughout the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 That is what the region expects of us: to be a steady and responsible leader.\nAnother major topic of conversation was the crisis in Burma.\u00a0 The regime\u2019s execution of four democracy activists despite pleas from many \u2013 including the ASEAN chair, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the ASEAN special envoy \u2013 has alarmed and horrified people across the region and around the world.\u00a0 I urge my fellow ministers to continue to press the regime to end its brutal violence, to release those unjustly detained, to allow humanitarian access, and restore Burma\u2019s path to democracy.\u00a0 We also have to increase economic pressure, do more to stop the flows of arms and revenue to the regime, insist on accountability for the atrocities that have been committed, and we strongly urge the international community not to endorse the regime\u2019s plans for sham elections next year.\u00a0 They can be neither free nor fair under present conditions.\nOne of the participants in the East Asia Summit and ASEAN Regional Forum meetings, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, visited with regime leaders in Burma just a few days ago, calling them a friendly partner.\u00a0 That directly flies in the face of ASEAN\u2019s hard work to bring the violence to an end.\nOn the matter of Russia, as we\u2019ve said many times, the Kremlin has not only attacked Ukraine;\u00a0 it\u2019s also attacked the UN Charter and ASEAN\u2019s Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which enshrines the principles of independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and national identity for all nations.\u00a0 Russia is a party to that treaty, as it\u2019s a party to many other agreements that it\u2019s signed over the years and now violates in Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s in the interest of all countries and people in Southeast Asia, the broader Pacific region, and the world that Kremlin end this aggression and its painful global consequences.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard many countries here condemn Russian aggression, just as they did in joining 141 countries at the United Nations for a UN resolution supporting Ukraine and calling for an end to the aggression.\nI want to very much thank Cambodia again for serving as ASEAN chair and also for hosting us this week.\u00a0 The United States is grateful for our cooperation with ASEAN on so many urgent priorities, including fighting COVID-19, addressing the climate crisis, strengthening cyber security, ensuring freedom of navigation, supporting the lawful unimpeded flow of commerce.\u00a0 We support the central role that ASEAN plays in the region, and now we look forward to the summit in November, where we\u2019ll launch the first comprehensive strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States.\nA few hours ago, Yohannes Abraham, a close advisor to President Biden, was confirmed as our next ambassador to the U.S. mission at ASEAN.\u00a0 He will be an excellent partner for all of our friends in ASEAN.\nThis has been my first visit to Cambodia as Secretary of State.\u00a0 I have to tell you I\u2019ve been struck by and deeply appreciate the friendliness, the warmth of the Cambodian people that I\u2019ve had an opportunity to meet and interact with.\u00a0 And I\u2019m also glad to say thank you in person to our outstanding embassy team, led by Ambassador Patrick Murphy.\nYesterday I had the opportunity to meet with a group of alumni from our YSEALI program \u2013 that\u2019s the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative.\u00a0 I met with farmers and food producers from across Cambodia who are partners of ours through the global food security program Feed the Future.\u00a0 In my constructive and candid conversations with Prime Minister Hun Sen and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, we discussed the best way to ensure that all of Cambodia\u2019s people enjoy a bright future by protecting democratic rights, preserving Cambodia\u2019s independence, pursuing inclusive economic growth.\u00a0 The United States looks forward to deepening our partnership with Cambodia on these fronts and many more.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for our longstanding friendship with the Cambodian people, and I thank Cambodia again for showing us such warmth and hospitality these past two days.\nWith that, I am happy to take some questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with David Brunnstrom with Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, I wanted to follow up on your remarks on Taiwan.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard from the U.S. side that it\u2019s maintained communications with China over the fallout from Speaker Pelosi\u2019s visit.\u00a0 Can you tell us how exactly that\u2019s been done?\u00a0 We saw Foreign Minister Wang Yi walk out of yesterday\u2019s dinner, but he was at the EAS today.\u00a0 Have you had any contact with him at all in Cambodia?\u00a0 And has the United States asked Taiwan to show restraint to in response to China\u2019s military activity?\nAnd one more, if I could.\u00a0 We saw you make a point of walking into last night\u2019s dinner with Foreign Minister Hayashi.\u00a0 Was that a show of solidarity with Japan after these missiles?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Let me start with the first \u2013 the last part first.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Hayashi is a good friend and colleague, and sometimes a coincidence is just a coincidence.\u00a0 We happened to be walking in together because we were talking together in advance of the dinner.\u00a0 But irrespective of that, we stand in strong solidarity with our partner and ally, Japan, including with regard to the very dangerous actions that China has taken by firing off these missiles, including five that, according to Japan, landed in its exclusive economic zone.\nWith regard to China more broadly, we have open lines of communication.\u00a0 When I had the opportunity to see Foreign Minister Wang Yi a few weeks ago in Bali, we had a lengthy conversation then about Taiwan.\u00a0 The question of the possibility of the Speaker\u2019s visit came up, and I was extremely clear with him about the importance of not using that visit, if she decided to proceed with it, as some kind of pretext for escalation or other actions that China has now, in fact, taken.\nIn the meeting that we just had with all of the ASEAN foreign ministers, we had a vigorous communication about the situation in and around Taiwan, and I reiterated the points that we\u2019ve made publicly, as well as directly to Chinese counterparts in recent days again about the fact that they should not use the visit as a pretext for escalation, for provocative actions, that there is no possible justification for what they\u2019ve done, and urged them to cease these actions.\nBut I think what\u2019s very important is this is not just our view.\u00a0 It\u2019s the view of many countries throughout this region.\u00a0 I\u2019d refer you to the statement that ASEAN itself put out yesterday.\u00a0 It\u2019s the view of countries well beyond the region, including the G7 countries.\u00a0 You saw the statement that the G7 put out.\u00a0 And we look to China to take account of the views of many countries around the world.\nFor our part, we don\u2019t seek, and do not want, a crisis.\u00a0 We\u2019re prepared to manage what Beijing chooses to do; I think that\u2019s the case for all else involved.\u00a0 And it\u2019s in no one\u2019s interest that this escalate further and that there be any kind of crisis.\u00a0 But we look to Beijing to act accordingly.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Hasanah Isa, PNN TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So good afternoon, sir.\u00a0 I\u2019m Sokheng Pa from VOD Khmer.\u00a0 I have the question, and thank for your remark.\u00a0 Absent your state \u2013 (inaudible) Department of State that you met Prime Minister Hun Sen yesterday, and you urge him to reopen civil and political space before 2023 election.\u00a0 May you have clarify?\u00a0 What do you want Cambodia to do, exactly?\nAnd the second question: Do you wish to see the reinstatement of CNRP and the return of Sam Rainsy and (inaudible) Kem Sokha, for them to join political life?\nAnd late \u2013 CNRP again, the last one is, if \u2013 yes.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Let me say a couple of things.\u00a0 First, we had a very lengthy exchange about a number of issues with the prime minister yesterday.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made clear that our strong desire is for a positive relationship between the United States and Cambodia, one that we would hope to deepen even further.\u00a0 But one of the things that stands in the way of strengthening the relationship between our countries are concerns that are shared about eroding respect for human rights, the weakening of democratic institutions here in Cambodia.\nAs a friend of Cambodia, we\u2019re urging the authorities to uphold the kingdom\u2019s international obligations, its commitments to protect human rights, to protect fundamental freedoms, including those which are also enshrined in Cambodia\u2019s constitution.\u00a0 We made known our concerns.\u00a0 I made known our concerns directly to the prime minister, and we\u2019ll continue to speak in support of multi-party democracy.\u00a0 We are not focused on individuals, personalities, or parties.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on the process and making sure that that process is open, transparent, and allows full and genuine participation by representatives of all the Cambodian people.\nI should also mention that I raised a number of cases of concern when it comes to human rights, and we focused on this both with regard to the systemic challenge and also specific challenges.\u00a0 So I mentioned a number of people where we have concerns, including a dual citizen, Seng Theary.\u00a0 And I met this morning with Kem Sokha, and this is, as you know, a key opposition leader.\u00a0 And again, the purpose is not to support in any way any particular individual, but the principle of the need for democracy, the need for respect for human rights, the need for an open, transparent, participatory system that would only strengthen Cambodia \u2013 strengthen its \u2013 strengthen it at home and strengthen it around the world.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Edward Wong,\u00a0New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 You\u2019ve mentioned several ways in which the U.S. might try and counter some of the aggression that you say you\u2019ve seen from Beijing.\u00a0 All of these are military counterweights that you\u2019ve presented.\u00a0 And I think, in general, there has been a lot of talk from the U.S. Government about new military alliances like AUKUS or partnerships, maybe putting more missiles in the region, things like that.\u00a0 Do you think that there is an inevitable spiral going on in the region, where militarization on all sides is occurring which might lead to greater crises?\nAnd then what do you say to the widespread criticism that the U.S. is refraining from entering into ambitious trade agreements in the region, and is thus missing an economic piece of competing with China here?\u00a0 People say that IPEF is a pale shadow of what TPP is.\nAnd finally, do you have any comments on Brittany Griner\u2019s conviction yesterday in Moscow, and have you spoken with Lavrov about this here?\u00a0 Lavrov told reporters earlier today that he was surprised he hadn\u2019t tried to talk to him about various issues.\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great, thank you.\u00a0 First, there is nothing inevitable about crisis, nothing inevitable about conflict.\u00a0 On the contrary.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us and incumbent upon China to act responsibly and to manage what is a very vigorous competition between us, to manage that competition responsibly.\u00a0 That was very much a key part of the conversation that I had with Wang Yi over \u2013 the foreign minister, over five hours in Bali just a couple of weeks ago, and it reflects what I said today as well, including with all of our ASEAN colleagues.\nI think what we\u2019re hearing around the region is an expectation from all of the countries, virtually all the partners in ASEAN, to do just that.\u00a0 That is our responsibility.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly why we made very clear that we do not want, we do not seek, and we will not take actions to provoke a crisis.\u00a0 We call on China to stand back from the actions it\u2019s taken, which are a serious over-reaction to the peaceful visit of Speaker Pelosi to Taiwan and, I think, consistent with what they\u2019ve been doing for several years now, which is making it clear that they will no longer abide by the status quo when it comes to Taiwan.\nWhat we\u2019ve said all along \u2013 and it\u2019s been the foundation of our management of Taiwan for more than four decades, successfully, in making sure that it was not a source of conflict, and that the people in Taiwan could flourish \u2013 is we have said that the differences between the mainland and Taiwan need to be resolved peacefully, not coercively, not by force.\nSo it is incumbent upon China to continue to seek to resolve those differences peacefully, not to use coercion, and certainly not to use force.\u00a0 But what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years is China moving in that direction.\u00a0 And what we\u2019re hearing from countries around the region is that that\u2019s the last thing that they want.\nI\u2019d add also, we spend a lot of time talking about so many of the challenges that our countries face together:\u00a0 the need, the desire that I think people in all of our countries have to build a sustainable recovery from COVID, to continue to manage global health challenges, to deal with climate change, to pursue the need for an energy transition and new energy infrastructure.\u00a0 These are the kinds of things that our citizens expect us to be working on together.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the United States is committed to doing.\nWhat we don\u2019t seek, and what we don\u2019t want, are efforts by any country, whether it\u2019s China with regard to Taiwan or the South China Sea, or Russia in terms of its aggression against Ukraine, to disrupt international peace and security because it\u2019s incredibly dangerous, it violates basic principles that undergird relations between countries \u2013 for example, sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence \u2013 and it takes time, focus, and attention away from the things that our people want us to be working on together. \u00a0So that was one of the cases that I also made today with the Chinese foreign minister, the Russian foreign minister, and all of our colleagues from ASEAN.\nWith regard to trade, we put forward, as you know, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and it\u2019s gotten an extremely positive response from more than a dozen countries that have signed on to be founding members.\u00a0 And it remains an open, inclusive process, and I expect that other countries will join in.\u00a0 And what IPEF, as the acronym goes, focuses on are economic areas that are going to be critical to the 21st century economy.\u00a0 For example, digital trade.\u00a0 For example, securer supply chains.\u00a0 For example, governance, combatting corruption, all of which are absolutely vital to trade and investment moving forward.\u00a0 Trade facilitation is also a part of that.\nThe response has been extremely positive, and we\u2019re now in the process of really building it together with all of the founding members, shaping the different pillars of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\nWith regard to Brittany Griner and to Paul Whelan, a few things on that.\u00a0 I think, first, we\u2019ve all seen the sentencing, conviction of Brittany Griner to nine years in prison, and that further compounds the injustice that\u2019s being done to her and her wrongful detention.\u00a0 It puts a spotlight on our very significant concern with Russia\u2019s legal system and the Russian Government\u2019s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.\u00a0 The same goes for Paul Whelan.\nWe put forward, as you know, a substantial proposal that Russia should engage with us on.\u00a0 And what Foreign Minister Lavrov said this morning, and said publicly, is that they are prepared to engage through channels we\u2019ve established to do just that, and we\u2019ll be pursuing that.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Sorath Sorn, CamboJA.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 My name is Sorath from CamboJA News.\u00a0 I have the question about the election.\u00a0 After the coming election, the opposition leader will sue by the ruling party as the NEC.\u00a0 And so what do you think about this, and what is your expectation about the Cambodian election next year?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, one of the things \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 One of the things that I shared with the prime minister and other Cambodian interlocutors is our expectation and, I think more important, the expectation of the Cambodian people that elections in Cambodia will be free and fair and genuinely participatory so that everyone in Cambodia can be represented in the elections and, depending on their outcome, in governance.\nOur purpose is not to be for any individual or any party, not at all.\u00a0 As I said earlier, it\u2019s about the process, making sure that there is a genuinely democratic process when it comes to Cambodia\u2019s elections.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to, that\u2019s what I shared with the prime minister.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank

pleasure to welcome you back in the region.\u00a0 And I appreciate very much your presence in this meeting.\u00a0 It shows the U.S. commitment to further strengthen relations with ASEAN.\u00a0 And thank you also for hosting the ASEAN-U.S. Summit in Washington, D.C., on the 12th and 13th of May this year.\nColleagues, we all know that we are living in a very challenging time.\u00a0 While COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, WHO has declared monkeypox as another public health emergency of international concern.\u00a0 In the meantime, the war in Ukraine continues.\u00a0 This situation creates significant impacts to the world, in particular the developing countries.\u00a0 Food and energy insecurity became more (inaudible) than before.\u00a0 The financial space is tightening.\u00a0 The question is:\u00a0 How can ASEAN-U.S. partnership help to ease these situations?\nColleagues, the Indo-Pacific is the future of our region.\u00a0 Our future will depend on how we manage the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 The Indo-Pacific region should not be approached with an either/or mindset, but rather with the mindset of Indo-Pacific cooperation, strategic trust, and, last but not least, always upholding the international laws.\u00a0 We have no other option but to vigorously reinforce this view.\u00a0 For Indonesia and ASEAN, it is very important to have concrete cooperation with partners, including with the U.S. \u2013 a win-win cooperation that can contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.\nSecretary Blinken, colleagues, in this challenging time, what the world needs is the wisdoms and responsibility of all leaders, all of us, to ensure peace and stability.\nMy last point \u2013 and this is very important \u2013 we are very glad that work is underway to elevate the ASEAN-U.S. relation into a comprehensive and strategic partnership, and I am sure that this new level of partnership will be a good avenue for us to further strengthen our relation.\u00a0 And I look forward to facilitating a fruitful discussion today with you, Tony.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nNow I would like to invite my co-chair to deliver his opening remarks.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, the floor is yours.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Foreign Minister, Retno, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you for your good and kind words.\u00a0 Thank you especially for Indonesia\u2019s support as the country coordinator for the United States at this meeting and throughout these past months.\u00a0 It\u2019s greatly appreciated.\u00a0 And let me also thank very much our hosts for (inaudible) \u2013 for today, tomorrow \u2013 Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, for hosting us in Phnom Penh and for Cambodia\u2019s leadership as chair of ASEAN this year.\nBefore I go further, I want to speak to the recent activity concerning Taiwan, because I know it\u2019s on people\u2019s minds.\u00a0 The United States continues to have an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 We oppose any unilateral efforts to change the status quo, especially by force.\u00a0 We remain committed to our \u201cone China\u201d policy, guided by our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Communiqu\u00e9s, and the Six Assurances.\nAnd I want to emphasize nothing has changed about our position, and I hope very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretext to increase its aggressive military activity.\u00a0 We, and countries around the world, believe that escalation serves no one and could have unintended consequences that serve no one\u2019s interests, including ASEAN members and including China.\u00a0 We\u2019ve reached out to engage our PRC counterparts in recent days at every level of government to convey this message.\u00a0 Maintaining cross-strait stability is in the interests of all countries in the region, including all of our colleagues within ASEAN.\nThis year, we proudly mark 45 years of ASEAN-U.S. relations.\u00a0 Even as we mark those 45 years, we\u2019re looking to the future.\u00a0 And as we look to the future, the United States is determined to deepen and strengthen our partnership with ASEAN to meet the challenges of this moment, challenges that are affecting citizens in all of our countries.\u00a0 We are committed to ASEAN centrality.\u00a0 We strongly support the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and we wholeheartedly endorse the values upon which the outlook is based: openness, inclusivity, commitment to the rule of law, good governance, and \u2013 Retno, as you said \u2013 respect for international law.\u00a0 These values are also at the heart of our own Indo-Pacific strategy.\u00a0 Our strategy and the ASEAN Outlook are very coincident in their approach.\nAs President Biden said at the ASEAN-U.S. Special Summit in May, we\u2019re launching a new era in ASEAN-U.S. relations.\u00a0 And to name just a few examples of our cooperation, last September U.S. Secretary of Energy Granholm participated in the ASEAN-U.S. Energy Ministerial to deepen cooperation on shared goals, like promoting renewables and emerging energy technologies.\nJust this past May, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Becerra joined the ASEAN-U.S. Ministerial on Health.\u00a0 We\u2019re expanding cooperation on global health, health care delivery, including improved disease surveillance, stronger health workforces, increased access to primary care.\u00a0 This will help lift up all of our populations, not only in dealing with things like pandemics that we\u2019ve been grappling with for the last couple of years, but as a general matter in strengthening our health care systems to the benefit of all of our citizens.\nAt the special summit between the United States and ASEAN in May, our Special Presidential Envoy on Climate John Kerry led the discussion on working together to achieve global and regional decarbonization goals.\u00a0 We very much hope to continue this conversation at a U.S.\u2011ASEAN Climate Ministerial very soon.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve done a dialogue on transportation, as well as the first-ever ministerial on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment.\nIn short, we\u2019re working together across an incredibly wide range of issues that are central to the prosperity and security of our combined one billion people.\nAs we look ahead to the November ASEAN-U.S. summit, we\u2019re laying the foundations for a comprehensive strategic partnership so that we can expand our cooperation into even more areas, including maritime security, public health, cybersecurity.\u00a0 We also hope to increase cooperation with ASEAN throughout the broader region.\u00a0 For example, with the Quad and within the Indo\u2011Pacific Economic Framework (inaudible) for your ideas to advance that kind of cooperation and collaboration.\nTo guide all these efforts, President Biden selected his great longtime advisor Yohannes Abraham, an exceptional public servant, as our next ambassador to the U.S. Mission at ASEAN.\u00a0 If confirmed, I can tell you from personal experience he will be an excellent partner for ASEAN.\nEarlier today, I had a chance to meet with a group of young people from all across the region who are participating in the U.S. program called YSEALI, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative.\u00a0 To date, more than 5,000 young people are alumni of YSEALI exchanges.\u00a0 More than 150,000 belong to the YSEALI network.\u00a0 They represent the extraordinary talent and dedication of young people across Southeast Asia, who are eager to contribute to their countries progress and help shape a shared future.\nSo it was very inspiring to sit with them and hear from them, and now it\u2019s inspiring for me to be able to sit with each of you.\u00a0 And so I look forward \u2013 Retno, colleagues \u2013 to speaking with each of you over the next two days about how we can ensure that this partnership, which really will shape the future for generations to come, can continue and even more effectively deliver for our people.\nSo with that, Foreign Minister, back to you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MARSUDI:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And I now kindly request the media to leave the room, as we will start the closed session.\n\n"},

strongly about.\u00a0 Because, as you know from your own experience, it\u2019s doing so many wonderful things to connect some of the most remarkable members of the younger generation here in Cambodia and throughout Southeast Asia with the United States, with young Americans, with our leading universities, and hopefully not only giving you some experience and knowledge and tools to build on the things that you want to do back home, but also creating remarkable networks among each other that last well beyond your formal participation in the program.\nCambodia is going to be hosting the next big session of YSEALI later this year.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s an opportunity to bring together another remarkable generation of young people.\u00a0 So we\u2019re really, really looking forward to that.\u00a0 And at the same time, there\u2019s a very strong network here in Cambodia, the thousands of Cambodians who are part of the YSEALI network, the 300 or so alumni at this point.\u00a0 But I\u2019m eager to learn from you about your experience with the program but also, especially, the work that you\u2019re doing, the experience you\u2019re having working to help protect the environment, to deal with the challenges that all of our countries face with climate change to build a really sustainable future where people all across Cambodia can provide for themselves, provide for their country.\nI was just \u2013 by the way, I came from a wonderful program that we have with Cambodians who are in the agricultural sector, and I saw some of these remarkable products that we\u2019ve helped build partnerships to produce and export, from cashew nuts to mangos, but done in an environmentally protective way.\u00a0 And all of this is, I think, a tremendous possibility in the future of making sure that we are doing what\u2019s necessary both to protect our planet but also to give our people opportunity.\u00a0 And I know that each of you in different ways is working on that.\u00a0\nSo I\u2019m eager to not talk and really to listen to each of you and to have a conversation.\u00a0 So why don\u2019t I stop there and we can open it up.\nMS GARCIA:\u00a0\u00a0All right.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 Well, to open it up \u2013 oh, I think they want to clap.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Good, good.\u00a0 So to open it up, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Cynthia Chen (ph), who is going to start us off with a brief story about her experience.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So good morning, Mr. Secretary, and good morning, Mr. Ambassador, and good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Really, thank you for coming here and (inaudible) with YSEALI.\u00a0 (Inaudible) ambassador working on the topic of fish migration and the chain of water quality and (inaudible) the Mekong River.\u00a0\nBefore YSEALI, I was not doing so good at school, but along the way I did a (inaudible).\u00a0 And I was surrounded by a lot of great people, and they kept telling me that you did a great job and you should apply to YSEALI.\u00a0 But I keep \u2013 I have a certain doubt because of my GPA is only 2.0, and I kept questioning my ability to learn and to grow.\u00a0 But with them to encourage me to apply to YSEALI, and I passed YSEALI, and during the fellowship I actually met with one inspiring woman named Susie Lacey (ph).\u00a0 It\u2019s the best (inaudible).\u00a0 And she said to me, like, the first thing is come and tell us in front of us young people that \u2013 the YSEALI fellows.\u00a0 She said that thank you, and America is glad to have you here, and what you did matters for this generation and the next generation.\nAt the moment I feel, like, awake because really, those things and \u2013 I mean, like, we really have those things as we as Cambodians.\u00a0 And we are young.\u00a0 We are very energetic.\u00a0 And with those support, those acknowledgements, those recognitions, we feel like it helps us to live just like a quarter of (inaudible) say that it\u2019s never too young to live.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 What you said is really important because \u2013 and it\u2019s especially important for me to hear that because one of the things that happens is as you get older \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 you kind of get more and more set in your ways.\u00a0 Even if you try to have the most open mind possible, we all are the product of our own experiences and what we\u2019ve done.\u00a0 And the most important thing is for all of you, this generation and the generation that will follow you, to make sure that we are thinking in fresh ways and new ways about the challenges we face.\u00a0\nAnd the simple truth is this just because we did something one way for the last 50 years doesn\u2019t mean we need to do it the same way for the next 50 years.\u00a0 So your ability to think anew about things, to look at maybe how we can do something better, and then to challenge all of us who may be in positions of responsibility to do the same thing \u2013 that\u2019s the most important thing.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we make progress.\u00a0 So thank you.\u00a0\nMS GARCIA:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 With that, I would like to invite our friends from the press to please step outside.\n"}, {"url":

Blinken.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone, and it\u2019s wonderful to be with all of you here, to see you all here.\u00a0 Patrick, thank you not just for the introduction but for your remarkable leadership of this mission every single day.\u00a0 And thanks to everyone who\u2019s joined us here today, especially our wonderful colleagues from USAID in our \u2013 in mission after mission around the world, where, as we would say, the rubber really meets the road.\u00a0 It is through our AID missions.\u00a0 They do remarkable work in place after place to create the most powerful connectivity possible between ourselves and our host countries, including here in Cambodia, by bringing to life powerful projects that make a difference in lives and livelihoods and futures.\u00a0\nSo I\u2019m glad to be with our USAID colleagues and our Cambodian partners.\u00a0 I met a few of them just a moment ago, and these are remarkable, dedicated entrepreneurs who are committed not just to their own success but to their country\u2019s success.\u00a0 I got a chance to sample some of the remarkable products that they\u2019re producing with assistance from the United States, and I can tell you firsthand this is good stuff.\u00a0 I happen to be an afficionado of cashews.\u00a0 Well, Cambodia is the number one cashew producer, exporter in the world, and I just tried some very good cashews, wonderful mango products and other things, beautiful vegetables, incredible things that are making a difference in lives.\nSo about 12 years ago, the United States launched an initiative called Cambodia Harvest, and that was part of our flagship global food security program called Feed the Future.\u00a0 The idea behind Feed the Future is that when it comes to chronic food insecurity, food aid is vital but it is not enough.\u00a0 We have the knowhow to improve farming across all climates, across all income levels, so that countries have their enduring capacity to produce their own food.\u00a0 It\u2019s the classic example of the old adage about give a person a fish, feed them for a day; teach them to fish, feed them for a lifetime.\u00a0 Feed the Future is all about that: creating self-sufficiency, creating indigenous productive capacity, investing in that, investing in that future.\u00a0\nWith the right partnerships, countries become more food secure.\u00a0 People\u2019s health improves.\u00a0 Poverty is reduced.\u00a0 The need for food aid itself goes down.\u00a0 Here in Cambodia, our two countries have worked together to increase crop yields, to improve the health of livestock, to promote climate resilience, to train farmers, to create new markets.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeing strong results.\u00a0 So as I met some of the individuals behind the numbers just now, they were kind enough to share some of the work that they\u2019re doing, to share their cashews, their mangos with us.\u00a0 This event is actually a diversion because as we\u2019re doing it, I made sure that my team is taking the wonderful baskets of produce so that we can bring them back with us.\u00a0\nBut it \u2013 in all seriousness, you can see the demonstrable impact of the partnership, and that\u2019s a powerful thing.\u00a0 We often deal in big issues of policy that sometimes are abstractions.\u00a0 It is particularly gratifying to see the tangible results of this partnership between the United States and Cambodia.\nThrough our partnership, Bun Sieng has helped provide technical support to farmers across the country.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for that.\u00a0 Holly Mio\u2019s (ph) team used grants for our program to expand the Dry Food Company internationally.\u00a0 And so we see that resonating around the world, not just here in Cambodia.\u00a0 Dara An built new cashew processing facilities with a Harvest grant.\u00a0 And Sothea Mao runs a food export and distribution business with our support; she signed a deal to distribute a local company\u2019s fruit in Cambodia and beyond.\u00a0 So congratulations for the remarkable work that each of you is doing.\u00a0 We\u2019re proud to be your partners.\nWe want to build on these successes.\u00a0 So today we\u2019re announcing the next phase of our collaboration, and it\u2019s called Harvest III.\u00a0 It will launch next week.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to provide up to $25 million over the next five years.\u00a0 So what will it do?\u00a0 It will continue to help farmers boost their incomes \u2013 for example, by increasing access to tools like greenhouses, which can help lengthen growing seasons, improve the quality of what\u2019s grown, and help products actually meet market standards. \u00a0We want to reach more farmers, especially women and young people, to make sure that they\u2019re reaping the benefits of these investments as well.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll help connect more Cambodian farmers and businesses to markets both here at home and abroad.\u00a0\nMore than 60 percent of Cambodians live in rural areas.\u00a0 You heard the ambassador speak to this.\u00a0 More than three-quarters of those households rely on agriculture, fisheries, or forestry as their main sources of income.\u00a0 Many of these workers have only limited access to markets or financing.\u00a0 We want to change that so that more people can enjoy Cambodian products and more farmers and entrepreneurs can grow their businesses.\u00a0\nWith this new phase, we\u2019re basically expanding our scale.\u00a0 The last stage of our program that was called Harvest II worked in select provinces.\u00a0 Harvest III will be nationwide.\u00a0 Harvest II focused on fruits, vegetables, spices.\u00a0 Harvest III will add grains, fish, other products.\u00a0 We\u2019re almost tripling the amount of grant money available to our partners.\u00a0 We believe in this program.\u00a0 We believe in our partners.\u00a0 And we want to do a lot more good work together.\u00a0\nThe needs are urgent.\u00a0 Far too many Cambodians still live in food insecurity.\u00a0 Far too many Cambodian children are malnourished.\u00a0 As a parent myself, whenever I see this, it goes right to the heart.\u00a0 I think each of us who\u2019s fortunate, when we see a malnourished child, we think \u2013 if we have children, we think of our own.\u00a0 We think of our families.\u00a0 And we want to do everything we possibly can to make sure that no child on Earth is malnourished.\nThis is a humanitarian issue.\u00a0 It\u2019s a health issue. \u00a0It\u2019s an economic issue.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a security issue because widespread hunger makes communities and countries less secure, particularly now when food insecurity around the world is on the rise because of Russia\u2019s war of aggression on Ukraine, which has blocked millions of tons of Ukrainian crops from being shipped to global markets.\u00a0 It\u2019s critical that we strengthen global food security and that we address the root causes of hunger, of malnutrition, and of poverty.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the United States and our partners have been doing in Cambodia and in more than 40 countries where Feed the Future operates.\u00a0\nSo let me say again how grateful we are to all of our partners across Cambodia, like our friends Bun, Holly, Sothea, Dara, who work hard every day to produce food, to grow their businesses as well, to support their families, to contribute to their communities, to share the bounty of Cambodia with people across the country but also around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to be part of your journey.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-indian-external-affairs-minister-subrahmanyam-jaishankar-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Very good to see you all here in New York at the United Nations, and I have to say that I\u2019m very pleased to be here on behalf of the administration, on behalf of the United States to help kickoff a critical 30 days \u2013 the Review Conference for the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nThis has now been in force for 50 years.\u00a0 It\u2019s made a powerful difference to the world in making the world a safer place, making it less dangerous, making sure that countries with nuclear weapons, including the United States, pursue disarmament; making sure that countries that don\u2019t have nuclear weapons do not acquire them by upholding and strengthening nonproliferation; and making sure that countries can engage in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, something that is even more vital as we deal with the challenges posed by climate change.\nThis is a critical moment for the NPT.\u00a0 It\u2019s a challenging one too because different parts of this regime are under challenge.\u00a0 And of course, we see that particularly in the area of nonproliferation when we have challenges being posed by Iran, by North Korea, and now in different ways, by Russia.\nSo the next 30 days, the work that\u2019s being done here by countries around the world to reaffirm the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to strengthen it, to strengthen each one of its pillars \u2013 disarmament, nonproliferation, peaceful use \u2013 is more vital than it\u2019s ever been.\nThe United States will be here in force over the next month.\u00a0 We have about 60 people on our team who will be here every single day working with any and every country around the world that seeks to strengthen this very, very vital regime, a treaty that has made a huge difference over the last 50 years and needs to continue to make a difference over the next 50 years.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Pam, go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much Ned and thank you \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Nice to see you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 It\u2019s Pamala Falk from CBS News.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yes. \u00a0Good to see you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0We heard some pretty dire forecasts this morning from the Secretary General about nuclear annihilation.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Mm-hmm.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0How worried are you about Russia-occupied nuclear plants in Ukraine like Zaporizhzhia \u2013 that doesn\u2019t have supervision \u2013 or Chernobyl?\u00a0 And what is your worst fear about, say, Speaker Pelosi\u2019s trip to China?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first on Russia and Ukraine, step back for just one second.\u00a0 Recall that when the Soviet Union dissolved, nuclear weapons were left on the territory of three new countries: Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine.\u00a0 Ukraine had the confidence to give up the weapons that it inherited when the Soviet Union dissolved because of commitments that Russia made to respect and protect its sovereignty, its independence, its structural integrity.\u00a0 The fact that Russia has now done exactly the opposite, that it\u2019s attacked Ukraine unprovoked in an effort to erase that sovereignty and independence \u2013 that sends a terrible message to countries around the world that are making decisions about whether or not to pursue nuclear weapons.\u00a0 So just stepping back, it\u2019s usually important to recognize that.\nSecond, and more practically speaking in the immediate, we\u2019re deeply concerned about the fact that Russia has taken over nuclear facilities in Ukraine, particularly in Zaporizhzhia, one of the largest nuclear facilities in Europe.\u00a0 There are credible reports, including in the media today, that Russia is using this plant as the equivalent of a human shield, but a nuclear shield in the sense that it\u2019s firing on Ukrainian from around the plant.\u00a0 And of course, the Ukrainians cannot and will not fire back, lest there be a terrible accident involving a nuclear plant.\u00a0 So this is the height of irresponsibility.\u00a0 It\u2019s vitally important that the IAEA get access to understand what\u2019s happening in these facilities and to make sure that they continue to be used in ways that uphold all of the necessary commitments on safety and security at the plants.\nWith regard to Taiwan, first, the Speaker will make her own decisions about whether or not to visit Taiwan.\u00a0 Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government.\u00a0 The decision is entirely the Speaker\u2019s.\u00a0 What I can say is this: this is very much precedent in the sense that previous speakers visited Taiwan.\u00a0 Many members of Congress go to Taiwan, including this year.\u00a0 And so if the Speaker does decide to visit, and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions, that would be entirely on Beijing.\u00a0 We are looking for them, in the event she decides to visit, to act responsibly and not to engage in any escalation going forward.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 NBC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The Japanese \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary \u2014\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 NBC, go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The Japanese \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, on the topic of grain, we know that a ship was able \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yes.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 \u2014 to leave the port of Odesa today carrying 26,000 (inaudible) of grain across the sea.\u00a0 Can you give us an update on how that\u2019s going?\u00a0 Do you expect more to get out to help the food shortage?\u00a0 And also, is that a sign that tensions might be easing?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So this is a good and important first step.\u00a0 We were pleased to see that the first ship did move.\u00a0 It does have 26-, 27,000 tons of grain, but keep in mind there are something like 20 million tons that are in silos and in storage in Ukraine that\u2019s been held back by the Russian blockade of Odesa up until now, and it needs to get out.\u00a0 It needs to get out to world markets, it needs to get to places where people are in desperate need of food, it needs to get out so that prices also continue to go down, not up.\nThe test will be in the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0 It\u2019s a start, it\u2019s important.\u00a0 I have to say that the leadership of Secretary-General Guterres and the United Nations has been absolutely instrumental in getting us to this day when at least we see the first ship moving.\u00a0 But the test is now really in the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0 More ships need to move, more grain needs to get to market.\u00a0 That\u2019s what will really make a difference.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Reuters, Michelle.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Did you talk to Prime Minister Kishida \u2014\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Reuters \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Michelle Nichols from Reuters.\u00a0 You mentioned this morning that a return to the Iran nuclear deal would be the best outcome for the world.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Iranian officials have signaled a willingness to return to talks.\u00a0 Is the United States ready to return to talks?\u00a0 And has Speaker Pelosi told you she\u2019s stopping in Taiwan tomorrow?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Second part first.\u00a0 We do not know what Speaker Pelosi intends to do, but again, that is entirely her decision, and one that we respect one way or the other.\nSecond, with regard to the JCPOA, we continue to believe, as I said this morning, that that would be the best path forward, a return to compliance on both sides to the JCPOA, to make sure that we are putting Iran\u2019s nuclear program back in a box and averting any kind of crisis.\u00a0 The EU has put forward a best proposal based on many, many months of discussions, negotiations, conversations.\u00a0 It\u2019s very consistent with something that they put forward in March that we agreed to that we would pursue in March, but we \u2013 it remains to be seen whether Iran is willing and able to move forward.\nSo we remain prepared to move forward on the basis of what\u2019s all been agreed.\u00a0 It is still unclear whether Iran is prepared to do that.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question right here.\u00a0 Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sir.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Did you talk to Prime Minister Kishida about Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan?\u00a0 And did you share any concern about it?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 I did not speak to the Prime Minister about that.\u00a0 I did have the opportunity to speak to him briefly this morning simply to say how powerful it is that he\u2019s here on day one of the Non-Proliferation Review Conference.\u00a0 It sends a very strong message around the world.\u00a0 Japan\u2019s commitment to disarmament, to nonproliferation, to the peaceful use of nuclear energy is both as a matter of history and as a matter of Japan\u2019s leadership role in the world vitally important, and I think the Prime Minister sent a very strong message by being here today on day one of the conference.\u00a0 And I just thanked him very much for doing that.\nThank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you everyone.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "UN Headquarters", "location": "New York, New York", "date": "August 1, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 Secretary General Guterres, President Zlauvinen \u2013 thank you \u2013 Director General Grossi:\u00a0 Thank you all for your longstanding leadership on nonproliferation.\nI noted that Prime Minister Kishida of Japan is here as well this morning, which sends a very powerful message.\u00a0 Earlier this year, he reaffirmed Japan\u2019s commitment to nonproliferation in a joint statement with President Biden.\nAnd a very special thanks to the foreign ministers, the deputy foreign ministers, the teams who have traveled to New York for these meetings and to get us off to a good start.\nIt\u2019s great to be with you all here in person today, especially \u2013 especially \u2013 given the critical role the NPT has played in upholding the global nonproliferation regime.\nMore than five decades ago, at the height of the Cold War, representatives of 18 nations drafted the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nIn the years that followed, nearly every country on Earth has joined the NPT.\nCountries put safeguards in place to monitor their nuclear programs.\nNuclear weapon states moved toward disarmament, including the United States.\u00a0 The number of nuclear weapons in our stockpile is now nearly 90 percent lower than it was at its height in 1967.\nThe United Nations Security Council affirmed that proliferation constituted a threat to international peace and security.\nEntire regions \u2013 the South Pacific, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Africa \u2013 joined Latin America and the Caribbean in declaring themselves nuclear weapons-free zones.\nAnd we saw countries use nuclear technology safely and peacefully to improve the lives of millions of people on Earth.\nSo there is no question that the NPT has made the world safer.\u00a0 But there\u2019s also no doubt that it\u2019s under increasing strain.\nAnd so we come together at a critical moment.\nThe DPRK continues to expand its unlawful nuclear program and continues its ongoing provocations against the region.\u00a0 As we gather today, Pyongyang is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test.\nIran remains on a path of nuclear escalation.\u00a0 Although it publicly claims to favor return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, since March, Iran has been either unwilling or unable to accept a deal to achieve precisely that goal.\u00a0 Getting back to the JCPOA remains the best outcome \u2013 for the United States, for Iran, for the world.\nIn January, President Biden and the leaders of the other NPT nuclear weapon states \u2013 China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom \u2013 all affirmed the principle that, and I quote, \u201ca nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\u201d\nThe very next month, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 And it\u2019s engaged in reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling, with its president warning those supporting Ukraine\u2019s self-defense, quote, \u201crisk consequences\u2026such as you have never seen in your entire history,\u201d end quote.\nRussia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine is a brazen violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter, and it\u2019s also contrary to the rules-based international order that we all seek to uphold.\u00a0 But critically, and it\u2019s directly relevant to what brings us together this month for the NPT Review Conference, its actions are also contrary to the assurances that it provided to Ukraine in 1994 in the so-called Budapest Memorandum, assurances of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence that were vital to giving Ukraine the confidence to give up the nuclear weapons it inherited when the Soviet Union dissolved and that were left on its territory.\nSo what message does this send to any country around the world that may think that it needs to have nuclear weapons to protect, to defend, to deter aggression against its sovereignty and independence? The worst possible message. And so it\u2019s directly relevant to what\u2019s going on here this month at the United Nations.\nMost recently, we saw Russia\u2019s aggression with its seizure of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest such plant in all of Europe.\u00a0 Russia is now using the plant as a military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can\u2019t and won\u2019t shoot back because they might accidentally strike a nuclear \u2013 a reactor or highly radioactive waste in storage.\u00a0 That brings the notion of having a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level.\nThe United States believes that all nuclear-armed states have a duty to act responsibly.\u00a0 We\u2019ve chosen to act with restraint and avoid actions that could unintentionally add to nuclear tensions \u2013 for example, by forgoing previously scheduled ICBM tests and not raising the alert status of our nuclear forces in response to Russian saber-rattling.\u00a0 There is no place in our world \u2013 no place in our world \u2013 for nuclear deterrence based on coercion, intimidation, or blackmail.\u00a0 We have to stand together in rejecting this.\nTogether with the United Kingdom and France, we\u2019ve released a set of principles and best practices that should be expected of every responsible NPT nuclear weapon state, among them that every effort has to be made to ensure that nuclear weapons are not used again.\nThe United States is committed to reducing the role of nuclear weapons and re-establishing our leadership on arms control, and we\u2019ve undertaken a deliberate policy review toward that goal.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to emphasize strategic stability, seek to avoid costly arms races, facilitate risk reduction and arms control agreements wherever they are possible.\nAny country that asks others to reject the pursuit of nuclear weapons also has to be willing to reduce \u2013 and eventually, eliminate \u2013 their own stockpiles of nuclear weapons.\nPresident Biden\u2019s commitment to disarmament has long been evident.\u00a0 Just two weeks into his term, he extended the New START Treaty with Russia until 2026, and that\u2019s made our countries and our world safer by preserving verified restrictions on our strategic nuclear arsenals and avoiding an arms race.\u00a0 Earlier today, he reiterated his readiness to negotiate expeditiously a framework to replace New START, if Russia is prepared to operate in good faith.\nWe continue to adhere to our policy not to use \u2013 or threaten to use \u2013 nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states that are party to the NPT and are in compliance with their nuclear nonproliferation obligations.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to implement, to the fullest extent possible, the commitments contained in the final documents of previous NPT Review Conferences.\nAnd as long as nuclear weapons exist, the fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attacks on the United States, on our allies, and partners.\u00a0 The United States would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States, its allies, and partners.\nAt this Review Conference, we hope to make tangible progress on all three pillars of the NPT \u2013 nonproliferation, disarmament, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy \u2013 and we\u2019ll work with all states parties to a successful outcome.\nThe world must reject the spread of nuclear weapons.\nThat starts with demanding compliance by all NPT state parties, ensuring we have safeguards in place to monitor ourselves, strengthening the IAEA\u2019s ability to implement those safeguards.\u00a0 We\u2019re encouraging states to adopt a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and an Additional Protocol, which will represent together the most rigorous standard of verification.\nIf any NPT state party does pursue nuclear weapons, we have to act as one to bring them back into compliance.\nEven as we verify that countries are not using their nuclear programs to pursue nuclear weapons, we also have to ensure that the programs are safe and secure.\nI commend Director General Grossi for his work promoting the safety and security of existing facilities, and especially for all that he\u2019s done to help prevent a nuclear catastrophe in Ukraine.\nThis Review Conference is also an invaluable opportunity to discuss how to reduce the risk of nuclear conflict and the chance of miscommunication during a crisis.\nThe United States is committed to pursuing a comprehensive risk reduction package, including creating secure communications channels among nuclear weapon states.\u00a0 We stand ready to work with all partners, including China and others, on risk reduction and strategic stability efforts.\nAs we look to the future, we also have to strengthen agreements preventing nuclear conflict \u2013 and create new ones.\nTo cap the growth of nuclear arsenals anywhere in the world, we continue to support the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty.\u00a0 We also stand ready to begin working with partners to restart negotiations this year on the long delayed Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty.\nFinally, we remain focused on enhancing the peaceful uses of nuclear technology.\nNuclear energy technologies are helping the world to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and fight the climate crisis, giving farmers new tools to boost crop yields and tackle global food insecurity, improving our ability to screen for dangerous diseases, and preventing the next pandemic.\nThe United States wants to expand access to these essential benefits for NPT states parties.\nTogether with the United Kingdom, we\u2019re launching the Sustained Dialogue on Peaceful Uses to find new ways to use peaceful nuclear energy technology to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe\u2019re also supporting clean energy innovations \u2013 like small nuclear reactors \u2013 to combat climate change, ensure reliable access to nuclear power.\u00a0 At the G7 Leaders\u2019 Summit in Germany just last month, President Biden announced $14 million in funding to support the deployment of small modular reactor power plants in Romania, which will provide zero-emissions nuclear energy.\nNow, some have asked about our new partnership with the United Kingdom and Australia, known as AUKUS.\u00a0 Through this partnership, Australia will acquire submarines.\u00a0 I want to emphasize that these submarines will be nuclear powered, not nuclear armed.\u00a0 Other countries have this kind of submarine.\u00a0 And these will adhere to the highest safety and nonproliferation standards under the NPT.\u00a0 We\u2019re working very closely with the IAEA to make sure that that\u2019s the case.\nAs we work together across the three pillars of the NPT, we build upon the efforts of so many who have come before us in this room.\nLast month, we lost one of those leaders: former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was deeply committed to nuclear nonproliferation throughout his career.\nIn 2016, Prime Minister Abe and President Obama made an historic visit to Hiroshima together \u2013 a place that represents the enormous destruction that nuclear weapons make possible.\nThere, President Obama said \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cWe must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them,\u201d end quote.\nPrime Minister Abe said this: \u201cWe are determined to realize a world free of nuclear weapons. No matter how long or how difficult the road [may] be.\u201d\nThat has to remain the charge for each of us here \u2013 to escape the logic of fear and live up to our responsibility to prevent nuclear conflict, to reduce nuclear weapons, to secure nuclear technologies, to advance peace and progress around the world.\nThank you very much.\n(Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-before-his-meeting-with-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty-npt-non-nuclear-states-parties-on-the-margins-of-the-npt-review-conference/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken and Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo, Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa, and Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry Hagiuda Koichi at a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Dean Acheson Auditorium", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "July 29, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 So we just concluded the inaugural meeting of the new U.S.-Japan Economic Consultative Committee, otherwise known as the EPCC or \u201cepic.\u201d\u00a0 Secretary Raimondo and I were very glad to welcome our colleagues here to Washington today.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Hayashi and I saw each other just a few weeks ago in Bali for the G20 and then in Tokyo, where I had the opportunity to convey the profound sympathy and sorrow of the American people to the people of Japan after the assassination of Prime Minister Abe.\nAs you may know, the EPCC was a product of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s meeting in January, their first major talk after the prime minister took office last fall.\u00a0 They agreed that the U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger or more necessary and that our countries should deepen our cooperation to strengthen the rules-based economic order to address urgent challenges facing our workers, our businesses, people, and accelerate open, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.\nToday\u2019s first meeting of the EPCC was, I think it\u2019s fair to say, a resounding success: productive, substantive, directly connected to issues that matter in our peoples\u2019 lives and in their futures.\u00a0 We discussed building resilient supply chains after the COVID-19 pandemic revealed just how fragile they are.\u00a0 We addressed emerging technologies which bring so much promise of opportunity but also risks to national security, human rights, consumer health and safety, intellectual property.\nWe talked about Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine.\u00a0 Our countries are working closely to impose costs on Russia so that President Putin will end the war and address, of course, in the meantime food and fuel prices worldwide that have been spiked in part because of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 We discussed development finance and the problem of opaque lending practices that can weigh down countries with unsustainable debt.\nAnd we addressed the People\u2019s Republic of China and how its coercive economic practices go against an open, inclusive rules-based international economic order that gives all countries a chance to participate, to compete, and to grow.\u00a0 Japan and the United States believe in a global economy where all countries hold themselves to norms, to standards, to practices that allow people, ideas, goods, capital to move freely; where disputes are resolved swiftly, peacefully, openly; and where trade and commerce support workers, raise incomes, protect the environment, and create opportunity for as many people as possible.\u00a0 The EPCC is the latest addition to an ever growing partnership with Japan.\nA few months ago in Tokyo, our two countries joined 12 others to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to support a stronger, fair, more resilient economy across the region.\u00a0 Our countries work together through the Quad with India and Australia on issues from global health to the climate crisis to infrastructure.\u00a0 We cooperate through the OECD to tackle bribery and corruption, through the Global Action Plan to fight COVID-19, through the new Mineral Security Partnership to bolster critical mineral supply chains.\nAnd beyond all of these different initiatives and fora, the bilateral relationship between Japan and the United States encompasses just about every issue we face, from protecting our national security, to defending human rights, to advancing our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 The work that we did today, making clear together that our economic security is a vital component of our overall national security and well-being, I think just underscores the importance and the breadth and depth of our partnership.\nWe are deeply grateful for our alliance with Japan.\u00a0 It stretches back decades, sustained by cherished ties of family and friendship between our peoples.\u00a0 The work we did here today reflects the strength of that partnership but also importantly carries it forward.\nOn a separate note, earlier today I spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.\u00a0 We had a frank and direct conversation.\u00a0 I pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.\u00a0 I also emphasized that the world expects Russia to fulfill its commitments under the deal it reached with Ukraine, Turkey, and the United Nations on grain shipments from Ukraine.\u00a0 Ambassador Brink, our ambassador to Ukraine, was in Odessa this morning.\u00a0 She confirmed that the ships are loaded and ready to go.\u00a0 It is important and vital that Russia make good on the commitments it\u2019s made \u2013 made to the world.\u00a0 As I made clear, we\u2019re looking to see that move forward as soon as possible.\nI also made clear to Foreign Minister Lavrov that in light of recent statements coming from the Kremlin about their plans to proceed with the further annexation of Ukrainian territory \u2013 indeed, the foreign minister\u2019s own words about replacing democratically elected Ukrainian Government as well as being part of their ongoing plans \u2013 those plans would never be accepted.\u00a0 The world will not recognize annexations.\nWe will impose additional significant costs on Russia if it moves forward with its plans.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also continue to stand with Ukraine, support its ability to defend itself, impose costs on Russia until it ends its aggression.\u00a0 We continue to coordinate closely with allies and partners, including very closely with Japan, to support Ukraine and to hold Moscow to account.\u00a0 And as always, we\u2019re prepared to work with Ukraine and others to support any meaningful diplomatic efforts to end the war, to end the aggression.\nSo with that, let me just thank my colleagues so much for an incredibly productive meeting and for designing together the way ahead and to make sure that the EPCC really is an epic achievement between our countries.\u00a0 Thank you.\nYoshi.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Hello, everyone.\u00a0 This is my very first visit to Washington, D.C., as a minister of foreign affairs.\u00a0 First, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude for President Biden, Secretary Blinken, and many people from the United States Government for your deepest condolences for the passing of former Prime Minister Abe.\u00a0 I would like to thank the thoughts extended by the people in the United States.\nWe have just come out of the very first ministerial-level Economic 2+2 with Secretary Blinken, Secretary Raimondo, and Minister Hagiuda.\u00a0 We had a very fruitful exchange of thoughts.\u00a0 I would like again to thank both secretaries for their wonderful hospitality.\u00a0 The Economic 2+2 is the first attempt in the alliance of Japan and the United States to discuss foreign and security policy and economic policy as a unit.\u00a0 In a background, there is a shared urgency between Japan and the United States that existing international order is challenged not only by unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force, but also by attempt to realize strategic interest by exerting economic influence in unfair and opaque ways.\nIn order to respond to such crisis effectively, today four ministers from Japan and the United States gathered and discussed a wide variety of issues, including economic policies of respective countries, establishment of regional economic order, and economic security.\u00a0 This is the response to the requirement of time, and I believe it serves as a strong message about the adaptability of Japan-U.S. alliance in a rapidly changing international economy and about the resolve by Japan and United States to lead the international cooperation in this area.\nToday we discussed the following points and confirmed on the cooperation.\u00a0 First, we discussed a rules-based, free, and open international order.\u00a0 As the economy has a strong influence on diplomacy today, Japan and the United States confirmed that we would cooperate with likeminded countries not only from the economic perspective but also from a strategic perspective in order to maintain and develop international order to ensure economic security.\nRegarding energy security and food security, we discussed assistance to those countries that are gravely impacted by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\nAlso I expressed Japan\u2019s support of IPEF and as the United States plays more active role in economic order of the Indo-Pacific region, and conveyed my strong hope to both secretaries that the United States come back to TPP soon.\nSecond, we discussed response to the exertion of international economic influence to hinder \u2013 sorry, intentional economic influence to hinder solidarity in the international community, and to distort foreign policies of different countries and confirmed on a shared awareness.\u00a0 Economic coercion issue was also taken up by G7 Elmau summit, and I hope to deepen the discussion towards the G7 Hiroshima summit.\nAlso, regarding the unfair and opaque development finance, I hope that Japan and the United States can work together to ensure all countries comply to the international rules and standards.\nIn addition, we agreed that for Japan and the United States to ensure our own competitiveness and resilience, we will continue to promote cooperation based on core partnership that was concurred in April last year.\u00a0 We also agreed to establish stronger supply chain cooperating with likeminded countries.\nI would like to reiterate that we are not pursuing protectionism or bloc economy, but any policy will give due consideration to transparency and predictability for businesses.\u00a0 I hope that we can continue to deepen our discussion in various related areas with likeminded countries, taking opportunities of occasion such as G7, chaired by Japan, and APEC, chaired by the United States.\u00a0 We have agreed to hold the ministerial meeting on a regular basis, and I look forward to our next meeting.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, good afternoon, and thank you to Secretary Blinken for hosting us, bringing us together.\u00a0 And thank you to Ministers Hagiuda and Hayashi for joining us and for being present here in the United States for this very important meeting.\u00a0 I also would like to join with Tony in expressing my condolences to our colleagues and to the people of Japan for the tragic loss of Prime Minister Abe.\nSo I share the assessment with Secretary Blinken that today\u2019s meeting was a resounding success.\u00a0 We had candid, productive, open, substantive discussion, and I\u2019m very proud of the joint progress on promoting economic growth, addressing threats to the global order, and enhancing security and resilience.\nThe close ties between the United States and Japan support good jobs in both of our countries and contribute to our mutual prosperity and security.\u00a0 Our alliance is an increasingly important force for peace and prosperity not only in the Indo-Pacific region but, in fact, throughout the world.\nI also want to acknowledge how deeply grateful I am that Congress yesterday finally approved funding for the CHIPS Act.\u00a0 As we discussed today, semiconductors are the linchpin of our economic and national security, and we had an excellent discussion today around how Japan and the United States could collaborate, especially with respect to advanced semiconductors.\u00a0 The $52 billion investment in the CHIPS Act in domestic semiconductor production will enable us to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States, rebuild American manufacturing, and strengthen our supply chain for decades to come.\nJust as important, this funding will strengthen our partnerships with allies like Japan.\u00a0 It will enhance our joint work on supply chains, promote the competitiveness of both of our nations, and importantly, make us less dependent on our adversaries for such a critical piece of technology.\u00a0 It will build on \u2013 excuse me.\u00a0 Just as importantly, the funding will strengthen our partnerships and will build on the meeting that Minister Hagiuda and I had in May, where we expressed shared intent for cooperation on semiconductor supply chains.\nI look forward to the day, not too far from now, where here in America we have American-made chips supplying Japanese auto plants here in the United States.\u00a0 Together our two nations are leading the way in investing in our futures.\u00a0 So again, I just want to thank Minister Hagiuda and Minister Hayashi for joining us.\u00a0 Thank you for your efforts to forge new and stronger bonds between our nations, our communities, and our people.\nMINISTER HAGIUDA:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I am Hagiuda Koichi, Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry.\u00a0 First I express also my gratitude to American people for sending heartfelt condolences to former Prime Minister Abe.\u00a0 Japan-U.S. alliance is a cornerstone of Japan\u2019s diplomacy.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Abe has always said so.\u00a0 On his historic visit to Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor with President Obama, I also accompanied them as then-deputy chief cabinet secretary.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Abe has staked his political life throughout, while making Japan-U.S. people\u2019s ties stronger.\nPresident Biden came to Japanese Embassy to express condolences.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken came to Japan, and Secretary Raimondo gave us a heartfelt message.\u00a0 I understand within the United States, flag was hoisted half-mast at many places, not only government buildings.\u00a0 It shows deep ties at people\u2019s level between our two countries.\u00a0 In place of former Prime Minister Abe, I sincerely express my gratitude from the bottom of our heart.\n\u201cJapan is back,\u201d Prime Minister Abe declared in Washington about 10 years ago.\u00a0 Japan will once again exert leadership with the United States, the champion of democracy, hand in hand for peace and prosperity of the world.\u00a0 So the determination was expressed in CPTPP, free and open Indo-Pacific, Quad, over a decade that its foundation underpinning peace and prosperity of the region was built.\u00a0 State Secretary Blinken the other day said he feels such a loss.\u00a0 Frankly, entire Japan is covered with a big sense of loss.\nHowever, Japan is here to stay.\u00a0 Going forward, Japan will work hand in hand with the United States and work toward peace and prosperity of the world.\u00a0 To clearly state our determination to you, I came here.\u00a0 Today, for the very first time, Economic 2+2 was held.\u00a0 The framework has been laid down.\u00a0 Supply chain risk, economic coercion, foreign security policy, and economic policy have become inseparable.\u00a0 Under such an era, Japan-U.S. foreign and economic ministers are meeting together, having a intensive discussion and sending the unified messages to the world.\u00a0 Its significance is very large.\nTo address new challenges such as digital, a new economic order based on rules will be built under U.S. administration\u2019s leadership with wide participation of countries in the region.\u00a0 We welcome that new economic architecture is being built at the IPEF.\u00a0 Energy secretary, business and human rights, developing trusted infrastructure such as information communication, supply chain resilience such as batteries and critical minerals and such and such \u2013 there are heaps of issues out there to be tackled.\nThis time, alongside a joint statement, plan of action on specific items was also released.\u00a0 This is a big outcome.\u00a0 In critical and emerging technologies like space, ocean, and cyber cooperation will be strengthened, and economic security will be ensured.\u00a0 Today, substantial time was spent on these topics for discussion.\u00a0 Issues will be dealt with in an offensive way as well as defensive way at the same time; combined with protection with export control, advanced technology development will be promoted.\nWe concurred to accelerate the Japan-U.S. joint development over next-generation semi-conductors.\u00a0 Japan will quickly move to action.\u00a0 Japan\u2019s wisdom will be collected from AIST, RIKEN, and University of Tokyo own research on next-generation semiconductor research.\u00a0 Decision was made to launch a new R&D organization.\u00a0 It will be open to overseas businesses and to research institutes.\u00a0 It will be an international joint research hub.\u00a0 We are determined to collect the strength of Japan, science and technology-based nation, and lead a cooperation between Japan and the United States and among likeminded countries.\u00a0 Unilateral use of economic force in violation of international rules to fulfill diplomatic demand should never happen.\nFrom the Pacific Ocean to Indian Ocean, this wide expanse of ocean and sky is free and open to anyone.\u00a0 Regardless of the size of the country, it should bring benefit to all the countries.\u00a0 This economic 2+2 is, as it were, compass for realizing free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 This is a foundation for peace and prosperity of the region.\u00a0 Toward that end, together with Commerce Secretary Raimondo, State Secretary Blinken, and Foreign Minister Hayashi, who are all here, I am determined to do my best.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll alternate two per side.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, could I begin by following up on your remarks about your conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov?\u00a0 How confident are you about this raising the chances of bringing home Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan?\u00a0 What is the sense that you got from Foreign Minister Lavrov?\u00a0 I know also you mentioned earlier this week that you\u2019re not planning to negotiate on Ukraine with the Russians, but what was the overall sense that you got from Foreign Minister Lavrov?\u00a0 Are you any more confident that the United States could be dealing with Russia and making progress in any area there?\u00a0 And do you plan to speak to him again or even meet him?\u00a0 As was announced today, you\u2019re going to be in Cambodia next week for ASEAN.\nAnd perhaps, if I could open up to everybody here \u2013 a week of phone calls, I suppose.\u00a0 The phone call yesterday that the President had with President Xi of China, does this \u2013 do you feel that this makes any progress on the issue of Taiwan?\u00a0 How concerned are you about the tensions in Taiwan right now, and a potential visit by Speaker Pelosi.\u00a0 Do you think that \u2013 are you confident that that\u2019s something that you can work through or are you worried about that aggravating the situation?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Shaun, thank you very much.\u00a0 First, just to put this in perspective, we said all along that if we thought there was any opportunity to advance diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, we would of course take it.\u00a0 Unfortunately, tragically, we\u2019ve seen no opening, willingness on the part of Russia to engage meaningfully on ending the aggression.\u00a0 At the same time, I\u2019ve also said that if there are issues where it could make a difference in senior Russians hearing directly from me or from colleagues, we would of course pursue that.\nAnd with regard to the call with the foreign minister today, as I noted the other day when we had an opportunity to speak, I told you what I intended to raise with him, and I raised exactly what I said I would raise with him \u2013 that is, the significant proposal that\u2019s been on the table for some weeks now that would lead to bringing home Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.\u00a0 I urged Foreign Minister Lavrov to move forward with that proposal.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to characterize his response, and I can\u2019t give you an assessment of whether I think things are any more or less likely, but it was important that he heard directly from me on that.\nSecond, as I said the other day, on behalf of many, many countries around the world, getting Russia to move on the commitments it\u2019s made \u2013 not just to the United Nations, Turkey, and Ukraine in the context of the deal that was agreed, but to the entire world that is looking for an end to the blockade of the Odessa port by Russia that has denied so many people the food that they need and depend on and has also resulted in a significant increase in food prices over many months \u2013 important that he hear directly from me on behalf of many other countries the expectation that Russia would move forward with its commitments and would stop, end the blockade, and allow the ships to sail.\nAnd finally, you\u2019ve heard me say the other day the deep concern that many countries around the world have in hearing in recent days about Russia\u2019s expanded war aims in Ukraine, particularly their plans to proceed with the annexation of additional Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 And I laid out exactly what we anticipate they will do in the weeks and months ahead \u2013 including having sham referendums in these parts of Ukraine, trying to falsely demonstrate that the people in these parts of Ukraine somehow seek to become part of Russia \u2013 all to advance President Putin\u2019s objectives in gobbling up as much Ukrainian territory as he can and, from his perspective, trying to erase Ukraine as an independent, sovereign country.\nThat of course is not going to happen.\u00a0 The Ukrainian people have made clear that that\u2019s not going to happen, and the world has made clear they\u2019re not going to let that happen.\u00a0 But short of that, President Putin is trying to grab as much Ukrainian territory as he can, and it was very important that the Russians hear directly from us that that will not be accepted \u2013 and not only will it not be accepted; it will result in additional significant costs being imposed upon Russia if it follows through on those plans.\nSo I don\u2019t want to characterize any of Foreign Minister Lavrov\u2019s responses.\u00a0 If you have an opportunity to ask him, please proceed.\nWith regard to the call between President Biden and President Xi, first, as you know, this followed previous discussions, including most recently in March, and it also builds on a number of recent engagements, including the time I spent with Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bali where we spent about five hours together.\u00a0 The National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the Secretary of Defense, the Treasury Secretary, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have each had recent conversations or engagements with their counterparts.\u00a0 And this is part of our effort to make sure that we maintain and deepen lines of communication with China to responsibly manage the many differences that we have and to work together wherever it is that our interests align.\u00a0 And that was very much the nature of the conversation.\nI can just say, again, it covered basically three things: where our two countries can work together, with a particular focus on climate change, on health security, on counternarcotics; second, an exchange of views on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine; and finally, Taiwan, where President Biden underscored that our policy has not changed.\u00a0 The United States strongly opposes any unilateral efforts to change the status quo or to undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 So that was the nature and basically the substance of the conversation they had.\u00a0 They touched on a number of other issues.\nBut look, I\u2019ll just say this in conclusion.\u00a0 We have many differences when it comes to Taiwan, but over the past 40-plus years, we have managed those differences and done it in a way that has preserved peace and stability and has allowed the people on Taiwan to flourish.\u00a0 It would be important as part of our shared responsibility to continue to manage this in a wise way that doesn\u2019t create the prospect for conflict.\u00a0 And keeping open lines of communication on this issue, especially between President Biden and President Xi, I think is vital to doing that.\u00a0 We believe direct communication between the leaders is the most essential aspect of meeting our responsibilities to manage issues as fraught as Taiwan in the most responsible way possible.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Mr. Matsuura from Kyodo.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much for the opportunity.\u00a0 This is Matsuura.\u00a0 This is a question to Minister Hayashi and Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Looking back at the history of Japan-U.S. relations, it was in 1990 that Security 2+2 was upgraded to the ministerial level.\u00a0 Today 2+2 has been expanded to economic area, and the Japan-U.S. alliance has come to the new stage.\u00a0 On the other hand, in the international community China is attempting to widely broaden its influence, leveraging its economic power.\u00a0 So what is the significance of Japan and the United States coming together to try and maintain and strengthen the economic order?\u00a0 Also, how do you plan to build on today\u2019s discussion in G7 and with ASEAN, as they have a strong economic tie with China?\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) First of all, Japan and the U.S. have been working together in solidarity to make sure that unilateral attempt to change status quo would not be allowed in the international community.\u00a0 On the other hand, as I said at the outset, for Japan and U.S. to effectively respond to the unfair and opaque use of economic influence, it is necessary to think about diplomacy, security, and economy as a unit.\u00a0 In particular, since the United States and Japan are number one and two democratic economies in the world, it would be beneficial for us to discuss strategically about the policies to be implemented in such situation.\u00a0 Economic 2+2 is here to respond to this kind of requirement of this era, and to demonstrate that the alliance can adapt to the changes in the international environment.\nBased on today\u2019s Economic 2+2 discussion, the Governments of Japan and the United States will promote cooperation in various area and work to maintain and develop orders in the international community, including Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 Also, for forming international economic order, not only cooperation between Japan and United States, but also cooperation with likeminded countries is essential.\u00a0 We hope to share strategic cooperation and issues that we discussed today at Economic 2+2 with the G7 countries in the summit chaired by Japan next year so that we can further expand the cooperation.\nAlso, regarding the relationship with ASEAN, Japan and the United States have always respected the unity and centrality of ASEAN while promoting concrete cooperation towards achievement of free and open Indo-Pacific and ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We will continue to closely cooperate with regional partners, aiming to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth in Indo-Pacific region and economic security that we discussed today during the Economic 2+2 and also by utilizing framework such as IPEF by the United States.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I agree with everything that my colleague has said.\u00a0 I would simply add a couple of points or reinforce a couple of points.\u00a0 First, the United States and Japan share a conviction that economic security and national security are inseparable.\u00a0 They are fundamentally linked.\u00a0 And I think it was very important to both of us and our \u2013 all of our colleagues to further elevate the discussions we\u2019re having on economic security issues because they\u2019re really front and center on our agenda and on the world\u2019s agenda and the very \u2013 the issues that you heard us talk about today I think really go to in many ways very practical things that our people in Japan and the United States and beyond are feeling and experiencing in their lives.\u00a0 And we have a shared conviction that working together we can make a genuine difference in advancing opportunity and dealing with challenges to the wellbeing of our people in the economic sphere.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the most important thing.\nSecond, I would simply say that many of the initiatives that we\u2019re engaged in together, whether it\u2019s between the United States and Japan, whether it\u2019s in the context of ASEAN, IPEF, the Quad; these are mutually reinforcing.\u00a0 And they in affect add strength to each other, and I think we saw that today because many of the things that we talked about overlap with issues that are on the agenda of IPEF, the Quad, et cetera.\u00a0 When the United States and Japan can work together to help drive some of these issues \u2013 and next year, as you know, Japan will be in the lead of the G7 \u2013 we will be in the lead of APEC \u2013 we can make a big, big difference in actually moving forward.\nThe last thing is this: we get to stand up here and share with all of you the results of our meeting.\u00a0 The truth of the matter is, there are a number of people who are sitting with us today and others who are back in their ministries in Tokyo and here in Washington, who really drive the work every single day.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve agreed that we will meet again among the four of us next year, but in\u2011between then we\u2019ve laid out a very detailed and concrete agenda for our teams to follow up on between now and the end of the year and then into next year so that not only have we set out a basic vision together and framework for the work that our countries can do; we\u2019ll actually follow up with concrete initiatives to make all of this real.\u00a0 So I think that\u2019s the other importance of today, an agreement that we\u2019re really going to drive this forward together over the next months.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, thank you for doing this.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, I wonder \u2013 starting on Taiwan, is the Japanese Government making any contingency planning from a security perspective for a potential crisis in the near term, whether that would be prompted by a visit from Speaker Pelosi or some other visit?\u00a0 And does the Japanese Government envision a role for the G7 to intervene with any economic leverage to deter or mitigate the risk of escalation in such a crisis?\nSecretary Raimondo, you\u2019ve spoken before about the Russian military being forced to strip semiconductors from kitchen appliances in Ukraine.\u00a0 Do you have any sense of whether those supply constraints that they have are imposing a time limit on their military operations there?\u00a0 And more generally, do you see that being applicable in a \u2013 with respect to China in a crisis or even on the other foot, does the U.S. have sufficient semiconductor supplies to see it through a Taiwan crisis in the near term?\nAnd then to Secretary Blinken, the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan Carrier Striker is in the South China Sea, but there\u2019s been a lot of ink spilled on the vulnerability of the surface fleet if there were a crisis with China.\u00a0 Are you having any conversations about a near term prepositioning of defense assets and \u2013 with Japan or other allies in the region next week?\nThank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you for your question.\u00a0 Regarding the visit by Speaker Pelosi, as a \u2013 we are not in the position as the Japanese Government to comment on that.\u00a0 Now, going on to \u2013 between Japan and the U.S. in May in a summit at the Joint Declaration regarding Taiwan, the basic approach to Taiwan has not been changed.\u00a0 It \u2013 Taiwan Strait peace and prosperity is important \u2013 remains the same.\u00a0 And a peaceful resolution of the Strait issue has been agreed upon between the leaders.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 With respect to the export controls, we have reason to believe that with each passing week and month, the export controls have an even more devastating effect on Russia\u2019s ability to continue this war.\u00a0 As the \u2013 they developed a stockpile in preparation for the war for these sorts of technology and spare parts.\u00a0 As that continues to dwindle, their ability to continue to operate is reduced significantly.\nI will say the reason that these export controls are having such an effect is because we\u2019re doing them in coordination with our allies, first among them the Japanese.\u00a0 I mean, this isn\u2019t the United States acting alone; we have a coalition of 36 countries.\u00a0 Japan stepped up immediately.\u00a0 And together, we are denying Russia parts, including semiconductors, and importantly, as we discussed today, collaborating on enforcement.\u00a0 And we will continue to collaborate on enforcement to continue to deny Russia what it needs to continue this war.\nWith respect to the United States, I have no concern that we have an ability to meet our needs.\u00a0 And furthermore, the fact that Congress acted yesterday on the CHIPS Act is an enormous step forward to ensure that we\u2019ll be able to protect ourselves and our allies and have adequate semiconductor supplies for decades to come.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And with regard to any contingencies and any preparations made on a military level, I defer to the Pentagon.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Well, I have a question to both Minister Hagiuda and Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 Well, economically, competition can take place and it might develop into a trade friction \u2013 it had happened in the past.\u00a0 But what do you think about the alliance relationship covering the economic area?\u00a0 And what are you thinking about further strengthening the semiconductor supply chain?\u00a0 What will be the future state of cooperation between Japan and U.S., particularly in the semiconductor?\u00a0 And also, do you have a plan to widen the framework between the Japan and the United States?\nMINISTER HAGIUDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you for your question.\u00a0 Well, when you talk about competition, it should be based on the free and fair rules.\u00a0 Then it can drive economic growth and can be a source of vitality.\u00a0 We are the world\u2019s number one and number three economic power.\u00a0 Japan and U.S. will work closely, encouraging each other and enhance competitiveness and grow together.\nOn the other hand, problems have come about that there are conduct which might threaten economic order or free and fair rules.\u00a0 Sometimes one country may use force of superiority over supply chain to their advantage.\u00a0 Economic coercion violating international rule is totally unacceptable.\u00a0 Freedom, democracy, basic human rights, rule of law \u2013 these are the universal values we share together between our two countries.\u00a0 We need to keep on adhering to the economic order based on the rule.\u00a0 We are always looking for a level playing field in terms of the competition so that a region of peace and prosperity\u2019s foundation can be laid down.\u00a0 That is a big responsibility incumbent upon the two countries.\nNext-generation semiconductor technology development would determine the future and show competitiveness \u2013 top priority area for cooperation.\u00a0 Leaders\u2019 summit in May had agreed to have a joint task force on the research and development of next-generation semiconductor research.\u00a0 Already met last month.\u00a0 And together with Secretary Raimondo, we agreed on the basic principle for the cooperation on semiconductor.\u00a0 We will work with likeminded countries to expand our cooperation toward a 2020s realization of R&D on the next-generation semiconductors, HRD, and supply chain resilience.\u00a0 We are going to put that into action.\nWe will look into the future implementation R&D.\u00a0 As I said, AIST, RIKEN, and University of Tokyo will offer their expertise in the next-generation semiconductor research.\u00a0 Wisdom will be collected to launch a new R&D organization.\u00a0 It will be made open to overseas businesses and research institutes, inclusive of Japan, U.S., and likeminded countries in the region.\u00a0 We hope to make into a hub for the international joint research.\nRight before this press conference, I had a bilateral with Secretary Raimondo, and thanks to her effort, CHIPS Act have passed in the United States.\u00a0 It\u2019s epoch-making.\u00a0\u00a0 And there is going to be a way where further commitment can be made on both public and private side.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Extremely well said by my colleague.\u00a0 I concur with everything he said.\u00a0 I would simply underscore two points.\nOne, in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which we have launched and \u2013 with Japan and a dozen other economies in the Indo-Pacific, there is a pillar focused on supply chains, and we expect that a core piece of work in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework in supply chains will be focused on semiconductors, aligning research and development, coordinating on export controls, working together.\nSecondly, after the passage of the CHIPS Act, our goal now \u2013 the Department of Commerce will be implementing the CHIPS Act with the goal of rebuilding the entire semiconductor supply chain in America, and we welcome Japanese foreign direct investment into the United States as we develop that supply chain.\u00a0 Specifically in the areas of chemicals and substrates, materials, the Japanese are world leaders \u2013 tooling \u2013 and we look forward to \u2013 and as the minister said, research and development in emerging technology.\u00a0 It\u2019s impossible to overstate the significance of Congress\u2019s action yesterday and the opportunity for collaboration that that opens for the United States and Japan to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 That concludes the press conference.\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\n\n"},

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "U.S.-Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee", "location": "Benjamin Franklin Room Washington, D.C.", "date": "July 29, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good morning everyone.\u00a0 Ministers Hayashi, Hagiuda, Secretary Raimondo, it\u2019s wonderful to welcome each of you here to the State Department.\u00a0 And Gina and I are delighted to welcome you to Washington for what is the inaugural meeting of the U.S.-Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee.\nEarlier this year when President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida announced the creation of the EPCC \u2013 appropriately, \u201cepic,\u201d as we call it \u2013 this was a reflection of the strength of our two countries\u2019 economic relationship and partnership, Japan\u2019s and America\u2019s leadership in the global economy, and the seriousness of the economic challenges facing our workers, our businesses, our people.\u00a0 As the world\u2019s first and third largest economies, it is critical that we work together to defend a rules-based international economic order, one in which all countries can participate, compete, and prosper.\nRecent events in the world \u2013 around the world prove how necessary this new gathering is.\u00a0 COVID-19 has revealed the vulnerability of critical supply chains.\u00a0 A growing number of countries struggle with debt burdens due to unsustainable and nontransparent lending practices.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, its blockade of the Port of Odessa has caused a spike in global food prices and fuel prices as well.\u00a0 The coercive and retaliatory economic practices of the People\u2019s Republic of China force countries into choices that compromise their security, their intellectual property, their economic independence.\u00a0 These and other challenges call for our two countries to work together even more closely on economic matters.\u00a0 This has always been a key element of our bilateral relationship, and with EPCC we will make our cooperation in this arena even stronger.\nThe EPCC also complements the work of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which our two countries launched with 12 others in Tokyo this spring to create a stronger, fairer, more resilient economy across the entire Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our conversations today and in the weeks ahead \u2013 and by the way, in the weeks ahead will also be leading to Japan assuming the leadership of the G7, the United States APEC next year \u2013 but all of these conversations, including through EPCC, will address our shared priorities, including securing critical infrastructure, building better supply lines and supply chains, shaping emerging technologies so that they deliver opportunity without undermining our security or, for that matter, our values.\nOn these issues and more, we will advance our shared vision of a open, inclusive, sustainable economic growth rooted in the rules-based international order.\u00a0 Ultimately, our cooperation will help move us closer to a future in which trade and commerce support workers, create incomes, create opportunity where countries are secure from coercion and aggression, where people, ideas, goods, and capital move freely, where universal human rights are respected, and countries and people can forge their own paths.\u00a0 Japan and the United States both share that vision.\n(Off-mike.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Tony.\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\n(Via interpreter) I would like to thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo for hosting.\u00a0 Currently Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine poses a serious challenge to the international order, but we must never allow unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force.\n(Interruption.)\n(Via interpreter) It is a powerful indication of the close collaboration between Japan and the United States that the first ministerial meeting of the Japan-U.S. Economic Policy Consultative Committee, which the two leaders concurred to hold in July at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting in May, was realized as concurred.\u00a0 I would like to thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo for hosting.\nCurrently, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine poses a serious challenge to the international order, but we must never allow unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force.\u00a0 At the same time, we are concerned that there are prominent attempts to use economic influence unfairly and opaquely to realize their strategic interest and to modify the existing international order.\u00a0 In order to effectively deal with this, it is essential to discuss foreign policy and economic policy as a unit, rather than discussing foreign policy and economic policy individually.\u00a0 It is also necessary to strongly disseminate such efforts by Japan and United States and lead the collaboration of the international community.\nFrom that point of view, this economic 2+2 is a timely framework.\u00a0 In addition, it is important to promote multi-layered bilateral cooperation in terms of policies, institutions, and technological development, with a focus on the CoRe, or Competitiveness and Resilience Partnership, in order for Japan and the United States to maintain competitiveness and resilience in the ever-changing international economic situation.\u00a0 Now, under Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s new form of capitalism, Japan is aiming for an economic society that balances solving social issues and economic growth, while emphasizing investment in people and promotion of \u2013\n(Interruption.)\nJapan and the United States should work together.\nToday, I look forward to discussing how Japan and United States exert our leadership towards realization of sustainable and inclusive economic growth of the international community, including the Indo-Pacific region, as well as maintenance and reinforcement of the rules-based free and open economic order.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, (inaudible).\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 Tony and I are thrilled to host you this morning.\u00a0 I had the opportunity the other evening to express my condolences to Minister Hagiuda, but I haven\u2019t seen you, so Minister Hayashi, please \u2013 and your delegation, please accept our condolences for Prime Minister Abe.\nIt\u2019s a pleasure to be here, as I said, and I could not agree more with you, Minister Hayashi, that the international rules-based order that the United States and Japan, along with our friends and allies, built is being challenged, which means it\u2019s incumbent upon us to strengthen our tie and step up to ensure that they cannot challenge this rules-based order.\u00a0 And I would suggest convenings of this kind are more important than ever, so thank you for enduring the long flight to be here with us.\nWe have a number of similar initiatives ongoing that all aim at the same goal.\u00a0 Last November, Minister Hagiuda and I launched the JUCIP, the U.S.-Japan Commercial and Industrial Partnership, to ensure that METI and the Department of Commerce work together to promote competitiveness and innovation.\u00a0 Today, of course, we are convening for the first time our economic 2+2 to discuss shared concerns of interest that are central to both foreign and economic policy.\nI would say this format is the first of its kind.\u00a0 It is ambitious, exciting, and timely in light of the threats that we are seeing around the world.\u00a0 And the reality that, as you said, Minister Hayashi, economic security is very much more than ever tied to national security.\nWe have a mandate today to track what we have achieved together thus far and to drive cooperative efforts going forward in a way that can help further strengthen the rules-based economic order in the Indo-Pacific, and indeed, in the world.\nI would take a minute to highlight that we\u2019ve made significant achievements so far.\u00a0 I\u2019m especially proud of Commerce and METI\u2019s joint work already underway in the JUCIP.\u00a0 It\u2019s already leading to concrete outcomes that we\u2019ll discuss later today, including in the session which I am leading around building supply chain resilience.\nToday in the rest of my comments, I also plan to focus on the newly launched Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which we believe is vital to establishing strength in the \u2013 economic strength in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 I want to thank Minister Hagiuda for the leadership you\u2019re providing in the JUCIP, but also in the IPEF, and for your close partnership in ensuring the success of the supply chain ministerial last week and the virtual ministerial for IPEF this week.\u00a0 I commend you for participating in the virtual ministerial for IPEF and then immediately getting on a plane and coming here today.\nOur shared interests make it imperative for us to continue leveraging dialogues like this, like the 2+2, like the JUCIP, like the supply chain, like the IPEF, to figure out concrete joint solutions for promoting economic growth, economic security that will also help us address the threats to the global economic order and enhance economic security and resilience.\u00a0 So I\u2019m excited to have a productive discussion today.\nMINISTER HAGIUDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Commerce Secretary Raimondo, State Secretary Blinken, at the outset allow me to reiterate our heartfelt gratitude to deep condolences expressed to former Prime Minister Abe.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Abe always said Japan-U.S. alliance is the cornerstone of Japan\u2019s diplomacy.\nToday historic kickoff of Japan-U.S. Economic 2+2 has materialized.\u00a0 Toward further deepening of Japan-U.S. alliance, a new page has been opened.\u00a0 This is how we think.\u00a0 Foreign and security policies and economic policy have become inseparable.\u00a0 Unilateral use of economic force in violation of international rules to fulfill diplomatic demand should never take place.\u00a0 State\u2011of\u2011the-art technology should be developed and utilized to further reinforce basic human rights and democracy.\nFurther, building economic architecture for a new era, including digital, is an urgent challenge that cannot wait.\u00a0 Vis-\u00e0-vis wider-ranging challenges, Japan and the United States \u2013 the world\u2019s number one and number two democratic economic powers sharing universal values \u2013 will have \u2013 work hand in hand.\nThe 2+2 will not only be confined to Japan-U.S. bilateral, but will be a foundation which will bring peace and prosperity widely in the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 This is, as it were, compass for realizing free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 This is our belief.\nI\u2019m looking forward to having a very good discussion.\u00a0 Let us send out to the world Japan\u2011United States unified and clear message.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you so much, Mr. Minister and colleagues.\u00a0 And just to add my voice as well to Gina\u2019s and to the minister\u2019s, I had an opportunity to pay respects upon the assassination of Prime Minister Abe, and I think and I hope that the spirit of leadership and vision he brought to our relationship, which was exceptional, will help animate us in the work that we\u2019re doing together.\nIt\u2019s wonderful to have all of you here.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get into our session.\u00a0 I\u2019m remiss in \u2013 for those of you who haven\u2019t been here before, this is the Benjamin Franklin Room.\u00a0 Ben Franklin is gazing at us.\u00a0 He was our first diplomat, he signed our first treaty, he charted the Gulf Stream, he captured electricity, he forced an ethos of self-government \u2013 and virtually none of this did he do while sober.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But we will be serving tea this morning.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo, Mark.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 And with that, I will be serving as your moderator today and try to keep us on time on this rather ambitious agenda.\u00a0 We have two plenary sessions, each divided into two bits.\u00a0 The first session will be \u201cRealizing Peace and Prosperity Through the Rules-Based Economic Order.\u201d\u00a0 The speaking order will be Minister Hayashi, followed by Secretary Blinken, Minister Hagiuda, followed by Secretary Raimondo, and we\u2019re going to allow about 20 minutes for this session.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-launch-of-the-u-s-afghan-consultative-mechanism/", "title":

Blinken At the Launch of the U.S.-Afghan Consultative Mechanism\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "U.S. Institute for Peace", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "July 28, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, everyone.\nFirst, let me say it is always a particular pleasure to visit our neighbors at the U.S. Institute of Peace.\u00a0 Lise, thank you so much for hosting us.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be here.\nAnd Rina, to you, to our special envoy, to the team working with you, to the many others who are involved with today\u2019s launch, I am grateful for all you\u2019ve done to bring all of us together today, but for the work that\u2019s being done every day that I\u2019ll have a chance to talk about over the next few minutes.\u00a0 But to our colleagues across the entire U.S. Government, civil society, thank you as well for supporting equality, supporting opportunity, for women and girls across Afghanistan.\nAnd a special thanks to the extraordinary panelists that we\u2019ve had today.\u00a0 I\u2019m really looking forward to getting a chance to speak with you directly shortly.\u00a0 But as you all know, they\u2019ve served in Afghanistan in different ways, in different roles, but there is one thread that runs throughout their public service.\u00a0 Each has helped strengthen the rights of Afghan women and girls, as well as members of other vulnerable groups, for decades.\nToday, they represent many others across Afghanistan and around the world who have dedicated their lives to this deeply vital and deeply honorable mission.\nAs the panelists made clear, we meet at a difficult time for Afghan women and girls.\nSince the Taliban took over a year ago, they\u2019ve reversed a great deal of the openness and progress that had been made over the previous decades.\u00a0 They\u2019ve silenced civil society and journalists.\u00a0 In March, they banned independent international media like Voice of America and BBC\u00a0from airing in Afghanistan.\u00a0 They continue to intimidate and censor Afghan media outlets.\u00a0 They stifled the free practice of religion for Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\nPerhaps most notably, they failed to respect the human rights of women and girls.\u00a0 Instead, under the Taliban, women and girls have largely been erased from public life.\u00a0 As a report released yesterday by Amnesty International showed, the Taliban have systematically restricted women and girl\u2019s rights to free movement, decimated the system supporting domestic violence victims, and contributed to surging rates of child, early, and forced marriage.\nThe Taliban\u2019s decision to ban girls from attending secondary schools, a decision that happened while some girls were literally walking to school and others were already sitting at their desks, was a reversal of commitments they made to the Afghan people and to the world.\u00a0 For 314 days and counting, the girls of Afghanistan have sat at home while their brothers and cousins have been receiving educations.\u00a0 It\u2019s a terrible, terrible waste.\nIt\u2019s especially difficult to accept because we all remember how different it was not so very long ago.\u00a0 Prior to the Taliban\u2019s takeover, thousands of women across Afghanistan held public office from the village level right up to the national level.\u00a0 Women entered professions previously closed to them.\u00a0 They started businesses.\u00a0 They were doctors, nurses, scientists, artists.\u00a0 And women didn\u2019t just study in schools across Afghanistan; they ran them.\nThese gains weren\u2019t felt only by women and girls.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve seen again and again throughout history from country to country, when equality and opportunity increase for one group of people, they tend to increase for other groups as well.\u00a0 As the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan were strengthened, we saw members of various ethnic and religious communities \u2013 Hazaras, Hindus, Sikhs, Sufis \u2013 take more prominent roles in Afghan public life.\u00a0 Afghans with disabilities did as well.\u00a0 The LGBTQI+ community found ways to build a community.\u00a0 So the changes in Afghanistan during the past year have been painful for so many.\nWe continue to urge the Taliban to reverse their decision on girls\u2019 education, to make good on their commitment to the Afghan people, to allow girls to learn.\u00a0 The evidence is overwhelming.\u00a0 Investing in girls\u2019 education, women\u2019s political inclusion, it leads to stronger economies.\u00a0 It leads to healthier individuals and families.\u00a0 It leads to more stable, more resilient societies.\u00a0 These are the things that people of Afghanistan want for their futures.\u00a0 That\u2019s why so many members of Afghan society \u2013 men and women, rural and urban dwellers, religious scholars, people across religions and cultural backgrounds \u2013 have all, all called for the Taliban to let women and girls go to school again.\nThe United States will continue to amplify these voices and do all that we can to support progress for Afghan women, girls, and other at-risk populations.\nEarlier this year, we joined partners across the international community \u2013 including the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Qatar, Turkey, Pakistan, the European Union, and others \u2013 urging the Taliban to let girls go back to school.\nLast month, we supported a Human Rights Council urgent debate that allowed us to hear directly from Afghan women leaders.\u00a0 We co-sponsored a resolution that will allow us to hear from them again this coming September.\u00a0 And as we help enable their voices to be heard, others will hear them as well.\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve continued our partnerships with Afghan civil society groups working on issues of equality, inclusion, opportunity for women, religious and ethnic communities, and other at-risk populations.\nAnd critically, with today\u2019s launch of the U.S.-Afghan Consultative Mechanism, we are taking these relationships to the next level.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I\u2019m so pleased about today.\nIt\u2019s going to make it easier for Afghan civil society groups to communicate and collaborate with American policymakers across a whole range of shared priorities \u2013 from supporting income-generating activities for Afghan women, to strategizing ways to help Afghan human rights monitors safely document abuses, to devising new methods to promote religious freedom.\nWhat we want to do is to make our partnerships with Afghan civil society more effective, more rigorous, more productive, more purposeful.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this new initiative is all about.\nSo let me simply share my profound appreciation for our American civil society partners, who do critical work to support women leaders and civil society organizations in Afghanistan, and for our Afghan partners for sharing your perspectives, for sharing your recommendations.\nWhat\u2019s remarkable to me and I think to so many of us is how, even in the face of threats, violence, intimidation, the women and girls of Afghanistan \u2013 and other vulnerable, targeted people \u2013 have simply refused to back down.\u00a0 These groups have never stopped believing in a brighter future for their country.\u00a0 They are determined to do all they can to make that future real.\nThe women who have taken to the streets to protest for their rights are one such group.\nIn December, when members of the Afghan National Security Forces were targeted despite the Taliban\u2019s supposed amnesty, women protested.\u00a0 In January, when female public servants were dismissed from their jobs, women protested.\u00a0 In March, when the Taliban instituted an edict directing women to cover their faces in public and to only leave home when, quote, \u201cnecessary,\u201d women protested.\nMany of them have said they will never, never stop raising their voices.\nThe work we\u2019ve done here today will ensure that we \u2013 and people around the world \u2013 continue to hear them, continue to listen to them, as we work together for a more stable, peaceful, prosperous, and free future for Afghanistan and for every Afghan man and woman.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you all for joining us today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-22/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken At a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Press Briefing Room", "location": "Washington, D.C. ", "date": "July 27, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Full house.\u00a0 Good to see.\nThis week, President Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine entered its sixth month.\u00a0 Costs continue to climb \u2013 thousands of civilians killed or wounded; 13 million Ukrainians forced to flee their homes; historic cities literally pounded into rubble; food shortages, skyrocketing food prices around the world \u2013 all this because President Putin was determined to conquer another country.\nHe\u2019s failed in that goal.\u00a0 Ukraine has not and will not be conquered.\u00a0 It will remain sovereign and independent.\u00a0 As this war stretches on, the courage and strength of Ukraine\u2019s military and its people become even more evident and even more extraordinary.\u00a0 They will do whatever it takes to protect their homes, their families, their fellow citizens, their country.\u00a0 The United States and our allies and partners will continue to stand with them and help provide precisely what they need to defend their freedom.\nIn the coming days, I expect to speak with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov for the first time since the war began.\u00a0 I plan to raise an issue that\u2019s a top priority for us: the release of Americans Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, who have been wrongfully detained and must be allowed to come home.\u00a0 We put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago to facilitate their release.\u00a0 Our governments have communicated repeatedly and directly on that proposal.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll use the conversation to follow up personally and, I hope, move us toward a resolution.\nI\u2019ll also raise the matter of the tentative deal on grain exports that Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the United Nations reached last week.\u00a0 We hope this deal will swiftly lead to Ukrainian grain being shipped again through the Black Sea and that Russia will follow through on its pledge to allow those ships to pass.\nThis has been the focus of the world\u2019s attention for months, including a few weeks ago at the meeting of the G20 foreign ministers in Bali, where one foreign minister after another urged Foreign Minister Lavrov and Russia to stop blocking the grain.\u00a0 So this agreement represents a positive step forward.\nThat said, there\u2019s a difference between a deal on paper and a deal in practice.\u00a0 Hundreds of millions of people around the world are waiting for these ships to set forth from Ukraine\u2019s ports and for millions of tons of grain and other crops to reach world markets.\u00a0 If the Kremlin signed this deal to look reasonable to the world, without any intention of following through, we\u2019ll know that soon enough.\nMy call to Foreign Minister Lavrov will not be a negotiation about Ukraine.\u00a0 Any negotiation regarding Ukraine is for its government and people to determine.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve said from the beginning, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\nBeyond these developments, now that we\u2019ve reached the half-year mark, let\u2019s take a step back and consider the state of the war and what we expect to come next.\nIn the Donbas region, where Russia concentrated its forces after failing to take Kyiv this spring, the fighting remains intense.\u00a0 The modest progress that Russian troops have made there has come at huge cost in both lives and materiel.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Ukraine is using all its defensive capabilities to hit back hard, bolstered by the more than $8 billion in security assistance from the United States since the beginning of this administration.\nAs we look ahead, what the world has heard recently from Russia\u2019s leaders is raising new alarms.\nLast week, Foreign Minister Lavrov said that the Kremlin\u2019s goals in Ukraine had expanded.\u00a0 Now they seek to claim more Ukrainian territory, beyond the Donbas.\nThis is the latest in a series of evolving justifications and ever-shifting goals.\nIn the beginning, Russia said that the purpose of the war was to \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine \u2013 a false charge aimed at delegitimizing Ukraine\u2019s democracy.\nThey said the real threat was somehow posed by NATO, a purely defensive alliance that made efforts to engage Russia for years but was rejected, and that helped safeguard peace, stability, and prosperity across Europe for decades, to the benefit of Russia, among many other nations.\nThen they said the war was to protect ethnic Russians living in Donbas from genocide, before relentlessly targeting the largest Russian-speaking city in Ukraine, Kharkiv.\u00a0 The only one responsible for killing ethnic Russians in Ukraine is President Putin.\nWhat this is about and has always been about is President Putin\u2019s conviction that Ukraine is not an independent state and belongs to Russia.\u00a0 He said it flat-out to President Bush in 2008, and I quote:\u00a0 \u201cUkraine isn\u2019t a real country,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 He said it in 2020, and I quote: \u201cUkrainians and Russians are one and the same people,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 Last month, he said that when\u00a0Peter the Great waged war on Sweden, he was simply taking back what belonged to Russia, and now Russia is again looking to take back what\u2019s theirs.\nPresident Putin has been foiled in his efforts to erase Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence.\u00a0 But now Moscow is laying the groundwork to annex more Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 From downgraded U.S. intelligence, as well as information available in the public domain, we can see that they\u2019re following the same playbook that they used back in 2014.\nThey\u2019re installing illegitimate proxy officials.\u00a0 They\u2019re working to establish branches of Russian banks in areas they control, set the ruble as the local currency, take over broadcasting towers, force residents to apply for Russian citizenship, sabotage internet access for local residents as well.\nAll of this to consolidate their power over these regions.\nOur intelligence also shows that Russia is using filtration centers in eastern Ukraine and western Russia to detain, to interrogate, and in some cases abuse thousands of Ukrainians.\u00a0 Some are allowed to remain in Russian-occupied Ukraine.\u00a0 Some are forcefully deported to Russia.\u00a0 Some are sent to prisons.\u00a0 Some simply vanish.\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see next:\u00a0 Russia-installed leaders will hold sham referendums to manufacture the fiction that the people in those places want to join Russia.\u00a0 Then they\u2019ll use those false votes to claim that the annexation of these regions is legitimate.\u00a0 We must and we will act quickly to make clear to Russia that these tactics will not work.\nAnnexation by force the territory of a sovereign and independent country is a gross violation of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 Members of the international community that have committed to uphold the charter and international law have a responsibility to denounce these plans by the Russian Government and to make clear they will never recognize these illegal acts.\u00a0 Otherwise, no one can claim to be surprised when Russia follows through on its plans \u2013 or if other countries follow suit in the future.\nA few days ago, Foreign Minister Lavrov said, and I quote, \u201cWe are determined to help the people of eastern Ukraine to liberate themselves from the burden of this absolutely unacceptable regime,\u201d end quote.\nBy what right can Russia claim this?\u00a0 Ukraine is not their country.\u00a0 The people of Ukraine democratically elect their own leaders.\u00a0 The Government of Russia has no say in that whatsoever.\u00a0 The right belongs to the Ukrainian people, and the Ukrainian people alone.\nDespite these deeply troubling developments, we should not lose sight of the broader picture.\u00a0 NATO is stronger, more united, and poised to grow.\u00a0 Nearly one-third of NATO members have already ratified Sweden and Finland\u2019s accession protocols.\u00a0 We appreciate the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s swift action to advance those protocols; we hope the full Senate will act quickly to do the same.\nMany countries beyond Europe have condemned Russia\u2019s aggression and are holding Moscow to account.\u00a0 The Ukrainian people are more determined than ever to defend their homeland, preserve their culture.\u00a0 All of these developments refute the Kremlin.\nEconomically, the sanctions we\u2019ve imposed on Russia to end its aggression are having a powerful and also growing effect.\nNow, Moscow has been cherry-picking economic data to support President Putin\u2019s insistence that everything is fine and the Russian economy is going strong.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply not true.\nThe Kremlin says that global businesses haven\u2019t really pulled out of Russia.\u00a0 In fact, more than 1,000 foreign companies \u2013 representing assets and revenue equal to more than a third of Russia\u2019s GDP \u2013 have stopped operations in Russia.\u00a0 Many of Russia\u2019s best and brightest have left as well, including highly educated professionals in critical fields, like energy and technology.\nThey say that Russia is replacing lost imports from the West with imports from Asia.\u00a0 In fact, imports into Russia have dropped more than 50 percent this year, and imports from China, for example, aren\u2019t making up the difference in quantity or quality, especially for high-end components.\u00a0 What that also means is that Russia can\u2019t manufacture products for Russian citizens or for export, and will increasingly lose markets overseas.\nThey say that the government is running a budget surplus because of high energy prices.\u00a0 In fact, the budget is in deficit, and Russia can\u2019t spend the oil revenues it has acquired on the imports it wants because of sanctions.\nThey say that the Kremlin has plenty of sovereign wealth.\u00a0 In fact, half of that money \u2013 half of that money \u2013 is frozen overseas.\nThey say that domestic consumption is still strong in Russia.\u00a0 In fact, consumer spending has plummeted.\nThey say that the ruble is the world\u2019s strongest performing currency.\u00a0 In fact, the currency market is controlled by the Kremlin, Russian households are restricted from converting rubles to dollars, the ruble is trading at a much lower volume than before the war.\nSo, though the Kremlin is working hard to paint a picture of economic stability, the facts show otherwise.\u00a0 The powerful impact of sanctions will grow and compound over time.\nThough President Putin will likely claim that this war was a resounding success, the world can see that it has weakened Russia profoundly.\nPresident Zelenskyy has made clear that the war will end through diplomacy.\u00a0 We agree.\u00a0 The United States is ready to support any viable diplomatic effort.\u00a0 Unfortunately, Moscow has given no indication that it\u2019s prepared to engage meaningfully and constructively, and we\u2019re under no illusion that that\u2019s going to change anytime soon.\u00a0 If and when the time comes, we will bring the full weight of American diplomacy to bear.\nIn the meantime, we\u2019ll continue to do all that we can to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s position on the battlefield so it has the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.\nFrom here in Washington and in all of my travels, I\u2019ll continue to discuss all of this with our partners and allies \u2013 supporting a sovereign, independent Ukraine; resolving the food security crisis; and how we can help create the conditions for a diplomatic resolution.\nLast week, as you know, I had the privilege of welcoming Ukraine\u2019s first lady, Olena Zelenska.\u00a0 She came to the State Department.\u00a0 I told her that the United States will not waiver in our support for the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 That was true six months ago; it\u2019s true today; it will be true long after this war, this aggression is over.\nWith that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Andrea.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary, there are reports that the administration has decided that this substantial offer is to trade convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big offer.\u00a0 Just last week, Bill Burns called him a creep in an interview with me.\u00a0 But you want to get Griner and Paul Whelan out, so what is the prospect of getting Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner out by making such a big trade, arguably over the opposition of the Justice Department \u2013 he\u2019s serving a 20 \u2013 or 5-year sentence.\u00a0 And what can you accomplish in a conversation with Lavrov to try to get this grain deal locked in, since they bombed Odessa within 24 hours of agreeing to the deal?\u00a0 How can you trust anything that Lavrov and the Russians agree to?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Andrea.\u00a0 When it comes to our efforts to secure the return home of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, you\u2019ll understand that I can\u2019t and won\u2019t get into any of the details of what we proposed to the Russians over the course of so many weeks now.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Can you talk about why you would make such an important \u2013 why you would put what you call a substantial offer on the table?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So here\u2019s what I can say about this.\u00a0 First, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve conveyed this on a number of occasions and directly to Russian officials.\u00a0 And my hope would be that, in speaking to Foreign Minister Lavrov, I can advance the efforts to bring them home.\u00a0 We have two imperatives when it comes to arbitrarily, wrongfully detained Americans anywhere in the world, including in Russia, including in the cases of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\u00a0 And I say this because, more than unfortunately \u2013 horrifically \u2013 this is a practice, as you know, that many countries engage in and one that we are resolutely working to end, and I\u2019ll come back to that in a minute.\nBut we have two objectives.\u00a0 We of course want to see those who were wrongfully detained be released and be able to return home.\u00a0 At the same time, it\u2019s important that we work to reinforce the global norm against these arbitrary detentions, against what is truly a horrific practice.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working concertedly on both.\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated with Trevor Reed \u2013 came home a few months ago \u2013 that the President is prepared to make tough decisions if it means the safe return of Americans.\u00a0 At the same time, we are working with partners around the world to use all of the relevant tools at our disposal, including some that were announced just recently in the executive order that the President released to respond to and impose costs on those who engage in this practice.\u00a0 And I believe we can actually fulfill both imperatives.\nAnd let me just say this as well:\u00a0 I think you can expect to hear me in the weeks and months ahead speak more to the efforts that we\u2019re making to reinforce this global norm against arbitrary detention to deter countries from doing this in the first place.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Can you speak to the grain \u2014\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I\u2019m sorry, the grain, I apologize, I didn\u2019t get to, Andrea \u2013 the second part of the question.\u00a0 Look, Andrea, it was incredibly powerful when we were in Bali a few weeks ago at the G20 to see foreign ministers from around the world demand that Russia end its blockade of Odessa and of the grain that has been blocked in Ukraine for six months \u2013 more than 20 million tons.\u00a0 And minster after minster did this from countries around the world geographically to such an extent that Foreign Minister Lavrov decided not to return for the rest of the session that the G20 foreign ministers were holding.\nAnd then I think the steps that we\u2019ve seen Russia take in at least agreeing on paper to allow grain to leave Ukraine is in response to the pressure that Russia is feeling not just from us, not just from G7 countries or even G20 countries, but from countries around the world who are saying \u2013whatever they think about anything else \u2013 end this blockade.\u00a0 Allow the grain to leave.\u00a0 Allow us to feed our people.\u00a0 Allow prices to come down.\nBut the test, of course, now is whether there\u2019s actual implementation of the agreement.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see in the coming days whether what Russia signed it\u2019s serious about and whether the grain gets out.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking toward.\u00a0 The bombings that you saw the other day \u2013 I mean, step back for a second.\u00a0 Irrespective of what they were aiming at, by what right does Russia have to bomb anything in Ukraine, or anything in Odessa, or anything in the port?\u00a0 None.\u00a0 Zero.\u00a0 Anything it\u2019s doing is to further its efforts to conquer Ukraine, which have and will fail.\nBut in the case of grain specifically, what we need to see \u2013 what we\u2019re looking to but what the world is looking to, more important \u2013 is whether those ships begin to sail, whether the grain starts to move.\u00a0 We\u2019ll find out in the next few days.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Happy summer, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Happy Wednesday.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you as well.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And perhaps most importantly,\u00a0happy birthday\u00a0to the State Department.\u00a0 Today is \u2013 I believe is the birthday, right?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Two hundred and thirty-three years.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Where\u2019s the cake?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, I was expecting you to bring one out.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We\u2019ll come back with it.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So two things, but they\u2019ll be real brief.\u00a0 One, when you talk about this substantial proposal, can you \u2013 I realize you won\u2019t get into the specific details of it, but does it involve a swap?\u00a0 Think along the lines of what was done for Trevor Reed.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Because I want to make sure that the proposal that we put forward has a good chance to advance, I\u2019m just not going to get into it in public.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Secondly, for the last couple of months \u2013 well, last six months now \u2013 you have been talking about how Russia is isolated internationally, and yet we see Foreign Minister Lavrov jetting off around Africa and the Middle East and President Putin going to Tehran, and say what you want about him having \u2013 only going to Iran.\u00a0 They make the case that they\u2019re not isolated, and now you\u2019re about to have this conversation with them.\u00a0 So what does that say about the administration\u2019s efforts to isolate Russia when you are actually now reaching out to them to talk about the issues?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Matt, in terms of some of the travels that the foreign minister, for example, is engaged in, what I see is a desperate game of defense to try somehow to justify to the world the actions that Russia has taken both with its aggression in general against Ukraine as well as, more specifically, its blockade of Ukrainian ports and its denying to the world at a critical time the grain, the wheat, the food that it needs.\u00a0 So they\u2019re doing everything they can to somehow justify what they\u2019re doing at a time when we\u2019re hearing from virtually every corner of the world an insistence that Russia stop this blockade and allow the grain to leave.\nSo no doubt Foreign Minister Lavrov will share some interesting views on the war, Russia\u2019s aggression, as well as on grains.\u00a0 For example, one of the things that Russia has been doing is blaming on sanctions the challenges of getting Russian grain out of Russia when, in fact, as everyone knows and as we make clear repeatedly, the sanctions that we\u2019ve imposed on Russia for its aggression against Ukraine from day one exempted wheat, exempted food products, exempted shipping and insurance necessary to move those out of Russia.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a fabrication.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s one that will be repeated, but it\u2019s one that we will continue to debunk.\nBut what I see in what they\u2019re doing is, again, desperately trying to explain the fact that a food crisis that has gone from making 100 million people food insecure three years ago to about 160 million people food insecure during COVID to now well over 200 million because of Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukraine\u2019s ports \u2013 this is somehow trying to justify what\u2019s unjustifiable.\u00a0 The only way that Russia can fully address the concerns of the world \u2013 look, the ideal way would be for it to stop the war, end the aggression.\u00a0 But short of that, end the blockade.\u00a0 There\u2019s a deal on the table to do that.\u00a0 What\u2019s going to be much more important than what Foreign Minister Lavrov says on his travels is what Russia actually does in implementing the agreement.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the world is looking for.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Felicia.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Going back to your discussions with the Russians on the substantial proposal, any \u2013 what\u2019s been the response from them up until this point?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m not going to characterize it.\u00a0 Again, my interest and my focus is on making sure that to the best of our ability we get to \u2013 get to yes, and we \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Do you feel that \u2013 sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And I don\u2019t want to qualify it.\u00a0 Look, one of the things that happens is this, and I mentioned in response to Andrea a minute ago:\u00a0 We\u2019re very focused on getting Brittney and Paul home.\u00a0 At the same time, I\u2019m also focused every single day on arbitrarily detained Americans in more than half a dozen countries around the world.\u00a0 We have a team that works on this 24/7 led by Roger Carstens.\u00a0 This is, for me, an issue of utmost importance.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that I see as fundamental to my own responsibilities in this job: looking out for the men and women of this department, looking out for any American who is arbitrarily detained abroad or otherwise needs our help when they\u2019re overseas.\u00a0 And I say this because this is something we are working every single day, and most of the time we\u2019re working it quietly behind the scenes, for obvious reasons.\u00a0 And I would say just because you don\u2019t see us doing something or you don\u2019t hear us talking about it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\u00a0 On the contrary.\u00a0 This is something that \u2013 bringing people home, bringing Brittney home, bringing Paul home.\u00a0 This is something that we\u2019re focused on 24/7, seven days a week.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Alex.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, let me get a comment on increasing calls to the administration to (inaudible) state sponsor of terrorism.\u00a0 If you ask anybody in Ukraine, they will tell you what Russia is doing every single day \u2013 its scope of its brutality \u2013 if you compare with the countries that already have been designated \u2013 North Korea, Iran and Syria will maybe not (inaudible).\u00a0 So what are we waiting for?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So on this, a few things.\u00a0 First, I\u2019m obligated, the department is obligated to follow the law.\u00a0 Criteria against which we make this determination are defined by Congress.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 And our task is to try to take these criteria that Congress has established and compare them against the facts to make sure that the facts in a particular situation actually meet the criteria that are established in law.\nMeanwhile, as we look at that, we\u2019re aligned with dozens of countries around the world across four continents on the most powerful sanctions, export controls, that I think have ever been levied.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also curtailed international assistance and foreign aid.\u00a0 And the costs that have been imposed on Russia by us and by other countries are absolutely in line with the consequences that would follow from designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.\u00a0 So the practical effects of what we\u2019re doing are the same.\nMore broadly, I would just say this.\u00a0 We\u2019ve methodically ejected Russia from international \u2013 from the international economic order \u2013 I talked about that a little earlier; most favored nation status and borrowing privileges from international financial institutions gone; we\u2019ve restricted its ability to access its frozen central bank funds, to make debt payments; and what you\u2019ve seen is a powerful impact and a growing impact on Russia\u2019s economy and Russia\u2019s economic prospects going forward.\u00a0 So in terms of the impact we\u2019re having, it is very much in line with anything that the SST designation would enable us to do.\u00a0 We\u2019re basically doing everything that we would need to do and want to do.\nSo again, what we\u2019re focused on is making sure that we are meeting the law and the criteria set out in the law, and making sure we\u2019re having the strongest possible impact.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We have time for one final question.\u00a0 Kylie.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Secretary, I\u2019m wondering \u2013 I know you don\u2019t want to get into the details of this proposed deal that you guys have put on the table.\u00a0 But can you detail President Biden\u2019s role in putting that offer to the Russians?\u00a0 Was he involved?\u00a0 Did he sign off?\nAnd then my second question is: With you expected to speak with the Russian foreign minister in the coming days, aren\u2019t the Russians getting exactly what they wanted here in detaining Americans: getting a phone call from the Secretary of State over these detained Americans while this war wages on in Russia?\u00a0 Why not continue these conversations quietly instead of in this public way, where the Russians get this win of having a conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Kylie, in terms of the President, of course he was not only directly involved, he signs off on any proposal that we make and any \u2013 and certainly when it comes to Americans who are being arbitrarily detained abroad, including in this specific case.\nSecond, there is in my mind utility in conveying clear, direct messages to the Russians on key priorities for us.\u00a0 And as I mentioned, these include securing the return home of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\u00a0 They also include, as I\u2019ve mentioned and I would expect to raise, following through on the grain agreement because what we\u2019re seeing and hearing around the world is a desperate need for food, a desperate need for prices to decrease.\u00a0 And if we can help through our direct diplomacy encourage the Russians to make good on the commitments they\u2019ve made, that will help people around the world, and I\u2019m determined to do it.\nAnd then, as I mentioned earlier, I think it\u2019s very important now that we see what Russia\u2019s next plan is \u2013 that is, the annexation of more Ukrainian territory \u2013 that the Russians, Foreign Minister Lavrov, hear directly from me on behalf of the United States that we see what they\u2019re doing, we know what they\u2019re doing, and we will never accept it.\u00a0 It will never be legitimized.\u00a0 There will always be consequences if that\u2019s what they do and that\u2019s what they try to sustain.\nSo we make a judgment in every instance where we think our diplomacy can hopefully advance our interests and values, including direct engagement.\u00a0 We make judgments about when it makes sense to talk about it in public, and as a general proposition, I believe in as much transparency as we possibly can have, and sometimes we make judgments that we\u2019re going to keep conversations quiet.\nSo in this instance, I thought it was important to make clear that on these issues \u2013 the detention of our American citizens, the food crisis the world is facing because of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, and the plans that Russia now has to pursue the annexation of Ukrainian territory \u2013 that our Russian counterparts hear directly from me.\u00a0 Thanks.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url":

Mr. President, it\u2019s a pleasure to have you here at the State Department in the United States. To our colleagues, I\u2019m especially pleased to be able to meet today with the president of Guyana.\nWe\u2019ve come off a very important and good Summit of the Americas, particularly as well our meetings with the CARICOM countries. Guyana has been a very strong partner for the United States and also in many ways a global leader. We\u2019re working together in our region and beyond to try to find solutions to urgent challenges, to include climate, to include food security, energy security. We\u2019re working on issues together, and I think coming out of the Summit of the Americas in particular there is a lot more energy in those efforts, including some things that we\u2019re working on very actively right now that I know we\u2019ll be sharing in the weeks ahead.\nI would note that, quite remarkably, I think something like 86 percent of Guyana is forest. It\u2019s a remarkable contributor in that way alone to the challenges that we face with climate change, but the United States is very eager to continue to deepen and strengthen the partnership that we have on all of these issues and more. Georgetown is also the seat, of course, of CARICOM, and this for us is a very important and vital institution, one which \u2013 with which President Biden, Vice President Harris had, I think, a very significant and important engagement at the Summit of the Americas.\nSo I look forward to continuing the conversations that we all started there and to deepening the work that we\u2019ve already begun between our countries. Welcome. It\u2019s so good to have you here.\nPRESIDENT ALI: Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken. First of all, allow me to express our gratitude for this meeting. We are very pleased to be here at a very important time in the development of Guyana as we seek to further strengthen our relationship with the United States, who we view as an important strategic partner.\nWe just came out of a very successful Summit of the Americas in which we identified some critical issues for CARICOM as a region \u2013 that is food security, energy security, financing, and the issue of climate change.\nIn all these areas Guyana is already providing leadership and we are committing ourselves to continue to provide that leadership. We are pursuing an energy path that seeks to balance our newfound natural resource of oil and gas, but we are not doing that at the detriment of our credentials on environment and climate change.\nAs you rightfully pointed out, our forests stores 19.5 kilotons of carbon. We are a net zero country. And we look forward to discussing how jointly we can continue to work on the issues of food security, climate, financing, working in the region in terms of debt crisis facing CARICOM, but more importantly, finding a balanced development strategy, and doing so staying true to the value system, principles that both of us believe so strongly in \u2013 that is democratic society where transparency, accountability, and strong governance support for the development of Guyana.\nSo I am very pleased to continue this conversation we started at the Summit of the Americas and to work with you on strengthening our partnership.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-secretary-of-commerce-gina-raimondo-at-a-virtual-supply-chain-ministerial-forum/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "date": "July 20, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Welcome, everyone.\u00a0 Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.\u00a0 Very pleased to have everyone join this ministerial meeting on supply chain resilience.\u00a0 People in virtually all of our countries have experienced the pain caused by supply chain disruptions.\u00a0 We have store owners unable to stock their shelves, people with chronic health conditions, we can\u2019t get lifesaving medicines, factories sending home workers because they can\u2019t get the necessary materials and inputs to keep their lines going.\u00a0 More than ever, I think we\u2019ve all come to an understanding about how supply chains are simply essential to meeting our everyday needs.\nThey\u2019re also vital to tackling virtually every pressing global challenge that we face.\u00a0 To prevent a climate catastrophe and adapt to the growing effects of climate change, we need resilient supply chains to produce clean energy technologies, from wind turbines to batteries.\u00a0 To end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that we are better prepared for \u2013 to respond to future health emergencies, we need resilient supply chains for vaccines and other critical health supplies.\nSo this gathering today is just our latest joint effort to try to address these challenges while minimizing disruptions, keeping workers on the job, bringing down costs for families.\u00a0 And here are a few of the ways that we\u2019ve been doing that over the last year or so.\nBack in October, we set up the Microelectronics Early Alert System to anticipate and reduce disruptions for the supply of semiconductors that are critical to our manufacturing.\u00a0 Here in the United States, that\u2019s helped keep American workers on the job at vehicle assembly plants in Michigan and Ohio, and it\u2019s helped keep factories running in partner economies like Mexico and Canada.\nTogether with many governments at this ministerial, we launched the Mineral Supply Partnership, which will invest in producing, processing, and recycling the minerals needed to make clean energy technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels.\nBack in 2020 when COVID-19 was hitting Americans the hardest, India provided medicine and vital supplies to the United States for our industries under strain.\u00a0 When India was facing a massive surge from the Delta variant the following year, we used those same supply chains to provide medical oxygen, therapeutics, and other aid to save lives.\nSupply chains are how the United States has delivered more than 565 million doses of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines free of charge and with no strings attached to countries around the world.\u00a0 And we\u2019re using supply chains to get food, fertilizer, lifesaving aid to people in response to the growing global food security crisis exacerbated by Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nAs we gather today, there are two main goals, I think, that we\u2019ve agreed that we need to focus on.\u00a0 The first is to identify other immediate steps that we can take to reduce disruptions that are most affecting people\u2019s lives and commit to taking those steps.\nThe second is to build the long-term foundation that makes us less vulnerable to future shocks, whether they come from natural disasters and pandemics, from wars, or some other crisis.\nThat is what resilience is all about.\u00a0 Now, we all throw that word around a lot, so let me just take a moment to suggest what it means to us.\u00a0 A resilient supply chain is a transparent one where partners are constantly sharing information in real time to anticipate, to measure, to respond to changes.\u00a0 A resilient supply chain is diversified so that when we can\u2019t get material or service from one source, we can find it somewhere else, and so no one country can weaponize its control over materials or inputs against any other country.\u00a0 That will require investing in research and development, and new manufacturing capacities.\nA resilient supply chain is secure, so we\u2019re less vulnerable to cyber attacks by governments or other actors.\nA resilient supply chain is sustainable, adhering to labor and environmental standards that we\u2019ve agreed on because it\u2019s consistent with our shared values, because we\u2019ve seen how governments that ignore these benchmarks tend to be less reliable partners, and because in 2022 any supply chain that\u2019s not environmentally sustainable won\u2019t be durable.\nSo whether we\u2019re addressing near\u2011 or long\u2011term challenges, there\u2019s only one way to build supply chains that are resilient in all of these ways, and that\u2019s to do it together, with partners \u2013 together with partners in government, including at the regional, the state, the city level, because no one country can cope with inevitable disruptions alone; together with the private sector, because while governments and multilateral institutions shape the rules of the road and can provide incentives, supply chains are ultimately designed, run, powered by businesses and by workers; and not only with industry, but together with all actors in the private sector, including those who have been historically underrepresented \u2013 women, minorities, native-owned enterprises, small and medium sized enterprises, labor unions.\u00a0 The dynamism, diversity, the ingenuity of our private sectors and of the open markets where they compete make us nimbler and more efficient than closed systems.\u00a0 We need to take advantage of this asset.\nYesterday, we hosted four sessions with partners from these diverse groups and organizations.\u00a0 And what we learned is going to inform today\u2019s discussion.\nSo I\u2019m especially looking forward to hearing participants\u2019 views on the challenges we face and what we can do to tackle them together.\nWith that, let me hand it over to my teammate, my friend, my co-host of this meeting, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\u00a0 Gina, over to you.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Thank you, Tony (audio interruption) more important, and I think there is no one who doesn\u2019t now understand the importance of having resilient supply chains.\u00a0 And in order for that to happen, we have to work across governments and as between the public sector and the private sector.\nWe all know \u2013 we all live it every day \u2013 supply chain congestion is challenging us and continuing to stress U.S. imports and exports and the movement of goods here in our country.\u00a0 And as co-chair of our administration\u2019s supply chain disruptions task force, I hear \u2013 I know about these issues.\u00a0 Frankly, I hear about these issues nearly every day or certainly every week from U.S. businesses and U.S. consumers.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s something that we really have to work together, as I say, across governments, among allies in order to solve our supply chain challenges.\u00a0 And we are working hard every day in order to alleviate this issue.\nAnd here in the States, we\u2019re also working hard to convince our Congress to quickly pass funding for the CHIPS Act, which would invest $52 billion in domestic semiconductor production.\u00a0 I will say last night here in the U.S., the United States Senate took a critical vote by a wide margin in a bipartisan fashion to move forward on that bill, so we\u2019re feeling quite optimistic that it will soon get to President Biden\u2019s desk.\u00a0 Additionally, President Biden\u2019s proposed budget requests millions of dollars to respond to the current supply chain crisis and the existing demand for supply chain work.\nI will say here at the Commerce Department, we currently have over 40 workstreams ongoing related to the supply chain, right.\u00a0 There\u2019s no silver bullet; there\u2019s no quick fix to fix our supply chain challenges.\u00a0 And so we are \u2013 and working very closely with Secretary of State and Secretary of Energy \u2013 we\u2019re going industry by industry, product by product, and trying to figure out how to unsnarl the supply chain in any way that we can.\nWe also know \u2013 and we\u2019ve become very, very aware \u2013 that supply chains are global.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we need to engage with likeminded partners, such as all of the people on this meeting and call, to work together if we really will \u2013 are going to be able to find sustainable, lasting, long-term solutions to solve our mutual supply chain challenges.\u00a0 And the \u2013 Tony and I are working very hard with the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, because that\u2019s a way for us to work with our allies in the Indo-Pacific to work together to shore up our supply chains.\u00a0 We are also co-chairing the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, which is off to a fantastic start, and we\u2019re making huge progress in both of these dialogues to make \u2013 to ensure that our supply chain is resilient, efficient, and benefits all of our citizens, industry, labor, civil society; makes sure that all of our efforts are inclusive and the benefits are widely shared.\nAnd of course, we know supply chain \u2013 supply chains are run by the private sector, fundamentally run by the private sector.\u00a0 So governments alone cannot solve the challenges.\u00a0 We need to and we\u2019re committed to engaging private sector partners, local communities, to together envision new ways of forming public-private partnerships, innovating.\u00a0 And I join Tony in sharing the excitement to hear from each and every one of you today around how we can work together to solve these problems.\nSo thank you again for joining us, and I\u2019m excited to hear from you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-moldovan-prime-minister-natalia-gavrilita-before-their-meeting-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

and gentlemen, and esteemed guests:\u00a0 Please welcome the Secretary of State of the United States Antony Blinken, accompanied by Dr. Kari Johnstone and the 2022 Trafficking in Person Heroes.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS JOHNSTONE:\u00a0 Good afternoon and welcome.\u00a0 Please, have a seat.\nMy name is Kari Johnstone.\u00a0 I\u2019m the Acting Director of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons here at the State Department, and I am just going to kick off our ceremony today.\nThank you all so much for joining us.\u00a0 It is great to have you with us here today.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to have Secretary Blinken here to release this year\u2019s report.\nOur program will consist of the following:\u00a0 First, Secretary Blinken will offer key remarks on this year\u2019s report.\u00a0 Next, we will have six amazing TIP Report Heroes whom we will honor for their steadfast dedication to combat human trafficking \u2013 five of whom are with us here in person.\u00a0 We

will find some time to visit state.gov to access this year\u2019s report online.\nWe are so honored to have you join us here today, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you for continuing to elevate the issue of human trafficking as a department priority, and for hosting today\u2019s event.\u00a0 We are proud to serve under your leadership as we work together to advance efforts to combat human trafficking.\nLadies and gentlemen, the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 And welcome to the State Department, welcome to the Benjamin Franklin Room, and especially to our heroes, welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you here in person at the State Department.\nToday, we\u2019re releasing the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report.\u00a0 It assesses how 188 countries and territories, including the United States, are performing in terms of preventing trafficking, protecting victims, prosecuting traffickers.\u00a0 That makes this one of the most comprehensive sources of information anywhere on anti-trafficking efforts by governments \u2013 what works, what doesn\u2019t, and how we can continue to do better.\nNone of this would be possible without the extraordinary efforts of many people, starting with the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, under Kari\u2019s remarkable leadership.\u00a0 Thank you again for everything that you\u2019re doing, everything your team is doing every single year, but also so many diplomats, journalists, advocates, academics, and especially survivors who contribute to our understanding of this terrible crime.\nThank you to our colleagues across Congress who have joined us today.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for the partnership that we have with Congress on combatting trafficking.\nThank you, too, to members of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking and on the Human Trafficking Expert Consultant Network, colleagues who are here with us today.\u00a0 These are two platforms that make it possible for us to work directly with survivors to shape more effective anti-trafficking policies.\nAnd finally, again, thank you to our six 2022 TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Five are here with us in person, as Kari said, and we\u2019ll honor them later this afternoon.\u00a0 So I\u2019d just like to mention the one hero who\u2019s not actually with us today, for obvious reasons.\u00a0 Let me just say a few words.\nKahtehrynah Chehrehpahkha leads the Ukrainian chapter of the anti-trafficking NGO La Strada.\u00a0 As we all know, since the start of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, millions of Ukrainians have had to flee their homes \u2013 some internally within Ukraine, some leaving the country altogether \u2013 many, most with just what they were able to carry \u2013 and that makes them highly vulnerable to exploitation.\u00a0 La Strada has a hotline.\u00a0 It\u2019s received an unprecedented number of calls over the past five months.\u00a0 The organization has given literally thousands of Ukrainians the information and assistance that they need to try to stay safe as they\u2019re forced from their homes.\nKahtehrynah \u2013 and all of our TIP Heroes \u2013 are making a huge difference in the lives of people around the world.\nI think most of you know this, but it\u2019s worth repeating:\u00a0 The scale of this problem is vast.\u00a0 There are nearly 25 million people currently victims of trafficking. \u00a025 million people.\u00a0 The United States is committed to fighting it because trafficking destabilizes societies, it undermines economies, it harms workers, it enriches those who exploit them, it undercuts legitimate business, and most fundamentally, because it is so profoundly wrong.\nTrafficking in persons violates the rights of all people to be free: free to do what you want, be who you want, make the life that you wish.\nEarlier this year, I had an opportunity to chair the first meeting of President Biden\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.\u00a0 We brought together 20 agencies across our government to talk about how to implement the National Action Plan that the President released last November.\u00a0 This, for those who don\u2019t know, is a three-year strategy that includes strengthening prosecutions of traffickers, enhancing victim protection, preventing the crime from occurring within our borders and abroad.\nThis report is a key part of our strategy.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we do every year, and as I said, a huge amount of work goes into actually bringing it to fruition.\nSo here\u2019s where we are.\u00a0 I think if you look at the report, you\u2019re going to see a mixed picture of progress.\u00a0 Twenty-one countries were upgraded a tier, because those governments made significant, increasing efforts to combat trafficking at home as well as for their citizens abroad.\u00a0 Eighteen countries were downgraded a tier, indicating that they either didn\u2019t make significant, increasing efforts to combat trafficking \u2013 or worse, that their governments have a state-sponsored policy or pattern of trafficking.\nAs the report details, corruption continues to be a top tool of traffickers.\u00a0 Complicit government officials may turn a blind eye to illicit activities, provide false documents for workers, tip off traffickers to impending raids.\u00a0 Corruption allows traffickers to continue to act with impunity.\nMeanwhile, in 11 countries, the government subjects its own people to trafficking \u2013 for example, as retaliation for political expression or through forced labor on projects of national interest.\nThat can look like subjecting people, including children, to forced labor in key sectors \u2013 mining, logging, manufacturing, farming \u2013 or sending members of ethnic minority groups to be \u201cderadicalized\u201d in camps.\nIt can also mean deploying workers around the world without telling them where they\u2019re going or what they\u2019ll be doing, confiscating passports and salaries, forcing them into dangerous work conditions, and constantly monitoring their movements.\nThat\u2019s what happened to Zhang Qiang, a Chinese laborer who signed onto a Belt and Road project in Indonesia last year.\u00a0 He was drawn by the higher pay, which he promised his daughter would be used to buy her a bed.\u00a0 But when he arrived in Indonesia, he was stripped of his passport, instructed to sign a contract for a longer duration and lower pay than he\u2019d been promised.\u00a0 Armed guards patrolled the workers\u2019 camp, making escape virtually impossible.\u00a0 After failing to get help from the Chinese embassy in Jakarta, he managed to board a boat to escape Indonesia via Malaysia, but then was apprehended by Malaysian authorities.\u00a0 By the last reporting, he was on track to be deported back to China.\nAnother challenge that you\u2019ll see laid out in this year\u2019s report is the climate crisis and the instability that it helps accelerate and create.\u00a0 As we\u2019re seeing in our hemisphere, climate is a key driver of mass migration, which can create, alas, ideal conditions for traffickers.\u00a0 And according to the UN Environment Programme, natural disasters \u2013 as well as the loss of livelihoods that they produce \u2013 may increase trafficking by up to 30 percent.\nEven the higher demand for clean energy can have unintended consequences.\nConsider, for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, that\u2019s home to much of the world\u2019s cobalt, which is a critical component for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles \u2013 something very important for our efforts to combat climate change.\u00a0 Some of that cobalt is mined by children, who are then pushed into work through coercion, through fraud, through force.\nI make this point because we need to be aware that as we tackle issues like climate and corruption throughout our \u2013 through our diplomacy, we also have to address how they intersect with trafficking in persons.\u00a0 Traffickers seize every opportunity to exploit victims for profit.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to be just as determined \u2013 in fact, more determined and more creative \u2013 to stop them.\nNow, the report also identifies several interventions that are making anti-trafficking efforts more effective.\u00a0 And one is this year\u2019s theme: more survivor engagement.\nSurvivors of human trafficking know \u2013 through deeply painful experience \u2013 the tactics that traffickers use, the obstacles that survivors face as they get free, the support that can help the most as they work to rebuild their lives.\u00a0 So what the report emphasizes and what I want to emphasize today is that need for us to listen \u2013 listen to them, empower them, partner with them at every level of our work.\nWe\u2019re seeing more organizations around the world ask survivors to serve as advisors \u2013 for example, the Albanian Coalition of Shelters for Victims of Trafficking, which provides victims and survivors with safe housing.\u00a0 They helped create an advisory board of survivors to make sure that their interventions are designed to actually fit the real-world needs of the populations that they\u2019re serving.\nOur own United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking is comprised entirely of survivors who make recommendations on federal anti-trafficking policies to the President\u2019s interagency task force.\nAnother important tool is better data collection, making sure that our practices and bringing this together to help track cases, to help allocate resources, to measure the effectiveness of anti-trafficking policies.\u00a0 And so we\u2019re focusing on that.\nIn the Philippines, to cite one example, the government launched a technology platform so that multiple agencies can work together to manage cases of victims as well as prosecute their traffickers.\nIn Uganda, the government partnered with two NGOs to launch the Trafficking in Persons mobile app platform.\u00a0 That helps investigators share details of cases they\u2019re working on.\u00a0 That helps bring more traffickers to justice.\nThese examples highlight the kind of information-sharing and partnership that we believe will bring us closer to our goal of a world that is free from human trafficking in all of its forms.\u00a0 And that\u2019s precisely the kind of information-sharing and partnership we hope this year\u2019s TIP Report will spur for governments as well as for advocates around the world.\nTraffickers don\u2019t respect borders.\u00a0 The harm caused by this crime is vast; it\u2019s varied.\u00a0 And it will continue to take relentless diplomacy, coordination, advocacy, and commitment, which is in this room and on this stage, if we\u2019re going to stop it.\nSo I simply want to say this:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you to everyone here for the dedication that you\u2019re showing to fighting trafficking and advancing human freedom and dignity, because at the heart of everything is the dignity that every human being deserves.\u00a0 And thank you, again, to everyone whose hard work \u2013 Kari, you and your team \u2013 made this report possible.\nThank you very much, and back to you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS JOHNSTONE:\u00a0 Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, for your poignant and effective words.\nI am now thrilled to turn to celebrating the 2022 TIP Report Heroes.\nPlease join me as we recognize and honor this year\u2019s six heroes.\nMr. Mohammed Tariqul Islam.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of his unyielding determination to provide assistance to victims of human trafficking, improve the investigation and prosecution capacity of the Bangladeshi Government, and increase cross-border collaboration to facilitate repatriation of survivors.\nMajor Mohammad al-Khlaifat.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of his critical role in implementing new ways to cooperate with the Jordanian anti-trafficking community, which led to formalized information sharing within the Public Security Directorate and with prosecutors, as well as a formal agreement with the Civil Aviation Regulatory Authority, to improve anti-trafficking efforts and ensure victims receive vital services.\nJudge Cornelius Wennah.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of his resolute efforts to build capacity in Liberia\u2019s criminal justice sector to successfully prosecute human traffickers and his strong advocacy for the active inclusion of traditional leaders and civil society organizations in Liberia\u2019s National Anti-Trafficking Task Force.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMs. Irena Dawid-Olczyk.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of her extraordinary leadership in directly assisting victims of human trafficking for more than a quarter of a century, lending her expertise in the creation of anti-trafficking training materials and films, and maintaining a strong relationship with the Polish Government to prevent the exploitation of refugees across the Poland-Ukraine border.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMs. Apinya Tajit.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of her heartfelt and unwavering persistence in advocating for workers exploited in forced labor, particularly in the fishing industry, assisting victims with their reintegration into society, and sharing her expertise with government officials and anti-trafficking authorities.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUnfortunately, our TIP Report Hero from Ukraine was not able to join us for this momentous occasion.\u00a0 However, we still want to honor her accomplishments.\u00a0 And you will see her photo on the screens: Ms. Kateryna Cherepakha.\nIn recognition of her remarkable engagement with the Government of Ukraine and international stakeholders to build the capacity of officials to identify victims of human trafficking, her tireless victim advocacy, and her work developing and conducting training courses for first responders as an OSCE National Expert.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd now, we will hear from one of the 2022 TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Please welcome Mr. Mohammed Tariqul Islam.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR ISLAM:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon.\u00a0 What a privilege to be here and speak on behalf of the 2022 TIP Report Heroes.\nI know for each of us it\u2019s an honor to be part of small network of individuals who have been recognized in the fight against human trafficking.\u00a0 But of course, I know the survivors are the real heroes each of us is able to serve.\nIn the UK last week, four-time gold medal Olympian Sir Mo Farah told his story as a survivor of human trafficking.\u00a0 His story reminds us that wherever we are in the world, human trafficking has left its mark, and we must do whatever we can to bring freedom, justice, and change.\u00a0 It is critical to ensure that the survivors are kept at the very heart of the story, and that is what I have learned the importance of at the organization I work for, Justice and Care.\nThe TIP Report Heroes give us hope.\u00a0 The network of heroes is a reminder of the power each of us has to respond to the growing issues of the human trafficking.\nAn example of that is Kateryna Cherepakha from Ukraine, who has been named as a TIP Hero this year for her work during the war in Ukraine helping the most vulnerable.\nMs. Tajit, the TIP Report Hero from Thailand, is passionate about doing what is right, not what is easy.\u00a0 She wants to see the maritime industry free from trafficking in her lifetime.\nMs. Dawid-Olczyk, the TIP Report Hero from Poland (inaudible) increase public diplomacy to de-escalate armed conflict and to prevent conflict-affected vulnerable people from being exploited.\nTIP Report Hero Judge Wennah from Liberia believes that this award will serve as an impetus to help his fight against human trafficking.\nAnd the TIP Report Hero Major Mohammad al-Khlaifat from Jordan appreciates all governmental and non-governmental efforts to combat trafficking in Jordan and hopes that Jordan can soon be free of human trafficking.\nThe awards and the TIP Report as a whole remind us of the power of the government to act.\u00a0 I know from my experience in Bangladesh that the TIP Report matters.\u00a0 It shapes government response and providing for the bandwidth organization, nonprofit, like Justice and Care, to work with them on effective solutions.\nThank you for your global leadership on the issue.\u00a0 Please do more of it, so that countries even more focus on the issue.\u00a0 In Bangladesh, that leadership has led many changes, including passing a high standard anti-human-trafficking law, development of national plan of actions, and setting up separate anti-human-trafficking tribunals.\u00a0 And those changes lead to tangible impact in the lives of the survivors.\nIn Bangladesh, we have the privilege of working with hundreds of survivors of human trafficking.\u00a0 We watch them with joy and pride as they rebuild their life, testify and use their experience to help others, and shape change at scale.\u00a0 Their stories demonstrate hope.\u00a0 The award is theirs.\nI\u2019ll close with a story.\u00a0 Ahali (ph) is a child of human trafficking we have the privilege of supporting.\u00a0 She returned home and feel nothing but shame.\u00a0 She wanted to take her life.\u00a0 We worked with her though, and she is now flourishing.\u00a0 She has developed a successful business, has a family, and using her experience to help others through a champion survivor program.\u00a0 She, too, is a hero.\nThanks to the Department of State and Secretary Blinken for sponsoring exchanges like the IVLP to help us connect to people around the globe working with the survivors and to fight eliminating human trafficking, and for recognizing the work that makes Ahali\u2019s and many other stories possible.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS JOHNSTONE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mohammed, for sharing that important message on behalf of all of this year\u2019s heroes. \u00a0Let\u2019s give this amazing group of leaders another round of applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It is such an honor to celebrate your important work.\nThe TIP Report continues to be a vital tool to inform the world about human trafficking and encourage governments to enhance and intensify anti-trafficking efforts in their countries.\u00a0 This year we chose to highlight the importance of meaningful engagement with trafficking survivors and the importance of integrating their expertise to improve anti-trafficking policies and strategies.\nIn the 2021 TIP Report, the department cited only seven governments with active efforts to consult and engage survivors.\u00a0 In the 2022 report, we have documented more than four times that number, 34 governments who actively \u2013 (applause) \u2013 absolutely.\u00a0 And these 34 governments actively took steps to incorporate survivor input into their policies and anti-trafficking approaches.\nThe 2022 TIP Report introduction cites governments with advisory councils and boards that include survivor leaders, elevating their participation among key policymakers, as in the United States and Albania.\nIn addition, this introduction also recognizes the governments that consulted experts with lived experience of human trafficking in the development of national action plans like Rwanda, Guyana, and the Netherlands.\nMany governments were added to this list \u2013 newly engaging survivors in national anti-trafficking planning efforts \u2013 during the most recent reporting period, like Bangladesh, as Mr. Islam noted, alongside Botswana, Finland, Iceland, North Macedonia, and Uganda, among others.\nIn addition, in Armenia, the Dominican Republic, India, and Spain, governments sought survivor input on reforming existing or new draft anti-trafficking laws.\nMany governments involved survivor leaders in shaping and delivering targeted awareness and outreach efforts, raising their voices to ensure impactful and clear messaging to facilitate change, as was done in Kosovo, Malta, Pakistan, Slovakia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates.\nAll this demonstrates that recognizing the importance of consulting survivors\u2019 expertise is a growing, global trend, and we are so pleased to be able to document these emerging efforts across the 2022 TIP Report narratives.\nAnd, of course, we know survivor leaders and experts with lived experience of human trafficking have advocated long and hard for a seat at the table and a substantial role in the development of governmental anti-trafficking programs and policies.\u00a0 It is because of their hard work that so many governments have been able to increase their efforts to meaningfully engage survivors and it is because of their commitment and expertise that we have a deeper understanding of how to do this engagement the right way.\nOne example I am proud to point to is the department\u2019s Human Trafficking Expert Consultant Network, comprising individuals with lived experience of trafficking.\u00a0 This year, network consultants worked with us to develop best practices to seek information from foreign governments and other key stakeholders for the 2022 TIP Report, ensuring that it more fully captures the impact of inequity and marginalization.\u00a0 Experts with lived experience in human trafficking have also helped us develop survivor-informed policies, programs, and resources for our government and beyond.\nIt is imperative that we engage survivors early and often.\u00a0 As we begin to see growing interest of our bilateral and multilateral partners to responsibly engage survivors, we are more hopeful than ever that elevated survivor voices will strengthen our anti-trafficking efforts around the globe.\u00a0 When governments and civil society prioritize partnerships with survivors, meaningful engagements can flourish and lead to better outcomes.\nEvery year, my office works in partnership with our colleagues across the State Department to ensure that the report is both comprehensive and accurate.\u00a0 This is the result of robust collaboration and healthy discussions, for which we are thankful.\u00a0 We also appreciate our colleagues across the U.S. Government as well as our dynamic allies around the world, both our foreign government counterparts and our collective partners in NGOs and international organizations, who continuously lend their voice to effect change through policy and law.\u00a0 We are especially grateful to those with lived experience of human trafficking whose expertise and contributions to this report cannot be overstated.\u00a0 Last, but not \u2013 definitely not least, I would like to give a heartfelt thanks to the experts and hard-working team of the Trafficking in Persons Office for your deep expertise and tireless commitment to this issue and this report.\u00a0 The hard work and long hours that you\u2019ve put into the production of this report are important and will effect real change as part of our robust diplomatic strategy, working with governments, community leaders, and civil society to put into action the report\u2019s prioritized recommendations.\nEach of us in this room has a role to play in the fight against human trafficking, whether in federal, state, or local

Blinken At a Virtual COVID-19 Global Action Plan Foreign Ministerial Meeting\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "July 19, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (Inaudible) thank you and Japan for your leadership role today as well as throughout.\u00a0 It is greatly appreciated, and I think I\u2019m in violent agreement with pretty much everything you just said.\u00a0 Japan has played a critical role in our Global Action Plan on COVID, particularly the last-mile support like expanding the cold chain technology so more vaccines can actually be shipped to more places.\u00a0 And let me thank, as well, Director General Tedros of the World Health Organization for joining us today and for his leadership every single day in this global effort.\nBack in February, when we foreign ministers last met on COVID, we launched the Global Action Plan to try to accelerate progress across six key lines of effort that were focused on the areas of the greatest need, where we identified the biggest gaps: getting more shots into arms, strengthening our supply chains, closing information gaps to try to increase confidence in vaccines, providing more support to frontline workers, increasing access to treatments and therapeutics, and finally, building a stronger, more effective global health architecture for the future.\u00a0 And you heard Foreign Minister Hayashi touch on virtually all of those lines.\nAnd what is so inspiring is that countries stepped up to take responsibility for individual lines of effort based on their unique capabilities, with rigorous coordination across all of these lines of efforts.\u00a0 Because ultimately, that\u2019s the only way that we\u2019ll finally succeed in ending the acute phase of this pandemic.\u00a0 So I think it\u2019s fair to say that since then, we\u2019ve achieved real progress on all six lines of effort that we decided on together.\nJust on shots in arms, for example, among the 92 low- and middle-income countries supported by COVAX\u2019s Advance Market Commitment program, vaccination coverage in that time has jumped from 28 percent at the end of January to 48 percent today.\u00a0 That is real, significant \u2013 insufficient, but real significant \u2013 progress.\nWe\u2019re seeing individual countries make major strides.\u00a0 For example, Malawi, which recently focused on vaccinating elderly people with a campaign that reached more people in two days than all previous efforts combined \u2013 targeted campaigns like these are critical to trying to close the vaccination gaps.\u00a0 To that end, the United States began distributing pediatric vaccine doses last month.\u00a0 This is for children ages five to twelve.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already donated more than six million doses to eleven countries and we\u2019re going to do more, because kids everywhere deserve protection from COVID-19.\nOn supply chains, our countries have begun working on an international clearinghouse platform for medical supplies that will make it easier for suppliers to actually connect with buyers, and that will produce much greater efficiency in this effort.\nOn closing the information gaps, we have campaigns underway in a number of countries to combat misinformation and disinformation.\u00a0 To cite a couple of examples, in the Philippines, the United States worked with religious leaders to boost vaccine confidence.\u00a0 These leaders incorporated COVID-19 messages into their prayer services.\u00a0 They reached more than half a million people in two parts of the country.\u00a0 Now 97 percent of eligible people in those places have been vaccinated.\nOn support for health workers, among the 92 low- and middle-income AMC countries, 75 percent of health workers have now been vaccinated.\nOn increasing access to treatments, this is the next challenge that we have to address together, and Foreign Minister, Hayashi also touched on this.\u00a0 And we do that, we think, by accelerating our work on robust test-to-treat programs that can connect a patient with treatment when they test positive.\u00a0 That reduces hospitalization; it saves lives.\nAnd finally, on enhancing global health security more broadly, last month the World Bank helped establish this new financial intermediary fund that Foreign Minister Hayashi mentioned, and we appreciate very much, Yoshi, Japan\u2019s initial contribution.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to help strengthen national, regional, and global capacities to prevent the next pandemic \u2013 or if not to prevent it, to make sure that we have in place what\u2019s necessary to mitigate it and to help people.\nSeveral donors have already stepped forward, including the United States.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made a pledge of $450 million.\u00a0 We hope more will contribute because, as we\u2019ve seen with COVID-19, sustainable financing is necessary to break the cycle that we often see: a panic when something happens and then neglect after a little while.\u00a0 That\u2019s what too often characterizes global health security.\nAll of these efforts will help us tackle other outbreaks happening around the world, like monkeypox and other diseases.\u00a0 The health of our people is simply more secure when we\u2019re doing this, when we\u2019re working together.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019ve already demonstrated that in the months since the Global Action Plan took off.\nLet me just commend everyone and every country that rose to the challenge and showed leadership across all of these different lines of effort.\u00a0 Our list of partner countries has grown.\u00a0 This meeting is actually significantly larger than it was six months ago.\u00a0 That\u2019s also an encouraging sign of the world\u2019s commitment.\nNow, again, to echo my friend the foreign minister, we have to keep going but with even greater urgency.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing a rise in infections in every region, as well as new variants that are more transmissible, even as vaccination remains a strong defense against hospitalization and death. Many of you are battling higher infection rates from BA.4 and BA.5, just as we are in the United States.\u00a0 These variants will continue to threaten us until we\u2019ve vaccinated more people everywhere.\nSo we can\u2019t be complacent.\u00a0 We have to continue to marshal attention.\u00a0 We have to continue to marshal commitment to ensure that ending COVID-19 remains a top focus for our governments and for our citizens.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got to continue to coordinate relentlessly with each other, because this is the definition of a challenge that no country can solve alone.\nWe\u2019ve got two months until we all gather at the UN General Assembly, so I would just urge that we accelerate our work so that when we meet in New York, we have new progress to announce, new ideas to discuss, new innovations to share.\nAgain, to everyone here today, thank you for being part of what really is a worthy enterprise on behalf of all of the people the world.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-to-employees-at-the-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

only one of them counts, and it\u2019s not director.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut thank you not just for the incredibly kind words but thank you for the outstanding leadership of this organization, which is simply absolutely vital to the well-being and security of the country that we share and the country that we love.\u00a0 We have had the great privilege of working together for all too long now.\u00a0 I think we must have started together in some kind of program for junior high school kids, but it\u2019s been a while.\u00a0 And there is also no doubt in my mind that there is no one better suited to be leading this community, particularly given the extraordinary complex challenges we\u2019re facing, than Director Haines.\nAnd though it\u2019s a relatively new office in the overall scheme of things, probably you are the only director, at least in the history of this institution, who can, if necessary, rebuild the electronics of an airplane, spar on a judo mat, talk theoretical physics, maybe sell a few books at the same time.\u00a0 So it\u2019s actually powerful because I think one of the things that makes Avril so extraordinary is the incredible diversity of her experience and the different inputs in her life.\u00a0 So much of what we are doing, so much of what you\u2019re doing, has more interconnections than at any time in our professional experience.\u00a0 Having someone with the breadth and depth of your experience at this particular moment in our history, I think we could not be in a better place.\nAnd I think all of you who have been working with the Director know that when it comes to being kind, when it comes to being decent, when it comes to having an intellect that is only surpassed by your character, we couldn\u2019t be better off.\u00a0 So to you, I am so grateful.\nMorgan?\u00a0 Where is Morgan?\u00a0 Is he here?\u00a0 So my hat\u2019s off to you as well.\u00a0 We go back a long ways, too.\u00a0 I can think of a few \u2013 just a few holidays ruined by some crisis where we were on a SVTC together at all hours in all parts of the world, and it\u2019s wonderful to continue this collaboration, have all of you \u2013 and have you in particular as a colleague.\nTo everyone who is joining across the ODNI enterprise, the broader Intelligence Community, it\u2019s very simple.\u00a0 I really wanted to come both to have a chance for an exchange this afternoon but just to say the two words that don\u2019t get said often enough but that are really, really important, and that\u2019s thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the incredible dedication that you\u2019re bringing every single day to making sure that this government is informed and that our country is a little bit safer and a little bit more secure.\u00a0 Thank you for the extraordinary professionalism you bring to that and thank you for being wonderful colleagues across the board.\nAs Avril said, throughout my time in government, and it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m now coming on to 30 years, which is hard to believe \u2013 but on the Hill, at the White House during a couple of stints, at the State Department during a couple of stints, I have, and I continue every single day, to rely on the IC.\u00a0 And everyone I\u2019ve worked with, starting with the President of the United States, has relied on the IC every single day.\nWhen the Obama-Biden administration came to an end, and I started working with then-former Vice President Biden helping to set up an institution with the University of Pennsylvania, we spent a fair bit of time together getting that off the ground.\u00a0 And the thing that he told me he missed the most about being vice president was starting the day with the PDB.\u00a0 He felt like there was something so unique, so special about that, and that he\u2019d been a little bit disconnected from this lifeblood of information that you were providing to him as vice president every day.\u00a0 Well, I think one of the things he\u2019s most pleased about being back as President is being able to tap into that again.\nThere are a lot of truisms when it comes to the work you\u2019re in, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re any less true for being truisms.\u00a0 You do make sure that we on the policy-making side of the equation have the information, have the insights, have the analysis that we need to try to make the best decisions possible.\u00a0 No guarantee, alas, that we\u2019ll make the right decisions, but at least it won\u2019t be for lack of information, it won\u2019t be for lack of intelligence, it won\u2019t be for lack of analysis.\nAnd then the thing that is maybe as important as anything is the fact that you give us your unvarnished take on what we are learning, what we\u2019re picking up, including when it isn\u2019t what we would most hope we would hear; it\u2019s what we need to know.\u00a0 And as long as that continues, then I think we\u2019ll really and you really will be doing your jobs.\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s the most important thing of all.\nI said we\u2019re \u2013 state the obvious \u2013 dealing with a world of incredible complexity and a world that\u2019s incredibly fast-moving in ways it never was before.\u00a0 In my own 30 years, I think the thing that\u2019s changed most as I thought back on it is the information environment that we\u2019re operating in.\u00a0 Think about it this way.\u00a0 And again, a lot of this is obvious, but it\u2019s worth occasionally just stepping back and remembering this.\u00a0 When I started in government in 1993, the information set that we were dealing with as policy makers consisted primarily of three networks that everyone tuned into at 6:30 or 7 o\u2019clock at night; a couple of national newspapers \u2013 the\u00a0Times,\u00a0The Washington Post, maybe\u00a0The LA Times\u00a0or\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0\u2013 that everyone got a physical copy of, a hardcopy of, when they woke up in the morning by opening the door to their apartment or their house, and that was pretty much it.\u00a0 That was \u2013 there was a common base of information.\u00a0 Then, of course, there was the work that the Intelligence Community was providing and our embassies were providing.\nNow, of course, we\u2019re living in a world where we\u2019re getting some kind of information feed intravenously every millisecond.\u00a0 The pressure on policy makers to respond, to react, to just do something on the basis of every single input of information we get is intense, and the Director knows this from having been on both sides of the equation.\nI think one of the most important things that we can try to do and that you\u2019re making sure that we can do is to be also a little bit of a circuit breaker in this process, to be able to not only make sure that, yes, we are getting the information in real time and getting it before everyone else, but also helping to put it in perspective, helping to understand what it means, helping to make sure that to the extent we\u2019re being proactive, that\u2019s great and it\u2019s as we should be; to the extent we\u2019re being reactive, we\u2019re doing it in a smart and deliberate way, not simply reacting for the sake of reacting because there\u2019s intense pressure to do that.\nIt\u2019s really hard to get that right.\u00a0 I can just tell you as a policy maker it\u2019s very, very challenging.\u00a0 I know the demands on you to provide the information as quickly as possible \u2013 in a sense, sometimes, to get it first but not necessarily to get it right \u2013 is intense.\u00a0 And I would just say one of the things I think we have to do together is constantly remind ourselves that we need to try to make sure we get it right even as we get it first.\nBut when you\u2019re putting everything together \u2013 whether it\u2019s cyber security or food insecurity that we\u2019re dealing with now; the climate crisis and all of its implications, particularly the security implications that flow from it; the ongoing challenges posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; terrorist threats to the United States, which have not gone away, to our people, to our interests overseas, so much else \u2013 your ability to deliver the most relevant, the most timely, the most objective data, analysis, information is simply indispensable to us doing our jobs and keeping people safe, in collaborating effectively with our allies and partners, and getting results.\nThis collaboration piece to me is also more important than ever.\u00a0 Another truism that I repeat endlessly \u2013 but I think it\u2019s just important for people to step back and think about this \u2013 is that there is virtually not a challenge that we face as a country, as a nation, in terms of the impact of these issues on our people that we can effectively, truly effectively, advance alone.\u00a0 And whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s the impact of emerging technologies, each of these defies unilateral solutions, and at least in my 30 years, there\u2019s a greater premium than there\u2019s ever been before on finding ways to collaborate, to coordinate, to cooperate with others, whether it\u2019s other countries, whether it\u2019s other groupings of countries, whether it\u2019s other institutions.\u00a0 And we know how challenging that is.\u00a0 We know the frustrations that come along with that.\u00a0 But it is absolutely vital.\nAnd there, thanks to this extraordinary community, we have in my 30 years experienced one of the greatest examples of how the Intelligence Community enabled collaboration and cooperation the likes of which we have not seen before when it comes to Ukraine and when it comes to Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 It is really one of the moments that I take the greatest satisfaction in and that I hope you take the greatest pride in, because we spent, as you all know very well, many months as we saw the mounting potential for Russian aggression against Ukraine trying to build the strongest possible collaboration and coalition of countries, both to make sure that support for Ukraine would be there if Russia followed through on the aggression, that pressure on Russia to end the aggression would be there through meaningful coordinated sanctions, and of course, that we would also make sure we were shoring up the defenses of our Alliance in NATO.\u00a0 And we were doing that even as we were pursuing as aggressively as we possibly could diplomacy to try to ward off the aggression at the end of last year.\nThe fact that we were able to bring to our allies and partners the extraordinary information that you were able to find \u2013 to do it in real time and to lay out for them and ultimately to lay out for the world, including at the United Nations \u2013 in the immediate lead-up to the aggression exactly what we saw the Russians as preparing to do and then do was extraordinary.\u00a0 Months of intelligence collection, reporting, analysis.\u00a0 You had confidence long before it happened that President Putin planned to launch this second military assault on Ukraine, and the fact that we were able and you were able to get to a place where we could downgrade and declassify an unprecedented amount of intelligence made all the difference in building that coalition so that we were ready to go on day one and we had the world with us.\nSo one fun \u2013 sort of fun \u2013 anecdote about this that \u2013 appreciate.\u00a0 You\u2019ll all remember that in the immediate run-up to the aggression, we had a pretty good idea that the Russians were likely to press go at a certain time, and then there were arguably a few things that derailed the exact timing.\u00a0 But we had been telling people this is likely to happen in the next 48, 72 hours.\u00a0 Got put off a little bit by some of their own misadventures; I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u00a0 On the day that it actually happened, I was on the phone that morning with a very senior European colleague who I will not identify.\u00a0 And I said to this colleague, \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen next 24 hours.\u201d\u00a0 And the colleague responded, \u201cYou\u2019re still saying that?\u201d\u00a0 This person called me at about 1:30 in the morning saying \u201cI guess you were right.\u201d\nWell, I was right only because you were right.\u00a0 And you were right before anyone, and that empowered our diplomacy in ways that I had never seen in my experience.\u00a0 So thank you, thank you, thank you for that.\u00a0 It\u2019s made all the difference in the world.\nNow, the only problem with the success that you\u2019ve achieved is that you\u2019re only as good as your last success.\u00a0 So we have to keep doing it.\u00a0 And we are.\u00a0 The exchanges that you\u2019re having, everything that we\u2019re doing with our counterparts around the world to continue to share whatever we can share about what we\u2019re seeing, what we\u2019re understanding, what we\u2019re analyzing, that is going to remain critical to the success that we\u2019re having.\nBut here\u2019s the bottom line:\u00a0 I suspect that people are going to be studying for a long time how we deployed the intelligence in this crisis way ahead of schedule, and they\u2019re going to be studying that for a long time.\u00a0 Moving forward, if we continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards of accuracy, credibility, transparency, I think we can leverage intelligence in new ways to support our diplomacy.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from this.\u00a0 There is a profound synergy between our intelligence and our diplomacy that we\u2019ve now discovered in new ways and that I think we really need to continue to make part of our thinking, not just when it comes to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine but across the board, whenever and wherever it\u2019s appropriate.\u00a0 It\u2019s the biggest difference-maker I\u2019ve seen.\nSo we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to use intelligence to try to spotlight dangerous, destabilizing activities by adversaries and competitors, but also I want to make sure that we\u2019re using it to leverage positive opportunities that are also out there and that we can\u2019t lose sight of.\u00a0 And maybe we\u2019ll have a chance to talk about that a little bit more this afternoon.\nSo let me just conclude with a couple of quick thoughts.\u00a0 So many of you have been working more than overtime these last few months, since before the war in Ukraine began.\u00a0 I know that that brings with it a lot of personal sacrifices when it comes to family, when it comes to friends, to make sure you get the job done.\u00a0 And yet this is still \u2013 more than still \u2013 it remains something that is immediately only the front burner, continues to demand tremendous time, tremendous energy, tremendous resources.\nAnd we have to keep digging in.\u00a0 The crucial updates on the Russian aggression; tracking disinformation, including threats to our elections; working with the State Department, with our allies to identify, to assess, to document evidence of atrocities in Ukraine as they happen \u2013 all of this is also part of the commitment we have to hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities.\nLast week we were able to put out to the public a lot of what we\u2019ve learned about one of the many horrific aspects of this aggression, and that is the deportation of hundreds of thousands of people from Ukraine into Russia \u2013 including orphans, some made orphan by the Russian aggression.\u00a0 It\u2019s so vital that the world continue to see and understand the human dimension of what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 So much of this becomes an abstraction, but being able to share with the world what we\u2019ve learned about some of what this means on a human level is, I think, hugely important.\nHaving said all of that and despite this unprecedented declassification strategy, you know this better than I:\u00a0 Much of what you do, most of what you do, remains outside of public view.\u00a0 But what I really wanted to share again today, and I know this not just from me but, even more important, from the President, is that he knows, I know because I see it every morning, how much you\u2019re doing to advance our interests, to defend our security, to keep this country safe.\nSpeaking for the State Department, we\u2019re particularly grateful for the partnership with ODNI and all of the IC agencies.\u00a0 Now, some of you know this, some of you don\u2019t:\u00a0 Our Bureau of Intelligence and Research, INR, actually has its roots in the Office of Strategic Services, which was created during the Second World War to try to coordinate espionage behind enemy lines, which actually makes INR the oldest civilian intelligence element in the U.S. Government, even older than the CIA.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Just thought I\u2019d mention that for the record.\nAnd I\u2019m especially pleased to be joined here today by the leader of INR, Assistant Secretary Brett Holmgren, who\u2019s doing an outstanding job for us.\u00a0 And what I hear from Brett virtually every single day is the strength of the collaboration and the coordination we have across the IC.\u00a0 So much of the work that our team does at INR is possible because of the collection, the analysis, the coordination that happens here at ODNI and across the entire Intelligence Community.\nAnd through the Joint Duty Rotation program we have literally dozens of IC employees with unique skills, technical expertise, perspectives that have been placed in bureaus across the State Department.\u00a0 Your diplomat colleagues basically help us do our jobs better, smarter, more effectively.\u00a0 So thank you for that.\nThe bottom line is this, two words that really stand out: professionalism, patriotism.\u00a0 That sums up the IC for me.\u00a0 That sums up my experience with it.\u00a0 And maybe I\u2019ll just add one other P, and that\u2019s partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for it every single day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/on-the-2022-elie-wiesel-act-report-to-congress-and-new-u-s-strategy-to-anticipate-prevent-and-respond-to-atrocities/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn the 2022 Elie Wiesel Act Report to Congress and New U.S. Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to Atrocities\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Wendy R.

in the People\u2019s Republic of China, where genocide and crimes against humanity are being perpetrated against Uyghurs in Xinjiang; in Afghanistan, where the Taliban continues to abuse the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, members of ethnic and religious minority groups, and other marginalized people; in Syria, where the Assad regime has committed war crimes; in Myanmar, where Secretary Blinken earlier this year announced his determination that members of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya.\nAll too often, in the decades since we began saying, \u201cNever again,\u201d after the Holocaust, governments \u2013 including the United States \u2013 tended to be reactive, rather than proactive.\u00a0 We took action, after atrocities had already occurred: documenting human rights abuses and making the findings known to the public, denouncing and sanctioning perpetrators, investigating and prosecuting them in court, providing support to the survivors and to their communities.\nThese measures are important.\u00a0 Indeed, accountability is crucial to uncovering the truth, to punishing those who have done grave harm, to achieving some measure of justice for victims, survivors, and their families.\u00a0 But accountability alone is not enough.\u00a0 We must work to stop atrocities, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide from occurring in the first place, to protect victims by preventing them from being victimized.\nIn 2018, Congress passed the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act in recognition that atrocity prevention is a priority and a responsibility of the United States.\u00a0 The 2022 Elie Wiesel Report, which we are releasing today, updates Congress and the public on the United States efforts to address genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in every part of the world, including specifically aligning our work to support evidence collection, impose sanctions, and hold perpetrators accountable in these and other countries.\nAnd we are going further today as well by launching the first ever Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to Atrocities.\u00a0 This plan will help coordinate resources and direct activities not only at the State Department but across the federal government in three key areas.\nFirst, anticipation.\u00a0 We know from painful experience that the human and economic costs of atrocities are higher when we wait to respond, as opposed to when we can take early action to prevent escalation.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the strategy emphasizes the importance of data collection, observation, intelligence gathering, and analysis.\u00a0 Under the strategy, we will work through the White House-led Atrocity Prevention Task Force to identify the countries and regions most at risk for atrocities and develop targeted plans for prevention and response.\nSecond, prevention.\u00a0 We will use our foreign assistance dollars as well as our diplomacy to strengthen institutions and societies, provide emergency and humanitarian relief, and help address underlying tensions and advance justice in countries at risk of atrocities and escalation. We will deepen our work with allies and partners, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to coordinate our efforts and mobilize coalitions to take preventive action.\u00a0 And we will train U.S. diplomats and foreign aid workers to recognize the warning signs that atrocities may be on the horizon.\nThird, response.\u00a0 As we know all too well, there will still be times when, despite our best efforts and those of our allies and partners, we cannot prevent atrocities from occurring.\u00a0 We will continue to deploy the full range of tools we have available to then hold people and governments to account for atrocities and human rights abuses.\nWe know none of these measures is sufficient on its own, and we must be humble about what even this new strategy can achieve.\u00a0 Despite the best efforts of the world, over the more than seven decades since the end of World War II, we have seen genocides in Rwanda, in Bosnia, in Myanmar.\u00a0 We have seen reports of sexual violence used as a weapon of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in ISIS-controlled regions of Iraq and Syria, and now in Ukraine.\u00a0 We have seen reports of extrajudicial killings in Colombia, in the Philippines, in Afghanistan.\nBut this new strategy makes plain to the world once again that the United States stands with the victims of these abuses, and that we refuse to give in to cynicism.\u00a0 We refuse to accept that atrocities and human rights abuse are inevitable.\u00a0 We can do better.\u00a0 The world can do better.\nTo quote Elie Wiesel again, \u201cNeutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.\u00a0 Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.\u201d\u00a0 This strategy and our other ongoing work to prevent atrocities once again demonstrates the United States commitment to standing on the side of victims and survivors, and holding the perpetrators of atrocities to account.\nThank you again for joining us this morning and for everything you do, every day, to make progress on these tremendously challenging issues.\nNow, please join me in welcoming Isobel Coleman, deputy administrator for USAID, who will share more about the important work USAID is doing to prevent and respond to atrocities.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR COLEMAN:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you so much to Assistant Secretary Witkowsky for your introductory remarks, and to Deputy Secretary Sherman for your really, inspirational remarks, too.\u00a0 And thanks to the entire interagency team for working and developing this very ambitious strategy and for producing the fourth annual report to Congress.\u00a0 So, thank you.\nAs we look at the world, from Burma to Ukraine, it\u2019s easy to feel like \u201cnever again\u201d is an aspiration out of reach.\u00a0 But we know, both from empirical data and from our partners\u2019 passion and commitment when they put themselves on the line to fight for peace and human rights that prevention is possible.\u00a0 We have seen time and again how U.S. Government efforts have helped address risk factors.\nThe comprehensive strategy we\u2019re delivering today reflects the U.S. Government\u2019s recognition that we not only need to address the crises in front of us, but we also need to invest in and work closely with local partners in places that are not making daily headlines.\u00a0 This strategy gives us a framework to ensure the U.S. Government can effectively and proactively engage in atrocity prevention with our local and international partners, and when necessary, mitigate effects.\nAtrocities are preventable.\u00a0 They are not inevitable.\u00a0 They are not random acts.\u00a0 There are always risk factors and warning signs before an atrocity takes place.\u00a0 The question is not if we can prevent atrocities; the question is whether we act early enough when prevention is still possible.\u00a0 Through decades of reflection and analysis, we\u2019ve learned that atrocities do not happen in a vacuum.\u00a0 Rather, they are symptoms of larger challenges.\u00a0 They manifest in the worst forms of violence and human rights violations, resulting from pernicious long-term development challenges like authoritarianism and democratic backsliding, lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law, conflict and political instability, gender inequality, and corruption.\u00a0 These trends are all too familiar, but our strategy for atrocity prevention and response accounts for some of the most glaring risk factors, including eroding trust and intercommunal conflict, the proliferation of disinformation, poor governance, and efforts to undermine the rule of law and to walk back fundamental rights.\nDevelopment assistance is uniquely positioned to help prevent atrocities.\u00a0 At USAID, even assistance aimed at other long-term goals in affected regions can support atrocity prevention.\u00a0 Health programs can support those directly affected through psychosocial and medical care.\u00a0 Economic growth programs can be structured to foster social inclusion.\u00a0 Inclusive service delivery can improve governance.\u00a0 At the same time, while development work may help strengthen the overall enabling environment for atrocity prevention, targeted interventions based on risk analysis and deep local knowledge and partnerships are essential.\nIn areas of greatest risk, good development simply isn\u2019t enough.\u00a0 We need dedicated atrocity prevention efforts and, when necessary, atrocity response.\u00a0 USAID\u2019s work to prevent, respond to, and support recovery from atrocities builds on many years of experience in the Balkans, Colombia, Burma, Ethiopia, Sudan, and elsewhere.\u00a0 This work ranges from small rapid-response efforts to tackle specific risks to large multiyear comprehensive programs.\u00a0 It covers countries that are currently low or medium risk, as well as high-risk countries and those currently experiencing mass atrocities.\u00a0 Our work seeks to reduce the risks of violence and human right violations writ large while targeting specific groups facing heightened risks, such as religious and ethnic groups, groups targeted for who they are or what they believe; women, who are too often the victims of conflict-related sexual violence; and pro-democracy activists targeted by authoritarian leaders.\nIn Burma, for example, USAID is working to support the safety and security of hundreds of journalists, high-profile activists, and other civil society actors, and to improve civil society\u2019s abilities to use information technology and cyber hygiene to counter disinformation and maintain a peaceful opposition.\nIn Ukraine, USAID is continuing its long-term support for government and civil society efforts to document human rights abuse, including atrocities; support truth-telling efforts; strengthen the legal enabling environment; build capacity of legal practitioners to investigate and prosecute these crimes; and provide legal assistance to conflict-affected civilians to ensure justice and accountability and put an end to impunity.\nAnd in Bosnia and Herzegovina, USAID is helping to build partnerships among religious leaders of multiple faiths, diverse groups of youth, and community leaders to promote mutual respect and foster connections across different communities, strengthening their ability to maintain non-adversarial relations amid efforts to sow division.\nDevelopment assistance like USAID\u2019s is necessary, but clearly not sufficient.\u00a0 We know we must work in close coordination across the U.S. Government as outlined in the strategy.\u00a0 We must avoid siloing this work and instead link it to related efforts, such as the Global Fragility Act; Women, Peace, and Security Act; and others.\u00a0 We recognize the unique approach that each challenge requires, but we also increasingly see that all of these related interventions reinforce each other.\nWe must also work with other governments through multilateral fora and international working groups, and above all, we must support the leadership and engagement of local actors.\u00a0 Our USAID missions have longstanding, deep relationships with local institutions, organizations, and actors who have the greatest understanding of complex local dynamics, whether in capital cities or remote areas.\u00a0 These relationships are built on trust and allow us to support those who are most affected to determine their own futures.\u00a0 Recognizing that states are duty-bearers for protecting human rights, we must use all diplomatic levers to engage government actors in countries at risk, which is why I\u2019m so proud to stand today with my State Department colleagues here.\nThe challenges are immense, but our commitment is unwavering.\u00a0 The U.S. Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to Atrocities is an important step towards atrocity prevention, and now all of us \u2013 all of our agencies \u2013 must work together diligently to make it a reality.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY WITKOWSKY:\u00a0 Well, thank you both for those inspiring, moving, and informative remarks.\u00a0 Thank you.\nThis concludes the formal remarks part of our program today.\u00a0 We would like to invite the guests, who are here with us, to join us in the foyer for a reception.\u00a0 We have some refreshments, and we also have copies of the publications that we\u2019ve been discussing today.\u00a0 For those of you online, the publications will be posted; and you can access them there.\u00a0 Thank you all again for coming.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-20/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

It is wonderful to be back in Thailand.\u00a0 We had a trip that was planned a few months ago that was delayed because of COVID, so I\u2019m finally glad to make it here.\u00a0 And I was reflecting, in conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don that the first time I was here was actually in 1980, so 42\u00a0years ago.\nAs I said at the signing that we had earlier today of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Deputy Prime Minister, the strength of the relationship between our countries lies in how we are constantly evolving to try to meet the needs of our people and to try and address the challenges we face.\nWe\u2019re working together to revitalize our economies, a central topic in my meetings with the Prime Minister and with the Deputy Prime Minister.\u00a0 We share the same goal of not just driving growth, but trying to ensure that it creates opportunities for all our people.\nWe\u2019re doing this together, bilaterally.\u00a0 The United States is Thailand\u2019s largest export market and third largest investor, and through new efforts like the ones we launched today to shore up our supply chains, we\u2019re going to be making our economies even more secure.\nWe\u2019re doing it regionally, through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 As a founding partner, Thailand is taking a leading role in shaping that framework to position our workers, our businesses, our governments to lead in areas that are critical to our shared prosperity, like clean energy, like the digital trade.\u00a0 And we very much appreciate Thailand\u2019s leadership of APEC this year; we look forward to building on that success when the United States takes over as host next year.\nWe also had candid discussions today on democracy and human rights \u2013 core values that we share.\u00a0 One of democracy\u2019s unique strengths is the ability to acknowledge our flaws and work to address them. \u00a0This spirit is reflected in the Communiqu\u00e9 on Strategic Alliance and Partnership that we signed today, which reaffirms our commitment to helping one another live up to the principles of free and open societies, such as an independent civil society and free and fair elections.\nWe\u2019re also deepening what has been decades-long cooperation in public health.\u00a0 Thailand is a crucial partner in the COVID-19 Global Action Plan that we established to try to end the acute phase of this pandemic and leave the world better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future emergencies.\nWe\u2019ve donated more than 2.5 million doses of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines to Thailand \u2013 free of charge, no political strings attached \u2013 while USAID has provided significant assistance to communities that are facing the highest risks.\nOur two countries partner in responding to regional challenges and regional crises.\u00a0 The United States is working with Thailand, and all of ASEAN, to push Burma\u2019s regime to fulfill the five-point consensus, end its brutal violence, and put Burma back on the path to democracy.\nThis morning I actually had an opportunity to meet with some young leaders from Burma, who are committed as ever to building a democratic future.\u00a0 More than 91,000 displaced people from Burma are currently in Thailand, part of the nation\u2019s proud tradition of welcoming refugees.\nFor decades the United States has provided support for those efforts here in Thailand, including $45 million in humanitarian assistance this year alone.\nFinally, we\u2019re deepening the bonds, the connections between our peoples.\nToday I met with some Thai alumni from the Fulbright Program, the International Visitor Leadership Program, and the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. \u00a0More than 5,000 Thais have participated in these programs over the years.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been enriched by their interaction with Americans, just as Americans have benefited from their engagement with Thai students, scholars, innovators, and leaders.\nFew people in history have done more to foster these ties than the great diplomat, Thanat Khoman.\u00a0 Among his many contributions, he pushed for Thailand to become one of the first countries to host Peace Corps volunteers from the United States.\u00a0 And when he was asked why, he said, \u201cIt is well that governments should come into contact with one another, but it is even more important for people to come into contact with one another,\u00a0to have first-hand knowledge, first-hand experience, and also first-hand ideas about what we should do in this world to keep peace and develop friendly relations.\u201d\nSo I\u2019m grateful that, all these years later, that we continue to find new ways to bring our governments together but, more important even, to bring our people together to the benefit of all of us.\nSo I want to thank the government and people of Thailand for hosting us so warmly today, on a Sunday.\u00a0 And with that, I\u2019m happy to take some questions.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Shaun?\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Could I follow up on the comments you made about Burma/Myanmar?\u00a0 You talked about the five-point consensus, but of course it\u2019s been over a year since ASEAN put that forward.\u00a0 It\u2019s been over a year since the United States has been putting sanctions on the junta.\u00a0 Are you still confident that this approach is working?\u00a0 What else can be done?\u00a0 What else can the United States do to restore democracy, to help restore democracy in Burma?\nCan I follow up on a couple points on that?\u00a0 The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, was also recently\u00a0\u2013 besides being in Bali, was also recently in Myanmar.\u00a0 Do you see his efforts and China\u2019s efforts helping or hindering the diplomacy that ASEAN and the United States are doing on Burma?\nAnd on that, some have called for the U.S. to formally recognize the NUG as a legitimate government of Myanmar.\u00a0 Is that something in the cards, including a representative office in Washington?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Look, as a bottom line, I think it\u2019s unfortunately safe to say that we\u2019ve seen no positive movement.\u00a0 And on the contrary, we continue to see the repression of the Burmese people.\u00a0 We continue to see violence perpetrated on them by the regime.\u00a0 We continue to see virtually the entire opposition in jail or in exile.\u00a0 And we continue to see a terrible humanitarian situation, exacerbated by the fact that the regime is not delivering what\u2019s necessary for the people.\u00a0 And that\u2019s also putting real pressure on Thailand as people flee from the violence, from the repression, in Burma.\nOn that note, I should say that we very much appreciate what Thailand has done to try to facilitate cross-border assistance, to try to expand cooperation on, for example, getting COVID-19 vaccines to people in Burma and to those displaced.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s even more that we can do to make sure that humanitarian organizations have access to people along the border to make sure they\u2019re getting the assistance they need.\nBut look, at this point I think a few things.\u00a0 One, all countries have to continue to speak clearly about what the regime is doing in its ongoing repression and brutality.\u00a0 We have an obligation to the people of Burma to hold the regime accountable.\u00a0 Regional support for the regime\u2019s adherence to the five-point consensus developed by ASEAN is also critical.\u00a0 That has not happened, and I think all the ASEAN countries need to hold the regime accountable for that, to continue to demand an immediate cessation of violence, the release of political prisoners, and a restoration of Burma\u2019s democratic path.\nBut to date, we have not seen positive movement in that direction.\u00a0 We will continue to look for ways that we can\u00a0\u2013 and other countries can effectively put pressure on the regime to move back to the democratic path, and we\u2019re doing that on a regular basis.\u00a0 That was part of the conversation that we had today.\nI can\u2019t speak directly to what China is or isn\u2019t doing in Burma, but I think it\u2019s also incumbent upon China, and in China\u2019s interests, to see Burma move back to the path that it was on and it was so violently disrupted from by the coup.\nI think this is something that we\u2019re deeply focused on, even as we\u2019re spending, of course, a lot of time on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t lost sight of Burma, we haven\u2019t lost sight of its people.\u00a0 I had an opportunity today to sit down with some remarkable young people from Burma to talk about what they see as its democratic future, and we are working with young people, we\u2019re working with the National Unity Government, we\u2019re working with other genuine representatives of the Burmese people, and we\u2019ll continue to do that, including supporting the work of the NUG.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 I will turn to Mr. Chanchai Pratheepwattanawong.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Recently China just confirmed that President Xi Jinping will attend the APEC meeting in November.\u00a0 Any update from U.S. Government if President Biden will attend, as well?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, we very much look forward to participating in the APEC Summit and, as I mentioned, we\u2019ll also be taking the APEC baton next year.\u00a0 So we are \u2013 we spent some time talking to our friends here in Thailand about their leadership of APEC, what lessons we can learn as we take the baton.\u00a0 I can\u2019t speak yet to who will be participating, but the United States will very much be present.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Nike Ching, VOA.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 On Sri Lanka, can you comment on the crisis there, as the country is facing the worst economic crisis since its independence, and its president is going to resign next week?\u00a0 Would you attribute the crisis to the food and energy prices hike linked to Russia\u2019s invasion in Ukraine, and if it would cause similar instability in other parts of the world?\nAnd separately, if I may on China, to follow up the previous question, is there any progress on firming up next interaction between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and if there is a prospect of first face-to-face meeting between them at G20 Summit?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Nike.\u00a0 With regard to Sri Lanka more broadly, this is something that we\u2019re closely following.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at the political developments.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen now thousands of people of all backgrounds taking to the streets, looking for accountability, looking for transparency, looking for a better future.\nI would note that the prime minister announced that he will step down when all parties agree to form a new government.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also seen reports from the Sri Lankan parliament, the speaker, who said the president intends to step down on July 13th.\u00a0 We\u2019re tracking all of that.\nBy the way, we would urge the Sri Lankan parliament to approach this with a commitment to the betterment of the country, not any one political party.\nAnd then it\u2019s incumbent on the government, whether it\u2019s a new, constitutionally-selected government, the existing government, to work quickly to try to identify and implement solutions that will bring back the prospect of long-term economic stability, address the Sri Lankan people\u2019s discontent, which is so powerful and palpable, over the worsening economic conditions, including power, including food \u2013 and I\u2019ll come back to that in a minute \u2013 including fuel shortages.\nAt the same time, as we\u2019re seeing this unfold, we condemn any violence against peaceful protestors and journalists.\u00a0 The Sri Lankan people have a right to peacefully raise their voices.\u00a0 At the same time, we call for a full investigation, arrest, prosecution of anyone involved in any protest-related violence and incidents of violence.\nYou asked about the impact of the Russian aggression in Ukraine on food insecurity and the impact, potentially, on Sir Lanka.\u00a0 Well, I think we are seeing that impact around the world, and it may be one of the contributing factors to what\u2019s happened in Sri Lanka, although I think there were, as I\u2019ve just said, many others that have come together.\nBut what we are seeing around the world is growing food insecurity that has been significantly exacerbated by the Russian aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve had opportunity to discuss in recent days, there are more than 20 million tons of grain that are sitting in silos in Ukraine that can\u2019t get out, can\u2019t get out to feed people around the world because Russia is blockading Ukraine\u2019s ports in Odessa, the Black Sea.\nWe have a fertilizer crisis that is having a real impact here in Thailand, a fertilizer shortage, prices that have gone sky-high.\u00a0 That is very significant, especially in a farming country, a vibrant farming country like Thailand, because in the absence of fertilizer, we know that means that next year yields will go down, prices potentially will go up.\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the reasons that President Biden dedicated half a billion dollars a few weeks ago to incentivizing more production of fertilizer in the United States that we can share with the world.\nSo we\u2019re seeing the impact of this Russian aggression play out everywhere.\u00a0 It, again, may have contributed to the situation in Sri Lanka.\u00a0 We\u2019re concerned about the implications that it has around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re working very hard to address those implications, including by putting significant resources into addressing humanitarian needs from food insecurity right now, as well as investing in longer-term production and sustainability, so that countries have the wherewithal to produce the food that they need over time.\nAnd then, with regard to President Xi and President Biden, our expectation is that they will have an opportunity to speak in the weeks ahead, and I can\u2019t talk to what may happen in the fall.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Mr. Jompol Daosukho.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hello.\u00a0 Could you make it clear that \u2013 about the U.S. Government role in Asia-Pacific, as called Indo-Pacific?\u00a0 Because some Thais are growing too concerned about your role.\u00a0 Some say that the U.S. Government will build the new version of NATO in our region.\u00a0 Could you make it clear that it is or not?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We have a commitment to and a vision of \u2013 that I think is shared with many other countries \u2013 of this region and its future, one that is free, one that is open, one that is secure.\u00a0 And that means, among other things, that people, products, investment can move about freely and go where it\u2019s needed.\u00a0 It means that countries can make their own decisions about their own futures, their own policies, free from coercion by anyone else.\u00a0 It means that people in those countries can live freely, speak freely, and aspire to an even better life in the future.\u00a0 That is the future that we\u2019re trying to build.\nAnd we\u2019re doing that in a variety of ways.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that by working, for example, very closely with ASEAN as well as within APEC.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that through some new initiatives that we\u2019ve launched, including the so-called Quad that involves India, that involves Japan, that involves Australia, where, among other things, we\u2019ve come together to be able to produce and distribute many, many vaccines to deal with COVID-19.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that tries to address the most important factors of the 21st century economy in ways that affect the lives of citizens in all of our countries; the digital economy, which is increasingly important; secure supply chains; the rules that surround the use of technology, to make sure that technology is used in a way that protects privacy and advances freedom, not uses a tool of repression; to make sure that governance is effective and devoid of corruption.\u00a0 All of those things are part of our vision.\nAnd the last thing I\u2019ll say is that this is not about demanding or insisting that countries choose; it\u2019s about giving them a choice.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, everyone.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you all.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-thai-prime-minister-prayut-chan-o-cha-before-their-meeting/", "title":

First and foremost, I\u2019d like to warmly welcome you to Thailand.\nI also wish to thank the Government of the United States and President Biden himself for the warm welcome afforded to me in Washington on the occasion of the ASEAN-U.S. Special Summit back in May. I hope to have the opportunity to welcome him to Bangkok for the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting later this year, and on other occasions.\nI note that this is a long visit for you, given that, prior to your arrival in Thailand, you attended the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Indonesia, and I hope the meeting went well.\nI am pleased that we have continued our close and cordial relations between the \u2013 our two countries, and that our relations continue to increase in momentum. This is especially true, taking into account the important occasion next year of the 190th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. And I hope that we can \u2013 are able to convert this into tangible benefits and outcomes.\nI also had the opportunity recently to meet with Secretary Austin here in Thailand, just this last month, having previously met in Washington back in May. What is important now is to push our cooperation, not only between Thailand and the United States, but between ASEAN and the United States, into tangible cooperation in areas such as public health and climate change, as well. As such, I am particularly pleased that just this morning we signed a Communiqu\u00e9 on the Strategic Alliance and Partnership between the two countries.\nBoth our countries and, indeed, the entire world have suffered from economic impacts from various crises in the past. I hope that this situation improves so that we can improve the livelihoods of our peoples.\nOn the specific issues concerning our bilateral cooperation, I understand that you had constructive and fruitful discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs this morning, and he has already relayed the messages from your meeting this morning. Today I wish to hear your thoughts on the various issues.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0Well, thank you very, very much, Prime Minister. It\u2019s wonderful to be here finally, a visited delayed but very much anticipated. I\u2019m grateful to everyone for their wonderful hospitality, especially on a Sunday. So thank you.\nAnd we did have very good conversations this morning. I think the statement that we signed together not only reaffirms the alliance between our countries, but also shows the breadth and depth of our partnership. And as the Deputy Prime Minister and I said, it sets the foundation for the next 190 years. So we will get to work on that.\nBut we were very pleased to have you in Washington for the ASEAN Special Summit, we\u2019re committed to ASEAN centrality, and to our own partnership with ASEAN. We\u2019ve very much appreciated your leadership with APEC this year, and we\u2019re looking forward to taking the baton from you for next year. But meanwhile, we\u2019ll look to the Summit in November.\nAnd we\u2019re very, very pleased, as well, that Thailand is an original member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Framework. This is \u2013 the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, excuse me. This is a very important opportunity for us to help shape the economy going forward in ways that really benefit our people in Thailand and the United States, and the work that we\u2019re doing together on COVID, including through the Global Action Plan.\nSo it\u2019s a pleasure to be with you, and to pursue the conversation, and to continue to strengthen the partnership between our countries. Thank you for having us.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-before-meeting-with-u-s-exchange-alumni/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Thanks for coming together. Thanks for coming together on a Sunday. I really appreciate that. But I was really looking forward and excited to meet all of you, to hear from all of you.\nOne of the things that I think is the most powerful thing that we do is the exchange programs that you\u2019ve each participated in, in one way or another. And one of the things that we found over many, many years is we have a really, really good ability to identify the most talented people, and to have a \u2013 have some real connection with the United States, and build relationships that last for years and, hopefully, also have an impact back in your own countries.\nSo I was anxious to hear a little bit about your own exchange experiences, but especially what you\u2019ve done since, because I know that you\u2019re each, in different ways, working on trying to make our society a little bit healthier, a little bit safer, a little bit more inclusive in different ways. So I really wanted to hear from you, and hear what you\u2019ve been doing, and hear the extent to which the experience of the exchange programs may have had an effect on what you\u2019ve been doing.\nSo with that, thank you all for meeting today.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-thai-deputy-prime-minister-and-foreign-minister-don-pramudwinai-remarks-to-the-press/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

And we, in particular, the hosts, are very much pleased to welcome Secretary Blinken during his first official visit to Thailand. And certainly this visit allows to follow up on the visit of the Prime Minister when he was in Washington, D.C. in May this year, and the bilateral meeting we had in Washington September, last meeting in the year 2021, and the previous one in May 2022, too.\nAnd as we\u2019re celebrating the 190th anniversary of diplomatic relations, another milestone of the Thai-U.S. relation has been set, and today we just finish off with the signing of a communiqu\u00e9, the Thai-U.S. Communiqu\u00e9 on Strategic Alliance and Partnership, which is a testament to our close alliance and longstanding ties of friendship, which set forth our strategy goals based on shared values and common interests.\nApart from the Strategic Alliance and Partnership Communiqu\u00e9, the second signing was on the MOU on promoting supply chain resilience. Again, this ensures strong, resilient, and diverse supply chain cooperation, particularly in critical industry, in technological innovation.\nAnd certainly, apart from the signing, we had discussion, as you probably noted, that \u2013 it was more than 45 minutes allowed\u00a0\u2013 but it was a very useful and fruitful discussion that we had, covering a number of issues. And all those issues you may ask. I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re allowed to be answering questions, but then certainly not only bilateral issues were discussed, regional issues, made the main channel of our discussion as well. And not only regional, but international was also included.\nWe also touched on the APEC, ASEAN, which Thailand is currently in the \u2013 the host and the chair.\u00a0 We will be passing the torch to the United States for 2023 chairmanship of APEC by the U.S.\nSo I\u2019ll try to make it short. I know we can hear more from our visitor, Secretary Blinken. Please, and I would keep this remark as short as it is. Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Don, thank you. Thank you so much. Hello, everyone. It\u2019s really a pleasure to finally be here. We had a trip planned earlier that COVID got in the way of, but it\u2019s wonderful to be here now, to be with you, and also to see you so soon after your recent visit to Washington, and to continue the extremely productive dialogue, conversation we have about the relationship between the United States and Thailand, our work together with ASEAN, and so many other things.\nI\u2019m especially pleased to be in Thailand at a time when we have an ally and partner in the Indo-Pacific of such importance to us that is in a region that is shaping the trajectory of the 21st century, and it\u2019s doing that every single day.\nAs the chair of APEC this year, Don, Thailand is at the forefront of doing that shaping. To name just one example, thanks to Thailand\u2019s leadership we\u2019ve seen APEC nations work together this year to promote economic policies that are aligned with tackling the existential challenge of our time, and that is climate change.\nOur countries share the goal of a free, open, interconnected, prosperous, resilient, and secure Indo-Pacific. In recent years we\u2019ve worked together even more closely toward that vision.\u00a0\nOur economic ties are incredibly strong. And even now, emerging from COVID, they will grow stronger. We\u2019re grateful for Thailand\u2019s partnership in launching with us the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. That\u2019s going to help create a stronger, fairer, more resilient economy that will help families, it will help workers, it will help businesses across the region.\nOur security ties are strong. Just a few weeks ago, Secretary Austin and Prime Minister Prayut discussed new ways to advance together regional security, including by expanding joint training and exercises and also collaborating in emerging areas of concern, like cyber and space.\nAnd of course, we\u2019re working very closely together, the United States and Thailand, on the climate crisis. Thailand was the first country to join our Clean Energy Demand Initiative, which connects countries looking to expand their use of renewable energy with companies that can help them do just that. Already we have got seven companies that have signaled their interest in investing up to $2.7 billion in Thailand\u2019s clean energy infrastructure, and Thailand is moving forward with these collaborations.\nThese are just a few of the examples of Thailand and the United States deepening ties. As Don said, 190 years, we\u2019re building the foundation for the next 190 years. And the two documents that we just signed will strengthen our alliance even further.\nThe Communiqu\u00e9 on Strategic Alliance and Partnership is, in my judgment, very significant because it highlights the depth and the breadth of our relationship, and it lays out new areas where we can work together even more closely, like promoting clean and renewable technologies including electric vehicles, carbon capture technology, and ensuring that more of our peoples can participate in and benefit from the digital economy.\nSecretary of State Dean Rusk, one of my very illustrious predecessors, and Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman signed a communiqu\u00e9 in Washington 60 years ago that solidified the U.S.-Thai alliance. With this new agreement, we\u2019re expanding their vision. We\u2019re broadening our cooperation. We are taking a partnership between us fully into the 21st century.\u00a0\nAs Don said, the other document that we signed together addresses one of the key issues of our time that has been brought into such clear relief by the COVID crisis and that affects the daily lives of Thais and Americans alike, and that is supply chains and the need to have resilient supply chains. The memorandum of understanding that promotes supply chain resilience will make it easier for Thailand and the United States to quickly share information and consult on possible supply chain disruptions so that we can actually take early action to mitigate problems.\u00a0\nThis memorandum of understanding will also make it easier to work with our respective private sectors to identify ways to make existing supply chains run more smoothly. Again, the COVID pandemic has made clear to people around the world how critical it is that we have reliable supply chains, for example, to ensure that people have access to lifesaving medicines, to personal protective equipment. All of that we\u2019ve seen in such stark relief these last couple of years.\nSo with these new agreements, our countries will do even more together to actually deliver for our people. That\u2019s the objective\u00a0\u2013 to make their lives a little bit safer, a little bit healthier, a little bit more prosperous. That spirit of seeking shared progress I think has been inherent in our partnership from day one. So next year we will celebrate 190 years of diplomatic relations. There\u2019s a document that began our friendship, the 1833 Treaty of Amity and Commerce, and it was signed on a scroll that was no more than 90 inches long. And it certainly included no mention of renewable energy or supply chains.\u00a0\nWhat it did say was this. It said that our countries would engage in commerce, and I quote, \u201cas long as heaven and earth shall endure,\u201d and that we would live, and I quote again, \u201cin perpetual peace\u201d with each other. So for nearly two centuries that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done. The documents we\u2019ve signed today will build on that peace, build on that friendship, for the benefit of the Thai people, the American people, and people around the world. Thank you very much.\nDEPUTY PRIME MINISTER/FOREIGN MINISTER PRAMUDWINAI:\u00a0\u00a0 We have also laid a foundation for the next 190 years, as well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0Exactly. Thank you.

I think everyone is still in shock at his assassination, shock at the loss for his family, his friends, and the world. And so I appreciate you doing that. I know it\u2019s so deeply felt throughout the region as well as around the world.\nOn a much happier note, it\u2019s wonderful to be here. And I guess patience is a virtue.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Ritz-Carlton Nusa Dua", "location": "Bali, Indonesia", "date": "July 9, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Let me just start by expressing again my shock and sadness at the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\u00a0 As President Biden said yesterday, this is a tragedy for Japan, a tragedy for his family and loved ones and all who knew him, but also for the world because Prime Minister Abe was a transformative leader, a statesman, someone of truly global stature.\nI\u2019ve got to tell you the news of his death was felt very deeply throughout the G20, all of the foreign ministers, and I know it was felt deeply back home in Washington as well.\u00a0 Many of us had an opportunity over these years to work with former Prime Minister Abe during his very long tenure.\u00a0 I actually had a chance to meet with him myself in 2015 when I was Deputy Secretary.\u00a0 I still remember his hospitality, his graciousness.\u00a0 And of course, President Biden had several opportunities to work with him when he was Vice President.\nThe alliance between Japan and the United States has been a cornerstone of our foreign policy for decades.\u00a0 And as I said yesterday, Prime Minister Abe really brought that partnership to new heights.\u00a0 The friendship between the Japanese and American people is likewise unshakable.\u00a0 So we\u2019re standing with the people of Japan, with the prime minister\u2019s family, in the aftermath of a truly, truly appalling act of violence.\u00a0 And I conveyed this directly as well to Foreign Minister Hayashi when he was here yesterday.\nHere in Bali, the G20 nations came together to address some of the most critical challenges facing people around the world, including the far-reaching consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, particularly growing food insecurity, rising energy prices.\u00a0 It\u2019s critical that the international community and especially the world\u2019s largest economies represented here at the G20 take on these problems together in a coordinated way with the urgency they demand, and that was very much the spirit of the meetings that we had.\nIn the session yesterday we heard the majority of countries condemn Russia\u2019s aggression toward Ukraine, which, among other things, has included the targeting of Ukraine\u2019s entire agricultural infrastructure \u2013 fields, warehouses, roads, transportation networks, silos, ports.\u00a0 Again and again, we heard calls from across the world represented in that room for Russia to open the Black Sea for\u00a0 Ukrainian grain shipments.\nThere was a strong consensus, and Russia was left isolated, as it has been many times since this war began.\u00a0 In fact, Foreign Minister Lavrov left the meeting early, maybe because the messages had become so resoundingly clear.\u00a0 As I said yesterday, the United States strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations in partnership with Turkey to bring Ukrainian and Russian grain to world markets.\u00a0 We need this initiative to move forward, and we need Russia to fully cooperate with it.\nWe\u2019re also counting on other countries to do their part.\u00a0 At the United Nations about six weeks ago, the United States issued a Call to Action to step up to the food insecurity challenge.\u00a0 To date, 98 countries have signed on to the roadmap that we\u2019ve put forward to address both near-term humanitarian needs and also building longer-term resilience.\u00a0 To date, the United States itself has contributed nearly $2.8 billion in emergency food assistance to Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean.\nAnd then at the G7 summit just two weeks ago, President Biden announced another $2.76 billion to strengthen global food security.\u00a0 This included longer-term investments to support agriculture production and resilience, and we look to other leading economies to step up as well.\nWe\u2019ll continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Today, I can announce the United States will provide nearly $368 million in additional support, including food, safe drinking water, cash assistance, emergency health care, shelter, as well as support to coordination among humanitarian organizations that are doing so much of this critical work on the ground.\nMore than 11 million people in Ukraine, 11 million people, have fled their homes since the aggression began.\u00a0 That is more than a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s entire population.\u00a0 The needs are tremendous and they\u2019ll only increase as the war continues.\nI commend Foreign Minister Retno of Indonesia and the Government of Indonesia for setting an agenda for the G20 that encompassed this and so many other timely, indeed urgent issues.\u00a0 At its best, the G20 brings countries together to mobilize targeted, coordinated action on the challenges that are actually having a direct impact on people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 We saw that with the G20\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Now we have to bring that same commitment to dealing with the global consequences of this terrible war in Ukraine, which was an assault not only on Ukraine but also on the rules-based international order that has helped to safeguard peace and security worldwide for decades.\nI also had an opportunity while here in Bali to meet with many of our allies and partners, including individual meetings with foreign ministers from Indonesia, Australia, South Africa, India, Argentina, and Fiji; a trilateral meeting with the foreign ministers of Japan and the Republic of Korea; and a meeting of the transatlantic Quad countries \u2013 Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.\nEarlier today, I met with State Councilor Wang Yi of the People\u2019s Republic of China for a little over five hours.\u00a0 The relationship between the United States and China is highly consequential for our countries but also for the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to managing this relationship, this competition, responsibly as the world expects us to do, leading with diplomacy.\nState Councilor Wang and I discussed how we see the state of our bilateral relationship, and I had the opportunity to directly communicate our approach to the People\u2019s Republic of China, as I laid out in a speech a few weeks ago.\u00a0 We talked about regional and global issues in which both of our countries have strong stakes, including the Kremlin\u2019s war on Ukraine and North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.\u00a0 We discussed where more cooperation between our countries should be possible, including on the climate crisis, food security, global health, counternarcotics.\u00a0 These are each global challenges that require major countries to do their part within the international community.\nAnd of course, we addressed areas of disagreement and ways to manage and reduce risks.\u00a0 I conveyed the deep concerns of the United States regarding Beijing\u2019s increasingly provocative rhetoric and activity toward Taiwan and the vital importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and I relayed our concerns about the repression of freedom in Hong Kong, forced labor, the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in Tibet, the genocide in Xinjiang.\nNow, none of these are easy topics, but the United States seeks always to be a consistent voice on human rights and fundamental freedoms, not to stand against China or any other country but to help advance peace, security, and human dignity.\u00a0 As always, I raised cases of Americans who are detained or otherwise unable to leave the country.\nDespite the complexities of our relationship, I can say with some confidence that our delegations found today\u2019s discussions useful and constructive.\u00a0 Moving forward, the United States wants our channels of communication with Beijing to continue to remain open.\u00a0 And as always, we\u2019re committed to defending and advancing the interests of the American people and American values in all of our engagements with Beijing.\nSo I want to end by simply thanking our hosts here in Indonesia for a terrific G20, for Indonesia\u2019s leadership.\u00a0 I think you\u2019ll see it produce results and pay dividends in the weeks and months ahead as we track to the leaders meeting of the G20 this fall.\nAnd with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Our first question, we\u2019ll start with Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering:\u00a0 What did you communicate to State Councilor Wang about the role China could play diplomatically in terms of the war in Ukraine and the resultant food and energy crisis, and what was his response?\nAnd secondly, I\u2019m just wondering \u2013 Wang is on a much more extensive diplomatic trip of Southeast Asia at the moment than your own and is talking about specific infrastructure projects in Southeast Asian countries, specific investments.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering:\u00a0 What does that say about the state of U.S.-China strategic competition in Southeast Asia?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much.\nSo with regard to Ukraine and with regard to Russia\u2019s aggression there and China\u2019s role in that, I shared again with the state councilor that we are concerned about the PRC\u2019s alignment with Russia.\u00a0 Now, what you hear from Beijing is that it claims to be neutral.\u00a0 I would start with the proposition that it\u2019s pretty hard to be neutral when it comes to this aggression.\u00a0 There is a clear aggressor.\u00a0 There is a clear victim.\u00a0 There is a clear challenge not only to the lives and livelihoods of people in Ukraine, but there is a challenge to the international order that China and the United States as permanent members of the Security Council are supposed to uphold.\nSo I think it\u2019s hard to be neutral on this.\u00a0 But even if you accept that as a premise, I don\u2019t think that China is, in fact, engaging in way that suggests neutrality.\u00a0 It supported Russia in the UN; it continues to do so.\u00a0 It amplified Russian propaganda.\u00a0 Going back even as Russia was massing its forces, President Xi chose to announce the \u201cno limits partnership\u201d with President Putin.\u00a0 Fast-forward to just a few weeks ago, June 13th.\u00a0 In his call with President Putin, President Xi made clear that he stands by that decision.\nMore than four months now into this brutal invasion, the PRC is still standing by Russia.\u00a0 It\u2019s echoing Russian propaganda around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s shielding Russia in international organizations.\u00a0 I believe it\u2019s shirking its responsibility as a P5 member, as I said, and even engaging in joint military exercises.\u00a0 We saw that just recently with a strategic bomber patrol in East Asia.\nSo what I tried to convey to the State Councilor is this really is a moment where we all have to stand up, as we heard country after country do in the G20, to condemn the aggression, to demand among things that Russia allow access to food that\u2019s stuck in Ukraine because of its blockade, and of course, that it end the war.\u00a0 So that was the nature of the conversation that we had, and I won\u2019t characterize his response.\nWith regard to the Indo-Pacific more broadly, look, what we\u2019re about is not asking countries to choose but giving them a choice when it comes to things like investment and infrastructure, development assistance, et cetera.\u00a0 There is on one level plenty of room for everyone to do that because the needs are immense, especially when it comes, for example, to infrastructure.\u00a0 But what we want to make sure is that we\u2019re engaged in a race to the top \u2013 that is, we do things to the highest standards \u2013 not a race to the bottom where we do things to the lowest standards.\nAnd so the work that we\u2019ve been doing in the Indo-Pacific, including with developing the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, including with the Global Partnership for Investment Infrastructure, which would apply in this region as well, is to make sure that investments we\u2019re making, work that we\u2019re doing with countries in the region, go to the highest standards.\u00a0 We make sure, for example, that when we\u2019re conducting investments in infrastructure we\u2019re not ladling countries with debt; that we are advancing the protections for workers, for the environment; that we\u2019re not advancing corruption; that we\u2019re having people from the countries in question actually benefit from getting to do the work on the projects in question; that we build to the highest standards.\nMy hope would be that if, as China continues to engage itself in all of these efforts that it engages in a race to the top, that it raise its game.\u00a0 That would actually benefit everyone.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll turn to Laksana Agung.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I have two questions.\u00a0 The first question related to this day (inaudible) and going forward.\u00a0 Is the new cold war going to be the world order?\u00a0 If it\u2019s so, please elaborate, including the impact to global economic politics and so forth.\u00a0 But if not, what kind of new world order that U.S. Government projected after the Russia-Ukraine war and when United States and China competition will dominate international politics over the next decade?\nAnd the second question:\u00a0 Where do you place Indonesia in this regard, and how the U.S. will engage with the Indonesian Government and improve the cooperation between the two countries?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 I\u2019ll just start with the second piece first.\nIndonesia is a vital partner to the United States.\u00a0 This is now my second trip to Indonesia in this job.\u00a0 I think you can see the vital role that Indonesia is playing in its leadership of the G20 at an absolutely critical time for countries around the world.\u00a0 And what we saw over the last day and what I know we\u2019ll see in the months ahead as we head to the leaders meeting of the G20 is Indonesian leadership setting a very strong and urgent agenda for the leading economies in the world and, as we saw with the foreign minister yesterday, really leading the conversation among all of us and trying to drive toward concrete results.\u00a0 I think this is just evidence of the vital role that Indonesia plays generally and that we\u2019re seeing it play increasingly, and it\u2019s something the United States values tremendously.\u00a0 The same is true across our bilateral relationship \u2013 something that the foreign minister and I had an opportunity to talk about yesterday.\nWith regard to the world order, I think the very point that so many countries emphasized yesterday is that what we\u2019ve seen with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine is not only an aggression against the Ukrainian people but an aggression against the basic principles of the world order.\u00a0 Russia is waging a war that is challenging that order as well as challenging Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence.\u00a0 It\u2019s failing at both.\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence are clear, and we\u2019re going to have a sovereign and independent Ukraine on the scene a lot longer than President Putin will be on the scene.\u00a0 But meanwhile, the death and destruction is terrible.\nBut it is also a challenge to the order.\u00a0 And if we were to allow that to proceed with impunity, if we didn\u2019t stand up to Russia\u2019s aggression, then the order that we would have is a world in which might makes right and in which large countries can bully smaller ones.\u00a0 That\u2019s in no one\u2019s interest.\u00a0 That\u2019s a recipe for conflict around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s a recipe for instability.\u00a0 It\u2019s a recipe for the kinds of things we\u2019ve seen in the past in history that we thought we had moved beyond.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that countries stand up to this aggression, that they insist that the aggression come to an end, and that together we uphold the basic principles that are the foundation of the order.\nNow, the last thing I\u2019ll say on \u2013 is this.\u00a0 The United States is a strong proponent of this order, of these basic principles that are enshrined in the United Nations Charter, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in so much international law that has followed both of those foundational documents.\u00a0 But we also believe that the order not only has to be defended, it also has to be reformed.\u00a0 It has to take account for the way the world is today, not just the way it was 70 or 80 years ago when these basic building blocks of the order were put into place.\u00a0 And that was also part of the discussion that we had, led by Indonesia, on multilateralism, on the future of multilateralism.\nAnd the one thing we know is this:\u00a0 Not a single one of the problems that we talked about over the last day and that are actually affecting the lives of people can be effectively solved by any one of our countries acting alone, whether it\u2019s the United States, whether it\u2019s Indonesia or any other country.\u00a0 There is a greater imperative than at any time in my career for countries to find ways to work together, to cooperate, to collaborate.\u00a0 And that was the spirit of the G20, and we\u2019re very grateful for Indonesia\u2019s leadership.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Rahmat Idris.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Your Excellency, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for this privilege.\u00a0 My name is Rahmat Idris from the Television the Republic of Indonesia, TVRI World.\u00a0 Yesterday\u2019s foreign ministers meeting here in Bali, that it will become a successful platform for all these leaders to come together, that they come to sort of come together, find common ground and truly find solutions to the world crisis that food and energy \u2013 food and energy security, as you mentioned, particularly for the nations who are severely impacted by these crises, exacerbated by the ongoing geopolitical tensions and also the war in Europe.\u00a0 And what were some of the more significant deliverables from the meeting that can truly inspire change, be it through the stronger U.S. commitment within the G20 and also the framework of the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy?\nThank you, Your Excellency.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Let me pick up where I left off.\u00a0 Just it starts with this basic premise, and actually the Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi started with this in our opening session.\u00a0 This basic notion that none of the challenges the world is facing, whether it\u2019s food insecurity, whether it\u2019s rising energy prices, whether it\u2019s the climate crisis, whether it\u2019s global health, not a single one can be addressed by any one of our countries acting alone.\u00a0 We have to find ways to come together and collaborate.\nThe G20 is one of the most important vehicles to do that because it represents the leading economies in the world that have the resources and the wherewithal to make a real difference on these challenges.\u00a0 And I think what you\u2019ve seen, we had something like 80 percent of global GDP is \u2013 was represented in that room yesterday.\u00a0 When we\u2019re able to focus our efforts together, we can have a real impact.\nLook at what we\u2019ve done, including through the G20, just on COVID-19 over the last year and a half.\u00a0 Through the work of countries in the G20 we were able to increase the production of and access to vaccines.\u00a0 We were able to make sure that countries had more of a financial cushion, including with debt relief, to deal with some of the repercussions from COVID-19.\u00a0 Most recently, we\u2019ve launched but with other G20 countries involved a Global Action Plan to make sure that even as we have vaccines the shots are actually getting into arms.\u00a0 All of these are concrete results from work the G20 countries are doing.\nWe focused over the last day on two things.\u00a0 One is, as we just discussed, trying to revitalize multilateralism.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a means of doing things; it\u2019s not an end in itself.\u00a0 But I think what was very, very palpable in the room across the many different geographies that were represented is a strong commitment to do just that.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019re doing to see that play out in the weeks and months ahead.\nSecond, there was an intense focus on food security.\u00a0 And there, two things.\u00a0 First, if you were Foreign Minister Lavrov sitting in that room, you heard not only a chorus of condemnation when it comes to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, but you heard country after country insisting that Russia let the grain out of Ukraine to get into world markets.\u00a0 The only thing that\u2019s holding it back is a Russian blockade of the Black Sea ports and Odessa.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ll see if Russia got the message.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see by its actions over the coming days and weeks whether it actually cooperates with the effort that the UN is leading in partnership with Turkey to find a good mechanism to allow the grain to get out.\nNow look, the easiest way for that to happen is for Russia to end the aggression, end its war, or at least get out of the way when it comes to Odessa.\u00a0 But short of that, this UN mechanism with Turkey would be a good way forward.\u00a0 We strongly support it.\u00a0 Russia needs to cooperate.\nMore broadly, there have been a series of initiatives taken over the last few weeks to try to deal with the immediate food insecurity crisis as well as the longer-term challenge of building greater resilience.\u00a0 One of those initiatives was something that we did, the United States did, at the United Nations about six weeks ago, where we launched a Call to Action to countries around the world and put out an actual roadmap with seven steps that countries could commit to taking that would address the immediate concern as well as trying to build greater long-term production and self-sufficiency.\nAs I said, now close to a hundred countries have signed onto that.\u00a0 One of the things we talked about yesterday was that initiative as well as some other initiatives, all of which involved the G20 countries.\u00a0 The need now is to, having made these commitments, to actually implement them, to move forward for example on making sure that the World Food Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization have the funding they need, to make sure that fertilizer is being produced and distributed \u2013 that\u2019s vital, to work with the international financial institutions to try to cushion the financial blow that countries are feeling as a result of food insecurity, to help them get food, to make the necessary investments in longer-term production and self-sufficiency, to share information more effectively amongst to look at different shortages and where we can target our efforts and resources.\nSo I think you\u2019ll see coming out of the G20 and also heading into the leaders meeting of the G20 in the fall real action to implement the agenda that we\u2019ve put out there on food security.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Okay, final question from Shannon Crawford of ABC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, the majority of the G20 might be netted against Russian aggression, but we heard from virtually every participant here that they want to see peace brokered in Ukraine.\u00a0 And while the U.S. sends weapons to the battlefield, even President Zelenskyy says it will all end at the negotiating table.\u00a0 But through the entirety of the war, you\u2019ve not met \u2013 you\u2019ve refused to meet \u2013 with your Russian counterpart.\u00a0 Is this out of step with the international community?\u00a0 And by allowing the relationship to further deteriorate, is there not a cost to bear not only in terms of lives lost as the fighting drags on but also for Americans like Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner who are wrongfully detained in Russia?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Let me start with this:\u00a0 With regard to the G20 itself and what we came here to do, I think we had two objectives this week.\u00a0 One was to make sure, as we\u2019ve just discussed, that the world\u2019s largest economies were focused on it\u2019s most urgent problems, following the agenda laid out by the Indonesian presidency.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we did, particularly with regard to food insecurity.\nAt the same time, we were determined that we not proceed with business as usual given the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and I think it\u2019s fair to say that we succeeded in both objectives.\u00a0 The discussion yesterday put the spotlight on some of the most pressing challenges we face, as we\u2019ve talked about, and I think it was very important that since Foreign Minister Lavrov was there he heard loudly and clearly from around the world \u2013 not just the G7 countries \u2013 but many other countries as well, condemnation of Russia\u2019s aggression and a clear call short of ending the aggression to allow food to get out of Ukraine to the world market.\nSo I think that was very important.\u00a0 The fact that Foreign Minister Lavrov chose not even to attend the session on food insecurity, having I think spent the morning hearing from virtually the entirety of the G20 about the Russian aggression and about the need to stop the blockade of Odessa, I think that was in and itself significant.\nAt some point this war will come to an end, and it will come to an end through diplomacy.\u00a0 The United States will \u2013 is always prepared to find ways through diplomacy to end conflict to bring peace, and that\u2019s the case with regard to this aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 The problem is this:\u00a0 We see no signs whatsoever that Russia at this moment in time is prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 A number of other countries in close coordination with us have engaged with Russia in recent months.\u00a0 They report the same thing: no signs that Russia is prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\nMeanwhile, I think our goal is clear, and you\u2019ve heard the President speak to this at the G7, at the NATO summit, to make sure that we continue the support that we\u2019ve been providing for Ukraine in terms of security assistance, humanitarian assistance, economic assistance.\u00a0 It\u2019s to make sure that we keep the pressure on Russia so that we incentivize to actually engage in meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 And both of those things will also give Ukraine the strongest possible hand to play when eventually there is a negotiating table.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where we are.\u00a0 That\u2019s where we are now.\nBut if we see any signs that Russia is actually prepared to engage in real diplomacy and bring this war to an end, of course we\u2019ll engage in that, just as we spent months before the Russian aggression working to address what Russia said were its concerns about Ukraine, the alleged concerns that NATO and/or Ukraine somehow posed a threat to Russia.\u00a0 We engaged directly with the Russians.\u00a0 I spent many weeks doing this myself, including with Foreign Minister Lavrov.\u00a0 We had a NATO-Russia process.\u00a0 We had the OSCE.\nWhat became increasingly apparent is that this was never about security concerns that Russia professed to have, whether a threat from NATO or a threat from Ukraine.\u00a0 It was always about what President Putin now acknowledges front and center about his conviction that Ukraine is not a sovereign, independent country, that it needs to be subsumed into Russia.\u00a0 He spoke about this in St. Petersburg just a few weeks ago.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this has always been about.\u00a0 It\u2019s what it remains about.\u00a0 And until Russia changes that perspective, that conviction, and is willing to end the aggression and engage in diplomacy to do it, this will continue, and we\u2019ll continue to support Ukraine and keep the pressure on.\u00a0 If there is an opportunity for diplomacy, we\u2019ll seize it.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url":

Thank you so much. And I \u2013 as I said to the \u2013 our colleagues before, I\u2019m really so grateful, the United States is so grateful for your leadership, Indonesia\u2019s leadership in bringing the G20 together \u2013 not just bringing us together but leading us, and particularly working to make sure that we recover together, recover stronger. We see the effects of COVID; it\u2019s still lingering around the world. Unfortunately, we also see the effects of the Russian aggression against Ukraine making things even more difficult than they already were.\nAnd through all of this, we share a conviction with Indonesia that multilateralism is a vital answer, a vital response.\u00a0And we listened\u00a0to the\u00a0foreign minister\u00a0talking to\u00a0all of us gathered today\u00a0about Indonesia\u2019s\u00a0conviction that not a single problem that we face as countries can be effectively dealt with by any one of our countries acting alone. We strongly agree with that, and that\u2019s why multilateralism is so important and Indonesia\u2019s leadership at this moment for \u2013 not just for Indonesia, not just for the United States, but for the world \u2013\u00a0is so important. So we strongly support that leadership (inaudible), the work that we\u2019re doing here today as foreign ministers, the work that our leaders will do in a few months\u2019 time in Indonesia.\nSo I\u2019m looking forward to our conversation and pursuing that, pursuing our bilateral relationship. As the foreign minister said, this is my second time\u00a0now\u00a0as Secretary of State in Indonesia. I\u2019ve been here many times before. The first time, actually, was with President Clinton, I think, in the 1990s. So it\u2019s wonderful to be back.\nI do have to say before we meet how deeply saddened and deeply concerned we are by the news\u00a0coming\u00a0from Japan about the attempt on the life\u00a0of\u00a0former Prime Minister Abe. We don\u2019t know his condition.\u00a0We do know that apparently he\u2019s been shot. Our thoughts, our prayers are with him, with his family, with the people of Japan. This is a very, very sad moment, and we\u2019re awaiting news from (inaudible). Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MARSUDI:\u00a0Yeah, and I would like (inaudible) as the president of the G20, on behalf of the G20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting, during the meeting I also conveyed our sympathy and our\u00a0prayers\u00a0to the speedy recovery of former Prime Minister (inaudible). Thank you very much, colleagues. Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MARSUDI:\u00a0So once again, thank you very much. I feel so happy that you are here today. Again, many of us make an extra effort to make it happen, and I hope that during this G20 foreign ministers\u2019 there is ways forward, and I will take this opportunity to discuss with you, of course, a bit of the bilateral relation, which we \u2013 I think we have reached a lot of progress in our bilateral relation, plus as I mentioned, too, on the international issues, and I received already the invitation from you for \u2013 I think for next week is it, for the (inaudible) conference, and\u00a0inshallah\u00a0I will be there, as usual. Please, thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0No, thank you. Again, I\u2019m very much looking forward to the conversation. This is now my second opportunity to be in Indonesia as Secretary of State, and a big part of that is deepening, strengthening the bilateral relationship between our countries. We\u2019re doing so much together already around the world. Indonesia\u2019s leadership on so many issues, including COVID-19, has been making a real difference, so I know we\u2019ll talk about that, as well as the broader G20 agenda that Indonesia is leading for all of our countries this year. We\u2019re grateful for that.\nLots to be \u2013 lots to be said. It\u2019s an incredibly challenging time. We know that so many people around the world are feeling the effects of food insecurity, energy insecurity, climate change, and all of these things are front and center on the agenda of the G20 thanks to Indonesia\u2019s leadership. So we\u2019ll be spending more time this afternoon talking about those things as well.

settled?\u00a0 On behalf of the Atlantic Council and all of the other partners to this \u2013 to this event, I welcome you and I thank you for spending this time with us after a very long day.\u00a0 I\u2019m so delighted to have with us the Foreign Minister of Spain, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, and the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.\u00a0 We\u2019re just going to get right into our conversation.\u00a0 And I\u2019m Michel Martin; I\u2019m the \u2013 one of the hosts of All Things Considered from National Public Radio in the United States, headquartered in Washington, D.C., and we do hope you\u2019re all supporters and contributors.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 All of you who can.\nForeign Minister, if I may start with you.\u00a0 Obviously, the war in Ukraine has focused the world\u2019s attention on NATO, if it needed any more attention.\u00a0 But there are NATO member partners who are far away from the action.\u00a0 How do you maintain urgency and focus on the issues that are important to NATO members when their \u2013 your populations who are far away from the conflict are mainly experiencing the conflict as inflation, increased gas prices, increased food prices?\u00a0 I mean, how do you maintain a sense of urgency around resolving that conflict when most people really aren\u2019t experiencing it excepting secondary considerations which are very important to them?\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 Yeah, all public opinions in Europe, and clearly here in Spain \u2013 we are very, very far from the eastern flank and from Russia \u2013 understood very quickly, starting in February 24, that something had changed dramatically that day.\u00a0 War \u2013 conventional war and full to scale \u2013 was back on European soil.\u00a0 And we were heading towards a new security Euro-Atlantic order, and therefore what was happening there really concerned us. \u00a0And it was also a threat to us.\u00a0 So, the public opinion is supportive \u2013 we see the polls in Spain \u2013 to ask joining all the other European partners and our natural allies, the United States, are very, very high.\u00a0 And I think that this summit is showing that that\u2019s not uncompatible with taking also a look to other threats coming from the south or hybrid threats that can happen in the east or in the south.\nSo, at the same time, there is this awareness that what\u2019s going on in the east concerns us very directly because it\u2019s a change in the European order of avoiding war as a way of solving conflicts; and at the same time all concerns \u2013 east and south \u2013 are really, really under the Madrid Strategic Concept.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, easy for me to say because I haven\u2019t been in all those meetings, but one could make an argument that this has been the easy part, funneling weapons to Ukraine, maintaining solidarity around helping Ukraine maintain a defense.\u00a0 One can make an argument that the hard part is yet to come, pivoting to a diplomatic solution which at some point has to take place.\u00a0 Are there any meaningful negotiations going on?\u00a0 If so, who\u2019s taking part in them?\u00a0 And if there aren\u2019t, what would trigger them?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, Michel, first I think we have to recognize that the hard part is every single day for people in Ukraine.\u00a0 The death, the destruction being wrought by the Russian aggression \u2013 some of which we see on our screens, much of which we don\u2019t \u2013 is extraordinary, and the Ukrainians are living this every single day.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the hard part.\u00a0 And \u2014\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Agreed.\u00a0 But for people who are not directly \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yes.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 \u2014 affected by the conflict, for other member nations like your two.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So \u2013 but I just wanted to start with that because I think it\u2019s so important that we don\u2019t lose sight of that basic fact.\nSecond, Jos\u00e9 Manuel is exactly right:\u00a0 I think that what we\u2019ve seen is a recognition throughout Europe and beyond that the aggression against Ukraine is also an aggression against some very basic principles that do underlie the international order.\u00a0 And if we allow them to be challenged with impunity, then we risk opening a Pandora\u2019s box.\u00a0 And I think people feel that, and of course this is the worst aggression in Europe since World War II.\u00a0 So, all of that is felt.\nBut to your question, I\u2019d also say a tremendous amount of work went into building, together, the capacity to support the Ukrainians, put pressure on the Russians, and reinforce our Alliance.\u00a0 That didn\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 It was the result of a tremendous amount of engagement, including by the United States, over many, many months to do this work together.\u00a0 Now it has to be sustained; it has to be sustained in terms of the support for the Ukrainians.\u00a0 We heard from President Zelenskyy today.\u00a0 It has to be sustained in terms of continuing to keep the pressure on Russia, and President Biden was clear from the start that that would impose some costs on us, but the stakes required it.\u00a0 And it requires us to do what we\u2019ve done today and will do tomorrow at NATO, which is to, in ways we haven\u2019t seen in a generation, reinforce our own Alliance \u2013 a defensive Alliance, not an Alliance threatening anyone, not an Alliance designed to be against Russia, but to make sure that its members can adequately defend themselves.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Agreed.\u00a0 When will a diplomatic solution be on the table \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So \u2014\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 \u2014 and is one in the offing?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 \u2014 to use a very \u2014\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Whose \u2013 what would \u2013 what would (inaudible)?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 To use a very hackneyed expression, it takes two to tango.\u00a0 And we have not seen any interest on the part of Vladimir Putin in engaging in any kind of meaningful diplomatic initiative.\u00a0 But in any event, as we\u2019ve said from the start, it\u2019s really important that the Ukrainians define the terms of any potential negotiation.\u00a0 Our role right now is to make sure that they have the means in their hands to continue to repel the Russian aggression, and when a negotiating table eventually does emerge, which at some point it will, that they have the strongest possible hand to play at the negotiating table.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Just a brief follow-up on \u2013 just on that point.\u00a0 There have been obviously sort of very disturbing military actions taking place while you all were meeting.\u00a0 There was a missile attack on a shopping center, for example.\u00a0 Do you interpret that in any particular way?\u00a0 Do you think that that was a signal of some sort?\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 Well, as Tony was saying, for me it\u2019s a signal that on the other side, on Vladimir Putin\u2019s mind, the idea of a dialogue, even of a ceasefire, is very, very far.\u00a0 It\u2019s a way of saying, this is a full-scale conventional war.\u00a0 And I want to remind everyone, because this is something that is known but we have a tendency to forget it, for many months we said in all formats \u2013 OECD, Russia-NATO Council, Normandy Format, bilateral dialogue \u2013 to try to solve \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 \u2014 any problem that Russia could have concerning its security.\u00a0 And right now, what we are seeing is that there is no one day in which civilians are killed or bombed.\nSo, for me, we all agree that dialogue would have been the best way to discuss anything, but unfortunately, Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t agree with us.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And just to add one thing because this is important.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Sure, of course.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Manuel makes a really important point, especially because we\u2019re here at NATO.\u00a0 There was a fiction that Vladimir Putin tried to advance that this was somehow about a threat that NATO posed to Russia or that Ukraine posed to Russia.\u00a0 It was never about that, and it remains clear that it never will be.\nWhat this is about is Vladimir Putin\u2019s conviction that Ukraine does not deserve to be a sovereign, independent country.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about a threat that NATO poses.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about a threat that Ukraine poses.\u00a0 And unless and until he gives up on this fixation on trying to end Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence, it\u2019s going to be hard to get anywhere.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 So, the stated goal of this conversation was NATO after Madrid, and I want to talk about some of those issues.\nAnother issue \u2013 there were two significant recent disasters affecting both of your countries, both related to irregular immigration, just in the last couple of weeks.\u00a0 In Melilla, at least 37 people died attempting to cross; in the United States, at least 50 people died who were being smuggled into the country.\u00a0 Given that both of your countries, our countries, are natural \u2013 they\u2019re national borders, but they\u2019re also NATO borders.\u00a0 I mean, is it time for NATO to turn its attention to mass migration in some meaningful way and to put some urgency behind that?\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Well, the two \u2013 the two specific events that you pointed out is a human tragedy, and it\u2019s appalling to all of us.\u00a0 And what that points out is the complexity of the phenomenon of irregular migration and how both the origin and transit countries and the countries that we are receiving illegal migrants, we must cooperate as strongly as possible to try to channel and to deal with the challenge in the best way.\nAnd at the same time, we are talking about borders in which inequality is probably at its most.\u00a0 The Melilla border is a border between European Union and Africa, probably the most unequal and imbalanced border wherever reference you take \u2013 GDP, youth, whatever.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very complicated to try to channel those irregular flows.\nSo, we have to go also to the root causes, which is underdevelopment.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we have also to cooperate with all those countries.\u00a0 And of course, the risk is always, as we saw in the Belarus border with Poland, that someone can use that as a weapon against our territorial integrity or our sovereignty.\u00a0 That\u2019s why, in the Strategic Concept of Madrid, irregular migration, if it\u2019s used as a political tool, it can be a threat to our sovereignty.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Agreed, but is NATO a vehicle to address this with urgency, to apply the same kind of urgency and focused attention to?\u00a0 I think we would all agree it is a humanitarian disaster.\u00a0 It\u2019s a moral disaster.\u00a0 And it also has claimed many, many lives, probably more than we even know.\nSo, Mr. Secretary, is this \u2013 is NATO an appropriate vehicle to address this as well?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 The first thing we have to recognize is we are living a historic moment when it comes to irregular migration and migration of all sorts.\u00a0 There are more people on the move around the world \u2013 100 million forcibly displaced in one way or another from their homes \u2013 more than at any time since we\u2019ve actually recorded these facts and this information.\u00a0 And it is happening across the world, in our own hemisphere, on our own border.\nOne of the interesting things, Michel, is that the United States and Spain \u2013 I\u2019ll leave aside NATO for the minute \u2013 are working closely together, including in the Western Hemisphere, to try to deal with the irregular migration that we\u2019re seeing there.\u00a0 We just came back together \u2013 before coming to NATO, we were at the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles.\u00a0 For the first time, the countries in our hemisphere, through what\u2019s called the Los Angeles Declaration, said we have shared responsibilities when it comes to trying to deal with migration because not a single one of us alone can deal with it effectively.\u00a0 And we are following through on a number of things that we\u2019ve agreed to to try to work on this collectively.\nSpain is a partner in this effort with other countries in the hemisphere, with the United States.\u00a0 So for sure we need collective approaches to this.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 So, another question for both of you.\u00a0 China.\u00a0 I mean, is it your hopes that steps taken here will send a message to China?\u00a0 And if so, what is it?\u00a0 What\u2019s the message?\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 China is a permanently member of the Security Council, so their role must be to preserve world peace and stability.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we expect from China.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the main message from this summit to China.\u00a0 What NATO wants is peace and stability in the world, and we hope to cooperate with them.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s to China to tell us if they want to engage with us in that way.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 What about you, Mr. Secretary?\u00a0 Thoughts?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I very much agree.\u00a0 The relationship that we all have with China is among the most complex and consequential of any relationship that we have with another country.\u00a0 And there are aspects of the relationship that are clearly competitive, and we need to make sure that that competition is fair and engage in it very, very strongly.\nAt the same time, there are aspects increasingly where we have to contest what China is doing.\u00a0 And one of the things that it\u2019s doing is seeking to undermine the rules-based international order that we adhere to, that we believe in, that we helped build.\u00a0 And in that sense, NATO has come together and said in its Strategic Concept this is the \u2013 basically the blueprint that we have for how we\u2019re going to approach the world together.\u00a0 For the first time, we have China as a feature of that Strategic Concept, a concern that all of the countries in NATO have.\u00a0 Not looking for conflict but trying to make sure that together we\u2019re upholding the rules-based international order \u2013 wherever it\u2019s being challenged.\u00a0 And if China\u2019s challenging it in one way or another, we will stand up to that.\nAt the same time, as Jos\u00e9 Manuel said, there are areas where we hope to pursue cooperation.\u00a0 But in 2010, the last time we had a Strategic Concept \u2013 a document that I know maybe some people\u2019s eyes will glaze over, but it\u2019s actually, really important to look at it, because it does define the road ahead for NATO, what it is this Alliance will be doing.\u00a0 Yes, defending itself and trying to deter aggression from countries like Russia, dealing with all sorts of new transnational threats that didn\u2019t even exist at the time the last Strategic Concept, in 2010, was written.\nBack then, by the way, NATO was looking at Russia as a potential partner.\u00a0 China was not even mentioned.\u00a0 And of course, cyber security, outer space, challenges \u2013 hybrid challenges short of actual physical conflict, none of those things really featured in what we were thinking about.\u00a0 Now, they are; now, they do.\u00a0 And China\u2019s a part of that.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Just a very brief follow-up on this.\u00a0 There were four Asia-Pacific countries that are partners \u2013 I think that\u2019s the right term, partners.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 NATO partners; they\u2019re not NATO members, they\u2019re NATO partners.\u00a0 What role do you see them playing going forward?\u00a0 Can you just \u2013 and could you be a little bit specific?\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 Well, NATO \u2013 although the main threat now comes from the eastern flank, and we have to look at the southern flank because this is a direct threat \u2013 NATO, in order to promote peace and stability \u2013 that\u2019s all we want, must have a global look and \u2013 look at global affairs.\u00a0 And there is where those partners are very important for us.\u00a0 As Jordan or Mauritania in the southern flank, where Asian partners help us to better understand, to engage with people on those parts of the world, and to promote that rule-based order.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Before we let you go, just a final question for each of you, an open-ended question:\u00a0 What do you see as the biggest challenge for NATO going forward?\u00a0 I mean, some say it\u2019s those \u2013 these gray zone countries like Georgia or Moldova, possibly Ukraine going forward, where these countries are looking to the West for security guarantees but they\u2019re probably not going to be members of NATO.\u00a0 Some people say it\u2019s the illiberal tendencies that are emerging in countries that we thought to be settled democracies.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I need to name them.\nSo, what do you see as the biggest challenge for NATO going forward?\u00a0 And let\u2019s say \u2013 Minister, we gave you the first word, so I\u2019ll give Mr. Blinken the last word.\u00a0 So, will you go first?\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 Let me turn a little bit your question.\u00a0 Threats are going to appear, and they can transform.\u00a0 The real challenge for us is to keep united, and to keep the cohesion.\u00a0 If we do it, we are showing it concerning the Russian threat.\u00a0 We will always overcome whatever happens.\u00a0 If we start to have divisions and to try to get different approaches, then even very small challenges can be very, very disruptive for us.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That really should have been the last word, because I think it was perfect.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 But go ahead.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 No, first of all, it really is the unity that Jos\u00e9 Manuel talked about.\u00a0 Because virtually none of the challenges that we have, whether it\u2019s in the Euro-Atlantic area or beyond \u2013 and by the way, I think he\u2019s exactly right about why the partnerships with other countries are so important.\u00a0 We tend to look at our security in different silos.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a transatlantic silo, we had an Asian silo, we have a hemispheric silo; we have to break them down.\u00a0 Because virtually all of these problems touch on each of us, and there are different competencies and different perspectives and different assets that countries can bring to bear, if they\u2019re working together.\nWhat is so powerful about what we\u2019ve done in the last day, and we\u2019ll do tomorrow, is to reaffirm \u2013 in ways that I can\u2019t remember us doing \u2013 the solidarity among our countries.\u00a0 NATO is emerging from this summit more united, more focused, and with more assets to deal with the multiplicity of challenges.\u00a0 There\u2019s not a single one.\u00a0 The immediate threat posed by Russia and its aggression on Ukraine and against the principles of the international order; the longer-term challenge posed by China; a whole series of transnational threats, to include climate and the effect that that has, including on generating conflict \u2013 all of these things are in our Strategic Concept, all of these things are challenges we have to meet and face; but we know that we\u2019re going to be more effective in doing it if we actually have a shared common approach, and we\u2019re bringing our shared weight to bear against them.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here over these two days.\nMS MARTIN:\u00a0 Secretary of State Blinken, Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, thank you so much for joining us today.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t have time for questions, so I was told.\u00a0 Thank you so much for joining us.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Michel.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALBARES:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-19/", "title":

me just start by saying how wonderful it is to be back in Germany for what is I think my sixth time as Secretary of State.\u00a0 There are reminders of my country\u2019s partnership with Germany everywhere in this city, including right here in this building.\u00a0 This bank administered the Marshall Plan funds that helped rebuild Germany and Europe after World War II.\nWe knew that a secure, prosperous, and democratic Europe was strongly in the interests of the United States, Europe, and the world.\u00a0 That was true then.\u00a0 It remains true today.\u00a0 Here in Berlin five months ago, I gave a speech about Russia\u2019s impending aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 Our intelligence revealed that President Putin was mobilizing for war, and to frame the stakes and prepare our partners, I laid out why that would be so dangerous for the people of Ukraine, for the people of Europe, indeed for people around the world.\nI said that Russia was taking aim not only at Ukraine, but at the fundamental principles of peace and security that were established in the wake of two world wars and the Cold War that one country can\u2019t simply change the borders of another by force or subjugate a sovereign nation to its will or dictate its choices or policies. \u00a0A few weeks later, the war began.\u00a0 Today, it enters its fifth month.\nThousands of civilians, tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or wounded.\u00a0 Cities have been flattened.\u00a0 Millions of Ukrainians have fled their homes.\u00a0 Beyond Ukraine, the global food crisis has spiked due to the war.\u00a0 Russia has destroyed Ukraine\u2019s agricultural infrastructure, including its second-largest grain terminal earlier this month.\u00a0 It\u2019s blockading Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea, preventing crops like grain and corn from being shipped worldwide.\nThere are about 25 million tons of grain stuck in Ukraine because of this Russian blockade.\u00a0 We spent some time today in the G7 meeting and then in the extraordinary session convened by my German colleague on the growing food insecurity crisis that has been accelerated by Russia\u2019s war of aggression and the steps that countries are taking to address it.\u00a0 These months have been brutal for Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been very difficult for countries and people around the world, and the truth is it\u2019s likely to stay that way for some time.\nSo let\u2019s recall for a minute what we\u2019re working to do and why we\u2019re working to do it.\u00a0 First, we are helping Ukraine survive as a democratic, independent, sovereign state.\u00a0 The UN Charter promises that to every country.\u00a0 Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, is violating that charter every single day.\u00a0 Ukraine is fighting with extraordinary courage.\nA war that President Putin thought would be over in a matter of days has now stretched on for months.\u00a0 They\u2019re fighting not just for themselves, but for all of us, because if Russia gets away with violating the fundamental principles that are at stake, it\u2019s not just the Ukrainian people who will suffer.\u00a0 It will drag us back to a much more dangerous time, a much more unstable time.\u00a0 It will send a message that these principles are somehow expendable, and that would make many countries around the world vulnerable to the very aggression to which Ukraine is now subject.\nYesterday, I authorized a drawdown of up to $450 million in arms and other equipment from the U.S. Defense Department inventories, including high-mobility artillery rocket systems, tens of thousands of additional rounds of ammunition for artillery systems that Ukraine has already received, including howitzers and patrol boats to help Ukraine defend its coast and its waterways.\u00a0 This is now our 13th drawdown for Ukraine\u2019s defense since August of 2021.\u00a0 That brings our total military assistance to Ukraine to more than $6.1 billion since the war began.\u00a0 We\u2019re giving Ukraine the support it needs to defend itself.\u00a0 For as long as it takes, we will continue to do so.\nThere have been recent reports that Russia\u2019s limited military gains in eastern Ukraine are sparking concerns in Europe and beyond about the war\u2019s trajectory, so let me be clear about a few things.\nFirst, Ukraine is defending itself with extraordinary courage and resilience, and Russia has already lost.\u00a0 President Putin\u2019s objective, in his own words, was to eliminate Ukraine as a sovereign, independent country.\u00a0 That effort has failed.\u00a0 A sovereign, independent Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than President Putin is on the scene.\nIn terms of its military campaign, Russian forces failed badly in their attempt to capture Kyiv.\u00a0 Due to stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has dramatically altered its strategy.\u00a0 It scaled back its near-term objectives and focused instead on capturing territory in the east to try to shift the momentum and allow President Putin to falsely claim victory.\nBut while Russia has made slow, painful gains in one region, those gains have been far from decisive, and they\u2019ve come at extraordinarily high cost.\u00a0 Public reports indicate that tens of thousands of Russian troops have been killed or wounded since the aggression began, and Russia continues to lose a large number of tanks, aircraft, ships, equipment, munitions.\u00a0 Even if Russia succeeds in capturing more territory, it will inherit cities and towns that its own artillery have turned to rubble and a local population that hates it.\u00a0 It will have to content with an increasingly assertive and well-armed Ukrainian force.\nRussia\u2019s become mired in a war of attrition of its own making, and despite what you hear from propagandists in the Kremlin, our intelligence indicates that Russian military continues to suffer from low morale, high casualty rates, equipment failures, and leaders who are afraid to tell the truth about what\u2019s really happening on the ground.\nSecond, we\u2019re raising the costs on Russia to bring the war to an end more swiftly through unprecedented sanctions and export controls.\u00a0 Economists predict that Russia\u2019s GDP will contract by between 10 and 15 percent this year.\u00a0 Moscow\u2019s prevented an economic meltdown so far by taking extraordinary measures to prop up its currency, but those tactics are unsustainable as the full impact of Western sanctions and trade restrictions begins to take hold.\u00a0 Access to credit will dry up.\u00a0 Manufacturing will decline.\u00a0 Shelves will remain empty.\u00a0 Unemployment will rise.\u00a0 Without access to global finance, technology, and commerce, Russia\u2019s long-term economic potential, its ability to project military power, its capacity to deliver a high standard of living for its people, will badly degrade.\nEven as Russia benefits from higher oil prices in the near term, it won\u2019t over time as Europe significantly reduces its oil imports and Moscow can\u2019t replace energy production equipment because of export controls.\u00a0 Likewise, the Kremlin can\u2019t spend its money on the things that it really wants, like advanced defense and aerospace components, that have also been limited by export controls.\nMeanwhile, we\u2019ve seen now more than a thousand foreign firms flee the country, withdraw their investments.\u00a0 More will likely make the same decision as the effect of sanctions and export controls continues to compound.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also seen many of Russia\u2019s best and brightest leave the country as well, including highly educated professionals in the tech and energy fields and foreign experts who used to call Russia home.\u00a0 Maybe all of this is why the Russian Government stopped publishing key economic data in April.\nOur information indicates that around half of Russians recently reported that their household economic situation has worsened since the war began.\u00a0 Eventually the Russian people will have to ask themselves:\u00a0 Is this war worth the cost?\u00a0 Why are we doing this?\u00a0 How is this in any way improving my life, my children\u2019s lives?\nThird, we\u2019re working to end global dependence on Russian energy, which the Kremlin has used as a tool of coercion for far too long.\u00a0 The EU pledge to cut Russian oil imports by 90 percent by the end of the year and to ban EU firms from carrying Russian crude is a strong and courageous act.\u00a0 We know that carrying it out will not be easy.\u00a0 Germany, for example, has just taken new measures to conserve energy to help address rising fuel prices.\u00a0 But in the end, moving away from Russian oil and Russian energy means breaking free from Moscow\u2019s grip, and that will ultimately make life better for the people of Europe.\nFourth, we\u2019re strengthening our own defenses.\u00a0 At the NATO Leaders Summit next week, we will endorse a new Strategic Concept to ensure that NATO is prepared to face emerging threats over the next decade.\u00a0 We\u2019ll announce new force posture commitments to strengthen NATO\u2019s eastern flank and its defense and deterrence.\u00a0 And, of course, we\u2019ll pursue Finland and Sweden\u2019s applications to join the Alliance in light of the Kremlin\u2019s war on their neighbor.\u00a0 President Putin wanted to weaken NATO with this war.\u00a0 Instead, NATO is stronger, more united, and on the cusp of enlarging.\nWe all wish that we could say with certainty when this war will end.\u00a0 The days ahead are not going to be easy.\u00a0 But we must and we will stay resolved to stand up to Russian aggression and defend Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence.\u00a0 President Putin used to claim that this war of aggression toward Ukraine was somehow about a threat that Ukraine or NATO posed toward Russia.\u00a0 But that\u2019s not what this is about; it never has been, and President Putin now forthrightly acknowledges it.\u00a0 He recently compared himself to Peter the Great and said that when Peter waged a war with Sweden, he was simply taking back what belonged to Russia.\u00a0 Now, he said, Russia is again looking to take back what is theirs.\u00a0 He stopped pretending this war of choice is about Russia defending itself from a manufactured threat by NATO.\u00a0 It\u2019s about conquest.\u00a0 It\u2019s about subjugating Russia\u2019s neighbor.\u00a0 We can\u2019t let that happen.\nFrom the start of this brutal war, the United States and our allies and partners have been united to a remarkable degree, and that continues.\u00a0 At every step there have been doubts about whether our shared resolve would last, and at every step we\u2019ve proved that it would.\u00a0 Some doubted that we\u2019d impose sanctions that would have a meaningful impact on the Russian economy; we did.\u00a0 Some have doubted whether we\u2019d build a significant coalition behind those sanctions; we did.\u00a0 Some doubted whether countries in Europe would provide lethal defensive assistance to Ukraine; they did.\u00a0 Some doubted that Ukraine could withstand Moscow\u2019s onslaught; it has, it will, and we\u2019ll stand with them.\nIn the coming week, we\u2019ll strengthen our unity yet again, both at the NATO Leaders Summit and at the G7 Leaders Summit, where we\u2019ll reaffirm our support for a democratic, independent, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine; address the impact that this war of aggression by Russia is having on rising global prices for food and gas; and roll out a set of concrete actions to continue to increase the costs on Russia.\nPresident Zelenskyy said that this war will only definitively end through diplomacy.\u00a0 We stand ready to support any diplomatic solution.\u00a0 And yet, Russia has shown no interest.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep discussing diplomatic strategies with Ukraine, with our allies and partners.\u00a0 We\u2019ll keep strengthening Ukraine\u2019s position on the battlefield so it has the strongest possible position at any negotiating table that emerges.\nAs President Biden recently reiterated, we seek a democratic, independent, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against any further aggression.\u00a0 We\u2019ll support Ukraine\u2019s efforts to achieve a negotiated end to the conflict because our principle throughout this crisis has been nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, and that will continue.\nThe United States is grateful to our allies and partners for incredibly close coordination every step along the way.\u00a0 We join people around the world in standing resolutely with the Ukrainian people as they fight for their country and for the principles that make the world more secure and more free for everyone.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We have time for a few questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Missy Ryan of\u00a0The Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thanks for doing this.\u00a0 I have two questions on Ukraine.\u00a0 First, you mentioned Russia\u2019s limited military gains in eastern Ukraine, but at the same time Russia has \u2013 I assume you were referring to the fall of Sievierodonetsk or the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from that city.\u00a0 But Russia has also managed to take other parts of eastern Ukraine, and I\u2019m just wondering if you see the changing of control in Sievierodonetsk as potentially an indicator of the limits of Ukraine\u2019s battlefield reach or capability and an indicator of this potentially settling into frozen conflict.\nAnd then yesterday you mentioned the 450 million, the latest drawdown.\u00a0 In response to that, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee welcomed the drawdown but also said that the administration, in his view, is still failing to go far enough in providing weapons that Ukraine has requested like longer-range drones and tanks.\u00a0 What\u2019s your response to the idea that the United States and its allies, despite this massive amount of assistance that\u2019s being rolled out, are arming Ukraine enough to maintain a stalemate or perhaps have this slow degrading of its territory but not enough to win?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Missy.\u00a0 So first, what we\u2019re seeing in the Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, after Russia\u2019s failure to achieve its objectives of taking the entire country, eliminating its sovereignty and independence \u2013 that failed.\u00a0 It failed in large part because of the extraordinary courage of the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 It also failed because for many, many months, well before the aggression, we had been doing everything we could to make sure that Ukrainians had in their hands the tools that they needed, the weapons that they needed to repel Russian aggression.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what they so effectively did around Kyiv and pushed the entire conflict to eastern Ukraine and southern Ukraine.\nThe fighting is intense in the Donbas throughout.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing horrifically large numbers of casualties on both sides, Russia and Ukraine, and what we\u2019ve said all along is that the trajectory of this conflict was not going to be linear.\u00a0 It would move back and forth.\u00a0 The progress that we\u2019ve seen Russia make in the Donbas, as I said, has come at incredibly high cost to Russia in lives and materiel.\u00a0 And as I mentioned a moment ago, in many cases, to the extent that Russia does take some additional territory, the territory that it\u2019s taken has literally been bombed to the rubbles by Russia itself.\u00a0 And to the extent the local populace remains, it\u2019s \u2013 as I said, it hates Russia.\u00a0 So that\u2019s not a situation that suggests there will be stability in any parts of Ukraine that Russia seizes by force.\nBut again, I think we focus on the tactical at the expense of looking, again, at the strategic.\u00a0 And it\u2019s worth emphasizing that Russia\u2019s objectives, Putin\u2019s objectives, had been to eliminate Ukraine as a sovereign and independent state.\u00a0 That has failed.\u00a0 And now there is a incredibly destructive battle going on in one part of Ukraine.\nWith regard to the assistance, what we\u2019ve done at every step along the way is to make the best determination we can about what it is that Ukraine needs and can effectively use to repel the Russian aggression.\u00a0 And that evolves over time; that\u2019s changed over time.\u00a0 Some of the systems that we and many others were providing to the Ukrainians to deal with the Russian attack on Kyiv were different from what is necessary now because the nature of the battle has changed, the nature of what\u2019s needed has changed.\nAs I mentioned, this is now the 13th drawdown that we\u2019ve done, well over $6 billion in assistance just from the United States, and of course dozens of allies and partners are also taking part in an effort coordinated by us \u2013 Secretary Austin in Ramstein just a couple of months ago brought everyone together to really further coordinate these efforts.\u00a0 And we make determinations every day about what we believe can be most effective in helping the Ukrainians deal with the Russian aggression and the specifics of that aggression.\nTwo things are necessary: the equipment itself, which is being provided very rapidly, to include most recently the HIMARS, to include most recently the MLRS \u2013 and that significantly increases the range that the Ukrainians have in dealing with Russian artillery positions and other things.\u00a0 It\u2019s also critical, though, that \u2013 in the case of weapons systems being provided by many, many countries, including the United States \u2013 that the Ukrainians be effectively trained to use the system as well as have the ability to maintain them.\u00a0 So all of that has to be put together.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that, and again, we\u2019re doing that in very close coordination with allies and partners, and I think you\u2019ll see, as more equipment continues to get where it needs to get \u2013 into Ukrainian hands \u2013 that that will have an impact on the battlefield.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Vivian.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I do have a food security question, but if you\u2019ll indulge me in light of the historic news back home, I wanted to ask you \u2013 of course, you may have heard that the Supreme Court has overturned\u00a0Roe v. Wade, imposing potential restrictions that would largely buck worldwide trends.\u00a0 Yesterday the court also said that Americans can \u2013 have the right to carry firearms in public for self-defense on the heels of a series of mass shootings.\u00a0 Of course, we know this is not necessarily your portfolio, but the Biden administration has repeatedly touted its desire to improve America\u2019s image abroad with allies and partners and to ensure them that on major issues and principles, America is on the same page.\u00a0 Does this complicate your efforts to do that?\nAnd then I can ask you right away the food security question.\u00a0 You and your counterparts have repeatedly pushed back on Russia\u2019s comments that sanctions are responsible for the food crisis, and there\u2019s evidence to support that, but sanctions have caused tremendous challenges that cannot be denied, and so far, despite discussions with allies around the world, those efforts haven\u2019t yet seen a significant impact as far as easing some of those logistical disruptions that are happening.\u00a0 And so how can you change that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sure, thank you.\u00a0 With regard to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, I believe the President is going to be speaking to that very shortly, maybe in the next hour or so.\u00a0 So I am certainly not going to get ahead of the President.\u00a0 I\u2019ll let him speak to the decision.\nWith regard to grain, first, it is very important to continue to make clear, as I did earlier today when I was standing with my German counterpart, that this narrative that Russia has been pushing out that somehow our sanctions are contributing to food scarcity, that that is entirely wrong and it is Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine that has exacerbated what was already a terrible pre-existing condition.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen rising food insecurity over the last few years, largely driven by climate change and COVID; now we have conflict and Russia\u2019s aggression.\nAnd again, to be absolutely clear about this, from day one, as we imposed sanctions on Russia for its aggression against Ukraine, we exempted from those sanctions food, food products, fertilizer, and also things necessary to move them out of Russia, including insurance and shipping.\u00a0 And we have been going around the world whenever a question, a practical question is raised about some perceived impediment to moving food to answer those questions, and if any complication has resulted that was unintended, we\u2019re dealing with it and making sure that we can facilitate the export of food.\nRussia itself has been playing terrible games with its own food, imposing its own export controls on itself, putting quotas on, deciding when and where it\u2019s going to make food available for political reasons.\u00a0 As I said before, there is nothing preventing the export of food, food products, fertilizer from Russia except for Russia itself.\u00a0 And the only thing that is preventing the export of food from Ukraine, the breadbasket of Europe, is Russia.\u00a0 Blockading Odessa \u2013 as I said earlier, there are about 25 million tons of grain stuck in silos in Ukraine, on ships in the Odessa port, that can\u2019t leave because of Russia.\nSo again, Russia has been spreading this false narrative, we are batting it down in every place that we can, and if any practical problems emerge, we deal with them.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Fred Pleitgen, CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, sir.\u00a0 I just got back from Russia; I was there for about two and a half weeks.\u00a0 And quite frankly, the Russians believe that they\u2019re winning.\u00a0 They say that their economy has been hit, but it certainly hasn\u2019t been crippled.\u00a0 They\u2019re making tons of money off oil and gas.\u00a0 They\u2019re actually trying to turn the offensive in Ukraine into an employment program by offering people up to five, six thousand dollars a month to fight there, especially people from lower-income regions of Russia.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve defined or they\u2019ve called the battlefield losses that you say are horrific \u2013 they\u2019ve called those acceptable.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t that mean that the U.S. essentially needs to step up a lot as far as economic pressure is concerned and military assistance to Ukraine is concerned if it really wants to dissuade Russia from continuing to attack Ukraine?\nI do want to also follow up on what Vivian was saying or asking, because I did have the chance to speak to Dmitry Peskov and he told me that the Russians will be perfectly fine with allowing goods to get out of the port of Odessa, but the Ukrainians have to remove the mines and the Russians want to inspect every ship.\u00a0 Do you give any credence to demands like that?\nAnd finally \u2013 this is probably just a yes-or-no answer \u2013 is there any chance that you\u2019ll bump into or meet Sergey Lavrov at the G20 in Bali?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So let me take those in a slightly different order.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFirst, with regard to Odessa, again, the only thing preventing Ukrainian grain from leaving is the Russian effective blockade of the port.\u00a0 When Russia says that it might be prepared to let ships out, that potentially creates the risk of Russian ships going in and attacking Odessa directly.\u00a0 So the Ukrainians have to have confidence that in doing anything that would allow their ships to get out of port, that the Russians won\u2019t take advantage of that and allow Russian ships to go in and attack Odessa.\nWith regard to inspections, by what right or by what logic does Russia insist on inspecting Ukrainian sovereign ships leaving Ukrainian ports going to other countries?\u00a0 That makes no sense.\u00a0 Having said that, the United Nations, the secretary-general have been working very persistently to see if some kind of agreement can be reached that would allow a channel out of Odessa for Ukrainian ships, and so food and grain.\u00a0 We very much support that effort.\u00a0 They are trying to bring Russians, Ukrainians together.\u00a0 Turkey\u2019s involved also in supporting this effort.\u00a0 If they can come to an agreement, that would be a very good thing, but I have doubts about whether Russia is really serious about doing this.\u00a0 It keeps sort of kicking the can down the road despite the best efforts of the UN secretary-general, but we hope that that can achieve something.\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s \u2013 more grain is moving out of Ukraine by rail, by land through to Poland, Romania, and other places.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the volume go up month to month.\u00a0 It\u2019s still not anywhere near where it was before the Russian aggression, but that is \u2013 that is increasing.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to help facilitate that.\u00a0 One of the other big problems that Ukraine has \u2013 and the President addressed this the other day \u2013 is that because so much grain is stuck in silos, as the new harvest comes in there\u2019s no place for it to go.\u00a0 So we\u2019re looking at some creative solutions to that problem.\nAgain, with regard to the sanctions and the pressure, Putin has developed over the years one of the most effective 24/7 propaganda systems of any country on earth, and so the steady diet of propaganda that Russians are fed every single day without other sources of information that Putin over many years has sought to eliminate makes it sometimes difficult for the truth to penetrate immediately.\u00a0 But as I said earlier, the sanctions have already had a dramatic impact on Russia\u2019s economic fortunes.\u00a0 Much of what it\u2019s doing, for example, to prop up the ruble is unsustainable, and I think you\u2019ll see changes there.\nAs I mentioned, while oil revenues are coming in because of higher prices, the export controls are such that the things that Russia most wants to buy, including technology to modernize its defense sector, to modernize its ability to extract energy in different places, they can\u2019t buy it.\u00a0 Meanwhile, this exodus of more than a thousand companies from Russia \u2013 that also has an impact over time.\u00a0 For example, companies that have been involved in selling things that Russians want to buy, they had inventory in Russia, so even as they left or said they were leaving, the inventory was still there, so Russians could still buy an iPhone.\nAs those inventories are depleted, I think you\u2019ll see that the Russian people will not be able to buy what they\u2019ve been able to buy for the last 20 or 30 years since Russia\u2019s opening to the world, and what Putin has forfeited among many other things with this aggression against Ukraine is everything that\u2019s been achieved in terms of Russian\u2019s openness to the world and the opportunities that creates for the Russian people.\u00a0 He\u2019s forfeited that with this aggression against Ukraine.\nThis will bite more and more and more.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing a downgrading of Russian bonds to junk status.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing expectations for Russian growth to be somewhere between minus 10 and minus 15 this coming year, and all of that has a cumulative impact.\u00a0 And as I said, at some point, despite the propaganda system, the Russian people are actually going to feel this in their daily lives.\u00a0 I wish that were not the case.\u00a0 I wish that these consequences of Putin\u2019s aggression were not going to also cause suffering in Russia, but that is a fact.\u00a0 It is a result of Putin\u2019s aggression, and I just come back to this simple question that if one could speak to Russians directly \u2013 and maybe you did in your time there \u2013 what is this possibly doing to improve their lives?\u00a0 How is this horrific aggression that is costing so many Ukrainian lives and so many Russian lives \u2013 how is that doing anything to actually address what the Russian people want?\nI think with time they\u2019re going to be asking those questions more and more and more.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Kristin Becker, ARD.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Oh.\u00a0 I won\u2019t get ahead of that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll \u2013 stay tuned.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Kristin Becker, ARD.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, in your statement, you said we will continue to help Ukraine as long as it takes, more or less.\u00a0 I was wondering, like, also in Germany these days solidarity is the big word, but in Germany and as well in the U.S., you have sort of a worsened situation for the normal people in terms of inflation, gas prices.\u00a0 So how long do you think you can keep up this solidarity?\u00a0 Is there a limit?\nAnd if you allow me, just \u2013 I do understand that you cannot offer an official position on the\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0case, but in Germany we have a big day today on abortion rights as well because parliament voted for more liberalization on that.\u00a0 And I was just wondering if you could offer at least a personal note.\u00a0 Your ex-boss \u2013 ex-President Obama said it\u2019s an attack on \u201cthe essential [freedom] of millions of Americans.\u201d\u00a0 Do you agree?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Second part first, again, because President Biden will be speaking to this very shortly, I\u2019m not going to have anything to say.\u00a0 I want \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the President.\nWith regard to the sustainability of everything that we\u2019re doing, I\u2019d say two things.\u00a0 First, as I mentioned in my opening comments, at virtually every step along the way in this process starting from before Russia\u2019s aggression through to right now, there have been lots of doubts expressed about our ability to do things we said we would do, about our ability to maintain solidarity, about the willingness of allies and partners to take significant steps when it comes either to sanctions or to supporting Ukraine, including with security assistance.\nAnd thus far at every step along the way, the doubters have been proved wrong, and our solidarity, our ability to work as allies and partners in support of Ukraine militarily, economically, and on a humanitarian basis; to impose costs on Russia for the aggression in an effort to get it to end the war more quickly, and as we\u2019ll see in just a few days, strengthening our defensive Alliance at NATO \u2013 I think that cohesion, that solidarity has been unlike any I\u2019ve seen in the 30 or so years that I\u2019ve been doing this.\u00a0 As I said earlier, too, we can\u2019t predict how long this war will last, and I fear that it will still be some time.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to see it \u2013 Russia\u2019s aggression end tomorrow, and we\u2019ll look for any opportunity to advance an end to the aggression.\nBut what I heard today from my partners in the G7 was an ongoing commitment to continue doing what we\u2019ve been doing in support of Ukraine: imposing costs on Russia, strengthening our own defenses.\u00a0 I know we\u2019ll see more of that at NATO and we\u2019ll see that at the leaders\u2019 level at the G7.\u00a0 And I think the solidarity is strong, it\u2019s real, and there\u2019s a real commitment to carry it through as long as is necessary.\n`MR PRICE:\u00a0 Take a final question from Carsten Hoffmann, DPA.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, you mentioned food security already today and there was the conference, but there is another big problem that is energy security.\u00a0 There is concern that Germany and other European countries might be hit very hard in the winter because of a lack of gas.\u00a0 Is there something that you have to \u2013 that the U.S. could do?\u00a0 Have you talked with your partners in Europe about this?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yes, and in fact, that\u2019s been an ongoing conversation \u2013 more than a conversation, active coordination \u2013 for several months.\u00a0 We set up a task force with the European Union to look at energy concerns that have arisen since Russia\u2019s aggression, including concerns about the availability of energy for Europe.\u00a0 We have ourselves directed more liquified natural gas to Europe.\u00a0 We\u2019ve worked with other countries, including in Asia, who were contracted to take some liquified natural gas that\u2019s been redirected to Europe.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing everything we can to support transitions that Europe is making away from Russian oil in the first instance, and then ultimately diversifying their sources of energy going forward.\nThis isn\u2019t easy at all.\u00a0 I mean, the dependence on Russia has built up over decades, so you can\u2019t just flip a switch and end it easily and cleanly.\u00a0 But there seems to me to be a real commitment in Europe to do that.\u00a0 And for people in Europe, continuing to allow Russia to have a stranglehold through energy on different countries in Europe, that I believe is both unacceptable and unsustainable.\u00a0 And European leaders are taking very courageous steps to move away from that.\nI think we\u2019ve said all along that in standing up to this Russian aggression, the costs would primarily be borne by the Ukrainian people, but we would also bear costs.\u00a0 And I think leaders throughout Europe and beyond in Asia have made the judgment that those costs are necessary because what\u2019s at stake, the ongoing dangers posed to all of us by allowing the Russian aggression to go forward with impunity, are enormous.\u00a0 And so there are sacrifices that are being made, but we\u2019re taking very active steps to try to address them, to end them, to mitigate them wherever we can.\u00a0 And again, there\u2019s an ongoing work that\u2019s being done virtually every day to look at what we can do to help make sure that Europe has the energy it needs when it needs it.\nThank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-during-the-uniting-for-global-food-security-conference/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

People living in acute food insecurity, that is when a person\u2019s ability to consume adequate food puts their lives or livelihoods in immediate danger: 108 million people roughly in 2016; 193 million people last year according to the UN estimates.\u00a0 Now, the World Bank calculates that Russia\u2019s unprovoked war on Ukraine, long one of the world\u2019s bread baskets, will add at least another 40 million people to the ranks of those who are severely food insecure.\nSo we know the drivers of all of this: climate, COVID, and now conflict with Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 The Russian military is laying waste to Ukrainian farms and grain silos, stealing Ukrainian grain and the equipment needed to harvest it, blocking access to and from Ukrainian ports by the sea.\u00a0 There are some 25 million tons of grain trapped in silos right now in Ukraine, where it will rot if it\u2019s not exported.\u00a0 Tens of millions more are being harvested in the coming months, but there\u2019s no place to put them because Ukraine\u2019s silos are full because it\u2019s not able to move its grain thanks to the Russian blockade.\nIt\u2019s very important that we be very clear about something, and Annalena said this earlier; I want to reinforce it:\u00a0 When we imposed sanctions on Russia so that it would end its aggression against Ukraine as quickly as possible, we deliberately created exceptions for agricultural goods, for fertilizer, for insurance, and shipping necessary to move these products precisely to avoid worsening the food crisis.\u00a0 Nothing \u2013 nothing is preventing food and fertilizer from leaving Russia, and only one country is blocking food and fertilizer from leaving Ukraine, and that is Russia.\nLast month, as Annalena said, I convened a UN Security Council meeting and a ministerial to try to help galvanize further collective action.\u00a0 One of the things we did was to create a global roadmap that commits countries to taking swift, concrete steps to get food to people around the world who need it now, and to build greater resilience to future shocks.\u00a0 Ninety-four countries and counting have signed on to that roadmap.\u00a0 So now, what\u2019s our responsibility?\u00a0 Our responsibility is to turn the commitments that countries have made \u2013 through the roadmap and other initiatives \u2013 into concrete, immediate action.\nA few suggestions:\u00a0 First, more countries need to step up with new substantial contributions to meet urgent humanitarian needs.\u00a0 The work of critical organizations like the World Food Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization \u2013 their cost of doing business has gone up dramatically.\u00a0 We need to help them fill some of these gaps.\u00a0 Since the Russian aggression began in February, the United States has committed nearly $2.8 billion in emergency food assistance, including increasing our aid to countries and regions that were the hardest hit \u2013 in the Horn of Africa, Yemen, Lebanon, Haiti.\u00a0 We have $5.5 billion in new funding for global food security and humanitarian assistance approved last month by the United States Congress.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be able to do even more in the weeks and months ahead, and you can expect further announcements of our additional support soon, including from the President at the G7 meeting.\nSecond, we have to accelerate efforts led by the United Nations to end Russia\u2019s blocking of Ukrainian food exports through the Black Sea.\nThird, we have to close the global fertilizer gap by both producing more fertilizer and using it more efficiently.\u00a0 We know that if fertilizer is not getting to farmers, then yields will go down.\u00a0 Yields go down; scarcity goes up; prices go up.\u00a0 Fertilizer prices skyrocketed with the onset of the pandemic.\u00a0 They shot up even further with Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 Lack of access to fertilizer means many low-income countries are significantly reducing their production.\u00a0 President Biden committed $500 million to boost our own fertilizer production and launched a global challenge to raise 100 million for new research on increasing efficiency as well as developing alternatives.\nFourth, governments have to resist the temptation to impose restrictions on the export of food and fertilizer.\u00a0 Past crises have demonstrated that will only make the problem worse.\nFifth, we need to substantially increase agricultural capacity and resilience around the world.\u00a0 This is something that I heard repeatedly when I hosted a meeting with African counterparts on the margins of our UN ministerial last month.\u00a0 We\u2019re hard at work at that both through individual efforts like our own Feed the Future initiative, which contributes a billion dollars a year to building capacity, and through leveraging investments through international financial institutions.\nSixth, speaking of those institutions, we very much agree that we need to follow up on initiatives within the international financial institutions to cushion food shocks and to give countries greater flexibility in what they do to make sure that they can feed their people.\nFinally, we need to have greater information sharing and coordination to better identify needs and to be able to act efficiently to meet them.\u00a0 That is one of the driving ideas behind the Global Alliance for Food Security, which we and other G7 members launched here in Berlin last month.\nSo let me conclude with this.\u00a0 We hear all these numbers; we\u2019ve all cited numbers of this growing food insecurity.\u00a0 But what we know is this:\u00a0 We know that those numbers are people, real people, real lives, real livelihoods, mothers, fathers, children.\u00a0 And when you see, in Somalia, for example, a mother taking one of her children on an incredibly treacherous journey to try to find food somewhere for her child and the others that she\u2019s left behind, and she makes it there and the child that she\u2019s brought with her dies in her arms because she couldn\u2019t get to the food in time \u2013 put your own kids in that position; put yourself in that position.\u00a0 Just imagine.\u00a0 As human beings, all of us have to be seized with this.\u00a0 We see the suffering and we know we can do something about it.\u00a0 So let\u2019s get it done.\n(Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-french-foreign-minister-catherine-colonna-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Ladies and gentlemen, Tony, I am very grateful that you made the trip again as the Secretary of State and are joining us at our conference, Uniting for Food Security.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us today.\nIn mid-May, you invited us to an important conference at the United Nations in New York, and today we build on the achievements back then.\u00a0 Together as the international community, we work with international organizations and we are making it very clear we do not turn a blind eye as the international community to the many countries in the world whose people are suffering from famine today as a direct impact of the war with which Russia has aggressed Ukraine.\nWe have discussed this in the G7 format at the moment, and our message as the G7 is very clear:\u00a0 We do not accept that the Russian war of aggression is making the world suffer from starvation.\u00a0 As the most powerful industrialized nations, we have a special responsibility.\u00a0 Even though this hunger crisis exacerbated by the Russian war of aggression is not something that we have caused, as G7 partners, we look with our international friends what Russia is doing.\u00a0 Russia is waging a cynical grain war, using it as a tool to make food prices skyrocketing and destabilize entire countries.\nWe act.\u00a0 As the G7, we will play a central role in supporting the most affected countries across the globe.\u00a0 Firstly, we will do everything we can in different formats to export grain from Ukraine.\u00a0 Together we try to open the sea routes, but in parallel, we also intensively work on rail connections even though this is technically very difficult.\u00a0 It is an ambitious endeavor.\u00a0 And together \u2013 this was an American initiative \u2013 we are building silos in order to store the grain safely for the moment.\nWe are increasing our emergency relief efforts, and at this conference, another important topic:\u00a0 We are working on sustainable production and better global food supply and strengthening this in the midterm.\u00a0 In addition to that, between Germany and the U.S., we have made sure that the medium-term consequences of the war are also taken into account.\u00a0 There is \u2013 are no sanctions on food, on medical products, but there is uncertainty across the globe when it comes to grain deliveries, insurances, and payments.\u00a0 We have seen this in our visits across the globe.\u00a0 Countries want security.\u00a0 They want to be sure that they can buy grain from Russia too.\nSo, we made it clear that we need a joint outreach program in order to make sure that countries are not afraid in terms of insurance consequences in the logistics sector, that grains are not being transported.\u00a0 This is important because Russia is not only waging a brutal war of aggressions with weapons, a brutal grain war, but also a fake news war.\u00a0 The evermore fanciful lies Russia is using to reverse who is the perpetrator and who is the victim here is something that we see, and this is why we are hosting this conference \u2013 to show our solidarity.\nTony, these are difficult times.\u00a0 It is a time in which we stand united as we\u2019ve never been before.\u00a0 The rules-based international order is something that many countries across the globe believe in.\u00a0 We stand in solidarity with those countries that need our support.\u00a0 We not only counter fake news, but we also stand up for the people across the globe who are suffering from hunger.\u00a0 It is very clear that we need a lot of stamina to do that not only in order to support Ukraine in its self-defense against Russia and rebuild the country later; we also need a lot of stamina and perseverance to address the global impacts of this war and the tremendous human suffering that we see everywhere in Africa, South Asia, and also in Afghanistan that have \u2013 countries that have been aggressed in a triple way.\nTony, as transatlantic partners, important meetings are ahead.\u00a0 The conference today is one of them, the G7 summit in Elmau another one, and also the NATO summit in Madrid next week.\u00a0 We will both be attending, and I am delighted that in these difficult times, the transatlantic partnership is stronger than ever before.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone, and Annalena, thank you very much for today but also for every day in this remarkable partnership that we have between our countries, between us, as well as among our G7 colleagues.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be back in Berlin.\u00a0 By my count, this is my sixth trip to Germany, in this job.\u00a0 We are looking forward to our leaders coming together in the beautiful Bavarian Alps, but I think we did a lot of good work today in support of the work that they will do in the days ahead.\nAs the foreign minister said, we focused intensely on our ongoing support for Ukraine, and some of the second- and third-order consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 In terms of support for Ukraine, the G7 has been remarkably united \u2013 starting from before Russia\u2019s aggression when we worked together, first to find a diplomatic solution if there was one, but if there wasn\u2019t one, to be prepared for the Russian aggression that we saw coming, and the work that the G7 did both in support of Ukraine\u00a0\u2013 military, economic, humanitarian support \u2013 as well as the pressure we\u2019re imposing on Russia to end this war of aggression.\u00a0 That continues, and we looked at ways today to deepen all of those lines of effort in the time ahead.\nBut as Annalena said, we\u2019re also intensely focused as the G7 on some of the second- and third-order consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression, no more so than when it comes to food insecurity.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have a lot more to say about that later, but let me just say for now that I am grateful for Germany\u2019s leadership, for Annalena\u2019s leadership, for her colleagues\u2019 leadership on this issue.\u00a0 Everywhere that I go around the globe, and I know it\u2019s the same for our colleagues, we hear the deep concerns about food insecurity.\u00a0 It was a problem before.\u00a0 Three, four years ago there were about 100 million people who were severely food insecure in the world.\u00a0 A year ago it was about 160 million people.\u00a0 Now another 40 or 50 million people are being added to the ranks because of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nSo the combination that we\u2019ve seen of COVID, of climate, and now conflict is creating an even graver crisis of food insecurity.\u00a0 And let\u2019s be very, very clear.\u00a0 As the foreign minister said, the only reason for this now is Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and Russia\u2019s blockade against grain and other foodstuffs moving out of Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s worth repeating: The sanctions that we\u2019ve imposed on Russia collectively and with many other countries exempt food, exempt food products, exempt fertilizers, exempt insurers, exempt shippers.\u00a0 So there is no reason \u2013 no reason other than Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukraine and Russia\u2019s refusal in many cases to export its own grain for political reasons \u2013 no reason that this shouldn\u2019t be moving. \u00a0And we are, of course, working on all of that.\nBut we\u2019re also working together in the absence of being able to get as much grain as we would like out of Ukraine or see Russia export its own foodstuffs, looking at other ways to help the many countries that are affected.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be talking about that in detail in a short while.\u00a0 So I\u2019ll leave it\u00a0\u2013 I\u2019ll leave that for later.\nBut the bottom line is this: Throughout all of this we\u2019ve stood together in solidarity and in common action.\u00a0 And as part of that, I can say that the United States is deeply fortunate to have an ally like Germany in times of challenge, in times of trouble.\u00a0 We coordinate on virtually everything that is having an impact on the lives of our people and of people around the world, whether it\u2019s food insecurity, whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s technology and innovation and the impact that that has.\u00a0 And simply put, we are united in defense of shared values.\u00a0 We\u2019re united in defense of human rights, democracy, and international law.\u00a0 We\u2019re united when it comes to the great problems of this day.\nAnd on a personal note, I just have to say how grateful I am, not only for Germany\u2019s leadership, but for Annalena\u2019s leadership.\u00a0 She\u2019s been at the helm of the G7 over these past months at one of the most critical times in world history, and we couldn\u2019t ask\u00a0\u2013 the world couldn\u2019t ask\u00a0\u2013 for better leadership.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

These are extraordinary times and, so far, we have done pretty well because the transatlantic partnership has been revitalized anew. It is no secret that we have had more difficult times in the past. It is now decisive that the United States, Canada, and Europe jointly coordinate their measures, and this joint coordination of course becomes increasingly demanding as the war goes on, we have to continuously readjust our sanctions, our support of the Ukrainian armed forces, and our agreements on how to safeguard energy and food security globally, but also in Germany and Europe. And this will certainly be the focus of our talks.\u00a0Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nVICE CHANCELLOR HABECK:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) modernization of transatlantic relations, and this (inaudible) has in the past looked different, but we do see (inaudible) particularly in our cooperation with the United States, Canada, and Europe all together.\u00a0 We have to work together (inaudible) cooperation also in \u2013 and also our policy moving forward together so we (inaudible).\u00a0 Particularly as far as the war in Ukraine, but also other (inaudible) in particular, (inaudible) energy security in Europe, and we will also have to (inaudible) opportunity in this regard, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re meeting again today.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nVICE CHANCELLOR HABECK:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) (Inaudible) modernization of transatlantic relations, and this (inaudible) has in the past looked different, but we do see (inaudible) particularly in our cooperation with the United States, Canada, and Europe all together.\u00a0 We have to work together (inaudible) cooperation also in \u2013 and also our policy moving forward together so we (inaudible).\u00a0 Particularly as far as the war in Ukraine, but also other (inaudible) in particular, (inaudible) energy security in Europe, and we will also have to (inaudible) opportunity in this regard, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re meeting again today.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-congress-bundestag-youth-exchange-welcome-home-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

So not bad.\u00a0(Applause.)\nLee, thank you not only for the introduction, but thank you for the leadership of a bureau that is near and dear to my heart.\u00a0 I\u2019ll come back to that.\u00a0 I believe so profoundly in this mission of connecting people through education, through culture, through sports.\u00a0 It is in my judgment among the best things that we do and, in terms of value for the money that we put into it, the best thing that we do.\nBut I also want to take a moment \u2013 Senator Blunt left, but when you have senior members of Congress showing the support that he\u2019s shown for our international exchange programs, it makes all the difference in the world.\u00a0 And the fact that, as the assistant secretary said, he was here today is really evidence of that, and having that partnership with Congress is hugely important.\nBut to everyone who is here who made this year\u2019s Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program a success, thank you, thank you, thank you.\u00a0 Our team at ECA, our partners in the AFS-USA, the ASSE, the Council on International Educational Exchange, Youth for Understanding, Cultural Vistas, the Nacel Open Door \u2013 all of you, thank you for making this a success and thank you for the difference that you\u2019re making.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut most of all,\u00a0congratulations\u00a0to all of this year\u2019s participants.\u00a0 Now, I know that many of you came home as recently as yesterday from your year away.\u00a0 I want to ask you all about what the airport was like.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Yeah, I can imagine.\u00a0 But let me start by saying, even as you\u2019re working through your jet lag, welcome back, welcome home.\u00a0 I suspect your family and friends missed you a whole lot.\u00a0 They can\u2019t wait for you to fill them in on a year\u2019s worth of stories, and I suspect you\u2019re going to get a year\u2019s worth of stories from back home.\nBut here\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you about a little bit today, because I think and hope for most of you this has been an incredible experience, an opportunity to actually get to know another country in an up-close and personal way, not only seeing the sights that you\u2019d see if you were a tourist, but learning all the little ways in which life is different there than it is here, but also the so many ways that it\u2019s the same.\nI know you\u2019ve had to deal with a lot of new challenges: adjusting to local dialects that sound very different, maybe, from the High German that some of you may have learned in school; trying to buy food on a Sunday \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 when stores in Germany are closed; or realizing that under the German grading system, somehow the lowest score is the best one and the highest score is the worst, which would have served me very well at many stages of my own education.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd I suspect for almost all of you this was a year that had some unforgettable moments.\u00a0 Maybe just the first time you conducted a conversation entirely in German, how remarkable that is; and then making connections, making friendships that I bet you will last the rest of your lives.\nThere just isn\u2019t an experience equivalent to the one of living in a new country.\nAs Lee said, when I was nine years old, I moved from New York to France, in my case, and I spent the next decade pretty much flying back and forth across the ocean because my dad was still in the United States, my mom and I were in Paris with my stepdad.\u00a0 I was going to school in France but spending breaks whenever I could in the United States.\u00a0 And here\u2019s what really stood out for me, and I suspect many of you have had this experience:\u00a0 As an American at a French school, I found myself even at a young age trying to explain my own country to the kids that I was in school with \u2013 sharing our own culture, maybe trying to correct some of the stereotypes that take hold about what Americans are like, debating world events from my point of view as an American kid.\u00a0 And it was almost like I was a junior diplomat representing my country abroad, just in a school cafeteria instead of at the U.S. embassy.\u00a0 But it was very much the same kind of thing.\nBut then what was interesting was when I was back here at home on breaks, in a way I was in the exact opposite role with my American friends.\u00a0 I found myself gently correcting stereotypes about the French people, sharing some of my favorite French music, trying to explain how my classmates over there saw the world.\u00a0\u00a0So in a way, I had become a representative for my new home back home as well.\nSo I have a feeling that a bunch of you already know that dynamic, and you\u2019re going to feel it even more as you\u2019re back home, as you\u2019re re-engaging with your friends and your families.\nAll these years later \u2013 because this was a while ago in my case \u2013 every day I can still feel how living abroad gave me a perspective that has stayed with me and that has shaped how I see the world, and it\u2019s done incredible things to enrich my own life and I think to enrich my work.\u00a0 And it\u2019s exactly why the State Department supports an incredibly broad range of exchange programs that bring international participants to the United States, take Americans around the world, just like you.\nMy wife, Evan Ryan, under the Obama administration sat where Assistant Secretary Satterfield sits right now, as assistant secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs.\u00a0 So even if I didn\u2019t profoundly believe this, I would have no choice.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But because of her work, I really could see every single day \u2013 as we talked about it at home when we got back from work, I could just see and feel the power of programs.\nAnd as I\u2019ve traveled around the world, including when I was last in government but also including now, I get a chance to sit and talk to folks who are participating in these programs, and I know, I know the profound difference it makes \u2013 it makes not only in their lives, but in a sense the lives of Germany and the United States, in this case, together.\nIt really is how we get new points of view; how we learn to see the world through the eyes of people with different histories, different cultures, different perspectives; how we understand world events as more than just headlines or chyrons on the TV screen, but as real things happening to real people, real families, real communities.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also how we find new partners to try to solve shared problems, and maybe gain some new skills that we bring back home to help as well.\nI also think that over time, these ties of friendship, these ties of understanding between people actually turn into bonds of trust between countries.\u00a0 And having that trust is more critical than it\u2019s ever been to the work that we\u2019re trying to do around the world to support democracy; to try to protect peace, or make it, as necessary; to try to advance the security of our own people, their prosperity, their opportunity, and shared progress around the world.\nAs alumni of this program, you\u2019re now part of that mission.\u00a0 You are in effect citizen diplomats.\nNow, if you end up building upon this experience in your life and in your career, all the better \u2013 all the better for you, all the better for the world.\nSo it\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t do \u2013 I can\u2019t let you leave here today and I can\u2019t leave here today without a little bit of a sales pitch: a career in diplomacy.\u00a0 I hope some of you, from this experience, have started to think that maybe that\u2019s something you\u2019d like to do.\u00a0 It is fascinating, it\u2019s meaningful, it\u2019s challenging, it\u2019s deeply rewarding.\u00a0 So I\u2019ve been hooked ever since I started working here in the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs, but one of the things that I want to point out is this:\u00a0 If you look around this department, the State Department, you will find people with incredible backgrounds not just in foreign policy or law \u2013 because so many people come up in that way \u2013 we have people in backgrounds, expertise in medicine, in engineering, in technology, in business, so many different things, who are now serving their country, serving the United States around the world.\u00a0 I know you met with a few of them this morning.\u00a0 But one of the things that makes this department thrive is having incredibly diverse, talented people with different backgrounds, different experiences, on our team.\u00a0 So given your own diversity, given the places that you\u2019re from, the things that you may do in your educations, even the things you may do in your careers, that still could lead you here, and I hope that it will.\nOne of the things that\u2019s been really striking is that if you looked at people in the Foreign Service, the Civil Service here 30 or 40 years ago, most of them were coming straight out of college or maybe grad school.\u00a0 Now what we\u2019re finding over the last 15 or 20 years is that people increasingly are coming from having had other careers, other pursuits for five years, 10 years, or more.\u00a0 And they bring with them this incredible experience, this incredible knowledge that enriches the department.\u00a0 So for some of you who may think this is a \u2013 this is really interesting but there\u2019s something else I want to do, just keep this in the back of your mind.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing quite like \u2013 at least in my experience \u2013 going to work every day with the American flag literally as well as figuratively behind your back.\u00a0 There\u2019s something really special about that.\u00a0 I hope you\u2019ll consider it.\nLast couple of things I want to say.\u00a0 Your exchange year came at an incredible time.\u00a0 Germany is one of our closest allies and partners.\u00a0 I\u2019ve traveled to Germany five times already in this job as Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to be going for a sixth time in a few days.\u00a0 Germany\u2019s hosting the G7 meetings.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together quite literally every day on some of the biggest challenges that we face and that are having a real effect, a real impact on the lives of all of our fellow citizens, like COVID-19 and trying to make sure that we help end this pandemic and we\u2019re better positioned to deal with the next one; like the climate crisis that is having profound effects around the world, including in our own country, and trying to do what we need to do together to get ahead of it; standing together against the aggression that we\u2019re seeing now by Russia in Ukraine.\nOne of the things I was told was that some of you actually volunteered this year helping Ukrainian refugees.\u00a0 Thank you, thank you, thank you \u2013 translating for new arrivals at train stations in Germany, working with local refugee assistance groups.\u00a0 You\u2019ve really had a front row to history in the making.\u00a0 In fact, you\u2019ve actually helped make that history by coming to the assistance of people in need.\u00a0 And these and so many other things that you\u2019ve done in Germany, all of these experiences, in ways that you may not be able to fully realize or imagine now, they\u2019re going to have a profound impact on your lives.\nSome of you might know that just a few blocks from here is the German-American Friendship Garden.\u00a0 It\u2019s right between the White House and the Washington Monument.\u00a0 And for those who are here and haven\u2019t been and have a chance, go take a look.\u00a0 One of the things is so wonderful about it, especially right now, is it\u2019s full of native plants and flowers from Germany and the United States.\u00a0 And it was dedicated a few decades ago, in 1988, just a few years after the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program was created.\u00a0 This year, you \u2013 each and every one of you \u2013 has planted new seeds of friendship between our countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re already seeing them start to blossom, and I think over time they will keep growing and make a huge difference in the years ahead.\nSo to each and every one of you, welcome home, thank you for participating in this program, but mostly thank you for what you\u2019re going to do in the years ahead.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-pride-reception/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

you make our foreign policy stronger.\u00a0 And we want to do everything we can to make sure that this department, the State Department, always recognizes your worth, supports you and your families, and is a place where you can bring your whole self to work every single day.\nNow, to do that, we need to be honest about the work it\u2019s taken to get where we are today, and you\u2019ve heard reference to some of it.\u00a0 For a long time, LGBTQI+ people couldn\u2019t live openly and still get a State Department security clearance.\u00a0 In contrast \u2013 in contrast \u2013 this week and this weekend, Diplomatic Security agents marched with glifaa in the DC Pride Parade.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That in and of itself is a pretty remarkable journey.\u00a0 And it\u2019s thanks in large part to glifaa, and to all the people who stood up and fought for America\u2019s foreign affairs agencies to be better.\u00a0 That took courage.\u00a0 It took resilience.\u00a0 And it\u2019s achieved real results.\nBut again, as you\u2019ve heard, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do.\u00a0 The work is ongoing, and in a sense, it always will be.\u00a0 We can\u2019t ever become complacent in advancing equity in our workplace.\u00a0 And especially now, it is so critical that we reaffirm our shared commitment to an America where all people are treated with equal respect and equal humanity, and where all kids know that they\u2019re perfect just the way they are.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re also working very closely with glifaa to see to it that when an LGBTQI+ officer serves overseas, they can do so with their partner.\u00a0 That is a priority for me and for all of us.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we here at State have another responsibility as well.\u00a0 It is our job \u2013 and it\u2019s quite literally Jessica\u2019s job \u2013 to stand up for human rights all over the world.\u00a0 And the fact is, again, as you\u2019ve heard, the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons are vulnerable or actively violated\u00a0in far too many places.\u00a0 Homosexual status or conduct is still illegal in 70 countries around the world.\u00a0 That\u2019s about a third of the world\u2019s countries.\u00a0 In some, it\u2019s punishable by death.\u00a0 And in too much of the world, being lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, or simply gender non-conforming means that you\u2019re going to be dealing with violence, you\u2019re going to be dealing with harassment, targeted by the police or security forces, denied education, denied employment, denied equal access to the justice sector or to healthcare, experiencing profoundly isolating social exclusion.\nThese are human rights abuses \u2013 and the United States fights for human rights.\u00a0 Human rights are indivisible.\u00a0 Whenever one group of people is targeted, all vulnerable groups are less safe.\u00a0 And whenever one group\u2019s rights are protected, societies as a whole become both more free, more prosperous, more secure.\u00a0 This is the \u201cinescapable network of mutuality\u201d that Dr. Martin Luther King talked about when he said that \u201cinjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s why it\u2019s not just enough to stand up for LGBTQI rights at home. We have to continue and we will continue to stand up for equal rights everywhere, in partnership with local activists and local communities.\nHuman rights are also central to our support for democracy around the world, because any system in which some groups are treated as \u201cless than\u201d \u2013 as second-class citizens with fewer rights and protections \u2013 is fundamentally flawed.\nWednesday, as you heard, President Biden signed an executive order to advance LGBTQI+ equality at home and abroad that includes direction to this department, to the State Department, along with other relevant agencies, to develop a plan to promote an end to the profoundly harmful and medically discredited practice of so-called \u201cconversion therapy\u201d around the world and to ensure that our foreign \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and to ensure, to ensure, that our foreign assistance dollars do not fund it.\nAt the Human Rights Council, we are supporting renewing the mandate of the Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity for another three years, so that this vital work to protect people facing violence and discrimination continues.\nWe\u2019ll keep supporting marriage equality and legal recognition for same-sex relationships around the world.\nAnd this year, we\u2019re celebrating the 10th anniversary of the State Department\u2019s Global Equality Fund.\u00a0 With support from Congress, from other countries, private sector partners, we have provided more than $100 million to LGBTQI+ organizations in more than 100 countries.\u00a0 (Cheers.)\nWe will continue to find ways to advance this work around the world.\u00a0 And I have a pretty good feeling I can count on everyone in this room to help us do that \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 because many of you have been pushing us to do more and to do better for a long time.\nSo as Mike noted at the outset, this is the 30th anniversary of glifaa\u2019s founding.\u00a0 I think probably all of you know the backstory, but for the few of you who don\u2019t:\u00a0 David Buss was a Foreign Service officer.\u00a0 He was posted to the Seychelles.\u00a0 David Larson was there with the Peace Corps.\u00a0 They became great friends.\u00a0 Eventually, they fell in love.\nAs a result, David Larson was removed from the Peace Corps for his, quote, \u201cinappropriate lifestyle.\u201d\u00a0 David Buss learned that the State Department was investigating him because of his sexuality.\u00a0 He also learned that other people at State and USAID were going through the same ordeal.\nSo the two Davids invited some of those colleagues over for brunch one weekend back in 1992.\u00a0 They included Bryan Dalton, Danny Hall, Jan Krc, Eric Nelson, John Schneider.\u00a0 That\u2019s how glifaa was born.\nThis story reminds us that powerful moments are often rooted in necessity, but also \u2013 also \u2013 in love, in friendship \u2013 and sometimes brunch.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIt\u2019s a story about who we were but also who we\u2019ve become.\nAnd I just want to thank everyone who has courageously carried forward that legacy, the legacy that glifaa\u2019s founders began all those years ago.\u00a0 We will continue to march together.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-senegalese-foreign-minister-aissata-tall-sall-before-their-meeting-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pleasure to be able to receive my colleague and my friend, the foreign minister of Senegal.\u00a0 Welcome, A\u00efssata, to the State Department.\u00a0 I had a wonderful visit where we spent a lot of time together in Senegal.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had many conversations since then.\nAnd our two countries are strong partners on so many issues based on many shared values.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking forward to continuing the discussions that we started in Dakar last November and things that we\u2019ve been working on since, including at the United Nations.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ll talk about the ways that we can address the growing food security crisis that has been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 This is a very important topic for both of us and for many countries around the world, and we\u2019ve been working concretely on how to address it both in the near term and the longer term.\nSenegal, of course, has been a leader on trying to end the acute phase of COVID-19 and more broadly on global health security.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be talking about that.\u00a0 And of course, we\u2019re partners on security cooperation, on economic prosperity, on dealing with climate change and on resolving regional issues.\nSo there is, as always, a broad agenda, but I\u2019m just particularly pleased to be able to reciprocate for the incredibly warm hospitality but also the incredibly productive visit that I had with you and with President Macky Sall.\nA\u00efssata, welcome.\u00a0 Over to you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TALL SALL:\u00a0 Thanks you so much, Secretary of State.\n(Via interpreter)\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you how delighted I am, me and my delegation, to have this working visit at the State Department, invited by the Secretary of State Mr. Blinken, who, as you reminded us, in last November you were in Dakar in order to strengthen further this wonderful relationship of cooperation between the United States and Senegal.\nOur cooperation is a historical cooperation.\u00a0 It is based on political values, human values, moral values which are our own and which are shared \u2013 democratic values, values of respect for human rights, fundamental values \u2013 freedom, freedom of thought, freedom of acting, freedom to assemble, to choose our political orientation and choose one\u2019s religion, which we respect in Senegal just as is respected wonderfully in the United States.\nThis already is what\u2019s at the basis of the construction of this relationship which is ours.\u00a0 And I was telling the Secretary of State Mr. Blinken last November in Dakar that all secretaries of state of the United States made a visit to Dakar, but his own visit was historical because it was in a double context.\u00a0 The first context is that we had not overcome the pandemic, and he decided in spite of these constraints to come visit to Senegal.\u00a0 This is something that the President Macky Sall, the Government of Senegal, were very much appreciated by the government.\nAnd the second context is that Senegal was the only French-speaking country to benefit from this very first secretary \u2013 visit of the Secretary of State Mr. Blinken in Africa.\u00a0 To us this was a very strong message, a message of friendship but also a message which indicates that we need to work side by side to meet all the challenges that are shaking the world.\u00a0 You \u2013 he said it.\u00a0 There\u2019s this crisis in Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ll talk about it once again.\u00a0 How can we cooperate further?\nSenegal very much appreciated the United States\u2019 support in the fight against COVID-19 as part of COVAX, but also all of the initiatives carried out currently by President Biden to position the world towards democracy and the fight against COVID-19.\nAnd at these very summits \u2013 the Summit for Democracy online, everywhere \u2013 Senegal was there. \u00a0Senegal benefitted at all times of this cooperation and of all of the economic initiatives launched by the United States on behalf of the entire world.\u00a0 USAID is in our country for a very long time, but before that the Peace Corps was already there in 1963, and after that AGOA, and after that MCC, and after that, now today, DPW and then DFC, and after that, and so on and so on.\u00a0 So this is the status of our cooperation at the economic level, alongside our political commitments, alongside the Government of the United States, because we do share the same values that I just mentioned.\nThat\u2019s why, dear Antony, I am very happy to see you once again this morning and to have this working meeting to establish once again a new landmark that will be written in the historical books.\u00a0 I\u2019ve just signed the guest book, and I said this is a very long road, but on a periodical \u2013 once in a while each actor will play their part.\u00a0 And today it\u2019s you for the United States, and myself, humbly, on behalf of Senegal, I do know that we\u2019ll write many more beautiful pages to further deepen the cooperation between our two countries, which are friends.\nThank you very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-a-diplomatic-corps-reception/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemarks at a Diplomatic Corps

Thank you so much.\u00a0 On behalf of myself, my wife Evan Ryan, welcome, welcome, welcome.\u00a0 Welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 Welcome to the Benjamin Franklin Room.\u00a0 It is so good to see this room full again.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a while, and it\u2019s especially so good to see it filled with so many friends and colleagues.\nSo, there\u2019s a saying that a picture is worth a thousand words.\u00a0 Now I\u2019m trying to calculate how many words we\u2019re up to tonight.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But it was really a pleasure to get a chance to at least say hello to every single one of you.\nNow, some of you have been to these receptions many, many times over, with many secretaries of state.\u00a0 The dean of the Diplomatic Corps \u2013 where\u2019s the dean?\u00a0 Ambassador Kyota, where are you?\nAMBASSADOR KYOTA:\u00a0 Right here.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mr. Ambassador, you have served in this role since 1997, the longest serving ambassador to the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, for others, this might be your first time in these Diplomatic Reception Rooms, but welcome to one and all.\u00a0 It really is a pleasure, and more than that a privilege, to host an incredibly distinguished group of diplomats and friends.\u00a0 We\u2019re joined, as I think some of you have seen, by senior officials at the State Department, including our two outstanding deputy secretaries, Wendy Sherman, Brian McKeon.\u00a0 Wendy, Brian, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe have other senior officials from the Biden administration here with us tonight, including our Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, the Acting Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy Alondra Nelson.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for their participation this evening, and it says something important.\nThey\u2019re here and other colleagues are here because now more than ever the broad array of issues that they work on, that we work on, draw upon our relationships with other countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s true across our entire administration.\u00a0 On everything from tech standards to infrastructure to environmental policy to growing a strong workforce, we\u2019re able to do so much more when we do it in partnership with others.\u00a0 That is the foundational premise that President Biden brings to our foreign policy, brings to our diplomacy.\nAnd of course, when it comes to the urgent challenges that we face, whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s trying to build a more equitable global economy, we know this simple truth:\u00a0 No single one of us can do it effectively alone.\u00a0 We need to be working together.\u00a0 We need to build cooperation.\u00a0 We need to strengthen cooperation.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re intent on doing.\nPresident Biden said on day one that our foreign policy would lead with diplomacy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve invested a lot in our bilateral relationships, in our alliances and partnerships, in regional and global institutions, where so much of this vital work takes place.\u00a0 I\u2019m personally grateful to every one of the Diplomatic Corps for taking up this mission with us, doing it together.\nThis is your life\u2019s work.\u00a0 It\u2019s our life\u2019s work.\u00a0 And you know the power of partnership better than anyone on Earth.\u00a0 Your missions here in the United States are dedicated to building stronger ties between our countries, to helping us address differences that arise, to work together on all that brings us together and all that has to bring us together if we\u2019re going to meet the challenges of our time.\nI also want to say that your missions make a huge contribution to the cultural life of our city, Washington, D.C.\u00a0 My wife Evan Ryan was the assistant secretary of state for Educational and Cultural Affairs during the Obama administration here at the State Department.\u00a0 We\u2019re big believers in the power of culture to connect people across languages, across borders, and Washington is uniquely lucky to be home to diplomats from around the world who are helping also to share their countries\u2019 music, art, food, language, history, culture with all of us.\u00a0 This city is so much richer and more interesting for your presence and everything that you do every day, so my thanks to you for that.\nNow, hanging on the wall over there is a portrait of Ben Franklin.\u00a0 He, of course, was America\u2019s very first diplomat.\u00a0 He served on a commission to France, charged with gaining French support for American independence.\u00a0 Sorry, Karen.\u00a0 I know you\u2019re here somewhere.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nNow, if you\u2019re wondering whether he succeeded, there is a desk over in the John Quincy Adams Room where the treaty ending the Revolutionary War was signed in Paris in 1783.\u00a0 Mr. Franklin became something of a pop cultural icon in France, at the time.\u00a0 Images of him wearing a fur cap instead of a wig, like many European dignitaries did, was printed on everything from rings to medallions to snuffboxes.\u00a0 He charmed the French with his wit, with his good humor; he made possible some extraordinary diplomatic feats, including France\u2019s official recognition of the United States as an independent country.\nSo, I think it\u2019s appropriate that he watches over us this evening, because no one knew better than Mr. Franklin the power of personal engagement, relationship building, and simply having a good time together.\u00a0 As he said, and I quote, \u201cBe at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let every new year find you a better [person].\u201d\nSo thank you all for joining us this evening in the spirit of peace, in the spirit of friendship, in the spirit of diplomacy, and welcome again to the State Department.\u00a0 Please, enjoy yourselves.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

Well, good afternoon, everyone.\nIt is wonderful to see everyone here today, particularly for this occasion.\u00a0 Susan, thank you very much, both for the introduction but also for what you\u2019re doing every day to really bring our diplomacy alive, to bring it to new generations of Americans.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for this.\u00a0 It\u2019s a remarkable project and one that we\u2019re fully invested in, so thank you.\nAnd Mr. President, it\u2019s so good to have you again in Washington.\u00a0 We were just in Los Angeles days ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to see you here.\u00a0 It\u2019s an opportunity, in a small way, for us to return the hospitality that you\u2019ve extended to us over this past year and a half, including my own visit to Bogot\u00e1\u00a0last year, and also to celebrate a truly joyous occasion.\u00a0 And maybe we\u2019ll do away with the microphone and I\u2019ll try and project.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The 200th anniversary of our bilateral relations that we\u2019re celebrating today \u2013 I guess we\u2019re giving new meaning to Juneteenth next week as well.\nAnd Mr. President, I really wanted to thank you again publicly, as I just did privately, for not just your participation in the Summit of the Americas, but for Colombia\u2019s leadership in the Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 We got a lot done for the people of our hemisphere over those three days in Los Angeles, and in no small measure because of Colombia\u2019s leadership, including on the migration declaration, which I may say a few additional words about in a few minutes.\u00a0 But that leadership, as always, was invaluable.\u00a0 Our partnership, as always, was invaluable.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful to you, President Biden is grateful to you, for that partnership.\nMr. Ambassador, Ambassador Pinz\u00f3n, friends for a long time \u2013 it\u2019s great to have you here today; other colleagues from across the Government of Colombia:\u00a0 So I know this is only one in a series of events that have been organized to celebrate our 200 years.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to our colleagues from Colombia for actually, in a sense, hosting the event today, co-hosting it with us.\nOur team in Bogot\u00e1 is also extremely active in organizing celebrations in multiple Colombian cities over the coming days.\nAnd finally, let me say to our colleagues who are here from the Colombian and American private sectors:\u00a0 Thank you for being here today; thank you for your work every day to strengthen ties between our countries.\u00a0 The economic bonds that bind us together are strong and growing stronger, and of course, it\u2019s a profound benefit to the people in both of our countries.\nIt is, I think, fitting that we are celebrating today at the National Museum of American Diplomacy.\u00a0 How are we doing?\u00a0 Let\u2019s see.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s a rogue microphone.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nWe have \u2013 and I suspect the president will get into this as well \u2013 a long history of being bound together, even before 1822, when our formal diplomatic relations began.\nFrom 1806 to 1807, Simon Bol\u00edvar spent six months in the United States traveling the East Coast from Charleston, South Carolina, up to cities along the coast, before, of course, leading the independence movement in South America.\nBeyond history, we, of course, have been and continue to be enriched immeasurably by Colombia\u2019s culture \u2013 the magical realism of Garcia Marquez, the art of Botero, the music of Shakira.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Colombia is said to be the land of a thousand rhythms; I suspect Shakira is responsible for 999.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut to the point that Susan made \u2013 and I think it\u2019s really important \u2013 this is a relationship that has remained strong over 200 years, even in the most challenging times, and that speaks volumes.\u00a0 A few decades ago, Colombia\u2019s entire future was on the line, under assault from drug cartels and insurgent groups.\u00a0 Conflict ravaged the nation.\u00a0 Many Colombians endured violence or lived in fear of it.\u00a0 And of course, at that time huge unemployment as well, economic difficulties.\nWe came together \u2013 the United States and Colombia \u2013 and I see leaders of that effort in this room today.\u00a0 We undertook Plan Colombia.\u00a0 We ended half a century campaign to topple the Colombian Government, as well as a war that killed more than 200,000 people.\u00a0 Plan Colombia became Peace Colombia, and though many issues remain, Colombia has expanded access to education, to jobs, other social services in its rural areas, and to the country\u2019s underserved communities, including Indigenous and Afro Colombian communities; reformed land laws; established institutions like the disappeared persons unit.\u00a0 Much work remains, but it is a remarkable thing, especially at a time of so much challenge around the world, to see the commitment \u2013 the enduring commitment \u2013 that Colombia has made to peace and progress.\nLast month, we saw the strength of democracy in action.\u00a0 I think you had the highest turnout for the first round of presidential elections in memory.\u00a0 Regardless of the results, the United States looks forward to working with the next administration to continue the progress that\u2019s underway and the relationship that generations of our officials and our people have built together.\nLet me just say a few words before turning it over to the president.\nWe are deepening our economic ties.\u00a0 Last month marked the 10-year anniversary of the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement that has helped double U.S. agricultural exports to Colombia, while making the United States the top importer of agricultural goods from Colombia.\nLast week in Los Angeles, at the Summit of the Americas, President Biden announced the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.\u00a0 We will work closely with countries across the region, including Colombia, to remove barriers to investment, to accelerate economic growth across our hemisphere, while ensuring that the gains of growth are more equitable \u2013 because we know that even as our economies grow, so have gaps between the rich and poor, and we\u2019re determined to address that.\nWe\u2019re advancing our shared security together.\u00a0 Our partnership over the years has allowed U.S.\u00a0 and Colombian security forces to work together.\u00a0 Ambassador Pinz\u00f3n and I worked on this some years ago.\u00a0 We now see the benefits in the work Colombian security forces are doing to train others throughout the hemisphere.\u00a0 Colombia has become an exporter of security in our hemisphere, and that matters.\u00a0 The recent designation of Colombia with President Duque as a Major Non-NATO Ally will enhance this cooperation by helping our militaries work even closer together in the years ahead.\nAnd this partnership, besides being a bilateral partnership, besides being a regional partnership, is increasingly a global partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together on global challenges, like the climate crisis.\u00a0 We see the stakes of this in Colombia\u2019s extraordinary natural beauty, from the snow-capped mountains in Los Nevados to the tropical rain forests in the south.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together to protect these and other diverse ecosystems across the country \u2013 for example, through Amazonia Connect, also announced at the Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 This initiative will work to reduce deforestation across the Amazon \u2013 the lungs of the hemisphere, and an unmatched source of biodiversity.\nIn my visit to Bogot\u00e1 last year, I had a chance to talk to a group of young Colombians, who asked me about several other areas where our countries work together, from creating safe pathways for migration to promoting understanding through culture and education.\nSo I had one conversation with someone from a much younger generation \u2013 and a much more talented musical background.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Juan Carlos Mindinero is an Afro Colombian musician from Tumaco who told me about his work using music to promote peace and to address some of the most difficult issues in his community, like racism. \u00a0His work reminded me in so many ways of the songs of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, which played such a key role in inspiring and mobilizing ordinary people to act.\nAnd when it comes down to it, that is really one of the most beautiful things about democracy: ordinary citizens confronting the toughest challenges that we face out in the open.\u00a0 And ultimately, these dedicated citizens are what give me the most optimism for the future of the relationship between Colombia and the United States.\u00a0 People who believe in the bonds between our countries, who stand ready to continue to grow them, to make their own governments and the relationship between them even better, even stronger, in the years ahead.\u00a0 That\u2019s what really drives this.\nSo let me simply say to everyone present, because in various ways virtually everyone here has been involved in this relationship, thank you for the commitment to this work.\u00a0 And simply put, Mr. President, friends and colleagues, here is to the continued friendship between Colombia and the United States.\u00a0 We could ask for no better partner, no better friend in the world.\nMr. President, over to you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT DUQUE:\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor for me to be here at the State Department and especially at the Diplomacy Center.\u00a0 Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken, for your words, for your friendship, for your permanent support to Colombia.\u00a0 Susan, thank you so much for having us today.\u00a0 Ambassador Pinz\u00f3n, Dr. Mar\u00eda Paula Correa.\u00a0 My also special greetings to the panelists that we\u2019re going to have this afternoon.\u00a0 Maureen, thank you.\u00a0 Joseph, Luis Alberto, and Marie Arana, a great writer who has written a lot about Latin America\u2019s history.\u00a0 I also want to express my salute to the former ambassadors from the United States to Colombia.\u00a0 Speaker Boehner, it\u2019s great to have you here with us.\nAnd I would love to express, Mr. Secretary, that we feel very honored of this 200 years celebration.\u00a0 It has been 200 years of our relationship that has been driven by values, by common purpose, and obviously by principles.\u00a0 And I would like to make some references of a historical nature.\u00a0 The first one is that the flag that I have behind me \u2013 yellow, blue, and red \u2013 was designed by Francisco de Miranda.\u00a0 Francisco de Miranda designed that flag, and Francisco de Miranda, who has to always be considered as one of our founding fathers, was very close to General Lafayette, and he was pretty much inspired by the founding fathers of the United States.\u00a0 He was approached later in time by the leaders of the Liberty Society of Caracas to come back and fight for liberty.\u00a0 But before that, in 1807, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar departed from the Port of C\u00e1diz and he was coming to the Americas with the idea of fighting for liberty.\u00a0 But instead of going directly to La Guaira that was the common trip that he would have made, he decided to stop in Charleston.\u00a0 And he remained in the United States for a few months, and it was during Thomas Jefferson\u2019s mandate.\nAbout that trip, there are no important documents about what happened to Bol\u00edvar, with the exception that he ran out of money and his brother had to send some money, finding a carrier.\u00a0 But what is interesting is that years after, there was this amazing letter that Bol\u00edvar wrote to a Jamaican diplomat.\u00a0 And this has been recalled also by Professor John Lynch.\u00a0 And he said in the letter, \u201cDuring my short stay in the United States, I tasted the flavor of liberal democracy.\u201d\u00a0 Those were major words that also inspired Bol\u00edvar.\u00a0 And he fought for independence.\u00a0 We got our independence in 1819.\u00a0 Then he fought in the Venezuelan territory against Tom\u00e1s Boves.\u00a0 He finally also built the independence of Venezuela.\u00a0 And then he started the southern campaign.\nBut at the time when he started the southern campaign, he called for a former Spaniard that had turned himself into a New Granadan and a Colombian, Manuel Trujillo y Torres, to be appointed as a representative to the United States of America.\u00a0 He came to Washington.\u00a0 He was a very clever guy.\u00a0 He had this capacity to speak eloquently.\u00a0 And he started knocking everybody\u2019s doors in order to make the case for the recognition of Colombia by the United States of America.\u00a0 People who knew him describe him as the Colombian Franklin.\u00a0 And there are few historical records about him, and it is very common that he is always referred with that phrase.\u00a0 He was a Renaissance man, and he was a very persuasive man.\nHe got to constitute a very powerful friendship with John Quincy Adams, who was the secretary of state at the time.\u00a0 And he made such a strong case for the recognition that John Quincy Adams approached President Monroe, and President Monroe in 1822 signed the recognition of\u00a0la Gran Colombia, becoming the first former Spanish colony to be recognized as a state by the United States of America.\u00a0 And Manuel Trujillo y Torres was a big fan of Thomas Jefferson.\u00a0 He always mentioned that that great inscription in the Declaration of Independence, to \u201chold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\u201d became a mantra that also inspired the abolition of slavery in our countries.\nSince then, this relationship has always been stronger and stronger.\u00a0 And we remember always the first visit that a U.S. president did to Colombia, and it was FDR, who came to Cartagena.\u00a0 Then we also remember President Kennedy\u2019s visit to Colombia, when he launched the Alliance for Progress with his good friend, Alberto Lleras Camargo.\u00a0 We remember Ronald Reagan\u2019s visit to President Betancourt; President Bush 41, his visit to Colombia, where he also met with President Barco in the city of Cartagena.\u00a0 We remember the visit that President Clinton made to Colombia.\u00a0 And we also remember how, in times of despair, the United States came to us and said:\u00a0 We will support you.\u00a0 And that\u2019s how Plan Colombia was built.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very glad to see here Ambassador Pickering, who was also an architect of Plan Colombia.\nAt the time when Plan Colombia was approved, Colombia was considered at the brink of becoming a failed state.\u00a0 Twenty years after this policy that has been bipartisan and bicameral, Colombia has become the 37th member of the OECD.\u00a0 And that just clearly speaks about how this diplomatic effort, based on values and principles, has been able to change our diplomacy.\nAnd also, after Plan Colombia, President Bush 43 decided to move forward the free trade agreement between Colombia and the United States.\u00a0 Speaker Boehner, we remember all the big efforts in Congress, how this also became a bipartisan, bicameral effort.\u00a0 And it has opened many opportunities for us.\nThen, during President Obama\u2019s administration, we got strong support from the United States in multiple fronts.\u00a0 We also finalized the putting in practice of the free trade agreement, and it marked a very important era for us.\u00a0 I remember as president how President Trump supported us in the midst of the pandemic, and how he also supported us to face the situation of the migrants in the border zone.\u00a0 And I have to express to you, Secretary Blinken, and to President Biden, my gratitude because you have saved millions of lives.\u00a0 You have become the largest donor of vaccines to Colombia in the midst of this pandemic.\u00a0 You have opened the accessibility of products to the United States like no other time before.\u00a0 And we have been able to work on climate action, the protection of the Amazon, the protection of the migrants \u2013 and it all came together in multiple ways.\nFirst, bringing our diplomatic relations to the highest peak ever by declaring Colombia a strategic non-NATO member ally, which means Colombia is today among the few countries that have that kind of recognition.\u00a0 But also, being able to work along, as we did last week in Los Angeles, in two major policies: the migration declaration of L.A., which out of the complex noise that we have on permanent politics is one of the most important statements ever in a summit to describe by all ourselves that we need to treat migration with a sense of fraternity, as we have done when 1.8 million Venezuelan brothers and sisters, Ambassador Vecchio \u2013 one million already have their TPS cards in their hands.\nAnd the other very important statement \u2013 the launching of the economic prosperity framework by President Biden.\u00a0 This can become as important as the Alliance for Progress because it can bring investment back to the Americas, thinking on the opportunities that we have with North America; and it can be an effective deterrent of migration driven by lack of opportunities.\u00a0 This will open opportunities for many Latin Americans.\u00a0 And we also believe that it\u2019s an opportunity to bring U.S. investment back in issues such as infrastructure, 5G networks, renewable energies, among many others.\nSo I consider that what we built last week was very important, and I feel proud that we were very much cohesive, the countries that participated.\u00a0 And we remembered that if there were reasons why some countries were not there, it\u2019s because in 2001, when we signed the Inter-American Democratic Charter, we also signed the Protocol of Quebec.\u00a0 That protocol established that the summits are not spaces for dictatorships, and that will never be a space for dictatorships.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo, Mr. Secretary, I feel so honored that today we\u2019re celebrating these 200 years of this relationship in a very special day that I want to bring to your attention.\u00a0 It was in June 15, 1952, that Colombian troops entered South Korea.\u00a0 Colombia was the only Latin American country that participated in the Korean War, and we came with a contingent of more than 5,000 troops, which can be called \u2013 Ambassador Pinz\u00f3n, who\u2019s a military expert, has said that it could have been more than 40 percent of the Colombian army at the time.\u00a0 And those soldiers came there hand by hand to participate with the United States in saving the South Korean democracy.\u00a0 And no country would have done that if it wasn\u2019t because we share those values, those objectives, and those purposes.\nI believe that this celebration is an opportunity for keep on strengthening our ties, and we will remain the most important ally for the United States in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 We will continue to differentiate ourselves, by embracing democracy, with autocracies \u2013 with pleasure \u2013 and we will also remain united to protect those in need, especially the migrant communities in our country that have left the horrible impact of the Maduro dictatorship.\nSecretary Blinken, you have been a friend of Colombia, you are a friend of Colombia, and I want to express my gratitude to all the diplomatic corps of the U.S. State Department here today.\u00a0 You have to always see the relationship between Colombia with the United States as an example of what bipartisan, bicameral policies can do and what bipartisan diplomacy can do.\u00a0 I definitely want to express to each one of you, thank you for doing so much for our country.\nAnd with your permission, Secretary Blinken, I would love to close my remarks by asking Ambassador Tom Pickering to join us here to impose him the 200 years condecoration to celebrate this 200 years anniversary between Colombia and the United States for \u2013 (applause) \u2013 to an example of one of the greatest minds in U.S. diplomacy.\u00a0 You have been an ambassador in many places around the world, in complex scenarios, Dr. Pickering, but as the president of Colombia, we have to thank you for being one of the brightest minds who created Plan Colombia, and we can say that because of Plan Colombia, we are today in a much better shape in a country of law and order and opportunities.\nAnd I\u2019ll finish by saying the following:\u00a0 In my last four years, I have been honored with being the president of my country, fighting every day for the good of our people.\u00a0 We passed a pandemic.\u00a0 Out of 48 months of my administration, 30 months will be facing a pandemic.\u00a0 But we\u2019re leaving Colombia with the highest growth ever, with the lowest multidimensional poverty ever reached by Colombia, with the lowest job informality rate, being a country that delivers on an energy transition, and a country that is considered today one of the most important places for start-ups in the region.\u00a0 Obviously, we still have challenges, but none of the things that we have achieved \u2013 would have not been achieved without the support of an ally such as the United States of America.\nSo Ambassador Pickering, I\u2019m going to impose this condecoration.\u00a0 I invite Secretary Blinken to join me here.\n(A decree was read.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-covid-19-global-action-plan-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken At the COVID-19 Global Action Plan Meeting\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Loy Henderson Auditorium", "location": "Washington, D.C. ", "date": "June 15, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Good to see you all here.\u00a0 When I heard everyone was gathering here, I thought the least I could do is drop by to simply say thank you, thank you, thank you for the remarkable work that you\u2019re doing.\nYou all know this, but four months ago our countries created the Global Action Plan to try to accelerate our efforts to vaccinate 70 percent of our people against COVID-19, the goal set by the WHO.\u00a0 I think we all knew that hitting that target would take countries stepping up together in a highly coordinated way.\u00a0 So we identified key gaps that remained, we established together six lines of effort to bridge those gaps, and then everyone in this room in effect took responsibility for leading this effort and doing it together.\nAnd as we\u2019ve talked, and I know as you\u2019re discussing today, we have made significant progress on each of these lines of effort.\u00a0 A lot more work remains to be done, but this is moving forward precisely because we\u2019ve come together in a coordinated way.\nThe first line of effort: trying to get more shots into arms.\u00a0 We know that there are a lot of vaccines out there.\u00a0 The challenge has been actually getting the shots into arms.\u00a0 We\u2019ve ramped up vaccine delivery.\u00a0 We\u2019ve improved cold chain capacity to store and ship more doses to more places.\u00a0 We\u2019ve conducted in-country campaigns to increase demand for vaccines.\nFor example, just to cite a few:\u00a0 Colombia has stepped up its efforts to vaccinate Venezuelan refugees; India has enhanced its vaccine production; Japan has significantly expanded cold chain storage worldwide; Australia, New Zealand are doing great work vaccinating citizens in the Pacific Island nations, just to cite some of the striking examples.\nTo that end, one of the things I\u2019m excited to be able to share today is that the United States, in partnership with COVAX, will begin donating pediatric Pfizer vaccines for 5-to-12 year-olds.\u00a0 In fact, the first shipment is going out today:\u00a0 300,000 doses are being donated to Mongolia; 2.2 million doses are being donated to Nepal.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got many more ready to go for countries that want them.\nThe second line of effort that we\u2019ve all been working on together: strengthening supply chains for COVID-related materials \u2013 tests, syringes, treatments.\u00a0 Well, we are building resilience into the supply chains when shortages and disruptions emerge.\u00a0 For example, the European Union has been consulting with businesses across Africa on medical supplies.\u00a0 The United States has started similar engagements in our own hemisphere as well as globally.\nThe third line of effort: addressing information gaps that lead to low confidence in vaccines. With help from Canada, we\u2019re coordinating across governments to combat misinformation and disinformation, as well as through programs like the United States Global VAX effort, which uses evidence-based interventions to increase vaccine demand.\nThe fourth line of effort that we\u2019ve been working together: providing more support to frontline health care workers.\u00a0 Well, with leadership from Spain, from India, the Republic of Korea, we\u2019re ensuring that those workers have access to vaccines as well as accurate information about vaccines so that they can stay healthy and keep doing the heroic work that they\u2019re doing every day.\nThe fifth line of effort:\u00a0 We\u2019ve begun a critical conversation on how to increase access to treatments and therapeutics so that people who get COVID can survive it and bounce back faster.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot more work we\u2019ll need to do on this line of effort to ensure that we have enough interventions available worldwide, from testing to treating, as we move to the next phase of the pandemic.\nAnd finally, the sixth line of effort: building a stronger, more effective global health architecture so that we can better detect, prevent, respond to future emergencies.\u00a0 Well, we started by building on the work of the structures that we created to address this pandemic \u2013 COVAX, the ACT-Accelerator.\u00a0 And I particularly want to thank Norway and South Africa for coordinating the ACT-A\u2019s work to develop and equitably distribute tests, treatments, vaccines; Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan for galvanizing donors; Indonesia for creating a financial intermediary fund for pandemic preparedness.\nI know that we all agree around this table and in this room that if we\u2019re just as vulnerable at the end of this pandemic as we were when COVID-19 began, that\u2019s dangerous and it\u2019s a major disservice to our citizens.\u00a0 We have to seize this opportunity to become better prepared than we were before.\nLooking ahead, the lines of effort that we\u2019re all working, the six lines of effort, remain critical.\u00a0 In many ways this is a marathon.\u00a0 We still have a long way to go if we\u2019re going to end the acute phase of the pandemic and build a lasting foundation for our future.\nTo do that, perhaps more than anything else, we have to maintain our commitment.\u00a0 We can\u2019t let the pandemic and pandemic fatigue deplete our political will.\u00a0 And I just want to assure you all that the United States continues to be intently focused on fighting the pandemic and leaving the world better prepared and better defended for whatever comes next.\nThis experience, this pandemic, has taught us that health security is national security \u2013 and that in this 21st century, health emergencies often can\u2019t be solved by countries working on their own.\u00a0 Viruses don\u2019t respect borders.\u00a0 We are, quite literally, all in this together.\u00a0 And so I\u2019m really grateful to everyone here, to the countries you represent, for this partnership.\u00a0 The progress we\u2019ve made to date has been possible because of your leadership, because of your engagement, because of your willingness to coordinate and collaborate to what I think is a remarkable degree.\u00a0 Now we just need to keep doing it.\nSo thank you.\u00a0 I hope the meetings here in Washington are productive, I hope they\u2019re energizing, and I look forward to seeing everyone again soon to review our progress, strengthen our efforts, and keep up this common fight.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-republic-of-korea-foreign-minister-park-jin-at-a-joint-press-availability/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken And Republic of Korea Foreign Minister Park Jin At a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Office of the Spokesperson", "audience": "Benjamin Franklin Room", "location": "Washington, D.C. ", "date": "June 13, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Good afternoon, everyone, and to Foreign Minister Park \u2013 Jin \u2013 to you, to your entire delegation from the Republic of Korea, welcome to the State Department. And I must say, it\u2019s also wonderful to see my friend the ambassador newly arrived in Washington here with us as well.\nBefore I jump into talking about the extremely productive meeting that we had, let me just say just a few words about the Summit of the Americas that we just wrapped up in Los Angeles at the end of last week. As I think we saw in the many positive statements from leaders coming out of Los Angeles, this was a substantive and successful event that laid the foundation for enhanced regional cooperation.\nCountries made significant and concrete commitments on a whole range of issues that directly shape the lives of the people in our respective countries \u2013 from training 500,000 healthcare workers, to turbo-charging the transition to clean energy, to building a more inclusive digital economy, to forging the first truly regional approach to migration in the Los Angeles Declaration. Our conversations were intense and intensive; our goals are ambitious. And now, of course, the work begins to turn what was agreed in Los Angeles into reality, to making those commitments concrete and real, and I have no doubt that all the engagement that happened in Los Angeles will pave the way to do just that.\nHere today, this is the foreign minister\u2019s first visit to Washington in his new role, and it comes quickly on the heels of the summit between President Yoon and President Biden in Seoul a few weeks ago. As President Biden said then and there, the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States has never been stronger, it\u2019s never been more vibrant, it\u2019s never been more vital. Our discussion today reflected the full breadth and depth of this partnership, as did Deputy Secretary Sherman\u2019s meetings in Seoul earlier this month. We probably could have gone on for another couple of hours covering the world as we were.\nNow, we can\u2019t also forget the other very notable meeting between our countries recently: BTS visiting the White House. (Laughter.) For the \u201cBTS Army\u201d in America, it was a thrilling day. And I have to tell you \u2013 some of you may have noticed this \u2013 I had another K-pop moment myself a few weeks ago when I was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. As we arrived at the Late Show, there was a huge crowd at the backstage door. And for a minute, I have to admit I thought, well, maybe they\u2019re here to see me. No, there was a K-pop group Twice that was also on the show that night. That\u2019s why they were there. And by the way, they were terrific.\nSo there\u2019s no question that the ties between our countries are strong and incredibly broad as well. And through this alliance \u2013 founded in shared sacrifice, deepened over nearly 70 years \u2013 our countries are taking on urgent challenges and also seizing opportunities together.\nSo to name just a few of the issues that we talked about in some detail today, first, we are coordinating closely with each other on the threat posed by the DPRK\u2019s unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The recent increase in Pyongyang\u2019s ballistic missile testing has raised tension throughout the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. We continue to seek the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And let me emphasize that the United States has absolutely no hostile intent toward the DPRK. We\u2019re open to dialogue without preconditions. We want to support the people of North Korea, including with COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 indeed, we have offered our help consistently throughout the pandemic, and again during the awful surge they are now enduring, which comes on top of severe economic and humanitarian crises. Our goal, simply put, is a peaceful and stable region and world. Until the regime in Pyongyang changes course, we will continue to keep the pressure on.\nJust as important as what we\u2019re doing is how we\u2019re doing it: together, together with the international community. For example, a few weeks ago, the United Nations Security Council voted 13-2 to impose stronger sanctions on the DPRK in the wake of unprecedented \u2013 an unprecedented number of provocative missile tests, including with ICBMs. All \u2013 all \u2013 the non-permanent members voted for the resolution. Only China and Russia opposed it.\nAnd with Japan and the Republic of Korea, two of our closest allies, we are working trilaterally to address the threat posed by the DPRK and to tackle other pressing regional challenges, including, for example, restoring Burma to a democratic path, supporting ASEAN, accelerating women\u2019s empowerment. All this work is grounded in our shared values as democracies and our shared commitment to human rights. And the United States is committed to helping our partners work through challenges in their relationship, which is in the collective interest of the region and of people in all three countries.\nSecond, we are working very closely with the Republic of Korea and other partners to develop the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which our countries launched together in Tokyo last month along with 11 others. This will put in place a robust foundation for strong and sustainable economic growth across an incredibly dynamic region. Our countries share a commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific where innovation flourishes, supply chains are secure, labor and environment standards are high, and the rules of the road give workers and businesses from all countries an equal chance to compete and to succeed.\nThe bilateral economic relationship between the Republic of Korea and the United States is one of the strongest in the world. We\u2019re your second-largest trading partner; you\u2019re our sixth-largest. We\u2019re the second-largest investor in your economy; you invest more in the United States than you do in any other country. In so many ways, we are profoundly linked together through our economics.\nSamsung is building a semiconductor factory in Texas, which will create thousands of jobs here in the United States. Hyundai has announced more than $11 billion in new investments in American manufacturing, including a new electric vehicle plant and battery factory in Georgia that will, again, create thousands of jobs. These partnerships between leading global Korean companies and American workers and communities will yield benefits for both of our countries and bring us even closer together.\nThird, we are standing together on global security challenges, including President Putin\u2019s unprovoked war on Ukraine. Since the war began in February, the Republic of Korea has coordinated sanctions and export controls alongside the United States and other allies and partners. It\u2019s taken steps to help stabilize energy markets. It\u2019s offered significant economic and humanitarian support to the government and people of Ukraine. We will discuss these and other issues in depth later this month when President Yoon joins the NATO summit in Madrid, together with other allies and partners from the Indo-Pacific region.\nAcross these and other issues, the Republic of Korea and the United States are united. We\u2019re working together to promote peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. We\u2019re connected by people-to-people ties going back generations, including nearly 40,000 Korean students who came to the United States in the last academic year \u2013 more per capita than from any other country. Foreign Minister Park earned degrees from not one but two American universities; he knows the power of these exchanges. So do we.\nIn the 140 years since our countries established diplomatic relations, we\u2019ve grown closer in every conceivable way. Under President Yoon\u2019s administration, that is sure to continue, especially as the ROK assumes its vital role as a global, pivotal state.\nSo, Jin, thank you again for being here in Washington. Thank you for the very, very good conversation between us and between our teams. A lot ahead of ahead of us, but for today it\u2019s wonderful to have you here. Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK: Well, thank you, Tony, for the warm welcome and the incredible hospitality. I would also like to thank your excellent team at the State Department for their work in preparing today\u2019s meeting.\nMy first official order of business after arriving in Washington, D.C. yesterday was to lay a wreath at the Korean War Memorial and pay tribute to the heroic U.S. soldiers who sacrificed for freedom. While there, I had a chance to meet with American families visiting the memorial, and was pleased to learn that the families were proud descendants of the Korean War veterans, Army soldiers and Marines who have passed away. I think they were pleasantly surprised to see the Korean foreign minister there.\nToday, Secretary Blinken and I had a very productive and comprehensive dialogue over lunch on a wide range of shared agenda. I\u2019m also pleased I had this opportunity to get to know Secretary Blinken on a personal level.\nToday\u2019s meeting takes place at an especially critical moment. First, it comes on the heels of the successful summit meeting between President Yoon and President Biden three weeks ago in Seoul, where they reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the alliance. Secretary Blinken and I discussed ways to build on the strong momentum created by the summit so early in President Yoon\u2019s term and to promptly implement the agreements reached by our two presidents.\nSecond, our alliance is confronting increasingly complex challenges, including destabilizing actions by North Korea, the war in Ukraine, ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, food and energy crisis, climate change, and others. As allies that share core values such as democracy and human rights, Korea and the United States are natural partners for tackling these tasks. This is what we mean when we commit to developing a truly global, comprehensive strategic alliance.\nSecretary Blinken and I also share our assessments on the series of recent missile launches by North Korea, as well as prospects of further provocations. We affirmed that any North Korean provocations, including a nuclear test, will be met with a united and firm response from our alliance and the international community. We expressed special concern over North Korea\u2019s increasingly aggressive rhetoric regarding the use of tactical nuclear weapons, and we agreed that North Korea issue is one of the top policy priorities for the United States and the Republic of Korea. Pyongyang\u2019s continuous provocations will only lead to strengthened deterrence of the alliance and stronger international sanctions measures.\nWith a shared understanding of the importance of extended deterrence, Secretary Blinken and I agreed on the early reactivation of the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group as a follow-up to the summit meeting in May. The EDSCG will serve as a timely and effective mechanism to discuss concrete extended deterrence measures as well as to send North Korea a firm message.\nWe also discussed concrete ways to close the loopholes in the implementation of existing sanctions as well as ways to further strengthen the sanctions regime. At the same time, we have been very clear that we remain committed to dialogue and diplomacy. We are prepared to take a more flexible and open-minded approach to diplomacy vis-\u00e0-vis North Korea. We seek dialogue with North Korea without preconditions. We urge North Korea to cease destabilizing actions and return to dialogue.\nWe also reaffirmed our willingness to provide COVID-19-related humanitarian assistance to North Korea irrespective of political considerations. We hope that Pyongyang will respond positively to this offer. The 21st century U.S.-ROK alliance is about more than the security terms, security realm. It is now an economic security alliance and a tech alliance. Korea, as a global pivotal state, or GPS, stands ready to assume a more active role in advancing freedom, peace, and democracy around the globe.\nToday, Secretary Blinken and I spent significant time discussing ways to address complex economic challenges so that the United States and Korea can work hand in glove to benefit our business cooperations and better the lives of our citizens in tangible ways. We also discussed addressing the all-important global supply chain issue. I expressed Korea\u2019s full support for the upcoming ministerial on global supply chain resilience to be co-hosted by Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo. Our two countries will also engage at the expert working level to strengthen supply chain early warning systems so that we can prevent damaging disruptions. Additionally, we discussed ways to scale up civil nuclear cooperation regarding partnership in overseas nuclear markets and small modular reactors.\nSecretary Blinken and I reiterate our commitment to strengthening efforts for a swift conclusion of the war and restoration of peace in Ukraine. Korea stands with the United States and the international community against Russia\u2019s illegal actions.\nWe also acknowledged the importance of maintaining a prosperous and peaceful Indo-Pacific. I shared Korea\u2019s plan to formulate our own Indo-Pacific strategy which would implement our global pivotal state across the region. Secretary Blinken welcomed Korea\u2019s initiative to embrace greater regional and global responsibilities.\nI also expressed Korea\u2019s desire to work closely with the United States and other partners to develop the IPEF, or IPEF, into an open, transparent, and inclusive platform for promoting peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. We work forward \u2013 we look forward to engaging in discussions to flesh out the four pillars.\nAfter today\u2019s meeting, I could not be more confident that our alliance is stronger than it has ever been. Once again, I would like to thank Tony for today\u2019s productive discussions and look forward to working closely with him as close partners. We are on the same page on many issues.\nI hope to see you in Seoul again \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK: \u2014 to continue these important talks and to reciprocate your warm welcome. Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.\nMR PRICE: We\u2019ll now turn to questions. We\u2019ll start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP.\nQUESTION: Hi, good afternoon, Mr. Secretary. I was going to ask about BTS, but he already addressed it, so could I ask you both to follow up on North Korea? You both mentioned the possibility of a nuclear test. How concerned are you at this point about that happening? You both said that the United States and the Republic of Korea are willing to meet without preconditions. Does that offer still stand even if they go ahead with the nuclear test?\nAnd if I can ask another issue that affects both countries, Iran. Foreign Minister Park, there has been a longstanding row with Iran over frozen funds. Do you believe that that\u2019s any closer to resolution? And Mr. Secretary, regarding Iran\u2019s actions last week regarding the IAEA, do you still see hope for diplomacy? Where do you see things standing now? Are you hopeful of resuming something at some point? Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. Jin, I\u2019m happy to start if you \u2013\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK: Go ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So with regard to, Shaun, to a nuclear test, we remain concerned about the prospects for what would be a seventh nuclear test over multiple administrations. We know that the North Koreans have done preparations for such a test. We are being extremely vigilant about that. We\u2019re in very close touch with our close allies and partners, starting with the Republic of Korea, also with Japan and others, to be able to respond quickly should the North Koreans proceed with such a test.\nI can say simply for today that we\u2019re preparing for all contingencies, again in very close coordination with others, notably with the ROK and with Japan. And we are prepared to make both short and longer-term adjustments to our military posture, as appropriate.\nA nuclear test would be dangerous. It would be deeply destabilizing to the region. It would blatantly violate international law set out in multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. So we urge the DPRK to refrain from further destabilizing activity. We call on the DPRK to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy. And indeed, in that regard we are prepared, as we have been, to proceed with no preconditions. And as I said earlier and I\u2019ll repeat now, we have no hostile intent toward the DPRK. But our efforts to engage without preconditions thus far have not been met with a response from the DPRK. In fact, the only response we\u2019ve seen thus far has been this multiplicity of missile tests, including ICBMs.\nWith regard to the JCPOA \u2013 and we\u2019ve spoken to this repeatedly in recent days \u2013 a lot of work went into seeing if we could return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA, working with the European Union, working with European partners, working as well with China and Russia over the past year or more. And it is fundamentally up to Iran to decide whether or not it wishes to re-engage in that agreement because the work in terms of re-engaging in that agreement has for the most part been completed. But what we\u2019ve seen is Iran continuing to try to inject extraneous issues into the conversation, into the negotiation, that simply have no place there. So they have to decide, and decide very quickly, if they wish to proceed with what has been negotiated and which could be completed quickly if Iran chose to do so.\nSeparately but relatedly, of course, are Iran\u2019s obligations under the nonproliferation regime to its commitments to the IAEA, including commitments that it has dodged for a long period of time, to the point where it was important for the IAEA to express, through the resolution of the Board of Governors, its deep concern with Iran\u2019s failure to comply. Now Iran has taken steps in response to the IAEA that make things even more challenging, including a return to the JCPOA as it, for example, pulls cameras out of places where the IAEA had them placed for monitoring.\nOne of the great benefits of the JCPOA was the most comprehensive and complete monitoring and inspections regime of any arms control agreement yet put in place. If the Iranians are dismantling that at the same time, then I think that makes the possibilities of return to compliance even more \u2013 more remote. So fundamentally, it\u2019s up to Iran, and we\u2019ll see quickly, I would imagine, what it proposes to do by its actions. And the actions that we\u2019ve seen are not encouraging.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK: I think that North Korea has now finished the preparation for another nuclear test, and I think only political decision has to be made. If North Korea ventures into another nuclear test, then I think that it will only strengthen our deterrence and also international sanctions. It will only isolate North Korea from the international community. And certainly, we need to push for a new UN Security Council resolution to deal with North Korea\u2019s provocation as we have discussed today. So the lesson that North Korea should learn is that the more provocations they make, the more isolated they will become, and in fact it will undermine its own national security.\nWith regard to Iran, we want to have a mutually beneficial relationship, although we have some obstacles of frozen funds. Korea will discuss it with Iran and also with the United States. And in terms of JCPOA negotiations, we hope that this issue can be resolved as soon as possible, and if that happens then I think that these obstacles could be fixed as well. So we need more diplomacy and dialogue with Iran in order that we can have a positive result out of the negotiations on the nuclear issue.\nMR PRICE: We\u2019ll turn to Park Hyunyoung with JoongAng Ilbo.\nQUESTION: Thank you for this opportunity. Secretary Blinken and Minister Park, you didn\u2019t mention to what extent the U.S. would provide extended deterrence to South Korea. With North Korea expected to conduct its nuclear test and becoming more and more capable with its weapons program, would you agree that extended deterrence is one of the most realistic solutions to protect the Korean Peninsula? And could you give us more detail on what U.S. and ROK agreed upon and if you have a time schedule to reactivate the Extended Deterrence Strategy Consultation Group, the EDSCG?\nAnd my second question is that the new South Korean Government vowed to strengthen U.S.-ROK alliance beyond military alliance that has been the core of the relationship for decades. Closer alignment with U.S. policies and deepening economic and security ties like joining the IPEF with the U.S. could potentially make South Korea\u2019s relationship with China suffer, like what happened when U.S. missile defense system was deployed to South Korea in 2017. So if this happens again \u2013 Chinese bullying or economic punishment \u2013 what can Koreans expect from the Biden administration? Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Happy to start again, Jin. Thank you very much. First, it\u2019s very simple: the United States is committed to extended deterrence, and that commitment will also take the form of, as we\u2019ve discussed, re-establishing the Extended Deterrence Group, the working group, and my expectation, I think the minister\u2019s expectation, is that that will get up and working very, very soon in the weeks ahead. So that\u2019s something we discussed. I won\u2019t go into any further detail on the substance, but I can tell you that we\u2019re committed to extended deterrence and we\u2019re committed to restarting the work of this group in the weeks ahead.\nWith regard to the second part of your question, the relationships that we have around the world are not designed to be zero-sum when it comes to China. For example, we\u2019re not about decoupling the economic and investment relationship between other countries and China or, for that matter, our own. On the contrary, we see tremendous value in those relationships. But there are certain aspects of the \u2013 just to cite the example of the trade and economic relationship \u2013 that are very important and that we discussed today. One is that I think for many countries, the lack of reciprocity in the economic and trade relationship is both unacceptable and unsustainable. That is, China imposes conditions and does things to our companies and businesspeople engaged in trade and investment in China that we do not impose on them, and that simply can\u2019t last. And I think you\u2019re seeing countries around the world come together on that proposition.\nSimilarly, even as we support trade investment and even as we do not seek to decouple our economies, there are certain very specific aspects of our economies that are of strategic importance or that have a security implication where we have to be very vigilant because there is no distinction between Chinese companies and the Chinese state. Indeed, under Chinese law, companies that engage in investment and business are required, at the request of the government, to share any information that they\u2019ve acquired as a result of these economic relationships with Beijing. And that presents, in certain areas, something that we have to be very vigilant about because it could become a security or strategic issue.\nSo that\u2019s the nature of the conversation. But more broadly, let me just add this. For us \u2013 and I had an opportunity to speak to this about a week ago in discussing the Biden administration\u2019s approach to China \u2013 our approach is not about holding China back or trying to keep it down. It\u2019s about upholding what we commonly refer to as the rules-based international order, the rule of law system that has been put in place to try to govern relations among nations in a way that upholds peace and security, minimizes the potential for conflict, and allows everyone to engage in a race to the top, where we all flourish and all succeed. When that order is challenged by anyone, we\u2019ll defend it. And in fact, we\u2019ll do it together. But again, this is not designed to be zero-sum. It\u2019s designed to be a race to the top in which everyone \u2013 we hope China included \u2013 is prepared to engage.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK: The question you have raised about extended deterrence and IPEF, we discussed before today between two of us. Extended deterrence strategy and consultation group meeting we agreed should be reactivated as soon as possible because it deals with Korean security and peace and stability, and also including the timely deployment of strategic assets when necessary. And, of course, the restoration of the Korea-U.S. joint military exercise will certainly help bring about more safe environment on the Korean Peninsula. I already mentioned the need for pushing the new UN Security Council resolution in case North Korea comes up with another nuclear test.\nConcerning IPEF, the basic approach that this forum has taken is that this forum should not alienate or exclude any one specific country. The basic idea is to have a more inclusive, transparent, and also flexible forum where joining participants can discuss the future of the region and how to create new laws and norms so that member countries can operate together in the area of trade, supply chains, energy \u2013 clean energy, and tax, and anticorruption. And I think that the real question is whether China would be willing to accept the norms and the regulations so that we can have a mutually beneficial relationship in the region. So I hope that IPEF can create a better world for the future through the establishment of new regional trade and investment and also economic security framework in the region.\nMR PRICE: Nike Ching, VOA.\nQUESTION: Good afternoon, Secretary Blinken. Good afternoon, Minister Park. On North Korea, North Korea has just appointed its first female foreign minister and also announced a partial reshuffle of its military leadership. What is your read to these personnel change? Is it an indication of shift of approach by North Korea toward the U.S. and South Korea?\nSeparately, if I may, Secretary Blinken, sanctions have not been working to deter North Korea from further provocation. Given the division within the United Nations Security Council, are unilateral punitive measures by the United States targeting Chinese and Russia individuals and entities supporting North Korea\u2019s weapon programs on the table?\nAnd to Minister Park, do you see United States play a role to revive the intelligence-sharing pact between Japan and Korea? Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you, Nike. We have noted the appointment of the new foreign minister in North Korea, but our approach is not predicated or dependent on specific individuals. It\u2019s focused entirely on the policies that the given country is pursuing. And as I said and just to reiterate, we remain committed, as is the Republic of Korea, to diplomacy and to dialogue. We\u2019ve had multiple senior U.S. officials, including the President, myself, repeatedly and publicly affirm that we seek diplomacy with the DPRK without preconditions, and I repeated it again today. I also reiterated that we have no hostile intent toward the DPRK. So we\u2019ll continue to reach out to the DPRK. We\u2019re committed to pursuing a diplomatic approach. Unfortunately, to date what we\u2019ve seen from the DPRK is the opposite. I hope they\u2019ll respond differently.\nWith regard to sanctions and pressure, virtually all of this is coordinated closely with other countries and it\u2019s pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions. North Korea is in violation of many of them, and repeatedly so.\nWhen it comes to targeting those who are supporting North Korea\u2019s missile or nuclear program, that\u2019s already what we\u2019re doing. We have imposed sanctions of one kind or another on individuals and entities, including Russian and Chinese individuals and entities that are aiding and abetting those programs. We\u2019ll continue to do so.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK: Well, I think that North Korea should change its mind and make a right decision. So rather than spending its budget for launching nuclear \u2013 testing nuclear bomb or launching missiles, they should spend their budget for the well-being of the people. Now we know that Corona-19 pandemic is affecting people\u2019s lives in North Korea. North Korea has voluntarily admitted the problems that they have. So as long as North Korea continues on its belligerent posture, as I mentioned, it\u2019ll only isolate the country.\nWith regard to GSOMIA, we want GSOMIA to be normalized as soon as possible together with the improvement of Korea-Japan relationship. In order to deal with the threat from North Korea, we need to have a policy coordination and a sharing of information between Korea and Japan and with the United States. So I hope that this security cooperation and sharing of information can be normalized as soon as possible.\nMR PRICE: Our final question goes to Kim Yangsoon with KBS.\nQUESTION: Hi, my name is Yangsoon Kim from KBS. It\u2019s really nice to see you, Minister Pak, in here. Welcome. I have a question to Blinken and the Minister Park too.\nWell, first of all, I\u2019ve been working here from the inauguration of the Biden administration from the time you guys revised the North Korean policy and put out the calibrated and practical approach to North Korea. But since then, as you mentioned and admitted, there is no response from the North Korea. And it looks like the sanction doesn\u2019t work well. So do you have any other leveraging to make the goal of Korean Peninsula denuclearization or any other thing to put a step forward to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula? Or you guys change or modification in the North Korean policy with the new Yoon government?\nAnd to the Minister Park, as you mentioned, yesterday, North Korea is ready to \u2013 just to push the button for the nuclear test. And do you think \u2013 what will be the instigation to push the button? Because you said that it will be the political action, and there it will be like a Korean-U.S. military joint army together things that will be an instigation or something like that? What will be the instigation?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much. So as you noted, we have made clear for some time our willingness to engage diplomatically and through dialogue with the DPRK toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula for some time. We took time to engage in a full policy review at the beginning of this administration. We completed that review and we\u2019ve made clear, as you said, to the DPRK as well as to others our preparedness to engage through dialogue and through diplomacy in trying to resolve the issues and to advance the prospects for a genuinely peaceful peninsula.\nAnd unfortunately, again, as I\u2019ve said, what we\u2019ve seen to date has been no response from the DPRK. To the extent there\u2019s been a response, of late it has been a proliferation of missile tests including ICBMs and possibly now a nuclear test. We\u2019ve seen the preparations for that. That would be the seventh test over multiple administrations \u2013 multiple American administrations, multiple Korean administrations.\nWe\u2019ve also made clear that unless and until the DPRK is engaged with us and with partners and allies in diplomacy and in dialogue that the pressure will continue, it will be sustained, and as appropriate it will be increased. We\u2019ve talked today and we will continue to talk with the ROK, with Japan, with others about the most effective ways to do that. And I can say that we are in full alignment when it comes to the approach that needs to be taken. That pressure can not only be exerted by our countries, but also by others in the international community, including through additional Security Council resolutions and what flows from that \u2013 from those resolutions.\nAt the same time, it is very important that we continue to strengthen our own defense and deterrence against further action by the DPRK. This is something that we\u2019re also engaged in. We\u2019re committed, for example, to talking about how we expand the scope and scale of combined military exercises for defensive and preparedness purposes, training on and around the Korean Peninsula.\nAnd of course, we want to make sure that we have in place all the defensive capacity necessary to deal with any possible provocation or aggression coming from the DPRK. That is not what we\u2019re looking for; that is not our goal or intent. To the contrary, it\u2019s the peaceful resolution of all of these differences toward a denuclearized Korean Peninsula, to do that through diplomacy and dialogue, but we\u2019re going to be prepared either way. And there is no daylight between the United States and the Republic of Korea when it comes to both aspects of that policy: being prepared fully to pursue diplomacy and dialogue but also being prepared to deal with any provocation and any aggression coming from the DPRK.\nFOREIGN MINISTER PARK: I think that North Korea is at a crossroads now. It can go ahead with its nuclear test and isolate itself or it can make a right decision and return to the diplomacy and the dialogue. I hope North Korea can make the latter choice instead of continuing on a dangerous course of action. If North Korea somehow decides to go ahead with this nuclear test then, as I mentioned, Korea and the United States will react with a firm position, through strength and deterrence, and also through the UN Security Council resolution. And I also think that China should play a very positive role to persuade North Korea that maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula requires their new thinking and also making a right decision at this important, critical juncture. So I really hope that North Korea can look to the future and make the right decision.\nMR PRICE: That concludes the press conference. Thank you, Your Excellencies. Thank you, everyone.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-press-availability-at-the-summit-of-americas/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken Press Availability at the Summit of Americas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Los Angeles Convention Center", "location": "Los Angeles, California", "date": "June 10, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It has been nearly three decades since the United States hosted the first Summit of Americas.\u00a0 As it happens, I actually worked on that inaugural summit, in a slightly different role\u00a0\u2013 I was a speechwriter for President Clinton at the time.\nNeedless to say, the hemisphere looks a little bit different than it did back in 1994.\u00a0 But the fundamental premise of that first summit still holds:\u00a0 No region more directly affects the lives of American citizens, their security, their prosperity, than the Americas.\u00a0 And at the same time, the concentration of democracies in our hemisphere gives us a unique advantage as we try to meet the fundamental needs of people across the region.\nThis summit comes at a challenging time.\u00a0 We heard that from many this week.\u00a0 COVID-19 has taken the lives of 2.7 million people across the Americas.\u00a0 If you add it all up, we\u2019re about 12\u00a0percent of the world\u2019s population.\u00a0 We suffered 40 percent of global reported deaths.\u00a0 No region has felt more acutely the pandemic\u2019s economic and social consequences \u2013 from rising poverty to more young people out of work.\nJust as we began to build back from the pandemic, the Russian Government\u2019s brutal war of aggression in Ukraine worsened many problems across the hemisphere \u2013 raising the cost of fuel, fertilizer, and food; making it tougher for producers to export their goods.\nThese headwinds come atop longstanding challenges in the region, including a lack of opportunity, an accelerating climate crisis, violence and insecurity, endemic corruption \u2013 all of which are driving people to leave their home countries in record numbers in search of places where they have a better shot at providing for themselves and their loved ones.\nThe more people across the region feel these challenges in their everyday lives, the more they are looking for effective governance to help address them.\u00a0 And that\u2019s been the guiding principle behind the Biden administration\u2019s engagement in our region.\nIt\u2019s why we donated more than 70 million doses and counting of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines to countries across the hemisphere \u2013 free of charge, with no strings attached.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s why the American public and private sectors continue to invest more than any other country in expanding economic opportunity across the hemisphere \u2013 from the $10 billion that the U.S.\u00a0 Development Finance Corporation has distributed to projects like \u2013 that are providing low-interest loans to women entrepreneurs, for example, to the $1.3 trillion that the United States provides in annual foreign direct investment to the Americas.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also why I convened my partners from across the hemisphere \u2013 first in Colombia, then in Panama \u2013 to focus on what we can do collectively to address the root causes of the region\u2019s migration crisis; increase economic support for the countries that are hosting the largest numbers of refugees and migrants, including the more than 6 million displaced Venezuelans; expand protections for migrants who are at risk.\nThese efforts were crucial to shaping what is now the first truly regional approach to migration in the Los Angeles Declaration.\u00a0 Thanks to President Biden\u2019s leadership, it was adopted by leaders of 20\u00a0countries in the hemisphere \u2013 including our own \u2013 just a few hours ago.\u00a0 We expect more to sign on, too, to this soon.\u00a0 What the declaration reflects is something new, and that is a commitment to shared responsibility when it comes to dealing with the migration challenge, shared responsibility and shared action.\nWe\u2019re also marshaling real resources behind this effort.\u00a0 The Vice President has led the way in generating $3.2 billion in new private sector investment through her Call to Action in the countries of northern Central America.\u00a0\nThis summit isn\u2019t the beginning or the end of our efforts to make democracy deliver in the hemisphere.\u00a0 Rather, it\u2019s a chance to engage with partners from around the region \u2013 in government, international organizations, civil society, the private sector, young people \u2013 about where we can do more, and where we can do better.\nThat included engaging with people from the countries that are not democracies \u2013 where voicing criticism of the government, standing up for human rights, or doing independent journalism is met with systemic, systematic, and swift repression.\u00a0\nI met with activists and human rights leaders, including from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.\u00a0 I was struck by their determination, despite serious harassment, attacks, violence, the determination to keep fighting for human rights and democracy in their countries.\u00a0 As for the governments of those countries, this summit focused on collaborating with partners to respond to the practical needs of people across the hemisphere.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to do that with governments that reject the basic principle that they are accountable to their people and repress their citizens\u2019 rights to speak up about the challenges that they face.\nAs a result of President Biden\u2019s leadership in bringing this summit together and driving broad support for its deliverables, we have a lot to show for this week\u2019s work.\u00a0\nTogether, our countries agreed to ambitious commitments in public health and pandemic preparedness, clean energy, climate change adaptation, digital transformation, democratic governance.\u00a0 These commitments give us benchmarks to hold us accountable by our fellow democracies and by the people that we serve.\u00a0\nThe United States announced new commitments to move these efforts forward, and let me just quickly highlight a few.\nTogether with partners, we will train and equip 500,000\u00a0\u2013 500,000\u00a0\u2013 local healthcare workers across the hemisphere over the next five years so that more people can get quality care in their communities.\nWe announced a new economic agenda \u2013 the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity \u2013 that\u2019s focused on building more equitable growth from the bottom up and from the middle out.\u00a0 We\u2019ll bring more countries into the partnership over the coming months.\u00a0 A key part of the agenda will be working with multilateral institutions to increase financing for the region\u2019s middle-income economies, which aren\u2019t developed enough to qualify for membership in groups like the G20 or the OECD, and yet are too developed to qualify for aid from international financial institutions like the World Bank.\u00a0 This is something that we heard loud and clear from our partners in CARICOM as well as others.\u00a0\nSo to that end, President Biden is proposing fundamental reforms to the Inter-American Development Bank so that it can invest in middle-income countries.\u00a0 As the bank\u2019s largest donor, the United States will put more resources into the bank\u2019s private sector lending arm to support these kinds of investments.\nWe\u2019re also turbocharging our efforts to support the region\u2019s transition to clean energy.\u00a0 Here at the summit, five new countries announced that they plan to join the Renewable Energy for Latin America and Caribbean initiative.\u00a0 That brings us to 20 countries teaming up to hit an unprecedented target: producing 70 percent of the hemisphere\u2019s electricity through renewable energy by the year 2030.\nWe announced a new partnership to invest in clean energy programs and climate adaptation and resilience across the Caribbean, and expanded regional efforts to protect and conserve our oceans.\nIn no small part thanks to the extraordinary work of our Climate Envoy John Kerry, regional development banks committed $50 billion over five years to help countries reduce emissions, expand renewable energy, address the growing climate crisis.\u00a0 We\u2019ll work with the banks going forward to ensure that the funding helps lower the barriers and risks to investing in a sustainable future \u2013 making it not only economically viable, but desirable for the private sector.\nAs part of our commitment to strengthen democracy, the United States committed $75 million in new support for over 300 community-led organizations across the Americas that are on the front lines of advancing human rights, lifting more people out of poverty, fighting corruption.\u00a0\nUSAID will devote an additional $42 million to aiding civil society in Central America \u2013 part of what is really a whole-of-government commitment to promoting freedom of expression, countering digital repression, defending other spaces where citizens engage in their democracies.\nFinally, we plan to host the first-ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver, Colorado, next April, 2023.\u00a0 This will foster greater cooperation among city, state, regional leaders, together with business, with youth, with NGOs.\u00a0 What we are already seeing is that cities are the leading innovators in bringing citizens and governments together to actually solve concrete, real-world problems \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a lot to learn from them.\u00a0 We have also, as part of this, the Cities Forward initiative which will draw on the knowledge and expertise from across our own government to help cities meet their goals for becoming more equitable, more environmentally sustainable.\nSo in sum, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve emerged from this summit clear\u00ad\u2011eyed about the challenges that we face and more aligned on the way forward: together, building on our strength as democracies, and knowing, as President Biden said, that at heart we have everything that we need \u2013 right here in our own hemisphere, in the Americas \u2013 everything we need to deliver for our people.\nSo with that, thank you.\u00a0 Happy to take some questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We will now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hello, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Humeyra.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I have a couple of questions, so please bear with me.\u00a0 Some countries who were present here today at the summit chose not to sign up for the migration declaration.\u00a0 What were their reservations and how is the United States going to address those going forward?\u00a0 How many do you think can be on board by the end of the year?\u00a0 And with this declaration, do you expect the record number of migrant arrivals at the border to fall?\u00a0 That was my first question.\u00a0\nMy second one is:\u00a0 Many leaders expressed their discontent to U.S. excluding Cuba and Venezuela, and they raised concerns about the unity in the region.\u00a0 What will the administration do to ease those concerns, and could that trigger a rethink of U.S. policy towards the region?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Humeyra.\u00a0 So first, on the L.A. Declaration on Migration, I\u2019m not sure if you were in the room, but if you looked at that stage, there were 20 countries represented on that stage.\u00a0 And as I said, this is the first time that we have come together across the hemisphere to take shared responsibility for the migration challenge \u2013 countries of origin, transit countries, countries of destination.\u00a0 And this is a significant step forward, in my judgment, because it actually promises, I think, more effective action in making sure that we have humane, orderly, safe migration.\u00a0\nA few things that I would just point to in the declaration itself because it\u2019s important.\u00a0 The commitments that governments made include to expand temporary worker programs to address labor shortages while reducing irregular migration.\u00a0 This is a real win-win.\u00a0 It\u2019s a win-win for countries like the United States, Canada, Mexico.\u00a0 They committed to open and expand or reinforce other legal channels for migration, including refugee resettlement, family unification programs.\u00a0 That, too, will help address critical labor shortages.\u00a0 There\u2019s a commitment to surge support to countries that are hosting large refugee and migrant populations to make sure that that\u2019s sustainable because we see the burden that this places on communities on different parts of our hemisphere.\u00a0 There\u2019s a commitment to combat and root out human smuggling networks that prey on the most vulnerable in the region.\u00a0\nSo that\u2019s a very strong, principled foundation.\u00a0 Twenty countries are on board.\u00a0 My full expectation is that more will join as we go forward.\u00a0\nAt the same time, one of the things we\u2019re doing is working directly with other countries with migration arrangements so that we\u2019re looking in individual cases at what specific steps individual countries might take, again, to help manage this challenge effectively.\nSo what will the results be?\u00a0 We\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We want to make sure that we\u2019re measuring our progress, but this is an important vehicle for actually making progress in managing the migration challenge effectively.\nI mentioned as well, we know that even as we\u2019re taking short-term and medium-term steps to manage migration, ultimately, the long-term investments that we\u2019re trying to make in countries from which so many people are leaving are ultimately what are going to make the most difference.\u00a0 And there, as I mentioned, at this summit the Vice President was able to announce that, thanks to her work, we have an additional $3.2 billion in investment from the private sector going to the countries of northern Central America.\nOver time, what that does is it creates opportunity.\u00a0 One of the biggest single drivers of migration is a lack of opportunity.\u00a0 If we and others can help create it, that\u2019s going to make a big difference.\u00a0 It will give people a choice.\nSo this will play out over time.\u00a0 There\u2019s some immediate measures, but \u2013 and some of this is medium term, some of this is longer term.\u00a0\nAs to the second part of the question, first let me say this: in the case of Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, they were here at the summit.\u00a0 I met with them.\u00a0 I met with human rights defenders.\u00a0 I met with civil society from those countries.\u00a0 And I would argue that they are more representative of the people in those respective countries than their current governments or regimes.\u00a0\nSome other countries were here at the foreign minister level but fully in force.\u00a0 We had, I think all told, about 68 delegations, 22 heads of state.\u00a0 And it\u2019s interesting; I know some people like to focus on differences of opinion in who is here, but everyone was fully united on what we did here.\u00a0 And I recited some of the concrete achievements of the summit.\u00a0 That was the focus of virtually of the conversations that I had over the last three days.\u00a0\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We will turn to Missy Ryan of\u00a0The Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Missy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 You went over this very ambitious list of deliverables that was announced during the summit, but it was unclear to me at least whether there will be a large amount of new U.S. Government investments associated with those, especially in comparison to some of the recent U.S. Government support to Ukraine, for example.\u00a0 And I understand the argument that much of the region is now middle income, but at the same time we heard some really poignant appeals from Caribbean nations and others saying that they\u2019re mired in debt due to climate change that is caused largely by big countries like the United States and they\u2019re drowning in violence caused in large part by U.S.-origin guns.\u00a0 Do you think perhaps the U.S. has a greater financial responsibility given its role in \u2013 excuse me \u2013 contributing to these problems?\nAnd secondly, I want to press you a little bit more on an issue that you discussed with Televisa.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the complaint that we heard from a number of countries, including Gabriel Boric when he spoke with\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0this week, about a double standard in U.S. engagement with and support for some countries with problematic governments and rights records like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and other countries which, as you said, are not accountable to their people, and then choosing not to engage with other ones.\u00a0 I\u2019m just going to have to sit down so I can read this.\nI heard you say that you are trying to see how you can stand up for people more effectively, but could you be more specific in telling us how you think about when to engage in some countries with issues and when not to engage?\u00a0 And do you think that these leaders who are making that point do have a point?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Thanks, Missy.\nSo first on the question raised very eloquently and powerfully by our partners in the Caribbean, this is something that the President and Vice President were extremely sensitive to.\u00a0 We had what I thought was an excellent meeting between the President, the Vice President, and our CARICOM partners yesterday.\nNow, again, don\u2019t take it from me.\u00a0 Ask them what they thought.\u00a0 Certainly what I heard from them coming out of the meeting, what I heard today, is that this is, as one of them put it, the best meeting we\u2019ve had in a decade with the leadership of the United States.\u00a0 And the reason it was such a good meeting is, first of all, because the President and Vice President listened intently to the concerns expressed by countries in the Caribbean and responded, I think, effectively to them.\nYou pointed to something really important.\u00a0 There is a different kind of middle-income trap where countries are classified as being middle income or even higher income, and yet they are particularly afflicted by COVID or the climate crisis, they don\u2019t have the means to respond, and yet they don\u2019t qualify for, for example, concessionary lending.\u00a0 Or they have so much debt piled up that even if they could qualify, they\u2019ve got a problem.\nSo we are committed to tackling this problem, and the President is engaged to working with the multilateral development banks to find ways to effectively support the countries that are in this position to make sure that they can get the support they need for, for example, climate adaptation or to respond to the food crisis or to respond to a health crisis.\nI think, again, if you ask our colleagues from the Caribbean, they will, I suspect, tell you that they very much appreciated the work that was done.\u00a0 And so much so that one of the agreements that came out of the meeting yesterday was to immediately establish a working group between the United States and the CARICOM countries to work through these practical problems and to make sure that we are actually seized by the fierce urgency of now \u2013 not next year, not in five years, now.\nSecond part of the question \u2013 with any given country, we are looking at a multiplicity of interests but also a common thread of values.\u00a0 President Biden committed to putting human rights and democracy at the heart of our foreign policy.\u00a0 It is, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the totality.\u00a0 It\u2019s a critical element that we look to, and we\u2019re always trying to assess in any given relationship where we think we can be most effective, both in advancing our interests but doing it in a way that is consistent with and advances our values at the same time.\u00a0 That is simply going to differ from country to country, even though that thread runs throughout.\nSo, for example, in the case of Saudi Arabia, which you mentioned, we determined early on that it was important to recalibrate the relationship, to make sure that it better reflected, in our judgment, our interests and values, but to do it in a way that didn\u2019t rupture the relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tremendously important relationship and partnership in terms of combating extremism, in terms of dealing with Iran; tremendously important as well in trying to bring to an end one of the worst conflicts in the world over the last decade that\u2019s been perhaps the worst humanitarian crisis on the globe, and that\u2019s the conflict in Yemen.\u00a0 And in part as a result of the work that we\u2019ve been able to do with the leadership of Saudi Arabia, we helped achieve a truce in Yemen that\u2019s now been extended for a second period of time.\u00a0 Humanitarian assistance is getting to places where it couldn\u2019t before.\u00a0 And we have an opportunity \u2013 fragile, but a real opportunity \u2013 to maybe have a sustained peace in Yemen.\nSo this is about getting results, doing it in a principled way.\u00a0 We could go down the list of each country, different situations in each, but our focus is the same:\u00a0 How can we most effectively advance America\u2019s interests but also America\u2019s values?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Go to Ariel Moutsados of Televisa.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Ned.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I would like to know, in the declaration of Los Angeles and \u2013 senior officials also from the United States Government have said that all countries should enforce or that the United States expects all countries to enforce their own immigration laws.\u00a0 Could you please elaborate on what type of enforcement actions you have been discussing, especially in the case of Mexico?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great, thank you.\u00a0 If you look at the declaration, it, as I said, sets out some very \u2013 some basic principles and it sets out commitments by governments to do certain things.\u00a0 The basic principles that we agreed to are the absolute need to make sure that migration is safe, it\u2019s orderly, it\u2019s humane, and we want to make sure that we\u2019re putting human dignity at the heart of everything that we do.\u00a0 And that means making sure that migrants are treated in a humane and dignified way, that we build in safety along the entire process of migration, but at the same time, that we uphold and respect our individual laws and that those laws be enforced.\nSo all of that is in the declaration.\u00a0 I went through \u2013 I won\u2019t belabor it again \u2013 I went through the specific commitments that governments have undertaken as part of the declaration in all aspects of migration, again, to include things like expanded temporary worker programs, to include things like creating more legal channels for migration, support for communities that are hosting many refugees and migrants, and combating and rooting out smuggling networks.\u00a0 But in all of this, we expect that countries will, just as the United States will, uphold and enforce its laws.\u00a0 Those are all, I think, relatively self-evident.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to go through them for each country.\nI mentioned as well that with this declaration that covers now 20 countries in the hemisphere, we\u2019ve also been engaged with individual countries on arrangements that go to even more specific things that countries can do, particularly when it comes to protections for migrants in their system, but also when it comes, for example, to repatriating migrants to the countries they came for, enforcing their laws to do that, seeking agreement with other governments to do that.\u00a0 There\u2019s a long, long list of things.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Gaby Perozo, VPItv.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thank you for doing this.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 While we are here at the summit, Maduro is currently visiting Iran and Turkey, and he\u2019s also talking directly with Russia and China.\u00a0 Are you concerned that they can sign an agreement offering more things to the regime than you?\u00a0\nMaduro refused to return to the dialogue in Mexico.\u00a0 Do you believe it is worth it for the U.S. to continue easing sanctions?\u00a0 You are placing all your hope on the negotiations, but what other alternative are the U.S. exploring besides Mexico?\nAnd another question.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 All right.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 What can we expect in the months to come as the U.S. administration shifts its attention to its other urgent and pressing matters?\u00a0 How can Latin America stay as a priority spot for you?\u00a0 Will your massive migration wave convince you that the region, it\u2019s both political and security priorities?\u00a0 Your enemies are in the region.\u00a0 You\u2019ve seen the immigration card to unsettle the U.S.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 All right, thank you.\nFirst, when it comes to negotiations and Venezuela, both the Unitary Platform and the Maduro regime in recent days have signaled an intent to resume those conversations or negotiations in Mexico City.\u00a0 That is the latest information that we have.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking toward.\nAnd in our judgment, Venezuelan-led negotiations between the Maduro regime and the Unitary Platform are the best path that we can see to try to restore to Venezuelans a democracy that they clearly deserve and clearly want, and alleviate the extraordinary suffering that\u2019s taken place in recent years.\nWe\u2019re very much committed to supporting Venezuelans in this effort and certainly their democratic aspirations.\u00a0 Under the right circumstances, with the support of the international community, the parties themselves are best positioned to negotiate steps toward a solution to the Venezuelan crisis.\nSo again, the most recent information we have is that there is an intent to return to Mexico City, and that\u2019s something that we support.\nWe\u2019ve also made clear that when it comes to sanctions, sanctions are not an end in themselves.\u00a0 They are an effort to incentivize those who are on the receiving end to engage in different conduct.\u00a0 And as we\u2019ve long said, sanctions aren\u2019t permanent.\u00a0 If we see change, sanctions can be lifted.\u00a0 The purpose is not to keep them there indefinitely.\u00a0 The purpose is to encourage countries, regimes, governments, to engage in the right kind of conduct, particularly when it comes to restoring democracy.\u00a0 That\u2019s the purpose.\nThe second part of the question:\u00a0 How can Latin America remain a priority?\u00a0 Well, first, I think we\u2019ve spent almost a week here \u2013 I got here on Tuesday and the President\u2019s been here for several days \u2013 making very clear that even in the midst of, for example, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, even in the midst of the broad challenge that, for example, China poses to us, that our own hemisphere is a priority.\u00a0 As I said, this summit brought together some 68 delegations, 22 heads of state.\u00a0\nBut what\u2019s really important are not the three days here; it\u2019s the 362 days that will follow in the year ahead.\u00a0 And the test is going to be whether we make good on the commitments that we\u2019ve made here.\u00a0 I recited a number of them.\u00a0 You \u2013 but more importantly through you, in a sense, our citizens \u2013 will hold us accountable to whether we actually deliver on these commitments.\nAnd if we\u2019re going to do that, we have to stay engaged.\u00a0 We can\u2019t just write a declaration, put it in a drawer, and expect it to produce results.\u00a0 This requires sustained day-in/day-put engagement by our government, by other governments, by the private sector, by civil society, international organizations, et cetera.\nBut the real answer to the test will probably be six months from now, a year from now, two years from now, when we look back and determine whether we\u2019ve made good on the commitments that were reached here in Los Angeles.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Raquel Krahenbul from Globo.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Hello.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Ned.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I also have two questions.\u00a0 I\u2019ll ask one first and then you\u2019ll answer, and then I ask the second.\u00a0 Is that okay?\nFirst question.\u00a0 President Bolsonaro said today \u2013 you were there during his speech \u2013 that Brazil is one of the countries that most preserve the environment.\u00a0 What is your reaction to that, and do you see real progress on Brazil\u2019s commitment on cutting deforestation?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Raquel, do you want to go ahead and ask your second?\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Okay, sure, sure.\u00a0 On the first bilateral meeting between President Biden and Bolsonaro yesterday, before the meeting a senior administration official said they were discussing topics they disagree on.\u00a0 Bolsonaro defended a lot of his old positions there, so what do you think about his statement there?\u00a0 What were the disagreements, and what changed for the bilateral relationship now?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good, thank you very much.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Let me talk about the climate piece first.\u00a0 Look, I think it is well known that climate change is a top priority for our administration, but also for countries in the hemisphere.\u00a0 This was very much front and center in the conversations we had.\u00a0 Many of the countries here, of course, were together with us at COP26, so this is an enduring focus for us.\nAnd it\u2019s also fundamentally true that Brazil is critical to these efforts.\u00a0 It has one of the cleanest energy grids as it already stands, but of course it\u2019s also one of the top emitters of greenhouse gasses, as is the United States.\u00a0 The Amazon, which we know are the \u2013 literally the lungs of the hemisphere, stores enormous quantities of carbon dioxide each year, and that is a vital service to the world in dealing with climate change that we cannot afford to lose.\nSo we\u2019ve been concerned by the continuing high levels of deforestation in the Amazon, a concern that we\u2019ve expressed.\u00a0 It\u2019s also why we\u2019ve put additional resources through something called Amazonia Connect to support Brazil, Colombia, Peru\u2019s efforts to preserve the Amazon.\u00a0 One of the things that President Biden shared with President Bolsonaro is that we feel a responsibility to do that because over many, many, many generations, we were able to take advantage ourselves, for example, of clearing forests in order to have agricultural production or industry before anyone understood the impact of climate change.\u00a0\nAnd now, as we\u2019re asking other countries not to engage in these kinds of steps, he believes, we believe that we have a responsibility to help.\u00a0 And that goes with, for example, helping to finance adaptation resilience and, in the case of deforestation, making sure that countries have the means not to further engage in deforestation or even to engage in reforestation.\nSo we discussed all of this.\u00a0 Brazil has put forward very ambitious climate commitments.\u00a0 We hope that they hold to those commitments.\u00a0 It would make a huge difference in this effort that has to be a global one.\nAnd more broadly, let me say this.\u00a0 We have, I think, over many years a strong, solid partnership.\u00a0 It spans centuries, quite literally, based on shared democratic values, based on a lot of mutual interests.\u00a0 The bilateral yesterday was, I think, best described as constructive, an opportunity to address a lot of issues in the bilateral relationship right now.\u00a0 I think \u2013 I don\u2019t want to put words in President Bolsonaro\u2019s mouth, but I think I heard him say today that it was productive and positive, and we, too, appreciate the close coordination on a whole range of issues.\nFor example, we talked about boosting trade, investment, job creation, working together on the environment, as I just mentioned, social and security issues with Brazil.\u00a0 And our hope \u2013 I think there\u2019s a common belief and also expectation that if we work more closely together, we can actually deliver real benefits for people in both of our countries.\u00a0 We happen to be the two largest democracies in the hemisphere; it makes sense for us to not only continue to work together but find ways to deepen the partnership.\nSo I think we had a good presence, had a good conversation yesterday about how we can move forward in that direction.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0This is something that is \u2013 has happened on a somewhat regular basis in the past, I think even a couple of times a year.\u00a0 Countries will make their sovereign decisions.\u00a0 However, the idea that Russia would be a good partner when it comes to law enforcement issues or when it comes to humanitarian assistance, shall we say, does not meet the credibility test.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, you said you want to (inaudible) progress on migration, but (inaudible) way to do that, sir?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (Inaudible) be able to judge whether we \u2013 whether we\u2019ve met them.\u00a0 People will be able to judge whether we\u2019ve met them.\u00a0 So I think it\u2019s very measurable.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-working-lunch-with-the-joint-summit-working-group/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

It\u2019s good to see everyone, and I don\u2019t want to be the only thing standing between you and \u2013 I guess it\u2019s lunch. Well, yes, we\u2019re in Latin America, so it\u2019s lunch. Wonderful to see everyone here today and thank you all for joining for lunch. Folks will be flying home in just a few hours, and that\u2019s actually when the real work begins \u2013 implementing, doing what we said we would do here at the summit.\nBut I just wanted to take a minute to say, first of all, how grateful we are that everyone here has put so much into making this summit a success. What we\u2019ve accomplished in Los Angeles is the result of months of consultation and coordination among all of our teams.\nAnd now, as I said, we have to make good on our pledges and turn them into concrete progress, and to do that, we have to keep that collaboration going. So I hope we can take the spirit that we have here and work together to turn it into real results.\nI wanted to say a few words about the Joint Summit Working Group organizations, because you will play a key role in making this happen. This, as you know, is a network of regional and international institutions that gives critical technical guidance and other support for summit commitments across our hemisphere.\nTo cite a few examples, last month, the Pan-American Health Organization launched a new information platform for our countries to share data on public health and on migration, so that we can better meet the medical needs of migrants, from COVID-19 to pre- and post-natal care.\nLast year, the Caribbean Development Bank \u2013 another Joint Working Group organization \u2013 helped to mobilize $80 million to support the pandemic response in the Caribbean.\nThe Organization of American States played a critical role in the Energy and Climate Partnership that came out of the Fifth Summit of the Americas back in 2009 \u2013 holding more than 40 technical meetings, workshops, policy dialogues to advance renewable energy and to mitigate the dangerous effects of climate change across our region.\nSpeaking of the OAS, we have a law in the United States known as the OAS Legislative Engagement Act, and that calls for the creation of a forum for legislators across the hemisphere to increase their participation in OAS activities. We have a bipartisan team of U.S. senators, led by Senator Ben Cardin, Senator Roger Wicker, who are helping to drive that process. Many of the members of Congress here today will be part of that endeavor, and we\u2019re grateful for that.\nHaving elected officials from across our region become more involved in the OAS \u2013 a leading institution for supporting democracy in the Americas \u2013 that will make its work stronger.\nSpeaking for the United States, we look forward to working with partners across the region to carry out the initiatives that our leaders announced in these days.\nThis includes the Americas Health Corps, to train half a million \u2013 I\u2019m going to repeat that number \u2013 half a million health professionals across the region over the next five years. Imagine what that can do to lift the foundation of health care across our region, not only in dealing with potentially future pandemics but in day-in/day-out health care for all the peoples of our region. Half a million trained workers.\nThe Digital Agenda for Transformation in the Americas, to try to increase access to digital tools, to training and opportunities \u2013 that too has tremendous potential to bridge the digital divide, to connect small businesses to the marketplace, to bring education to students where it\u2019s needed.\nThe Cities Forward initiative, to direct more support to cities, because we know that\u2019s where so much innovation and problem-solving is actually taking place. Parenthetically, I think as many of you know, next year we\u2019re going to have our first Cities Summit of the Americas \u2013 Denver will host it \u2013 because again, so much is happening at a local municipal level. We want to tap into that.\nOn these and all the ambitious initiatives that our countries made, we will lean on our Joint Working Group partners to actually make them real, to actually produce concrete results.\nSo that\u2019s why we wanted to convene one more time before leaving California \u2013 so we can get started on hammering out our next steps.\nLet me say again how much I\u2019ve appreciated our time together here in Los Angeles. It has been inspiring. It\u2019s been energizing. And I think seeing representatives come together from across the region \u2013 not just from government, as important as that is, but from civil society, from the private sector, young people, international organizations \u2013 all driven by a fundamental desire to deliver results that will make a real difference in the lives of our people, to actually be responsive to what our citizens demand, what they\u2019re looking for.\nLast word. The theme of this summit \u2013 \u201cBuilding a Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable Future\u201d \u2013 that speaks to many of the challenges facing our countries, from climate to COVID to building stronger economies. But we throw these words around \u2013 sustainable, resilient, equitable. They have a real meaning, and that\u2019s important. We need to focus on what they actually mean.\nSo we seek a sustainable future, through long-term investments \u2013 not just expensive short-term fixes \u2013 on energy, on economic development, and so much else, so that we have a real and durable foundation for progress that can pay off not just in the next months but over many years and over many decades.\nWe seek a resilient future, and that simply means that our governments and our societies will be better placed to respond to crises of all kinds, to do it swiftly, to do it capably, learning from the lessons of the past to try to protect our people and help them get back on their feet when emergencies happen.\nAnd we seek an equitable future, and that simply means that everyone \u2013 no matter where they live, no matter who they are \u2013 have access to economic, social, educational opportunities, and are treated with equal respect and dignity.\nThat is the meaning of those words, and now our challenge is to make them real, to make them concrete, to make genuine progress. It\u2019s a shared vision for the hemisphere that we share. And as President Biden said on Wednesday, there has never been a greater need for cooperation, for common purpose, and yes, for transformative ideas. Here in Los Angeles, we\u2019ve actually deepened that cooperation. We\u2019ve affirmed a common purpose. And we\u2019re embracing transformative ideas, which we now have to turn into lasting progress.\nThat\u2019s what the partnerships represented in this room are charged with now. And as we think about leaving Los Angeles, I can say that we\u2019ve come together for three days. I\u2019m looking forward to the next 362 days, and then the 365 days after that, and after that, when we demonstrate that what we did here is going to bring real positive change in the lives of our people.\nThank you all so much for being here. Let\u2019s carry on the work. Thank you. (Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-with-mexican-foreign-secretary-marcelo-ebrard-and-canadian-foreign-minister-melanie-joly/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great pleasure to be here in Los Angeles with my friends and partners from Mexico and from Canada.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Ebrard, Foreign Minister Joly, thank you for joining us today.\u00a0 Simply put, Mexico and Canada are our two literally and figuratively closest partners in the hemisphere.\u00a0 We are working together every single day on the issues that have animated this summit, including working together to try to engage the COVID challenge, the climate challenge, the migration challenge, the technology challenge that each of our countries faces.\u00a0 And I think we are brought together by a common conviction that we are going to be much more effective in dealing with these challenges when we work together than when we stand alone.\u00a0 And that\u2019s been the spirit that\u2019s animated the relationships among us, including at the North American Leaders\u2019 Summit that President Biden and President L\u00f3pez Obrador and Prime Minister Trudeau have animated so strongly.\nOur ability to coordinate, collaborate, cooperate is going to make a huge difference in actually advancing the various initiatives that this summit is launching or reinforcing.\u00a0 So I welcome this opportunity for us to compare notes as we head into the final day of the summit, and to look not just at the three days that we spent together here in Los Angeles, but the next 362 days to work together to make good on the commitments that we share.\nSo with that, thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Antony, in the first place for the warm reception for the Mexican delegation, and\u00a0congratulations\u00a0for the summit.\u00a0 Really amazing, the organization and everything.\u00a0 Thank you very much for that.\nHello, M\u00e9lanie.\u00a0 Nice to meet you \u2013 to see you again and the Canadian delegation.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pleasure to be here.\nAs Antony Blinken mentioned, we have a lot of things to work on daily \u2013 daily \u2013 because it\u2019s a very intense relationship between our countries.\u00a0 And we have common purposes in order to prepare the North American Leaders\u2019 Summit this year, which is going to be held in Mexico, maybe Mexico City.\u00a0 And so we have right now some results for the summit which are very positive in our view, from the Mexico view \u2013 point of view, regarding the America prosperity, all the continent prosperity in the next months and years, how to recover from pandemic, how to coordinate our efforts in order to strengthen our inter-American organizations, and how to deal with a regional approach for migration and labor mobility.\nSo a lot of work to do, and we have a very positive relationship, very honest one between us, and we hope that we are going to have this meeting today, other steps ahead in our common objectives.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Antony.\u00a0 Thank you, M\u00e9lanie.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Tony, for hosting us.\u00a0 It\u2019s always a pleasure to see you.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been seeing each other a lot over the past months.\u00a0 Good to see you, Marcelo, as well, and thank you for organizing this meeting.\u00a0 It is the first meeting of the foreign ministers of the three countries together, so I hope this becomes a tradition, and of course we will work on preparing the North American Leaders\u2019 Summit which will be happening in Mexico, and I think, Marcelo, you just said to the press Mexico City.\nSo at the same time, we will work on many issues.\u00a0 Tony mentioned them, from climate change to the question of the impacts of the pandemic and migration.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019ve seen strong support throughout the hemisphere about the importance of what is happening in Ukraine.\u00a0 We need to make sure that we continue to have that strong unity across the hemisphere.\u00a0 And we will talk about how we can continue to address the impacts of this war, including on the question of food security, food prices, and the impacts of \u2013 also on gas prices.\u00a0 So affordability is also a part of the discussions we\u2019ll be having today.\nSo thank you both.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pleasure to be working with you again.\n(In French.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (In French.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) And of course, what it is in our thoughts now are the impacts of the war in Ukraine, impacts not only in Ukraine but throughout the world, here in the hemisphere, in our continent.\u00a0 We know the geopolitical impacts of the war are huge, specifically when it comes to food and gas prices.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Also with us is the Governor of California Gavin Newsom, our Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis \u2013 this is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art \u2013 and our mayor of Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHosting the summit here is an honor for all of us in Los Angeles.\u00a0 We built LACMA as a cultural center for the 10 million people and beyond, 10 million people of Los Angeles County who come from 140 countries and speak more than 220 languages, and many of whom have roots in the Americas, of course.\u00a0 And we reflect the communities we serve.\u00a0 It is normal course of business for LACMA that we would have the exhibitions on view for you to see tonight as you\u2019re enjoying food and drink.\u00a0 In the Resnick Pavilion behind me, we have exhibitions related to the ancient Americas \u2013 Mixpantli: Space, Time, and the Indigenous Origins of Mexico, which you should see \u2013 which give voice, a new voice to the narration of history through Indigenous voices.\u00a0 And there is a contemporary exhibition across the way.\nAnother exhibition on view for you is The Portable Universe, which is about the thought and splendor of indigenous Colombia, which offers a new framework of thinking about \u2013 there are many Colombians here, I know, including my chief operating officer, who\u2019s here.\u00a0 And this is about working with indigenous cultures to rethink, again, how we tell the stories of these objects and their use.\nAnd then finally, we have a huge exhibition of \u2013 called Archive of the World: Art and Imagination in Spanish America, 1500-1800, which showcases our incredible collections of the art of the Spanish Americas.\nThe galleries are going to be open to you this evening to enjoy along with food and drink.\u00a0 We love having you in Los Angeles, and now I would like to introduce one of our distinguished guests, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSPEAKER PELOSI:\u00a0 Thank you, Michael.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Michael.\u00a0 Let us thank Michael Govan for the beautiful, beautiful hospitality he\u2019s extended to us this evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Michael, so much.\nIt\u2019s so appropriate as we come here to celebrate we\u2019re all Americans in this wonderful hemisphere that the arts are a such a unifying force in our lives.\u00a0 And as Michael described the art of so many regions of the Western Hemisphere, particularly Latin America, we see some unifying things.\u00a0 We see the art.\u00a0 The poet Shelley once said the greatest force for moral good is imagination.\u00a0 Imagination should be creative, to enjoy, to laugh together, to cry together, to be inspired together, to forget our differences, to be unified, and to appreciate each other\u2019s culture.\u00a0 So thank you, Michael, for your hospitality for this very important meeting.\nNow, I was told I\u2019m supposed to welcome you to California, and here our governor is here, Gavin Newsom.\u00a0 Gavin Newsom.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And our Senator Alex Padilla.\u00a0 Senator Alex \u2013 newly renominated Alex Padilla.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 But I want to also bring greetings from the Congress of the United States, and I want all my members of Congress to come forward here so you can see how important this meeting is to all of us.\u00a0 See all these members who have come?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Chairs of committee, chairs of caucuses, leaders in the Congress, and many of them from southern California.\u00a0 Our former colleague, Deborah Mucarsel-Powell is here, a co-chair of this conference.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nLet me just say how proud we are to be part of this, how proud we are of the President and the Vice President for their leadership in bringing this meeting together, to our Secretary of State hosting the ministers who are here.\u00a0 We welcome you, ministers.\u00a0 We look forward to exchanging some ideas with you, to hear from you how we can work better together as neighbors and as friends as we try to, shall we say, build the economy and save \u2013 in terms of health care, in terms of the planet, in terms of so much resilience and growth and equality and fairness that we want to generate.\u00a0 So perfect that we are at a museum that unifies us, LACMA.\u00a0 How wonderful.\u00a0 Michael, thank you.\nAnd I\u2019m so proud of my members.\u00a0 Okay, everybody wave who\u2019s a member.\u00a0 Okay, Maxine Waters, some of you are there.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And now it\u2019s an honor to be here with all of you.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nNow, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to introduce somebody else or just say, again, on behalf of the Congress of the United States, to the ministers, we\u2019re very proud of our Secretary of State.\u00a0 We take our lead from him, and he is so proud that so many of you are here.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR GOVAN:\u00a0 Thank you, Madam Speaker, and now we welcome the Second Gentleman of the United States Douglas Emhoff.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR EMHOFF:\u00a0 Good evening.\u00a0 Michael, thank you so much.\u00a0 I remember when Michael came to Los Angeles several years ago.\u00a0 We got to meet when you got here, and you have made such an imprint on my hometown.\u00a0 So Michael Govan, we need more civic leaders like you \u2013 (applause) \u2013 because arts are so important for life, especially in times like this.\nBut good evening, everyone.\u00a0 I see so many friends in this room and so many people here from my own hometown of Los Angeles.\u00a0 Hello, Senator.\u00a0 And also want to say hi to my governor, Governor Newsom.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 My mayor \u2013 I think I heard Eric was here.\u00a0 Eric, if you\u2019re here, hello.\u00a0 Our senator, Alex Padilla, thank you for everything you do.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And all the dignitaries here in this room from all over the Americas, thank you for coming to my hometown of Los Angeles, California.\u00a0 We welcome you.\nI\u2019m here on behalf of the entire Biden-Harris administration.\u00a0 I see some of the secretaries here and some folks who work in our White House with me.\u00a0 Thank you for all your work and thank you for being here to help us welcome this summit.\nI want to personally take a moment to thank my good friend and someone that I look up to very much.\u00a0 We\u2019ve now done a few events together over the last couple of weeks.\u00a0 I\u2019m talking about you, Madam Speaker.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You\u2019re such an inspiration to so many of us in this room.\u00a0 I get to see firsthand now every day what she does.\u00a0 I know the members see this every day.\u00a0 You\u2019re just truly outstanding.\u00a0 You really are \u2013 your work ethic.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just for Democrats; it\u2019s for the entire country, if not the entire world.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t say enough in private how wonderful you are, I\u2019ll say it once again publicly.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nAnd I got to know now-Secretary Blinken a couple years ago.\u00a0 We got to spend a lot of time together, and we are truly fortunate as a country and as a world to have Secretary Blinken as the Secretary of State of the United States of America.\u00a0 (Cheers.)\u00a0 So again, thank you.\u00a0 This man travels the world.\u00a0 He\u2019s everywhere.\u00a0 He works so hard.\u00a0 He accomplishes so much.\u00a0 So you\u2019ll hear from him in a minute.\u00a0 So thank you so much for your service to our country.\nI was just a teenager when I moved to southern California, but even as a young person it didn\u2019t take me long to realize how vibrant and how amazing and how dynamic this city of Los Angeles is.\u00a0 So like the people in this room, Los Angeles is a diverse city.\u00a0 We come from diverse backgrounds.\u00a0 We represent diverse perspectives.\u00a0 And we have ties all over this amazing world here in Los Angeles.\u00a0 And I spent a career in entertainment, so I know firsthand that Los Angeles is home to some of the most creative minds in the world.\u00a0 We got to see some of that in the museum here \u2013 people who inspire us through art, through music, through film, all here in Los Angeles.\u00a0 So I\u2019m glad for that reason that we\u2019re gathered here at one of the beacons of our city, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\u00a0 It\u2019s under a lot of construction and growth, so over the next couple years it\u2019s going to continue to be one of the greatest museums in the world right here in Los Angeles.\u00a0\nBut the Speaker mentioned this \u2013 administrator and I were at an event representing the arts today.\u00a0 Arts have this unique ability to unite people, to foster conversation, foster understanding, broaden our perspectives, inspire change, and really to heal, which is very much in the spirit of the Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 So as you prepare to enter the final days of the summit, I hope this evening\u2019s reception will continue to inspire you, and as we continue to work together to unite our region and bring us all together.\u00a0\nWith that, I would like to introduce my very good friend, Secretary Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 I know that I am the only thing standing between you and the opportunity to visit the extraordinary exhibits that we got a little taste of thanks to Michael and the team here.\u00a0 I really want to commend it to you.\u00a0 And in particular, there are extraordinary works that tie our entire hemisphere together and show the vibrancy of an extraordinary culture.\u00a0 So I really commend it to you.\u00a0 I hope you\u2019ll take the time to do that.\nDoug, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your kind words, but thank you also for your leadership of one of the most important challenges that we\u2019re facing here at the summit this week and beyond: ending the COVID-19 pandemic and also supporting the communities hit hardest by the pandemic.\nAnd Madam Speaker, Nancy, thank you for joining us tonight, but mostly thank you for what you do every single day in leading this country.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I think most of you know this:\u00a0 The Speaker has played a pivotal role in strengthening the United States\u2019 relationships with our partners across this hemisphere \u2013 empowering civil society, advancing women\u2019s rights, and so much more.\u00a0 Many of you know this as well because you\u2019ve worked with her and hosted congressional delegations that she\u2019s led to your countries.\u00a0 The Speaker has also long championed the enormous contributions that generations of immigrants from our hemisphere have made to the United States, including, of course, right here in California.\u00a0 Mostly, Madam Speaker, it\u2019s one of the privileges of my career to be able to serve at the same time that you are.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTo my fellow foreign ministers, representatives, observers who are here:\u00a0 Thank you, thank you, thank you for participating in this 9th Summit of the Americas and for the months of hard work that have gone into advancing our shared goals, more of which we\u2019ll hear about tomorrow.\nAnd Michael, again, thank you for hosting us here at LACMA.\nWe had a chance, as I said, to tour a part of the museum, including the Mixpantli exhibit which marks the 500th anniversary of the fall of the Aztec capital in modern-day Mexico City.\u00a0\nI want to point out one project and really commend it to you.\u00a0 It\u2019s called\u00a0We Are Here.\u00a0 It was created by artists and scholars from CIELO, an Indigenous women-led organization.\u00a0 The piece that you\u2019ll see is an interactive map that depicts the 20 Indigenous languages spoken today \u2013 today \u2013 in Los Angeles.\u00a0 It highlights Indigenous communities from Mexico and Central America who are adding to the richness of everyday life here \u2013 small business owners, teachers, students, so much more.\nAnd in this way, the map makes visible communities that have too often been rendered invisible across our shared hemisphere.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a fundamental step toward demanding rights that they and all communities are entitled to.\u00a0\nAs Mariah So, the main cartographer for this project, said recently, \u201c[Maps] create a reality just as much as they represent it.\u201d\u00a0\nThis is one project that reminds us of the remarkable diversity that we can see here in this room tonight and that we experience every single day across our hemisphere \u2013 the immense strength that lies in that diversity if we draw upon it.\nIt reminds us that we can build societies where more people have access to opportunity, instead of reserving those opportunities for the just well-off.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDrawing on that diversity, drawing on that diversity, building a future where all people in the Americas are empowered to reach their full potential \u2013 that\u2019s kind of what this summit is all about.\u00a0\nA few quick examples, and then I will leave you to the exhibits and to talking to so many friends you have here.\nThe America Health Corps initiative, which the United States developed in partnership with the Pan American Health Organization and others, will provide training to 500,000 \u2013 500,000 \u2013 health professionals, increasing access to health care for people across the Americas.\u00a0 It will do this by expanding existing training programs administered through the United States Government, as well as by increasing the capacity of PAHO\u2019s training platform.\nThe U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis, or PACC 2030, will support communities across the Caribbean as they adapt their infrastructure to withstanding the growing effects of the climate crisis. \u00a0The Vice President will lead these efforts and draw on the capabilities of governments, of businesses, of NGOs, and others to help our partners implement their national adaption plans.\nAnd by the way, I saw Secretary Kerry in the house, who \u2013 John.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 The extraordinary leadership that John is providing in actually helping our country and helping the world meet this crisis, the truly existential challenge of our time.\u00a0 Thank you for everything that you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I would mention too very quickly the Digital Agenda for Transformation in the Americas.\u00a0 This is the first-ever shared framework that we have in our hemisphere for our region\u2019s digital future, for example, by helping to expand internet access.\u00a0 We know we need to do that.\u00a0 We need to bridge the digital divide that exists within our countries and among our countries, particularly in historically marginalized communities.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be using digital technology to promote quality education and to connect small businesses to the marketplace.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re working on a number of other initiatives to deepen our ties even further.\u00a0 We\u2019ll talk about those more in the \u2013 over the next 24 hours.\u00a0 You heard the President speak to so many \u2013 so much of this today.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to belabor it tonight, but let me just say this in closing.\u00a0\nWe look forward to working with our existing partners on each and every one of these initiatives, to expanding the group of partners that we have so that more can effectively address the challenges and opportunities before us.\nBut here\u2019s the thing.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the challenge for all of us, especially my colleagues who are with us tonight.\u00a0 The more that we can ensure that we not only set out these commitments \u2013 but we actually deliver on them, we implement them, we do what we say \u2013 the more we\u2019re going to meet the demands of our people, the more we\u2019re going to be able to show that democracies can actually deliver results.\u00a0 That is the challenge for our time.\u00a0 I am so glad and grateful that we\u2019re all united in advancing that challenge together.\u00a0\nThank you all for being here and have a wonderful evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Michael.\nMR GOVAN:\u00a0 We are just so honored to have all of you here.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Enjoy food, drink, each other, and the galleries.\u00a0 Our brilliant curators are waiting if you want to go into the galleries and speak with them and learn about all of these exhibitions and artworks.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n"}, {"url":

The civil society members participating in the 9th Summit of the Americas condemn the dictatorships of Nicaragua, Cuba, and Venezuela.\u00a0 (Applause)\nAnd call upon all of the states to condemn all dictatorships and take the following actions to promote the right to democracy among the peoples of the Americas. \u00a0One, eliminate all forms of political violence and the immediate release of all persons deprived of their liberty who are imprisoned for political motives in all countries.\nTwo, protect those groups whose rights have been violated and those that are especially vulnerable. \u00a0For example, communities of African descent, indigenous, corruption whistleblowers, human rights and environmental protectors, LGBTQ+ communities, disabled persons, boys, girls, women, adolescents, young people, senior citizens, migrants, refugees, stateless persons, people in transit, scholars, and journalists.\nEradicate harassment and discrimination in the workplace; sexual abuse and exploitation; forced labor, partnerships and marriages; and human trafficking, in order to eliminate all forms of violence, political as well as against the dignity of human life.\nFour, guarantee and protect the right of the people, indigenous, rural, and communities of African descent, to the access to land, territory, and safe and balanced environment. \u00a0As well as their right to self-determination. \u00a0Achieve a regional agreement on migration, refuge, and internal displacement which includes structural measures to avoid the expulsion of migrants and respects the right to political asylum and international protections.\nSix, guarantee the independence of state powers. \u00a0Specifically, the judicial power and access to justice. \u00a0As well as the electoral agencies at the national and subnational level. \u00a0That there be no more impunities in the Americas. Guarantee the physical safety and legal status of civil society organizations and not criminalize national or international cooperation with them. \u00a0Including the management and execution of those resources. \u00a0Stop the advance of organized crime in the political class and the state capture, which takes advantage of populism to dismantle democratic institutions.\nNine, expand the participation of civil society and social actors in the inter-American system, summits, and general assemblies of the OAS. \u00a0Ensure the right to freedom of the press, free will, expression, and opinion. \u00a0Condemn the destabilizing actions of the Sao Paulo Forum and the Puebla Group on the hemisphere. \u00a0As well as the inherence of the Cuban dictatorship in any other state.\nThank you.\nOn the subject of transparency and anti-corruption, adopt transparency measures as to the expenditures, management, and execution of the public budget. \u00a0Encourage and facilitate the reporting of irregularities and acts of corruption, including money laundering, by protecting the whistleblowers and also identifying and making whole the victims of corruption. \u00a0Promote effective socialization and integrity measures. \u00a0Implement and broadcast public consults via accessible and friendly technology platforms in the legislative and public policy community development processes.\nCriminalize corruption and demand transparency in the management of public funds. Guarantee resources to work in the fight for democracy and against corruption. Criminally sanction public officials who are involved in corruption for the responsibility they hold. \u00a0Demand that multilateral organizations and agencies condition their financing and cooperation to the respect of human rights and integrity in management.\nStrengthen PASCA, composed of the Caribbean, United States and Canada.\n(I\u2019m almost done).\nOn the subject of citizen participation and inclusion, increase international cooperation to guarantee access to education, justice, and health for all persons, with special attention to vulnerable persons. \u00a0Encourage the inclusion of the youth, identities, disabled persons in the decision-making chain of governments. \u00a0Promote strategies to encourage diverse candidates to run for public office and the integration of vulnerable groups in the electoral process in all countries.\nImplement the necessary changes so that civil society organizations, social actors, and the private sector have a permanent representation in the GRIC (SIRG) and JTCC processes. \u00a0As well as active and collaborative participation in SISCA.\nWe call upon all member states to form a working group with civil society representatives and of the national legislative assemblies to fulfill the recommendations of the MESICIC (OEA). \u00a0To follow-through with the agreements of this summit, strategies must be included for publishing and training in the use of the proposed mechanisms. \u00a0As well as the work between the GRIC and the Joint Summit Task Force, civil society, and the private sector in order to evaluate the progress of governments regarding the implementation of the plan of action prior to the 10th Summit of the Americas.\nEssentially, good character, bolstered by values of faith, hope, charity, love, humility, perseverance, patience, equity, non-violence and non-discrimination are the antidote to corruption.\u00a0 Our governments need to create mechanisms that address human rights issues, transparency, and anti-corruption in order to achieve true and efficient democratic governance.\u00a0 As nations, we have the great challenge to overcome corruption and lack of transparency. \u00a0As well as deepen unity, brotherhood, and cooperation among the people and governments. \u00a0Taking into account, each person\u2019s right and dignity of each person to self-determination.\n\u201cPeace means respect for the rights of others.\u201d- Benito Juarez\nThank you very much.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Vanessa.\nThis is a summit that is hosted by the United States.\u00a0 We have three representative \u2013 government representatives here on the stage today.\u00a0 So I\u2019m going to give the floor to the host of the summit, the representative of the United States, Secretary Antony Blinken.\nSecretary, the floor is yours.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And let me start by saying \u2014 this is what this summit is all about.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just about governments meeting together, as important as that is \u2013 and it is important because it\u2019s been four \u2013 more than four years since the heads of government of our respective countries have come together.\u00a0 But it is about working with, hearing from, listening to all of the stakeholders in our societies \u2013 civil society, the business community, labor, young people, and what \u2013 the power of the summit is to bring all of us together.\u00a0 I hope that that includes a lot of interaction among the different groups, not just between the government representatives and civil society, but what we heard was a very powerful call for countries to adopt, adhere, implement basic democratic principles, all of which are founded in the democratic charter of our hemisphere that was launched actually at a Summit of the Americas in 2001 in effect, and took life, and should be the foundational document for all of us.\nWe all have shortcomings when it comes to this.\u00a0 We all need to be held accountable for those shortcomings.\u00a0 Civil society is a powerful way of doing that, and we value it even if we don\u2019t always make clear our appreciation.\u00a0 But making sure that this voice is heard is critically, critically important.\u00a0 It will animate what we do.\nAnd the last thing I\u2019ll just say is this is a critical time for our entire hemisphere.\u00a0 No region of the world has been more affected by COVID-19 than our region.\u00a0 We\u2019ve suffered more loss of life than any other part of the world.\u00a0 And all of the other repercussions that followed from that, including economic repercussions, where people are suffering.\nWe have about 30 percent of world GDP in our hemisphere.\u00a0 But we need to activate it, and we need to activate it in a more equitable fashion.\u00a0 So there has to be greater inclusion in what we\u2019re doing.\nBut we have COVID.\u00a0 We have climate.\u00a0 We have migration, which is at historic proportions.\u00a0 More people on the move in our hemisphere than at any time in memory, and that\u2019s also true around the world.\u00a0 We have the impact that technology is having on the lives of all of our people, and big digital divides among us.\u00a0 We have inequities in our health systems.\nAll of these things, as well as the shortcomings that our very societies have when it comes to democracy \u2013 these are things that we need to work on together.\u00a0 And in part, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do among our countries at the government level.\u00a0 Because we know this basic fact is true, and I think there\u2019s a recognition across most of the countries in our hemisphere: not a single one of the big challenges that we face that\u2019s actually having an impact on the lives of our citizens can be addressed by any one of us acting alone.\u00a0 And not only acting alone in terms of governments, but acting alone in terms of stakeholders.\u00a0 The only way we\u2019re going to get sustainable results is if we can somehow bring all of the stakeholders along together.\u00a0 It\u2019s very hard, it\u2019s very imperfect, it takes time, but that\u2019s the way to do it, and that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re meeting and listening to each other, and trying to learn from each other.\nSo in that spirit, I\u2019m really pleased to see everyone here, and want to keep listening.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Let\u2019s close the round of government officials on the stage.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Let\u2019s hear from M\u00e9lanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs from Canada.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s great to be here.\u00a0 Thank you, Tony, for hosting this important Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 I had the chance to meet some of you in the room before being here.\u00a0 I know that there are great people, strong women from Mexico and \u2013 yes, working on the question of women empowerment.\u00a0 Thank you for your work.\u00a0 I know I met some of you also that are working to make sure to combat poverty and make sure that education is available to children.\u00a0 So thank you.\u00a0 And I know a lot of you are coming from different perspectives and different walks of life, and are all about defending human rights and freedom of expression in your different countries.\u00a0 So thank you for being here.\u00a0 Merci d\u2019\u00eatre ici.\nWell, Tony has mentioned it a bit earlier, the Summit of the Americas, of what last happened in 2018.\u00a0 Let\u2019s all remember what has happened since 2018.\u00a0 Obviously the pandemic, but also we know that the war in Ukraine is having a real toll on gas prices, on cost of living, on affordability in general, and obviously we know that there has been and there will continue to be issues linked to the impact of climate change \u2013 definitely in the Caribbeans, but also throughout the hemisphere and throughout the world.\u00a0 And so more than ever, the discussions we\u2019re having at this Summit of the Americas and everything in line with foreign policy is having an impact in people\u2019s lives and in households, may you be in Erika\u2019s country, in Panama, in Canada, in the U.S., in Chile, et cetera.\nAnd so that is why it\u2019s important that we have this conversation together, because more than ever, your work is also important, and we need to make sure that we continue to talk to each other.\nThere\u2019s been some issues also in dealing with our own democracies within the hemisphere.\u00a0 We know that.\u00a0 There\u2019s been shining lights from President Cortizo in Panama, and Erika, you\u2019re part of this government, from Gabriel Boric\u2019s election in Chile, but there\u2019s been also democratic backsliding, and I am convinced that many of you in the room have opinions about that.\nAnd so we know that democracy is being threatened three ways.\u00a0 The first one is linked to the fact that there are some authoritarian new regimes and authoritarian leaders that are challenging democracies, and there\u2019s that fight on the world stage between both regimes.\u00a0 The second one is also democracies and democratic institutions being challenged at home within our own democracies and a mistrust of people towards the very possibility of countries being able to tackle these difficult issues.\u00a0 And the third one is the impact of the online discussion, so democracy and \u2013 in the digital age and the impact of misinformation and disinformation.\u00a0 That\u2019s definitely something we have to look into.\nSo thank you for being here.\u00a0 Clearly as the representative of Canada, it\u2019s a pleasure to be here and being a strong voice for human rights and feminist foreign policies and many other issues, and of course it\u2019s my goal to make sure that we have greater discussions and relationship between each other.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Merci beaucoup, Ms. \u2013 Madam Minister.\u00a0 And let\u2019s hear from the Minister of Foreign Affairs from Panama, Erika Mouynes.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MOUYNES:\u00a0 (Via translation). Thank you. I will be very brief because we are here to have a dialogue and we want to hear from you. \u00a0I think it is important you have a platform and that there really are key words \u2013 it is a frank and honest dialogue about what is happening. \u00a0If we do not start there, call things by their name, and really try to, jointly society and government, cooperatively to try to raise our voice when necessary, to mobilize in the sense and emergencies that occur, because yes, we are going through a lot of complicated crises.\u00a0 Climate crisis, we are going through a pandemic crisis, a crisis of an invasion in Ukraine. \u00a0But, none of those situations allows or lends the space for a negotiation about- gender equality is non-negotiable, freedom of speech is non-negotiable, human rights are non-negotiable. \u00a0So, let\u2019s talk, let\u2019s dialogue. \u00a0Let\u2019s get to the point. \u00a0The concerns- let\u2019s make sure that we as States are receiving, our raising and really representing all of the concerns that throughout the hemisphere civil society has.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 (Via translation.) Thank you very much, Minister.\nLet\u2019s close the round with the two other voices from civil society.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with Adela Panezo Asprilla from the Centro Familiar Afro Sante\u00f1o.\nMS PANEZO:\u00a0 (Via translation.)\u00a0 Good afternoon \u2014 I was saying that I am happy to be here precisely with our Panamanian Chancellor. \u00a0And the question that I have, we are, and you all have said it, we are going through a very difficult situation. \u00a0Particularly as a result of this pandemic that has affected all of our countries. \u00a0So civil society has been doing an excellent job and the result is what we are going through here, the whole process in which we have been participating with the society, as civil society. \u00a0And we have made the documents with the proposals we are making. \u00a0Which we hope you can all read, not just the synthesis but also the documents drafted in our sub-regions. \u00a0And that\u2019s the concern that remains for us, it is to really know if what we have put forth, all the work we have done throughout this process, which are proposals to improve the quality of life of our populations, to improve the state- the democratic situations that our countries are facing, if you all really, the members who are here, truthfully, in what way are you going to put into practice the follow-through to our proposals. \u00a0Because we believe that we should not just do a panel, we need to consider the proposals of all of civil society. \u00a0Because there\u2019s a representative part here, but there\u2019s others that also must be taken into account. So, that is our concern. \u00a0To see how far the disposition of all of you- we know that there are, we know that there are a lot of problems. \u00a0But, we need, more concrete solutions. \u00a0Because we continue to live in poor populations, that get poorer and poorer. \u00a0We continue to live through violence- the pandemic has increased violence. \u00a0And so we need to be able to improve these things with concrete measures that achieve a solution for the problems of our people. Especially those most violated (of rights), the people most impoverished.\u00a0 (Applause)\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 I really think that this is a critical point, how\u00a0\u2013 what the civil society has been done in the last weeks, it arrives to the desk of these people, the government officials, and ends in decisions that the society expects.\nBut before we hear from the politicians\u00a0\u2013 it is the tough questions, and we will expect some answers from you guys\u00a0\u2014\nQUESTION: It\u2019s a good question.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 It\u2019s a good question, yeah.\u00a0 But let\u2019s finish the round with Gale Mohammed-Oxley from the Social Actor.\nMOHAMMED-OXLEY: Good morning, everyone.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning.\nMS MOHAMMED-OXLEY:\u00a0 Thank you all for the cause observed.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pleasure to be present here.\u00a0 As the host country, thank you for accommodating us.\u00a0 Civil society has included social actors as part of the process since Panama.\u00a0 Now, yes, we have become a part of, but we are still apart from.\u00a0 Why I say this is because many of our social actors are not practicing politicians, and we have to face the agonizing attitude and the agonizing developments that politicians practice.\u00a0 Many of us prefer to stay away from conferences like this.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because we do not feel a part of.\u00a0 It\u2019s not part of our culture to be fighting, to be arguing, to be questioning unnecessarily, to be preventing, to oppose unnecessarily.\u00a0 We don\u2019t like that.\nSo therefore, my question:\u00a0 How can civil society and social actors implement our shared work plan \u2013 because we work together \u2013 from the Summit of America, from this ninth summit?\u00a0 How can we join the government, partner with governments to implement the proposals?\u00a0 That\u2019s my question.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 That\u2019s a good one, and I think it\u2019s related to the other one.\u00a0 So let\u2019s hear from our government representatives.\u00a0 Madam Minister.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Well, thank you.\u00a0 These are indeed the questions, because being \u2013 I\u2019m the foreign affairs minister of Canada, but I\u2019m also a member of parliament, directly elected, and therefore I really understand the legitimacy that comes with the fact of representing people directly in my riding of Montreal and being able to make sure that I serve them well in order to have the legitimacy to be at the cabinet table with Prime Minister Trudeau and really take decisions on \u2013 in terms of our foreign policy.\nAnd so it goes both ways.\u00a0 You guys have to be happy with the work we\u2019re doing, because if that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t be on the stage.\u00a0 And at the same time, we have to work together to find a way that when we take decisions based on your advice and your comments, that we can celebrate the solutions we found together.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s the balance we need to get to, because if we don\u2019t, and if there\u2019s just an idea of confrontation, which I clearly don\u2019t see in the room \u2013 not at all \u2013 but if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re not able to show to our citizens that democracy works, institution are \u2013 have a legitimacy and therefore we can be able to work on creating more opportunities and basically that government matters.\nI come from a country where a part \u2013 at the core of our constitution it\u2019s written peace, order, and good government, which is quite rare, quite frankly \u2013 good government.\u00a0 What is a good government?\u00a0 A good government is a government that is serving the people, but also that is able when serving the people to be efficient, that is able to make sure that we\u2019re addressing systemic issues from racism to poverty, but also that the people within Canada believe that government works and matter.\nSo on the international stage, this is how we conduct our businesses and our foreign policy.\u00a0 And it is, yes, about having solutions in the Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 I think clearly Tony can talk about them, but to help your health care system, to make sure that we can deal with the root causes of migration, and finally that we can really tackle the issue of climate change while building real infrastructure, helping making sure that people are able to deal with one more crisis that are happening on the environmental front that are having an impact on food crisis and just their capacity to work.\nSo that\u2019s what I would say to your tough questions, ladies.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Merci.\u00a0 Okay, minister.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MOUYNES:\u00a0 (Via translation.)\u00a0 I have a very simple answer and I think that the question \u201cwhat happens now?\u201d is very important.\u00a0 Because we are always experts in making queries and consultations and very long documents that say \u201cwhere did they go and how was it implemented.\u201d\u00a0 The end goal cannot be the photos of the flags and the leaders of all of the countries.\u00a0 That does not represent any result. It represents that we met. But, generate accountability, that is what is important.\u00a0 Because if not, we have thousands of wonderful speeches and there\u2019s a lack of coherence with the actions.\u00a0 One of the proposals we have put forth is that we begin these summits and these forums, discussing what we promised in the past and what was done.\u00a0 That way we know. (Applause)\nMS PAZCO:\u00a0 [Inaudible]\nFOREIGN MINISTER MOUYNES:\u00a0 (Via translation.)\u00a0 That is going to mean that we look back and we begin by putting into context with actions or not the lack of these. \u00a0Because frequently we arrive to meetings where we end up promising the same thing and there is no way to give follow-up and understand that we are talking the same discourse, lacking action.\u00a0 So I think that it is a valid question and a question that in the end, what needs to exist is a plan of action with a milestone for the next one: we don\u2019t meet again if we don\u2019t start by talking about what was done.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0So I find myself in violent agreement with my colleagues.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Both of them articulated it very powerfully, and I think in a way that should resonate with everyone.\u00a0 Let me just add on a couple of points.\nFirst \u2013 and you both said the same thing, and the questions are so important and have implied the same thing \u2013 we have a summit that takes part\u00a0\u2013 takes place, excuse me\u00a0\u2013 over three days.\u00a0 But the other 362 days of the year matter more because it really goes to whether we\u2019re actually going to do anything about what we\u2019ve said here in Los Angeles or what we said at previous summits.\u00a0 I think Erika\u2019s idea of imposing a report card on ourselves is a really good one.\u00a0 We should be held accountable for commitments that we\u2019ve made, principles that we\u2019ve said we\u2019d adhere to in the past, to see if we\u2019re really doing that.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a really good idea.\u00a0 I think we should take it on.\nBut I don\u2019t want to discount the fact that as challenging as it is, we are getting\u00a0\u2013 we are doing things that I think can have an impact, will have an impact, if we follow through.\u00a0 M\u00e9lanie mentioned the need to improve health care systems in all of our countries, not only to deal with hopefully preventing, and if not, effectively mitigating the next pandemic, but also, there are such huge disparities in health care within our countries and among our countries that we have to do better.\u00a0 Well, one of the things coming out of this summit is a commitment to fund 500\u00a0\u2013 the training for 500,000 health care workers, technicians, specialists across the hemisphere, will be in different parts of the\u00a0\u2013 of our hemisphere.\u00a0 If we make good on that commitment, that\u2019s going to have a real impact.\nOur Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading an effort to generate more private sector investment in countries of the so-called Northern Triangle \u2013 in Guatemala, in Honduras, in El\u00a0Salvador \u2013 because we know, of course, that the lack of opportunity is one of the main reasons why people end up becoming migrants and choosing to leave everything they know behind\u00a0\u2013 their families, their towns, their cities, their culture, their language\u00a0\u2013 and take an incredibly risky journey across the hemisphere.\u00a0 Well, you have to create opportunity, and one of the ways to create opportunity is to actually make investments in countries.\u00a0 That takes time, but there\u2019s now a commitment just as a result of the work the Vice President has done from the private sector to invest $3.2 billion in those countries.\nNow, it helps to have good, effective, transparent governance to make sure that those investments can proceed smoothly and actually get to where they need to go.\u00a0 We have work to do there.\u00a0 But these are concrete things, and we should be held to making good on them.\nSo the last thing I\u2019ll say is this because it goes to the questions that you\u2019ve raised that I think are very important:\u00a0 How do we make sure that 365 days a year, not just three days a year, we have this connectivity with all of the different stakeholders, that we are working together as best we can even though sometimes we represent different points of view, and that\u2019s the way it should be; and that if\u00a0\u2013 in the case of civil society, that you\u2019re there on the takeoff of initiatives, not just on the landing?\u00a0 That\u2019s on us to find ways to better work together.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s also on you to be willing to participate in that.\nAnd finally, it goes to something that M\u00e9lanie said that I think is true.\u00a0 We have to deal in a world\u00a0\u2013 and I\u00a0\u2013 we have to be pushed by those of us who seek the perfect.\u00a0 But my own country is not perfect.\u00a0 It never will be perfect.\u00a0 What we\u2019re about is a journey toward trying to be more perfect.\u00a0 And that\u2019s in inherent acknowledgment that we\u2019re not perfect.\u00a0 It\u2019s good that there are those who expect perfection.\u00a0 But in government, part of our challenge is trying to bring together all of the different interested groups, parties, stakeholders, and finding a way forward.\u00a0 And that way forward is probably not going to be perfect, but hopefully it\u2019s progress.\nMy boss, the President of the United States Joe Biden, likes to say on any given challenge that we face, when we come up with a solution that may be imperfect, he likes to say to those who are unhappy, \u201cDon\u2019t compare me to the Almighty.\u00a0 Compare me to the alternative.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo I hope we can keep that in mind, too, and work in a spirit of working forward together because here\u2019s the last thing on this:\u00a0 I think there is a growing recognition among those of us who are in government for \u2013 and I\u2019ve been doing this in one way or another for nearly 30 years \u2013 that if we\u2019re not able to bring along all of the different stakeholders on any given issue, whatever we do won\u2019t be sustainable.\u00a0 It won\u2019t hold up.\u00a0 It will fall apart.\u00a0 So simply out of rational interest, we should be doing this.\u00a0 It also happens to be the right thing to do, and sometimes it\u2019s nice when conscience meets practicality, and I think it\u2019s a necessity that we do this.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 Let\u2019s hear from Vanessa.\u00a0 This is a conversation.\u00a0 We have six minutes left.\u00a0 Vanessa, be short if you can, and then we will hear from other \u2014\nMS NEUMANN:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Very, very short and to the point, no secret that corruption is the biggest thing that turns governments away from their people, right.\u00a0 Makes the government genuflect to either nefarious foreign interests or particular criminal interests, and state capture is something that concerns all of us in civil society.\nI made \u2013 I spoke the recommendations from my group.\u00a0 They\u2019re not my recommendations; they\u2019re the group\u2019s.\u00a0 And I would like to hear from you and those in government three specific ways in which you will help us concretely combat corruption and state capture and the involvement of aspects of government, including militaries, in activities like drug trafficking.\u00a0 How are you going to help us get our governments back responsive to our people?\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Let\u2019s give one minute for each.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with minister from Panama.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Erika.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MOUYNES:\u00a0 One minute.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n(Via translation.)\u00a0 The fight against corruption- Let\u2019s see, confidence in government is eroding.\u00a0 What is happening in democracy in part is simply that there is a lot less confidence in our leaders.\u00a0 The same thing is happening to us in every country.\u00a0 As trust is lost, representativeness is lost.\u00a0 So the fight against corruption goes hand in hand in the own interest of all politicians who govern, because if they don\u2019t have that trust, they are not really representing and they are losing leadership.\nI believe that commitment [inaudible] and we are at a very delicate and conjunctural point.\u00a0 We have gone through a very complicated pandemic in which in every country we had scandals about the management of medical supplies, etc. \u00a0So then, where did that go directly?\u00a0 To the trust of all of our populations.\u00a0 And, why is that fight so important?\u00a0 Beyond society asking for it, it is in the very interest of all leaders to have it at the forefront everything that has to be done- and there\u2019s a lot we could talk about here about what can be done about corruption, from digitizing, accountability, etc. but it has to be an absolute priority.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Minister.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Yes, of course.\u00a0 Well, the question of corruption is really important because like Erika said, it has an aspect \u2013 has an impact on public trust.\u00a0 But also in general, it really has an impact on really being able to take the public\u2019s resources and to invest in public services.\u00a0 And so of course, I can understand the frustration, the \u2013 how can I say \u2013 not only frustration, but the revolt of people when looking at the impact of corruption in their country.\nSo this is something we take very seriously.\u00a0 Vanessa, you were asking us in terms of what do we think, but more what are the solutions.\u00a0 We think \u2013 Canada is in favor of creating an international anti-corruption tribunal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Yes, I think it\u2019s worth clapping, I think.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS NEUMANN:\u00a0 Yes, I\u2019ll applaud that.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Because we think it would help put pressure on countries and it would bring accountability in the face of injustice.\u00a0 So that\u2019s our goal and that\u2019s something we are willing to work with many countries, and, of course, it will be first democratic countries wanting to join in this very important project.\u00a0 But I think also that we can pressure other countries bit by bit to participate.\nAnd last but not least, there are all these principles and international norms.\u00a0 We call them the international rules-based order, which is important, yes.\u00a0 But one of the things that has been difficult is the question of accountability when a country doesn\u2019t respect the norms and principles that, for example, are at the core of what the United Nations have put into place since the Second World War.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it with Russia right now, but we are seeing it in other parts of the world as well.\u00a0 So we as a country has been \u2013 have been pushing for the question of accountability.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we were in favor of creating the international court of justice and that\u2019s why we\u2019re coming up with this new idea of creating an international anti-corruption court because I think it makes sense in the circumstances to push more accountability at the international level.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS NEUMANN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Merci.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m very tempted to say what they said and leave it at that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But just to almost emphasize what\u2019s been said, first, I agree very much with the question and with the ideas put forward by civil society in this.\u00a0 We know that corruption is perhaps the most corrosive, negative element in democracy. \u00a0We know that if you look at virtually every social movement around the world in the last 20 years, whether it was Tunisia, whether it was Egypt and Tahrir Square, some countries in our own hemisphere \u2013 I could go down the list \u2013 in virtually every instance, a revulsion at corruption was the main reason or certainly one of the main reasons for people to say, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\nBut to your point, we also see genuine state capture, where it becomes so endemic that it is incredibly difficult to root out because virtually everyone has an interest in perpetuating the system, and incredibly brave individuals are putting their futures and their lives on the line to say, \u201cNo, we reject this system.\u201d\u00a0 So we have to help give the tools.\nSo a few things in a practical way.\u00a0 One is, look, just putting a spotlight on the problem is in and of itself important \u2013 it\u2019s insufficient but it\u2019s important \u2013 and that\u2019s something we do.\u00a0 Creating tools and support for all of the different groups that are the most effective watchdogs when it comes to corruption is hugely important.\u00a0 We know the media is vitally important.\u00a0 We also know that it\u2019s under tremendous challenge.\u00a0 Some of us talked about this yesterday.\u00a0 Independent media in our hemisphere is \u2013 and other places in the world is constantly being threatened.\u00a0 Just in this year alone, 17 journalists in our hemisphere were killed doing their jobs, and a big part of their jobs has been exposing corruption.\nSo there are very concrete programs that we\u2019re putting in place, including through the Summit for Democracy that President Biden convened and this summit, to support independent media \u2013 to support it financially so that it can survive, to give journalists the tools to protect themselves against various efforts to stop them from doing what they\u2019re doing, whether it\u2019s through cyber technology, physical protection, to push back against states using laws against journalists \u2013 for example through lawsuits \u2013 to try to put them out of business.\u00a0 We now have a fund to support them so that they can effectively defend themselves and not go out of business in doing it.\u00a0 These are practical things, but we\u2019re driving that to make sure that there is an independent media.\nCivil society \u2013 coming out of this summit, the United States will be providing another almost $100 million between the State Department and USAID to about 300 civil society groups across our hemisphere so that they continue to be able to do their work, including finding ways to combat corruption.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s an international tribunal or whether it is existing mechanisms that have proven effective in our hemisphere through the United Nations, we support the work because sometimes bringing in an independent body is the only way that you\u2019re actually going to be able to do it.\u00a0 It\u2019s impossible to set that up sometimes within a state.\nA word that I know a lot of people don\u2019t like, but in this instance I think it can be very important: sanctions.\u00a0 We will continue to identify and, as necessary, sanction corrupt officials, because that is one way of disincentivizing them and disincentivizing others from engaging in these practices, including sanctions that prohibit them from coming to the United States, benefiting from our country, sending their children there, et cetera, et cetera. \u00a0If other countries did the same thing, that I think would create a lot of disincentives for people to engage in these in these practices. And then there are lots of things that can be done that different countries can look at, including my own country \u2013 for example, looking at things like beneficial ownership, who actually owns and is behind different institutions and different assets that are being used, including to advance state capture.\nSo there\u2019s a very practical list, but I really do think it starts with a common commitment to say that this is inherently in contradiction with the basic principles of our hemisphere, principles that all of our countries agreed to in the charter that should animate what we do.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR ALEGRET:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 I was advised to finish this panel sharp at quarter to 1:00, so I think it\u2019s time to thank the Secretary, ministers, and voices from civil society on your job, your work done in the last weeks, the last months, and since you took your positions.\u00a0 We trust you.\u00a0 We need you to work hard to those voices, those ideas ends up on your desk and changing things.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-secretary-general-of-the-organization-of-american-states-luis-almagro-at-a-meeting-of-the-summit-implementation-review-group/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

is the great power of being the chair.\u00a0 Again, welcome, everyone.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Welcome to Los Angeles.\u00a0 It is wonderful to see my fellow ministers, all of your teams here for the Ninth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 And welcome to each of you.\u00a0 Welcome to the Summit Implementation Review Group Ministerial.\nFor those of you who are not familiar with this group, it is made up of national coordinators from countries across our hemisphere, who negotiate the political commitments that our nations\u2019 leaders will adopt at the summit in the days ahead.\nMonths of work have gone into the commitments that we\u2019ll discuss today and to ensuring that our level of ambition meets the level of need of people across our shared hemisphere.\u00a0 And let me simply say this:\u00a0 We are deeply grateful for all of the efforts that our respective teams have made.\u00a0 Thank you, thank you, thank you.\nIn particular, I\u2019d like to thank my colleagues from Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guyana, Jamaica, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay, each of whom chaired working groups on the summit\u2019s five central themes: health and resilience, digital transformation, clean energy, environmental sustainability, and democratic governance.\u00a0 Your leadership was crucial to reaching the consensus that I expect we\u2019ll finalize today.\nI\u2019d also like to give a very special shout-out to our team\u2019s summit coordinator, Kevin O\u2019Reilly, and Kevin \u2013 where is Kevin?\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And our deputy coordinator, Dave Silverman, who is serving his seventh summit.\u00a0 There\u2019s got to be an award that goes with that.\u00a0 So thank you both for remarkable service and remarkable work.\nAnd I\u2019ll say this, too:\u00a0 I actually participated in the very first Summit of the Americas in 1994 in\u00a0 Miami.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to come full circle now here in Los Angeles.\nTo my friend and colleague, the secretary general of the OAS, Luis Almagro, welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be working with you as always.\u00a0 To Vice Chair Ducl\u00f3s Parodi, colleagues, the commitments that we will discuss are intended to address some of the most pressing challenges that we face in our hemisphere, including COVID-19; the climate crisis; deep inequity; and threats to democracy and human rights; as well, of course, as the migration crisis that all of these problems are contributing to drive even further.\nWe all know this from the work that we do every single day:\u00a0 None of these challenges stay within our national borders, and they\u2019re mutually reinforcing.\u00a0 When individual countries don\u2019t do enough to invest in detecting infectious disease or reducing emissions, it puts people across the region and the world at risk.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen, of course, how COVID-19 and the consequences of the climate crisis are hitting underserved communities the hardest, deepening inequities within our hemisphere.\nMuch like the problems, the solutions are interconnected.\u00a0 And to be effective, they have to reach across borders.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u00a0 That\u2019s really what it comes down to.\nAddressing these challenges also demands that we try to bridge the divide between domestic and foreign policy, whether we\u2019re working to improve health security or energy security; defending an open, secure, reliable internet; or strengthening regulations to make sure that illicit finance cannot find a safe haven in any of our countries.\u00a0 And you see that in the diverse teams that each of our countries has put together for these discussions and to try to tackle these problems.\nLet me simply focus us now on the five areas that we will discuss today and that our leaders will take up later.\nFirst, we will build greater health and pandemic resilience by strengthening our public health systems to ensure that people across our hemisphere have access to quality care.\u00a0 That includes expanding people- and community-centered health services, investing in education and training in medicine, public health, nutrition, biomedical science research.\u00a0 It also includes preparing for future health emergencies by strengthening our capacity to detect, to prevent, and to deal with future outbreaks of pandemics and other emergencies, improving coordination, transparency, accountability across the region, because when it comes to global health \u2013 we\u2019ve learned this \u2013 we\u2019re all in it together.\nSecond, we will establish the first-ever regional agenda on digital transformation to close an enduring digital divide in our societies so that all people can access and use the digital tools that are increasingly essential to their daily lives \u2013 from running a small business to getting an education.\u00a0 The agenda will include expanding internet access, particularly in historically marginalized communities, driving innovation and social inclusion through increased access to digital government services.\u00a0 It also includes expanding digital technology\u2019s role in promoting quality education, digital literacy, digital citizenry.\nThird, we will accelerate the region\u2019s transition to clean energy, drawing on the strength, the knowledge, the capabilities of governance, but also businesses, NGOs, researchers, communities across our hemisphere.\u00a0 We\u2019ll make it easier to share technical knowledge and best practices; to foster greater collaboration with the private sector and other stakeholders to identify opportunities for manufacturing or trade in clean energy goods and services; we\u2019ll advance sustainable, attainable, responsible mining sector principles; and secure the integration of mineral supply chains in our own hemisphere.\nFourth, we will double down on investing in climate resilience and adaptation to better equip our communities to deal with the changes to the environment that all of us are already experiencing, and which we know are going to grow no matter how effective we are in accelerating the shift to clean energy.\u00a0 That includes meeting our commitments to halt and reverse deforestation, decreasing the amount of carbon from land use activities, increasing our capacity to store carbon.\nFifth and finally, we will recommit ourselves to one of the core aspirations that brought us together 30 years ago, when the United States hosted the first Summit of the Americas in Miami: advancing democracy.\u00a0 We\u2019ll push ourselves, we\u2019ll push our neighbors across the region to shore up the rule of law, free and fair elections, human rights, and other pillars of free and open societies.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll work together to address common threats to our democracies, from corruption to disinformation.\nWe all know the democratic process is not always easy or swift.\u00a0 That\u2019s true within a single democracy.\u00a0 It\u2019s amplified when we bring together dozens of democracies, as we\u2019ve done for this summit.\u00a0 But the fact is we also acknowledge our shortcomings.\u00a0 They\u2019re out in the open.\u00a0 We don\u2019t sweep them under a rug.\u00a0 And we work to try to address them together, and ultimately that is the greatest strength that we bring to the table as democracies.\nAnd there are few regions in the world like this one, where you see so many democracies \u2013 from the left, from the right, from the center \u2013 that are able to set out a shared roadmap for addressing complex problems.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s something to celebrate even as we\u2019re clear-eyed about all of the work that we have ahead of us.\nAnother strength is that we don\u2019t lose sight of the people that we serve.\u00a0 A big part of this process has actually been listening \u2013 to individual citizens, to NGOs, to young people, to communities, to businesses, including those that are critical of how we\u2019re performing.\u00a0 The input we sought from stakeholders has been crucial to understanding what our people actually need from us, what they expect of us, what we need to try to deliver together.\nSo going forward, citizens will be critical partners in carrying out these efforts and holding us to our commitments that we make here at the summit.\u00a0 We\u2019re here for a few days, but this is 365 days every year that matter.\u00a0 And whatever we commit to here, we have to carry it forward.\u00a0 We have to work on it every day.\u00a0 We have to do it together.\u00a0 That\u2019s the spirit that we hope will come out of Los Angeles.\nWith that, it\u2019s my pleasure to give the floor to Secretary General Almagro.\u00a0 Luis.\nSECRETARY GENERAL ALMAGRO:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary of State.\n(Via interpreter) Thank you.\u00a0 And we want to thank the United States Government, the SIRG, Secretary of State Blinken, for getting us together before the summit.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, ministers, foreign affairs coordinators, national coordinators, summit coordinators, participants, representatives of the joint working group \u2013 Joint Summit Working Group.\nAs secretary general and the technical secretariat and institutional memory of the summit process, as president of the Joint Summit Working Group, we want to congratulate the host country for their leadership and for assuming this enormous responsibility in this Summit of the Americas.\nSince the summit was \u2013 became official in January of 2022, the president of SIRG has worked together with the participating delegates to include all the priorities.\u00a0 When the United States launched the Summit of the Americas in 1994, it was considered then that the democratic leaders of the hemisphere would work together as true partners for prosperity.\u00a0 Throughout the years, we have achieved important advances to achieve prosperity, democracy, and security in the Americas.\nHowever, though some of the challenges we faced at the time still persist, the current challenge have no precedent, in contrast to the first summit with a true consensus around democracy.\u00a0 Today, we definitely have to ensure that we achieve a democratic governance instrument as one fundamental to strengthen the democratic charter of the Americas.\nThe summit offers the leaders of the Americas the opportunity to reaffirm that commitment to democracy.\u00a0 Citizens who achieve this and the peoples who achieve this authority is through the adoption of a plan of action geared to strengthen this democratic governance.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than ever now that the governments, institutions, enterprises, and the citizens of the America work together to deal with these challenges and to create new opportunities to advance in the \u2013 with the objectives of the ninth summit.\u00a0 In this context, the Government of the United States has shown true determination in bringing a series of proposals that are essential for the economic, social recovery of the nation.\nThe ninth Summit of the Americas takes place as an opportunity to catalyze these responses to face the challenges of the regional scenario in topics related to health, energy transition, digital transformation, the defense of the democratic principles, the social dynamics and the security dynamic and the migration issues.\u00a0 In 2021, as a result of a series of consultations and dialogue with civil society, the national coordinators of the private sector summit and other involved sectors, they identified the priority topics for this host country.\u00a0 The inputs in the consultation became a reality of conducing a sustainable, resilient, and equitable future.\nAs a result of the many challenges faced by the countries of the region, the later context of COVID must be taken advantage to promote a collective agenda for which we must strengthen the coordination of all agents and reinforce multilateral coordination in the inter-American system.\u00a0 The whole system begins with this summit.\u00a0 It does not end here.\u00a0 It begins with the summit.\nIt\u2019s a new period of partnerships in the Americas.\u00a0 Today we have two entities of the inter-American system \u2013 United Nations, multilateral banks \u2013 who have actively participated throughout the negotiations.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had a chance to meet virtually with them, and we\u2019ve closely followed the evolution of all the discussions, with interest in identifying, of course, the financing sources because these efforts require that we pay several bills.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the effort that the host country has promoted to find the solutions needed by the hemisphere.\nAnd I want to end saying that in view of the social, political, economic, and health impacts caused by the COVID pandemic in the regions, it\u2019s necessary that we go back to the Sustainable Development Goals, which means that we adopt strategic measures to deal with the systemic and structural deficiencies and shortcomings in the region.\u00a0 This requires greater convergence amongst our institutions.\nWe call upon us to overcome differences so that we can truly achieve the implementation as a result of the work adopted.\u00a0 The role of the technical secretariat of the summit process will continue to harmonize the efforts of all regional, public, and private agents to support member countries around all the priorities adopted at this summit.\nI wish you a very productive and successful discussion and summit.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Gracias,\u00a0Luis.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a moment to let our colleagues from the media leave the room.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

So the fact that you\u2019re here today at this summit, we very much greatly appreciate.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Myron.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0\u00a0I want to ask you, Mr. Secretary, at the outset:\u00a0 As you look at this Summit of Americas, and not just the CEO summit of it but the broader summit that President Biden and you are engaging with all these leaders from the region, tell us what\u2019s important about it as you look at the foreign policy agenda, the administration, you think about it regionally, you think about it globally.\u00a0 How does this summit fit into it?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first, Myron, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for this partnership on our end, too.\u00a0 We can\u2019t do it without you.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a partnership in so many ways with the Chamber across so many issues.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s especially important in our own hemisphere, so I\u2019m grateful for everything that you\u2019ve done and that the Chamber has done to be such an important presence here at the summit over the next three days.\u00a0 Hugely, hugely, important.\nAnd this is a critical moment for us.\u00a0 On one level, it\u2019s pretty simple, and it\u2019s obvious but it\u2019s no more \u2013 no less important for being obvious.\u00a0 No other region in the world has the same direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of Americans than the hemisphere that we share.\u00a0 It\u2019s as simple as that.\u00a0 So to some extent as goes the hemisphere, so go we.\u00a0 And so we have a real stake in making sure that, together, we get this right.\u00a0 And again, to state the obvious, this is a time of incredible challenge for all of us.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a confluence of almost perfect storm events over the last few years that have had a profound effect here in the Americas: COVID, climate, some \u2013 a democratic deficit, migration, and of course the daily and changing impact of technologies on the lives of everyone.\u00a0 You put all that together, we\u2019ve lost 2.7 million lives \u2014\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 from COVID in our hemisphere.\u00a0 Our hemisphere has suffered the most from COVID.\u00a0 At the same time, it\u2019s 30 percent of global GDP.\u00a0 If we get our act together and mobilize that effectively, there is so much we can do.\u00a0 The leaders have not met in more than four years.\u00a0 It\u2019s time.\nBut to your point, and this is what I find so vital about this summit, as important as the government-to-government work is, that is far from the sum and substance of this gathering.\u00a0 We have the business community, we have civil society, we have young people, we have all the different stakeholders in our hemisphere.\u00a0 And if these three days, four days can galvanize some collective action together and then we can take that from the summit, I think we\u2019ll have done a good thing.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0\u00a0Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you for framing it in the context of all the things that this region has to think about \u2013 the pandemic, the return to health and the return to stronger economies.\u00a0 You have an economic plan that you want to talk about at this summit.\u00a0 Can you give us a preview about what that economic plan looks like and a little bit about how the private sector will play into that economic plan?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first, never get ahead of your boss, so the President \u2014\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0\u00a0Just a little bit of a \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Just a little bit.\u00a0 The President\u2019s going to be speaking to this later today, and I\u2019m very excited about that.\u00a0 It dovetails with a number of things that we\u2019re doing here.\u00a0 First, we have \u2013 with our partners throughout the region, we have a number of areas and issues that we\u2019re trying to drive together.\u00a0 There\u2019s going to be a lengthy summit declaration that you\u2019ll see that actually focuses in our work together on a number of areas, and the President\u2019s economic plan dovetails with those areas.\nSo for example, we need to build greater health resilience in our hemisphere in two ways: we need to be better prepared to manage a future pandemic, but also in the daily lives of people.\u00a0 We need to be able to provide better basic health services.\u00a0 There are huge disparities.\u00a0 One of the great things coming out of the summit \u2013 and this is where the private sector also is critical \u2013 is we have a commitment over the next couple of years to train 500,000 health professionals, generalists and specialists.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to make a huge difference if they are effectively deployed throughout our hemisphere in raising the basic level of health services.\u00a0 That\u2019s one, but the president\u2019s going to address some of that.\nSecond, on the climate and energy agenda, there are huge needs but also huge opportunities to come together in a way that actually is beneficial to our economies and also beneficial to climate, beneficial to our energy security and infrastructure development.\u00a0 He will speak to that.\u00a0 We have to do more and we will do more in a positive way to bridge digital divides that exist within our countries, but also within the hemisphere itself.\u00a0 Facilitating digital trade, doing it in a way that\u2019s secure, that upholds basic democratic principles, but that also is much more inclusive so that we bridge some of these divides.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to be a big part of it.\nBut also \u2013 and this is really imperative and this is, again, where our partnership with the private sector is so important \u2013 we have to find ways together and make good on commitments together to create an environment in which business can really work effectively.\nSo we know there remain huge challenges when it comes to everything from regulatory frameworks to corruption.\u00a0 It is vital that all of our partners \u2013 and we \u2013 work together to deal with these.\u00a0 Because, for example, as we\u2019ve discussed, there\u2019s a lot of capital out there.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not going to be deployed if the environment in which you want to deploy it is simply too risky and too complicated.\nWe have these conversations all the time with our counterparts.\u00a0 Hearing it from us is one thing; I think hearing it from the business community directly, that\u2019s important too.\u00a0 So the President\u2019s going to address all that.\nThere are huge infrastructure demands throughout the world; there are huge infrastructure demands in our hemisphere.\u00a0 How do we facilitate making sure that the government is playing its part in helping to support viable projects, in helping to mobilize capital?\u00a0 All of that will be there.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of where he\u2019s going to be; stay tuned.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0 Always smart not to get ahead of POTUS, of the President, your boss.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yes, it\u2019s a good rule.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0 Look, you talked about energy security, you talked about the digital transformation, you talked about digital trade \u2013 all these are important areas for business to be in partnership with government, and not just our government but governments around the region.\u00a0 How receptive is the message being heard in the region?\u00a0 Now, I know you\u2019re going to begin your bilaterals over the next couple days, you\u2019ll have the big summit \u2013 do you see government leaders across the region understanding that this is a critical moment to come together?\u00a0 Because we see quite a bit of change politically in the region, and I wonder how that factors into what you\u2019re trying to achieve.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, look.\u00a0 One of the, I think, strengths, in a sense, of our region, is \u2013 look, there are political differences.\u00a0 We have democratic governments of the left, of the right, and of the center.\u00a0 But despite what political differences there are, if the fundamentals are there, we\u2019re going to be able to work very, very effectively together.\u00a0 And whether it\u2019s of the left, the right, or the center, there\u2019s a common challenge for every single democracy in our hemisphere, and that\u2019s to actually deliver concrete results for people.\u00a0 One of the reasons you may see changes in governance is simply because people have lost faith in the \u2013 whatever the current existing administration is in a given country, whether it\u2019s left, right, or center, in its ability to deliver practical things, concrete things.\nSo my sense, Myron, is in our conversations, governments are very motivated to figure out how do we actually deliver.\u00a0 And it\u2019s partly because it\u2019s the right and necessary thing to do.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably the politically self-preservation thing to do as well.\nSo I think we have to work with that, work with partners, and find ways together to support change that creates the right environment \u2013 again, to, among other things, mobilize capital throughout the hemisphere.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0 Well, all those are very important principles and issues to think about.\u00a0 One thing that you\u2019ve talked about but I want to get a little deeper on is the rule of law \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yep.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0 For business leaders, rule of law is fundamental.\u00a0 We need certainty, we need transparency, we need accountability, and by the way, we want to be accountable also to the system.\u00a0 Talk to me about the Alliance for Development in Democracy.\u00a0 You have this pathway with a couple of countries in the region.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure you want to expand that to others.\u00a0 How does that fit into this narrative, and how does it link up to the business community in terms of us working with you?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So I think this is a terrific initiative and it brings together, as you know, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Panama.\u00a0 In fact, I had my counterparts from those countries in Washington three or four months ago for a meeting of this alliance.\u00a0 And we\u2019re focused on very practical things like: how do we make governance work better for people, how do we make sure it\u2019s inclusive, and how do we make sure that it does exactly what we\u2019re talking about, it creates a better environment for, among other things, investment?\nSo one of the things we talked about is using some of the digital tools that have been developed to make sure governments adopt them.\u00a0 That\u2019s a way of combatting corruption, which is one of the single biggest challenges we face not only in the hemisphere, but around the world.\u00a0 It cuts through red tape, so that also helps create a better business environment.\u00a0 These are the kinds of initiatives that, in a very practical way, we\u2019re trying to bring together.\u00a0 And if we can demonstrate among a small number of countries that this works, I expect that\u2019ll expand to others as well.\nBRILLIANT:\u00a0 What does success look like at the end of this summit?\u00a0 After our CEO summit, after your summit that the President leads, what does success look like, and how do we go forward and make sure that whatever is discussed here, we take into action?\u00a0 And here, you can challenge the private sector.\u00a0 We need to play a role.\u00a0 But what does success look like?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Look, I think the private sector\u2019s a critical partner on virtually everything that we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 And in fact, one of the greatest strengths we bring to the table is our ability to work together with the private sector in ways that other countries don\u2019t or can\u2019t.\u00a0 So we want to see that mobilized to the greatest extent possible.\nI think when it comes to the issues we\u2019ve talked about, when it comes to basic good governance, when it comes to transparency, when it comes to rule of law, when it comes to combatting corruption, I think that\u2019s something that the private sector rightly should and must insist on.\u00a0 And hearing it directly from the private sector makes a big difference.\u00a0 Certainly our partners hear it from us, and of course we have to deal with our own challenges, as we are.\nBut what does success look like?\u00a0 It\u2019s two things.\u00a0 Yes, it\u2019s what gets agreed at this \u2013 at the summit.\u00a0 There\u2019ll be important commitments; there\u2019ll be important initiatives; there\u2019ll be important declarations of intent.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0\u00a0Right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0But three days is not 365 days.\u00a0 This has to be done over 365 days.\u00a0 We have to hold ourselves accountable to what is agreed here, the commitments that all of us make to try to move forward, and then really see where we are at every step along the way.\u00a0 Are we delivering on that intent?\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to know that right away.\u00a0 So look, I think we\u2019ll have important \u2013 the lingo that we use \u2013 deliverables.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have good deliverables.\u00a0 But the deliverables are only as good as their implementation.\u00a0 They\u2019re only as good as the sustained commitment to getting them done.\nSo maybe we should come back together in Los Angeles in a year\u2019s time and see how we\u2019re doing.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0\u00a0Los Angeles or others?\u00a0 Well, this is the City of Angels, so I shouldn\u2019t say other cities.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve got a lot of great cities in this country that would be happy to have this forum.\nLook, I know you have limited time, and I want to ask you just sort of what should we be thinking about?\u00a0 What should the business community be thinking about?\u00a0 You\u2019ve mentioned the big issues.\u00a0 But what is it that we all need to be thinking about to drive home success?\u00a0 Underscoring everything you just said.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So for me, it\u2019s a pretty simple proposition.\u00a0 Not a single one of the issues that we\u2019re working on and that are actually having an impact on the lives of people in every country in this hemisphere \u2013 not a single one can we effectively deal with alone.\u00a0 And by alone, I mean no single government can do it and no \u2013 and even a group of governments can\u2019t do it because we need to have partnerships with the private sector, with civil society, with other major stakeholders.\u00a0 Climate, COVID, emerging technology, migration, all of these things defy unilateral solutions, either unilateral, again, on the part of a single government or unilateral on the part of a single stakeholder.\nSo it\u2019s in a sense as basic as that.\u00a0 If we can\u2019t find ways to effectively partner, we\u2019re not going to meet these challenges.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t meet these challenges, we\u2019re not going to be responsive to our citizens.\u00a0 And if we\u2019re not responsive to our citizens, they\u2019ll let us know.\nSo we need to get this right, but last thing I\u2019ll say is this, and I think you\u2019ll hear this from the President this afternoon because he is the eternal optimist and it\u2019s an occupational requirement.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 There\u2019s huge opportunity here.\u00a0 You all know this better than anyone.\u00a0 You can see it, you can feel it, and you\u2019re doing it.\u00a0 The Vice President, with the call to action for investment in the Northern Triangle countries, that\u2019s been a remarkable success \u2013 $3.2 billion in new investments generated just in the space of about a year.\nSo the opportunity is there.\u00a0 The question is: How do we effectively work together to seize it?\u00a0 And here, Myron, with the Chamber, hearing from you, talk \u2013 working with you, engaging with you so that we understand from the perspective of the business community what\u2019s needed, and then we can use what influence we have to try to create \u2013 help create that environment.\u00a0 That\u2019s hugely important.\nWe\u2019ll share the same with you, and I think if we\u2019re working together, we\u2019re going to get a lot done.\u00a0 You take a step at a time, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re traveling too far.\u00a0 As I say, in a year\u2019s time, maybe we\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve actually covered a little bit of distance.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0 Well, one thing, and I know we have to run, is \u2013 I would add to the agenda is food security.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0 Absolutely.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0 We talked about energy security, rule of law, governance \u2013 all of these are important.\u00a0 I think also at this time, with what\u2019s happening in Europe, we have to work together on the food security issue.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And I\u2019m really glad you raised that.\u00a0 And I know we\u2019re over time, but let me say a quick word about that because it\u2019s hugely important.\u00a0 We have a, here again, historic food insecurity crisis that is global in nature.\u00a0 Three years ago there were roughly 100 million people around the world who were considered severely food insecure.\u00a0 That went up to about 160 million people last year.\u00a0 Now, with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re adding another 40 million people to those who are severely food insecure around the world, so about 200 million people.\u00a0 This is reaching historic proportions.\nAnd here, too, we know we\u2019ve had a perfect storm.\u00a0 This has been the result of COVID.\u00a0 It\u2019s been the result of climate change.\u00a0 And now it\u2019s the result of conflict.\u00a0 So we obviously have to deal with the underlying conditions one way or another.\u00a0 But that\u2019s going to take time.\nIn the meantime, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve tried to bring countries together around the world to deal with the immediate challenge as well as the long-term challenge.\u00a0 We have the presidency of the UN Security Council in the month of May.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Rotating presidency.\u00a0 We decided to dedicate that presidency to focusing on food insecurity.\u00a0 I went up to New York, spent a couple of days there.\u00a0 We had about 40 countries together coming together on this, 40 foreign ministers, the Security Council itself, looking at the resources we need to put right now into the organizations that are helping deal with those who are food insecure \u2013 World Food Program, Food and Agricultural Organization, and others.\u00a0 We looked at what can be done, and the President has done it, to generate, for example, the production of more fertilizer, half a billion dollars from the United States, to make sure that are folks are producing more.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t have the fertilizer on the market, crop yields go down, prices go up.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019re doing that.\u00a0 Janet Yellen, our Secretary of the Treasury, is mobilizing the international financial institutions to help alleviate some of the financial burdens on countries that are dealing with this.\nAnd at the same time, of course, we\u2019re working, for example, to get wheat out of Ukraine.\u00a0 There are 25 million tons of wheat that are sitting in silos at the ports in Odessa.\u00a0 There\u2019s 84, 85 ships filled with grain that can\u2019t get out because of the Russian blockade.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to see that that gets lifted with the United Nations.\u00a0 And we\u2019re also working at other ways to get grain and other goods out of Ukraine so that they can get on to markets, people can have food, prices can go down.\u00a0 All of this coming together.\nBut it takes continued action.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to be working, for example, with the G7 countries to make sure that we are getting sustained action on this.\u00a0 We had a \u2013 there, too, in New York at the UN, now more than 80 countries have signed on to a call to action that has specific things that each of us need to do to address this crisis.\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0 Well, I know we\u2019re running up against the clock, and I know that you\u2019ve got staff that\u2019s ready to pull me.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve literally run against the \u2014\nMR BRILLIANT:\u00a0 And I would simply say, look, it may not be a fun job right now, but it\u2019s certainly an interesting job, and we are so grateful for your leadership and for the President\u2019s leadership at this critical time.\u00a0 And I would just simply hope that you\u2019re getting a little bit of a break periodically from your busy schedule.\u00a0 But thank you so much for being at this summit and for offering your perspectives.\u00a0 And very much appreciate the partnership that you expressed about the private sector and the Chamber in particular.\nSo please give him a round of applause.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0Thanks.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

very much.\u00a0 Well, good evening, everyone, and it is wonderful to be in Los Angeles, and particularly wonderful to be here in this extraordinary building.\u00a0 And I want to start by saying thank you, thank you, thank you to Arizona State\u2019s Cronkite School of Journalism, to USC\u2019s Annenberg School of Journalism, to the Equis Institute, for partnering with us and putting this event together; and also, as important \u2013 more important, even \u2013 for their leadership in promoting independent journalism and civic participation, and for training rising generations of media professionals.\nTo the journalists and civil society leaders from across the hemisphere who made the journey to Los Angeles: welcome.\u00a0 We\u2019re so grateful to have you here \u2013 and especially grateful for the crucial work that you do every single day.\nFinally, to any of the J-school students in the audience, we are heartened by the path that you\u2019re taking.\u00a0 Now, I say that with some degree of modest authority, as a one-time aspiring journalist myself.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m old enough that when I briefly practiced the profession, I did it on something called a typewriter.\u00a0 You can look it up.\u00a0 You\u2019ll find it somewhere on the internet.\u00a0 But take it from someone who never fully realized that aspiration \u2013 it is a challenging path.\u00a0 I suspect you know that already.\u00a0 But I couldn\u2019t be more inspired to see rising journalists here, and I\u2019m really looking forward to reading your bylines and hearing you and seeing you in the media over the years ahead.\nSo starting tomorrow, the Ninth Summit of the Americas is going to bring together governments, civil society, youth, the private sector, and citizens from across our hemisphere to try to see how, together, we can tackle the fundamental problems that our societies face and do a better job at delivering for our people.\u00a0 That is the mission that we set for ourselves.\nIn every country in the hemisphere, for every goal that we want to achieve, for every problem affecting the lives of our people, a free, independent press is essential.\nWe see that in the reporting around the hemisphere and the world \u2013 including by some people who are here today \u2013 whether that\u2019s digging into the toughest topics, like corruption or abuses by security services; or lifting up the stories of grassroots leaders who are finding solutions to complex problems, like the youth activists in small island states who are helping their communities adapt to rising seas and other changes that are brought on by climate change.\nReporting on issues like these shows how a free, independent press is quite literally a cornerstone of healthy democracies.\u00a0 And at its core is an idea, the idea that accurate information is a public good \u2013 one that helps people understand the events and forces shaping their lives; spotlights problems and solutions that they otherwise might not see; and, fundamentally, empowers citizens to engage meaningfully in their communities, their countries, and the world.\u00a0 In democracies, we often look to the media to provide this public good.\nIt\u2019s also the reason it\u2019s so important that governments like ours are open to scrutiny, to questions from the media \u2013 even when occasionally it\u2019s not the most comfortable thing to do.\u00a0 And you can take that from me as well.\nWhen I had the honor of becoming Secretary of State, one of the very first things I did was to reinstate the daily press briefing at the State Department.\u00a0 And our spokesperson, Ned Price, is here with us today.\u00a0 It\u2019s why, wherever I travel around the world, I make a point of holding press conferences where I take questions from local media as well as with some of the media colleagues who travel with us around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s why I\u2019ll take questions from you when I get done with these remarks.\nYet today, we see that the right to freedom of expression, including freedom of the press, faces profound challenges in our own hemisphere and around the world.\u00a0 Challenges that, if left unaddressed, could threaten the foundations of our democracies.\nSo what I\u2019d like to do in this time that I have now is to highlight three of the challenges that we see, and what the United States is doing \u2013 together with journalists, media organizations, NGOs, multilateral organizations, philanthropies, the private sector, and other governments \u2013 what we\u2019re all trying to do to tackle them.\nThe first challenge \u2013 this will not be news to anyone \u2013 is disinformation.\u00a0 Many speakers today have highlighted how governments and non-state actors are seizing on vulnerabilities in our media ecosystem to create, to disseminate, to amplify false or misleading information.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen how these falsehoods can polarize communities, poison the public square, undermine people\u2019s trust in health systems, government institutions, in democracy itself.\nToday, the United States is launching the first hub of the Digital Communication Network of the Americas.\u00a0 Since creating the DCN in 2015, we\u2019ve actually helped build a network of more than 8,000 journalists, educators, communicators and new media professionals, public officials and others around the world, who are working to combat state-sponsored disinformation and propaganda.\nThe network does this by developing and sharing evidence-based tools to help local actors provide people with accurate information.\nTake one example, the pandemic.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen governments and other actors intentionally spread false narratives about COVID-19\u2019s origin, its transmission, and treatments in an effort to stoke fear, to sow doubt, including about safe and effective vaccines, to erode trust in democracy itself \u2013 including deliberately targeting Spanish-language social media in this region.\nThe spread, the reach of disinformation online is, quite simply, staggering.\u00a0 One study that measured social media traffic over a 90-day period of the pandemic found that the entire World Health Organization COVID-19 site received only 25,000 social media engagements, compared to 2.1 million hits \u2013 million hits \u2013 for a single false story claiming that the coronavirus is a bioweapon stolen from Canada.\u00a0 That\u2019s wrong, by the way.\nIn response, DCN has connected investigative journalists, data scientists, public health officials to share effective strategies on disseminating accurate information about COVID-19 and debunking harmful myths on social media.\nThe strength of DCN is in the diversity and flatness of the network that\u2019s been created.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t try to prescribe one single solution, but what it does is it makes it easier for participants to learn from one another\u2019s responses \u2013 whether through webinars or trainings, online learning hubs or research exchanges, even games and apps.\u00a0 The new Americas chapter will complement DCN hubs in Africa and Europe, further broadening our network of partners and the ideas that they bring to the table.\nEven as we take steps to counter disinformation, we have to always guard against measures that give governments overly broad powers to criminalize, to censor, or otherwise quash freedom of expression, as we\u2019ve seen in the rash of so-called \u201cfake news\u201d laws passed by governments, some of which have been abused to harass or lock up journalists whose critical reporting the governments didn\u2019t like.\nThis brings me to a second challenge: the ongoing threats, harassment, the violence faced by media workers across the region.\nYou all know this, because many of you are living it.\nAt least 17 journalists have been killed in this hemisphere in this year, according to the UNESCO observatory of killed journalists, including \u2013 most recently \u2013 Yesenia Mollinedo and Sheila Johana Garcia, the director and a reporter of the news website El Veraz, in Veracruz, Mexico, shot to death on May the 9th.\nNo region in the world is more dangerous for journalists.\nCrimes like these persist in no small part because the people who order them and carry them out are so rarely held accountable.\u00a0 That sends a message that these attacks can continue with impunity.\nRepressive officials are also using new technologies to monitor journalists, to surveil their private communications \u2013 a practice unearthed, fittingly enough, through very dogged reporting.\nGovernments are using sweeping legislation to quash free expression, as we saw in the recent slate of amendments adopted by El Salvador in March and in April of this year.\nIn Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, the simple act of carrying out investigative journalism is a crime.\nIn Nicaragua, journalists and political opposition candidates Miguel Mora and Miguel Mendoza, newspaper publisher Juan Lorenzo Holmann are currently unjustly imprisoned, after being sentenced under abusive legislation in trials that lacked basic due process.\u00a0 Dozens of independent journalists have fled the country due to persecution and threats, including Anibal Toruno, Luis Chavarria Galeano, Jackson Orozco, who are with us this week at the summit.\nIn Cuba, independent journalists are subjected to systemic abuses, including house arrest for days, weeks at a time, beatings, forced exile.\nWhen individual journalists are attacked, when they\u2019re persecuted, when they\u2019re imprisoned, when they\u2019re targeted in any other way, the chilling effects reach far beyond the immediate victims.\u00a0 Sometimes this can lead to the shuttering of a publication.\u00a0 Other times, it can lead other reporters to self-censor or to leave the profession entirely.\nSo here\u2019s some of the things that we\u2019re trying to do about that.\nThe United States is working across the region to strengthen the rule of law, investing in training judges and prosecutors to investigate and prosecute such attacks, as well as those on human rights defenders and other civil society leaders.\nWe consistently speak up and speak out about attacks on journalists, in every country, in public and in private.\u00a0 We document governments\u2019 efforts to curtail freedom of expression in our annual human rights report.\nWe\u2019re deepening our engagement with multilateral bodies that advocate for freedom of expression and the safety of journalists around the world, using our seat at the table to try to make them even more effective.\u00a0 One of the reasons that it was so important for the United States to come back into these international organizations was to be able to assert some of this leadership at these tables.\u00a0 And we\u2019re helping to stand up new bodies to address emerging threats.\nWe\u2019re very proud to join the new OAS Group of Friends of Freedom of Expression and Journalism and we welcome the creation of the OAS\u2019s new Center for Media Integrity.\u00a0 Luis, thank you for your leadership on this.\u00a0 It\u2019s very, very important.\u00a0 And we\u2019re deepening our engagement in the Media Freedom Coalition.\nWe\u2019re also doing some very practical things that we hope will make a difference.\u00a0 For example, increasing support for journalists who are facing threats of harassment.\u00a0 USAID will provide up to $9 million to support a global Defamation Defense Fund for Journalists, which will offer liability coverage for journalists and news organizations targeted with unjust litigation.\u00a0 This is one of the tools that repressive governments use.\u00a0 They try to turn and distort the law against journalists by going after them with lawsuits that they can\u2019t afford to defend.\u00a0 We will help make sure that they can defend themselves.\nThe State Department is investing up to $3.5 million to launch a Journalism Protection Platform that will provide at-risk media professionals with physical and digital security training, psychosocial care, and other assistance when they are in one way or another under attack.\nThird, we\u2019re working to make independent media more sustainable.\u00a0 Put simply: we will not have a vibrant, independent press if more and more outlets are shutting down because they can\u2019t find a viable business model.\nThe United States is working with business groups, with the private sector, to help independent media become more financially sustainable.\u00a0 We\u2019re providing direct financial assistance to at-risk outlets.\u00a0 We\u2019ve committed $30 million to the International Fund for Public Interest Media, which will focus on assisting media in resource-poor and unstable settings, and $5 million to improve the financial viability of independent media outlets.\nWe\u2019re also encouraging other countries to engage in similar means of support.\u00a0 We had, as some of you know, a Summit for Democracy that President Biden convened last year.\u00a0 One of the main areas of focus of the summit was finding ways collectively to provide support to independent media.\nIn my own judgment, it\u2019s hard to think of a smarter investment in our democracies \u2013 given the incredibly brave and innovative work that journalists are doing throughout our region.\nJournalists like Catherine Calderon, who many of you heard from, I think, earlier today.\u00a0 Back in 2015, she was an activist.\u00a0 She was helping to organize demonstrations against corruption in Honduras.\u00a0 She kept running into Jennifer Avila, a journalist who was covering the protests.\u00a0 The more they talked, the more they saw a similar gap: For all the ways Hondurans were hurt by corruption in their everyday lives, no media outlet was conducting independent, rigorous reporting on the problem.\nThat, of course, was no accident.\u00a0 For years, Honduran activists and reporters who have tried to document corruption \u2013 and in particular, women \u2013 have been silenced through harassment, through threats, through discrimination, through violence.\nSo Catherine and Jennifer decided to launch a media outlet that would close that gap, and it was called\u00a0Contracorriente, or counter current.\u00a0 Since 2015,\u00a0Counter Current\u00a0has flourished.\u00a0 It\u2019s unearthed corruption at the highest levels of government, the military, the police, and it\u2019s led to high-profile resignations and even prosecutions.\u00a0 Reflecting on the founding of\u00a0Counter Current, Catherine said, and I quote, \u201cNow, more than ever, I feel it was necessary.\u00a0 We had to exist\u2026to be a space where we have the possibility of doing journalism\u2026without being silent.\u201d\nThe same is true for free, independent press across the hemisphere: It has to exist, now more than ever, for the well-being of our people, for the well-being of our communities, for the well-being of our democracies.\nThe United States is committed to being a partner not only in protecting this space but expanding it.\u00a0 Thanks very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I want to know how you justify the invitation to Dr. Ariel Henry from Haiti when he is ruling with no mandate in contravention of the nation\u2019s constitution, and then he\u2019s been implicated in, I think you would admit, very serious crimes, including the murder of a Haitian journalist just this February by the Haitian police.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So we\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity, I think, in the days ahead to talk about the summit, the participation in the summit, who\u2019s here, who\u2019s not.\u00a0 In Haiti, we continue to work for a transition that leads to appropriate elections that are supported by all the Haitian people.\u00a0 We continue to work to deal with gang violence that is afflicting the country and is doing terrible damage to the Haitian people.\u00a0 We continue to work to try to find ways to support the Haitian people, who have borne more than their share of trouble in the last years, both human and naturally made.\nSo in all of these ways we\u2019re working, including with partners in our hemisphere, to try to support the Haitian people.\u00a0 But we want to see them have a truly representative government, and that goes down the path of getting to new elections in the coming time.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But Prime Minister Henry is refusing to negotiate with civil society.\u00a0 Again, he is actually governing with no constitutional mandate.\u00a0 His government has been implicated in many different crimes, including potentially the murder of the past president.\u00a0 You yourself have said in your speech here today and in previous statements that countries like Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, that you mentioned are being excluded from the Summit of the Americas because you deem them to not be democratic.\nBut how can you use that as your justification when you have the so-called prime minister of Haiti, who is ruling under no sort of democratic mandate here, despite the fact that this is well-known in terms of the repression of journalists, the repression of protesters, and his previous involvement in the coup against President Aristide that\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0has at least alleged the United States Government was supportive of?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, we, like many other countries, are determined to get into the facts of what happened in Haiti, including the assassination of the previous prime minister.\u00a0 We\u2019re determined to find the facts wherever they lead and to whomever they lead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 What about (inaudible)?\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Okay, and now \u2013 well, now we would like to get started on our conversation that we have planned here today.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I \u2014\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I\u2019m excited to get started on this, and I think everyone will enjoy it as well.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have more time, of course, to answer these questions after the discussion that \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We\u2019ll be happy to follow up with these questions.\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 For sure.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 But Secretary Blinken, what about Shireen Abu Akleh \u2014\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you, all.\u00a0 We really want our panel (inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0 \u2014 who was murdered by Israeli forces, right?\u00a0 CNN just agreed to this.\u00a0 These are your two greatest allies in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Israel.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Again \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 They have murdered American journalists and there have been absolutely no repercussions, and you\u2019re sitting up here talking about the freedom of press and democracy.\u00a0 The United States is denying sovereignty to tens of millions of people around the globe with draconian sanctions for electing leaders that you do not like.\u00a0 Why is there no accountability for Israel or Saudi Arabia for murdering journalists?\u00a0 It is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist in Palestine.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I deplore the loss of Shireen.\u00a0 She was a remarkable journalist, an American citizen, as you well know.\u00a0 And there too we are determined to follow the facts and get to the truth of what happened to her.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The facts are established, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 No, they have not yet been \u2013 no, they have \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, with respect, they have not yet been established.\u00a0 We are looking for \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, they have.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 No, they have not.\u00a0 We are looking for an independent, credible investigation.\u00a0 When that investigation happens, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.\u00a0 It\u2019s as straightforward as that.\u00a0 That has not yet happened, but it\u2019s something that we very much want to see happen.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have time after the panel, of course, to talk more about this.\u00a0 But Madison, go ahead.\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Yes, so thanks for joining us here tonight.\u00a0 I\u2019m super honored and excited to be here.\u00a0 Now, one thing you mention in your remarks which I want to talk about a little more is the safety issues in journalism.\u00a0 Journalists in countries, including democracies, put their safety and lives on the line in order to do their job.\u00a0 And I know you talk about it a little bit in your remarks what the U.S. is doing, but what more do you think needs to be done to help ensure their safety?\nAnd to the other journalists up here, is that something that kind of worries you guys entering this workforce?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, I think especially for reporters who are working in areas of conflict or working on societies where governments are engaged in repressive actions, the risk of doing the job is acute.\u00a0 And as I mentioned, in our own hemisphere just in this year, a year that is only half over, 17 journalists at least have been killed, as documented by UNESCO.\u00a0 So this is something that we take very, very seriously.\nAnd a number of things I mentioned go directly at trying to help give journalists, especially in independent media where the resources may not be the same as for major media organizations, some tools to more effectively protect themselves faced with these dangers.\u00a0 And it goes from everything to having the right tools to deal with their cyber security, to deal with their physical security, and also to deal with their legal and economic security.\u00a0 All of these things are very practical programs that we\u2019re working on, that we\u2019re putting in place.\u00a0 And not only are we doing it, we\u2019re trying to do it with other countries around the world.\u00a0 As I mentioned, at the Summit for Democracy that President Biden convened last year, this was one of the lines of effort that we put into place.\nIt\u2019s also really important that we provide support for NGOs and other groups that are engaged in this kind of work in helping journalists, but we want to make sure as well that we\u2019re hearing from people so that we understand exactly what they\u2019re facing and maybe how we can be more helpful in helping them face it.\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Yeah, and do one of you guys want to answer?\u00a0 Yeah.\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0\u00a0I think part of why I love doing this is because it\u2019s always new every single day.\u00a0 You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get yourself into, but that comes with a lot of safety issues.\u00a0 Granted, I\u2019m a journalist right now in Illinois.\u00a0 It\u2019s not somewhere where there\u2019s a ton of conflict in terms of places abroad like we\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of emotion when it comes to that.\u00a0 But I think it fuels me more than anything to keep on going, and I just hope tonight we can kind of come to a consensus and find solutions and push the conversation forward to make sure that people feel welcomed to start in this path and keep it going.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 But is this something \u2013 as you\u2019re thinking about and are engaged in careers, is this something that you\u2019re actually thinking about that\u2019s a concern, that is a \u2014\nMS BAITTO:\u00a0 Definitely.\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Oh yeah, definitely.\u00a0 Even here in the U.S. when there has been different protests in the last several years, you see videos surface of stuff that happens to journalists.\u00a0 So me seeing that as someone who\u2019s entering this career field, that\u2019s something that scares me.\u00a0 You can go out and cover something, emotions are high, and something can happen here and abroad.\nMS VILLALOBOS:\u00a0\u00a0There was something in your remarks that stuck out to me because there was a student at Cronkite that was part of her grad program.\u00a0 She was trying to see if there are some courses that we could put into place about teaching safety to journalists, how to defend yourself when you\u2019re out there, or even just teaching things that might not be common sense to everyone about keeping yourself safe.\u00a0 And just hearing that in your remarks, seeing that we may be doing things like that on a national level, it just really resonated with me.\u00a0 And I think that that\u2019s a great idea.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s kind of an extraordinary observation and comment because the idea that that would have been part, for example, of a journalism school curriculum 25 or 30 years ago, probably not.\u00a0 So in many ways it\u2019s a sad commentary, but it\u2019s also, I think, a commentary on the fact that at least in different ways we\u2019re trying to step up to this problem.\nAnd I certainly hope that it doesn\u2019t have the chilling effect that it\u2019s designed to have, but that takes incredible courage.\u00a0 It takes determination.\u00a0 But what I found is a common denominator in the many years that I\u2019ve been either a journalist myself for a brief period of time or working with journalists is an almost unquenchable desire to get at the truth, to get at the facts, including our two friends who raised questions just a few minutes ago.\nThat\u2019s what we need.\u00a0 We need to continue.\u00a0 We need to be held accountable, but we also need to make sure that the structures, the protections are in place to allow people to do their jobs without fear of retribution of whatever kind.\u00a0 And yes, the only way this should really happen is for our friends in the press to be yelling at me, not to have other people yelling at them.\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Of course.\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 And one thing that I think is significant, you wanted to kind of get into the journalism field and have had practice in it.\u00a0 Do you think, when you had the idea to possibly go forward with this, was there \u2013 as a \u2013 was it as pervasive back then to be scared and to have some apprehensions in possibly becoming a journalist?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It really depended what you were doing.\u00a0 I had a good friend when I started out; we were on our college newspaper together, and then after school he went into reporting professionally and he wound up going to Central America in the 1980s.\u00a0 So that was a challenging time, and that was not without its own kind of dangers. \u00a0Other reporters famously were in Asia and other places in times of \u2013 in places of conflict.\nSo I think there\u2019s been a long history of reporters obviously being in places of conflict.\u00a0 I think what\u2019s changed in a sense is that the terrain of conflict has broadened out, and the kind of practices that some governments and others engage in has changed to make it more challenging for journalists in a broader variety of places than before.\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Yeah, and one thing I\u2019ve noticed is as generations go on, I feel like there\u2019s been a loss of trust in media.\u00a0 I was actually talking to my grandfather about this the other day, and he said when he was growing up, he would watch the news, he would listen to Walter Cronkite, and you just trusted.\u00a0 You had this trust.\u00a0 But now I feel like we\u2019ve lost so much trust as journalists, and I think in the past few years we\u2019ve definitely seen people in power say things about the media and it obviously \u2013 other people start to believe that too.\u00a0 So how can we rebuild that trust to get it to where it was once or even better?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the $64,000 questions and I\u2019m not \u2014\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 \u2014 sure that there\u2019s a good answer.\u00a0 But you\u2019re exactly right, and the Walter Cronkite example is a good one.\u00a0 When I started out as a reporter after college \u2013 this is in the mid-1980s, just to situate in time \u2013 as a practical matter, most Americans got their news from one of the three networks at night: ABC, CBS, NBC.\u00a0 There was a little bit of talk radio.\u00a0 There was obviously no internet, no social media.\u00a0 And there were these curators of the news at the networks and at the major newspapers \u2013 the\u00a0Times, had the\u00a0L.A. Times\u00a0out here,\u00a0The\u00a0Washington Post,\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0\u2013 and that was where a lot of people got their information.\u00a0 And of course, there was vitally important local media, which I\u2019ll come to in a minute.\u00a0 But you had these relatively small number of people who, in effect, edited the news that you consumed.\nAnd in many ways, I think there was an expectation \u2013 I certainly had it \u2013 that the democratization of information that we\u2019ve seen over the last 25 years would actually be a good thing, because there\u2019s something that isn\u2019t \u2013 doesn\u2019t quite sit right with a small handful of organizations having such a dominant role in shaping the information that most people receive.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve also seen some of the downside of that, to state the obvious, and it\u2019s very well known to just about everyone in this room.\u00a0 We\u2019ve lost these trusted mediators, trusted curators.\u00a0 Now everyone is a publisher.\u00a0 Some claim they\u2019re not publishers, but that\u2019s another matter.\u00a0 And as a result, we have an incredible ecosystem of information that people, myself included, have a real hard time deciphering, and finding sources that are genuinely trusted is something that is increasingly a challenge for people.\nSo whether we can recapture that in some fashion, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Now, one of the things that we\u2019ve tried to do is to help give people some of the tools to have digital literacy, to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, to try to make their own judgments about the news and information that they\u2019re consuming and not simply to take it at face value.\u00a0 But this, of course, gets into all sorts of other complicated complications about where people go to look for their information, and the fact that we\u2019re all, in effect, relegated to silos of our own choosing.\u00a0 There\u2019s a tremendous amount of self-selection, and we are all constantly looking for affirmation of the views that we bring to the table to begin with.\u00a0 That also doesn\u2019t make for the most healthy ecosystem.\nSo there\u2019s a lot that goes into this, and ultimately, it ideally starts with the individual consumer to somehow demand that that kind of trusted information be what is \u2013 what\u2019s out there on the market.\u00a0 But there\u2019s a lot that we could talk about.\nBut let me ask the three of you:\u00a0 So how do you see this?\u00a0 As people who are going into this field now at a time when trust for most institutions has been on a downward slope, including the media, how does that make you feel about the profession, and what would you want to do about it?\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 So I\u2019ve been working for two years, now that I graduated \u2013 I was the first class to graduate during the pandemic \u2013 and I started journalism school 2016, when I think that\u2019s the year we saw a huge shift in trusting the media.\u00a0 And so this is all I\u2019ve ever known.\u00a0 I\u2019ve only known that people don\u2019t like us and that they don\u2019t trust us, right?\u00a0 I mean, there\u2019s \u2013 the majority of us \u2013 people realize what we\u2019re doing and I think so, but there\u2019s bad actors there that totally might not really get behind what we\u2019re doing.\nBut I think if I have been able to navigate how to ethically and factually report during this tough time, I\u2019m ready to be thrown whatever is ahead.\u00a0 But just to be frank, I think we talk about the future of journalism and there\u2019s a lot of responsibility put on the new generation, as we should, right, because we\u2019re the ones on the front lines \u2013 the next ones.\u00a0 But if you guys don\u2019t have the answers, we definitely don\u2019t either, right?\u00a0 But I think together we can find them.\nBut it\u2019s going to be a give and take.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to take some time.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to take a lot of time, and it needs to start with education. \u00a0It needs to start with media literacy.\u00a0 People need to understand how to transparently obtain a news outlet where they should go, where shouldn\u2019t they go; what is factual, what is not; how do you figure that out on your own computer, on Facebook, on all these different outlets; and, honestly, to lead with compassion.\u00a0 I think a lot of us as journalists and some of the ones that have been veterans and have had great, long careers get desensitized, as they should.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sure one day I will, too.\u00a0 But I still have a lot of feelings towards everyone that I interview and all the stories that I tell, and I hope I don\u2019t lose that because I think when you do, you lose humanity and what we really are here to do is \u2013 and it\u2019s just give a voice to people that are \u2013 that don\u2019t have a platform.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, well, that\u2019s a wonderful way to look at it.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a wonderful motivation.\u00a0 I hope you don\u2019t lose sight of that.\u00a0 But here\u2019s the hard truth:\u00a0 We\u2019re looking to you \u2014\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 Of course.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 \u2014 and to your generation for the answers.\u00a0 We \u2014\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 We\u2019ll get there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 You\u2019re the ones who need to figure this out.\u00a0 We\u2019ll try our best.\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 Yes, yes.\nMS VILALOBOS:\u00a0 One of the points that you brought up earlier was about information overload, and that was actually one of the points that was brought up in a panel here earlier.\u00a0 How do you personally sift through your social media feed and everything?\u00a0 And I\u2019m sure sometimes your own face pops up on there.\u00a0 How do you handle that?\u00a0 How do you find what you think is the sources that you want to trust and things like that, and how can \u2013 if you\u2019re handling that, how can the public handle that as well?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It\u2019s the single biggest challenge that I think anyone in government faces, and it\u2019s a challenge that I\u2019ve seen evolve again over the last almost 30 years that I\u2019ve been doing this.\u00a0 When you had just a relatively limited number of sources of information 25 or 30 years ago, not only could you manage your day, but the pressure to respond was much less acute than it is now, than it\u2019s been for the last decade or so.\u00a0 There was a cushion, there was a gap in news emerging and then it really getting into the bloodstream of your community or your country.\nNow it\u2019s instantaneous.\u00a0 It\u2019s an intravenous feed, and that puts incredible pressure on people who are actually in government to react, to respond, to do something immediately.\u00a0 Having the discipline to try to take a little bit of distance \u2013 to not just jump at a report that concludes X, because maybe it\u2019s not conclusive; to actually have the distance and the remove to say no, we need to get to the facts, and even if there\u2019s tremendous pressure to respond to what seem to be the facts \u2013 that\u2019s not easy.\nWhen I worked for President Obama, one of the, I think, thoughts that he had about this was that his job in a sense was to be something of a circuit breaker and to try to create that distance that no longer really exists, that moment of reflection, of deliberation, of trying to understand what the facts are before you simply reflexively respond because there\u2019s pressure to do it and because you\u2019re perceived as somehow weak or feckless if you\u2019re not responding immediately.\u00a0 That\u2019s not an easy thing to do, but I think it is incumbent upon those of us who are in government or positions of public responsibility to at least try to do that.\nAnd I think the challenge that media faces between \u2013 it\u2019s a perennial challenge, but it\u2019s gotten worse because of the immediacy of information.\u00a0 The challenge between getting it right and getting it fast \u2013 there\u2019s a huge responsibility that comes with that, too.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a responsibility you\u2019re increasingly going to have to face in your careers, because the pressure on you to get it immediately \u2013 even if maybe you\u2019re not getting it right, right away \u2013 is pretty intense.\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 And then going on to like another topic, people these days with social media \u2013 anyone can be a journalist.\u00a0 Anyone can get their phone, livestream something, post a picture that could be taken out of context and post it somewhere, and then people start to believe that this is true and then you have the spread of fake news.\u00a0 But another issue with fake news I think we\u2019re seeing a lot is people will see something that could be factual, but it doesn\u2019t align with their preconceived ideas and this other thing that is actually fake does, and they call that fake news, and that spreads.\u00a0 And that\u2019s another issue with social media.\u00a0 Do you feel that there needs to be any more regulation with social media?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, one of the things I\u2019m going to try not to do is to delve into anything that smacks of politics or \u2014\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Because, happily, my job lets me stay out of that.\u00a0 But I think we\u2019re \u2013 clearly this is a fundamental debate that we\u2019re having, and now to get the \u2013 how to find where the right balance is is incredibly, incredibly challenging.\nYou mentioned as well, and these \u2013 a lot of these things join together \u2013 having the appropriate literacy to try to pull apart the information from the disinformation, the real from the fake, that\u2019s something that needs to start really, really early.\u00a0 One of the things we\u2019ve seen, for example, is that as we rightly devote a lot of resources, for example, to STEM education or STEAM education in our countries, well, usually they\u2019re finite budgets.\u00a0 And when you look at budgets in schools, one place that the money that goes to STEAM or STEM often comes from is civics.\u00a0 But if we\u2019re not teaching civics, we\u2019re not teaching the foundations that you need for something like digital literacy.\u00a0 And that creates a problem very early on that just builds and builds and builds, and then if you don\u2019t have a citizenry that has the tools to be able to deal with this information system, it makes it very, very challenging to deal with.\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 One thing that I\u2019m a little curious with, just checking your Twitter, there\u2019s been about more than a dozen tweets put on in the last 24 hours.\u00a0 Clearly you\u2019re not the social media influencer behind all of them, but what \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Every single one.\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 Every single one, word for word.\u00a0 But what is the process in which your team or one person, whatever it is, what is kind of the process that a tweet has to go through or any social media content has to go through when it has your name on it?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s a great question and one that I and we take very seriously, because if I\u2019m putting something out, then I\u2019m simply here as a representative of the United States Government, so anything that we put out is supposed to be \u2013 to represent the government, to be reflective of it, to be reflective of our policies, and I\u2019m simply a vehicle for doing that.\nSo we have a very carefully married-up operation between the folks on our communications team, the folks on our policy team, myself and other colleagues depending on what the subject is, and they need to know and understand each other in \u2013 almost intimately, because we have to make sure that whatever is going out under the State Department banner, whether it\u2019s in my name or anyone else\u2019s name, is an accurate reflection of the policies of our government and the President.\nSo a lot of care goes into that.\u00a0 We don\u2019t always get it 100 percent right, but we work at it every day.\nMS VILALOBOS:\u00a0 And this social media topic, I think that it\u2019s interesting.\u00a0 We as journalists are always writing headlines, writing topics, things like that.\u00a0 This era of clickbait culture and at-times sensational journalism, I think this is more of a \u2013 not so much a question as an idea.\u00a0 This is just taking over, and I think that \u2013 I think that just the \u2013 there\u2019s so many things that can go wrong when there is more drive for engagement in the headline rather than actual content in that headline.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, this goes to something we were talking about, and I was talking about a little bit earlier \u2013 is that there is a race to survive too.\u00a0 The economics of this business are increasingly challenged, increasingly complicated.\u00a0 That\u2019s especially true, of course, in print media.\u00a0 And so even social media, the clickbait phenomenon is part of \u2013 is partly making sure you get as many eyeballs as you can on something and then maybe drive the advertising revenues or drive your \u2013 so what used to be called readership.\u00a0 So all that pieces together.\nOne of the reasons we\u2019re trying to look for ways to build support for independent media is to help take some of that pressure off, and at least create a space where journalism is not motivated by that necessity.\nNow, having said that, I often thought it would be really great fun writing headlines for tabloids.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That just sounds like a great job.\u00a0 And just to date myself, again, one of the \u2013 I think the greatest \u2013 and I know I shouldn\u2019t comment on individual publications, but I always thought growing up that the headline writers for the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0have one of the best jobs in the business.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Because the inventiveness of those headlines are incredible, and there\u2019s just one that stuck with me from many, many years ago, back in the days of the Soviet Union.\u00a0 One of the leaders of the Soviet Union passed away and the headline in the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0the next day was \u201cRed Head Dead.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty good.\nMS BAIETTO:\u00a0 And I think for everyone we were really able to really talk about hopefully a good idea of where the future of journalism is going and hopefully inspires others.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, let me \u2014\nMS THOMAS:\u00a0 Thank you for joining us.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 No, let me just say to the three of you, first of all, it\u2019s really inspiring to be with you.\u00a0 It\u2019s inspiring to see others out here, both colleagues who are engaged in the profession today, people who are just joining it.\u00a0 I am so glad that you\u2019re doing this, as I\u2019m dead-serious about the proposition that this lies at the heart of our democracies.\u00a0 And as goes journalism, as goes a free media, so go our democracies.\nSo what you\u2019re doing is incredibly important.\u00a0 It\u2019s also incredibly challenging.\u00a0 It goes to, I think, what you were saying about, first of all, trying to find the humanity that\u2019s usually at the heart of things \u2013 to remember that, ultimately, you\u2019re reporting on, writing about real people, complicated, imperfect as human beings are, to try to reflect that.\u00a0 I know how hard it is too, because having been on both sides of this \u2013 when you\u2019re in government and you\u2019re in a room with 10 people and you\u2019re talking about a policy, and then if you ask the 10 people in the room who said what and what were the conclusions, you\u2019d probably get 10 different answers from people who were actually in the room.\u00a0 You\u2019re not in the room and you\u2019re trying to figure out what was said in the room.\nIt\u2019s incredibly hard, but it\u2019s incredibly, incredibly powerful and incredibly necessary.\u00a0 And I think having that drive to try to learn about something, to understand it, to know it, and then to be able to communicate it to your fellow citizens is a wonderful thing.\u00a0 So it\u2019s great to see all of you going into it.\u00a0 Thanks.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-at-the-inter-american-dialogue-mayors-workshop/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Thank you very much, and really, thanks to each and every one of you for joining us today. It\u2019s great to see so many colleagues on the screen. I especially want to thank my friend and colleague Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack for being here, helping to lead our discussion, and for everything that he and our colleagues are doing every single day to respond to what is, alas, a growing crisis.\nWe see the impact this is having on lives quite literally around the world. But to you, Tom; Cary, to you for everything that you\u2019re doing every single day \u2013 our special envoy for food security \u2013 I want each and every one of you to know that we\u2019re focused on this every day. And not just us; maybe most important from my perspective, the President, who is very, very engaged on the issue of what we can do to deal with food insecurity both in the near term but also in the long term.\nLet me just say a few words to get us started, turn it over to Tom, and then we are really eager to hear from you, to listen to you. As you all know very, very well, between 2016 and 2021 \u2013 last year \u2013 the number of people living in acute food insecurity jumped from about 100 million to 160 million people, in part because of the accelerating climate crisis as well, of course, as the pandemic, COVID-19, disrupting food supply chains, causing prices to spike in many places.\nThen, as Cary alluded to, Russian President Putin launched his unprovoked war of aggression on Ukraine. That\u2019s, of course, caused terrible suffering in Ukraine itself, its people, the country; but again, as you know very well, it\u2019s having a devastating impact on global food security because Ukraine is one of the breadbaskets of the world. It\u2019s a leading producer of wheat, of corn, sunflower oil, among other things. And quite literally every place I go, this is what I hear.\nRight now, a Russian naval blockade in the Black Sea is preventing Ukraine\u2019s crops from being shipped to their normal destinations. There are somewhere around 20 million tons of wheat that\u2019s trapped in silos near Odessa and in ships literally filled with grain that are stuck in the Odessa port because of this Russian blockade. Russian forces have captured some of Ukraine\u2019s most productive farmland. They planted explosives throughout the fields. They\u2019ve destroyed vital agricultural infrastructure. There are credible reports, including as we saw in one of our leading newspapers today, that Russia is pilfering Ukraine\u2019s grain exporters \u2013 exports, excuse me \u2013 to sell for its own profit. Now Russia is hoarding its food exports as well.\nSo this is all deliberate. We know that. President Putin is stopping food from being shipped and aggressively using his propaganda machine to deflect or distort responsibility because he hopes it\u2019ll get the world to give in to him and end the sanctions. In other words, quite simply put, it\u2019s blackmail.\nThe Kremlin needs to realize that it is exporting starvation and suffering well beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders, with countries in Africa that are experiencing an outsized share of the pain. And this is what I\u2019m hearing directly from counterparts throughout the continent. As the chair of the African Union, President Sall of Senegal told President Putin a few days ago the countries of Africa are victims of this conflict even though they are far, far, far away from the war.\nThis was also driven home at the UN a few weeks ago when I convened a meeting of more than 30 foreign ministers to help confront the crisis, as well as the Security Council. But we can\u2019t wait for President Putin to do the right thing. The rest of the world must urgently and collectively respond to the emergency.\nSo that brings us to today. You represent some of the world\u2019s leading food and agriculture businesses, top foundations, NGOs. Many of your teams have been fighting hunger and strengthening global food security for years, for decades. But we now have another critical moment in this fight, and simply put, we want to make sure that we\u2019re coordinating and collaborating with you to the greatest and most effective extent possible. This doesn\u2019t work if we\u2019re not working it together.\nOur administration\u2019s produced our own global action plan that focuses on five critical lines of effort that I\u2019ll just very briefly touch on before turning it over to Tom.\nFirst, we are providing aid to meet urgent needs, including more than $5.5 billion in food security and other humanitarian assistance since the Russian aggression. Some is going directly to countries. Some, of course, is going to international organizations like the World Food Program, like the International Fund for Agricultural Development, like the Food and Agriculture Organization.\nSecond, we\u2019re working with other countries to mitigate the global fertilizer shorage. For example, President Biden announced a $500 million investment to increase domestic fertilizer production, to lower costs, increase supply.\nThird: We are boosting agricultural capacity and resilience through the Feed the Future initiative. We\u2019re partnering with countries in Asia, Central America, East, Southern, and West Africa, to take on the longer-term challenges of building productive and effective agricultural sectors to help countries move from vulnerability ultimately to self-sufficiency.\nFourth, we\u2019re cushioning the macroeconomic shocks of this crisis \u2013 for example, by working with multilateral development banks to increase support for financial assistance programs worldwide, something that Treasury Secretary Yellen has been taking on with full force.\nAnd fifth, we are keeping this issue high on our diplomatic agenda, and that\u2019s going to continue for as long as the immediate crisis endures, but also as long as the underlying challenges endure. We\u2019re doing it in our bilateral engagements with partner countries in international forums of one kind or another and in our outreach to the private sector and NGO partners, including folks on this screen.\nWe need your expertise. We need your resources, your human resources. We need your networks. We need your best ideas to try to deal with the challenge we have before us. And we really want to know and learn from you about your assessment of the current situation; and then, looking ahead, what long-term food security problems you see looming on the horizon, not because of this war but also because of other dynamics that are in play.\nWe know that governments cannot solve this crisis without partners like you. We\u2019re grateful for all that you\u2019re doing. We\u2019re grateful for being in the fight with you, some of you for many, many years now. So I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from folks, but let me turn it back to Cary and/or turn it over to Tom.\nSECRETARY VILSACK: Mr. Secretary, thanks very much. I appreciate the opportunity to be with all of you today, and I think it\u2019s fair to say that we all know how complicated and how sophisticated global food systems are. And as Secretary Blinken indicated, it certainly under normal circumstances requires cooperation and coordination. But with COVID shutdowns, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, we now have deep concern about how we will get the food and fertilizer flowing efficiently, ensuring that our producers and those around the world have the necessary tools and continue to keep food on the dinner tables of people across the world. This is a monumental challenge.\nWe\u2019re joining here today, Secretary Blinken and I and Cary, because we really want to know what you know, and we also want you to know what the Biden administration is doing to addressing these problems through an all-of-government approach.\nNow, Secretary Blinken, who has been a tremendous advocate for focusing on food security, alerted you to the fact that we have made a $500 million or \u2013 and will be making a $500 million investment in modernizing fertilizer production and development, of more efficient use of fertilizers by farmers here in the U.S. We have also made a $2 billion investment based on the President\u2019s direction on our domestic food supply system to ensure greater resiliency in that system and to ensure that American consumers and producers are benefiting from fair prices and abundant supplies. We also drew down at the USDA the full $282 million from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, which is hopefully going to send U.S. commodities to countries in Africa and the Middle East that are feeling directly the effects of Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine and the subsequent disruptions.\nI\u2019ve been engaging as well with my counterparts around the world. Just last month I traveled to Germany for the G7 agricultural ministerial, which I followed up with a trip to Poland, where we discussed very similar topics to what we\u2019re delving into today. We\u2019re encouraging our allies and partners to come together to keep trade open, not to enact export bans, and to share best practices for sustainably increasing production to ensure that we\u2019re able to get food to those who most need it.\nThe knowledge of how to make those systems work most efficiently and at home are lessons that can be disseminated all around the world. Some of the organizations on this call helped to build the global trading system that has fed a global population by grew by 5 billion people since World War II by encouraging food to flow from surplus regions to food-deficient regions. It was built on the idea by removing trade barriers we could effectively and efficiently integrate our economies, generate innovation, grow and prosper together.\nDuring these times of stress, many countries consider becoming insular and to place less emphasis on partners and neighbors and allies. This is exactly the response that Putin was hoping we would get and he would have, but he didn\u2019t anticipate the solidarity that the international community has shown in large part because of the leadership of President Biden. He didn\u2019t think that the support would come and that countries would bind together to help, and he probably hoped that the tension would strain our relationships with one another. But in fact, he was wrong. We continue to prove him wrong by keeping the lines of trade open, by avoiding export restrictions, by sharing resources, and by working together through these difficult times.\nNow, as Secretary Blinken well knows as he\u2019s been so heavily and personally involved, we\u2019re conducting extensive diplomatic engagement to encourage all countries to refrain from these trade-restrictive measures like export bans and excessive stockpiling, which can exacerbate supply chain challenges and price inflation.\nI\u2019ve been encouraging countries to take this time to examine barriers to trade, including rules and standards that may be outdated. Now is not the time to fight on to uphold these barriers. We\u2019ve got to work together to remove them so that we can ensure a seamless trading system, the kind of cooperation via global agricultural markets that were so important to global food security.\nAs I listen to you today, I hope we hear from you some of the logistical challenges that we may face in trying to move that Ukrainian grain if ports are open or if an overland access route is established, in terms of the ability to access the trucks, the rail cars, and the loading equipment necessary to move that grain efficiently. I hope we\u2019re able to meet the testing and inspection equipment needs that were conveyed to me by the Ukrainian agricultural minister. I hope we learn how we can continue to contribute to the World Food Program so we can meet the challenges of eve-increasing global food insecurity. And I hope that if and when we\u2019re able to figure out ways in which fertilizer can be made available, that we do so in a way that enables all of us to be able to produce the food necessary to feed ever-increasing world populations.\nSo I look forward to the conversation. I appreciate Tony\u2019s inclusion of the Department of Agriculture in this important conversation, and I look forward to learning from all of you today.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-qatari-deputy-prime-minister-and-foreign-minister-mohammed-bin-abdulrahman-al-thani-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Benjamin Franklin Room", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "June 2, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Good morning, everyone. Today, the State Department is releasing the 2021 International Religious Freedom Report. This report offers a thorough, fact-based review of the state of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. We produce this document every year since 1998, starting under the leadership of then Secretary Albright, whose life and legacy we continue to celebrate.\nBack then, the Office of International Religious Freedom, which leads this annual process of drafting the report, was the only government entity in the world charged with monitoring and defending international religious freedom. Now, more than two decades later, we have more than 35 governments and multilateral organizations that have created offices that are dedicated to this goal.\nAnd I\u2019d like to thank the office for its efforts again this year under the leadership of Ambassador Rashad Hussain. This team has done remarkable work, and I very much appreciate the efforts.\nI also want to thank the hundreds of State Department officials around the world who gather information, conduct the fact-finding that\u2019s actually at the heart of this report. And all of us \u2013 all of us \u2013 are indebted to civil society, faith leaders, religious organizations, human rights groups, journalists, and others who share their perspectives and analysis, and who do the critical work of promoting religious freedom every day in every part of the world.\nWhen Secretary Albright first introduced this report, she noted that from our earliest days, Americans had believed, and I quote, \u201cthat nations are stronger, and the lives of their people richer, when citizens have the freedom to choose, proclaim, and exercise their religious identity.\u201d\nIndeed, religious freedom is the first freedom enshrined in our Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights. It\u2019s been recognized by nations around the world as a human right, including in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nRespect for religious freedom isn\u2019t only one of the deepest held values and a fundamental right. It\u2019s also, from my perspective, a vital foreign policy priority. Here\u2019s why. We know that when the fundamental right of each person to practice their faith or to choose not to observe a faith is respected, people can make their fullest contributions to their community\u2019s successes; entire societies are better off.\nOn the other hand, when governments deny this right, it ignites tension, it sows division, it often leads to instability and conflict.\nThis year\u2019s report includes several countries where we see notable progress, thanks to the work of governments, civil society organizations, and citizens. For example, last year the Kingdom of Morocco launched an initiative to renovate Jewish heritage sites like synagogues and cemeteries, and to include Jewish history in the Moroccan public school curriculum.\nIn Taiwan, authorities are making it easier to report employers who refuse to give their workers a weekly rest day in order to attend religious services.\nIn Timor-Leste, the new president, Ramos-Horta, recently pledged to defend the rights of all citizens regardless of religious background.\nAnd in Iraq, national leaders welcomed Pope Francis for the first ever papal visit to the country, where he conducted Christian and interfaith ceremonies in Baghdad, in Mosul, and in the Iraqi Kurdish region.\nOne local leader from the city of Nasiriyah, Sheikh Haider al-Dubaisi, later reflected on the Pope\u2019s visit, and he said, and I quote, \u201cHe came even though he could barely walk. He sent a message not only to Iraqis, but to the whole world, that Islam and other religions can sit together peacefully.\u201d\nSitting together peacefully. Ultimately, this report is about spreading that kind of progress to more parts of the world.\nUnfortunately, the report also shows that we have more work to do. In many parts of the world, governments are failing to respect their citizens\u2019 basic rights. Some governments continue to use blasphemy and apostacy laws, which banned defamation and renunciation of religion, to police the language of religious minorities. Others curtail expressions of religious belief like restrictions on religious attire.\nAnd all societies, including our own and across Europe, must do more to combat rising forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim sentiment.\nTo highlight a few examples, in March, based on extensive legal review of the evidence, I made the determination that Burma\u2019s military committed genocide and crimes against humanity with the intent to destroy predominantly Muslim Rohingya in 2017 \u2013 intent that was evidenced by, among other things, attacks on mosques, the use of religious and ethnic slurs, the desecration of Korans, among, again, many other actions.\nIn Eritrea, only four religious groups are permitted to practice their faith freely, while members of other religious minority groups have been detained, arrested, forced to renounce their faith as a precondition for their release.\nIn Saudi Arabia, we recognize the important recent moves to increase interfaith dialogue and religious tolerance. However, publicly practicing any faith other than Islam remains illegal, and the government continues to discriminate against members of religious minority communities.\nChina continues its genocide and repression of predominately Muslim Uyghurs and other religious minority groups. Since April 2017, more than 1 million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and others have been detained in internment camps in Xinjiang. The PRC continues to harass adherents of other religions that it deems out of line with Chinese Community Party doctrine, including by destroying Buddhist, Christian, Islamic, and Taoist houses of worship and by erecting barriers to employment and housing for Christians, Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and Falun Gong practitioners.\nIn Afghanistan, conditions for religious freedom have deteriorated dramatically under the Taliban, particularly as they crack down on the basic rights of women and girls to get an education, to work, to engage in society, often under the banner of religion. Meanwhile, ISIS-K is conducting increasingly violent attacks against religious minorities, particularly Shia Hazaras.\nIn Pakistan, at least 16 individuals accused of blasphemy were sentenced to death by Pakistani courts in 2021, though none of these sentences has yet to be carried out.\nBeyond these countries, the report documents how religious freedom and the rights of religious minorities are under threat in communities around the world.\nFor example, in India, the world\u2019s largest democracy and home to a great diversity of faiths, we\u2019ve seen rising attacks on people and places of worship; in Vietnam, where authorities harass members of unregistered religious communities; in Nigeria, where several state governments are using antidefamation and blasphemy laws to punish people for expressing their beliefs.\nThe United States will continue to stand up for religious freedom around the world. We\u2019ll keep working alongside other governments, multilateral organizations, civil society to do so, including next month at the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom.\nAt its core, our work is about ensuring that all people have the freedom to pursue the spiritual tradition that most adds meaning to their time on Earth. It\u2019s about giving people the chance to express themselves freely, which is part of being their fullest selves. That\u2019s the progress. That\u2019s the progress that this report hopes to help create.\nSo once again, I\u2019d like to thank everybody whose hard work made this report possible. And with that, I want to turn the floor over to the person who\u2019s maybe worked the hardest, Ambassador Hussain, to highlight a few themes from this year\u2019s report. Rashad, over to you. (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR HUSSAIN: Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary. I\u2019d like to thank President Biden, Vice President Harris, Secretary Blinken for leading United States global efforts to defend and advance human rights, including international religious freedom for all people everywhere. And I\u2019m grateful to our colleagues in governments and to thousands of civil society partners in the United States and around the globe, partners from all political and faith backgrounds, who were instrumental in developing the report.\nReligious freedom is a critical part of the American story. Our nation was founded centuries around by individuals fleeing religious persecution. It is natural then that freedom of religion was enshrined in America\u2019s founding documents, including in the First Amendment to our Constitution in our Bill of Rights. Freedom of religion is also a universal right enshrined in several international instruments and covenants, including in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nEarlier today, we transmitted this year\u2019s 2000-plus page Report on International Religious Freedom to Congress. And I\u2019d like to thank Bob Boehme, his editing team, and our colleagues at embassies and posts around the world for their tireless work in collecting the information that\u2019s in this year\u2019s report.\nThe report gives voice to countless individuals around the world who have been killed, beaten, threatened, harassed, or jailed for seeking to exercise their beliefs in accordance with the dictates of their conscience. The United States will continue to stand for those who are oppressed all over the world.\nOn the pages of this year\u2019s report are stories of individuals who have endured unspeakable persecution, governments that have sought to restrict religious belief, practice, and expression for people across a wide range of belief traditions. Non-state actors have targeted religious groups, attacked places of worship, and vilified religious, ethnic, and racial groups in their hateful narratives, including on social media platforms. From Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia; Jews in Europe; Baha\u2019is in Iran; Christians in North Korea, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia; Muslims in Burma and China; Catholics in Nicaragua; and atheists and humanists around the world, no community has been immune from these abuses.\nI\u2019d like to lay out three key themes in the report.\nFirst, too many governments use discriminatory laws and policies and abuse their own people. We have seen two genocides of religious minority communities in recent years \u2013 in China and in Burma.\nSecond, rising societal intolerance and hatred are fueling violence and conflict around the world. Governments must not sit silent or stand idly by in the face of such oppression.\nThird, powerful collaboration among civil society, governments, and multilateral partners has led to some progress and provides hope in addressing these complex challenges.\nTo provide concrete examples of how these themes are playing out around the world: first, far too many governments remain undeterred in the repression of their citizens. It comes as no surprise that the People\u2019s Republic of China is a glaring example here. The PRC Government continue to commit genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs who are predominantly Muslim and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups. The PRC uses sophisticated emerging technologies such as AI and facial recognition to surveil and maintain control of its open-air prison in Xinjiang. Behind all the evidence and data, the many reports of deaths in custody, torture, and physical abuse, there are thousands of Uyghur family members \u2013 daughters and sons are desperate to know where their parents are, but are terrified of what news they could discover and are wondering whether they will ever be safely reunited.\nThe PRC Government also continued its crackdown on Tibetan Buddhists. Authorities arrested, tortured, and committed other abuses against Tibetans who promoted their language and culture, possessed pictures and writings of the Dalai Lama, or practiced their religion at Buddhist monasteries. Secretary Blinken recently determined that the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya. Throughout Burma, already vulnerable communities, including civil society leaders and members of religious and ethnic minority groups, continue to face heightened risk of atrocities and other abuses.\nFollowing its designation as a Country of Particular Concern for the first time last year, Russia has doubled down on its violations of religious freedom rather than reverse course. Russian courts regularly reach new milestones for excessive prison sentences against individuals exercising their religious freedom, and Russian authorities carry out hundreds of home raids against suspected extremists that frequently include violence. President Putin sought to justify the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine through the blatantly false pretext of de-Nazification. The world clearly sees through this lie and is instead witnessing Russia\u2019s brutal suppression, including suppression of religious leaders and the appalling destruction of religious sites.\nReligious Freedom conditions in Afghanistan have deteriorated since the Taliban seized control. The Taliban regime and rival militant group ISIS-K have detained, intimidated, threatened, and attacked members of religious minority communities. And as the Secretary stated, in India some officials are ignoring or even supporting rising attacks on people and places of worship.\nTo elaborate further on the report\u2019s second theme, there are a number of ways that rising societal intolerance and hatred are fueling violence and conflict around the world. Governments must speak out and protect the vulnerable and marginalized. Anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim hatred, and xenophobia are on the rise in many countries. Democratic backsliding and the rise of nationalism and nativist rhetoric and policies have been used to justify violence towards members of ethnic or religious minority groups and historically marginalized peoples. Social media platforms are used to spread hate speech and to incite violence by vilifying and threatening members of religious minorities.\nAnd finally, I\u2019d like to say a little bit more about the report\u2019s third theme, how collaboration between civil society and government has created some progress. While this report paints a challenging picture of the state of religious freedom around the world, we remain hopeful about the future. Civil society groups and countries all over the world are essential to this report and to our work. Their advocacy changes laws, it lifts up the names of prisoners, provides lawyers to fight against spurious charges, and pushes governments including our own to do the right thing. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with civil society on powerful initiatives, such as the Marrakesh Declaration, which affirms the rights of Christians and other religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries, and the Istanbul Process, which rejects criminalization of blasphemy.\nIndependent and strong civil societies help governments solve problems and better serve their people by shining a light on the issues that matter most. Where civil society thrives, governments operate with more transparency and accountability, creating a tangible impact on the lives of everyday citizens. We must listen to and empower the voices of civil society, including those who dissent from majority views or criticize the government, as we work towards a more just and peaceful future for us all. Change is only possible with the hard work of the groups and individuals dedicated to fighting for these rights. Today, more than ever, we have tools at our disposal to facilitate the flow of information to keep individuals informed. We have mechanisms to shed light on abuses taking place, and we have the means to hold bad actors accountable.\nWe have more partners in this effort now than ever before, including religious leaders. And religion can be such a powerful force for good, and it should never be used to harm people. Our greatest hope is that together we can unite our efforts to ensure respect for freedom of religion or belief for all people around the globe, and we continue to stand in solidarity with all people seeking to exercise their beliefs.\nThank you. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you all. Appreciate the good work.

B. Du Bois wrote in\u00a0Foreign Affairs\u00a0about the global consequences of racism and colonialism. George Kennan \u2013 need I say more \u2013 if you go back and look at the infamous \u201cX\u201d long telegram, you will see, remarkably, passages in it that sound like they could have been written today.\u00a0Foreign Affairs\u00a0foresaw a number of the trends that are actually defining our lives today more broadly.\u00a0 We went back and looked at a number of issues over the years.\u00a0 Back in 2005, so some time ago when some of us were still literally using internet cafes to check our email, this magazine predicted the rise of all kinds of internet-enabled projects.\u00a0 Many of us, I think, may have read that at the time and not been able to foresee what\u00a0Foreign Affairs\u00a0did.\u00a0 Now we\u2019ve got cars with Wi-Fi and refrigerators that give us weather reports.\u00a0 Well,\u00a0Foreign Affairs\u00a0was on it early.\nBack in May/June of 2001, I was privileged to appear in the pages of\u00a0Foreign Affairs.\u00a0 The piece that I wrote then was titled \u201cThe False Crisis Over the Atlantic,\u201d and the case it made was that the interests of Europe and the United States were fundamentally aligned, whatever the differences of the day, and despite, at that period in time, a lot of fears of us growing apart.\u00a0 So here we are 21 years later; Europe and the United States are standing and acting together in the face of a very real crisis, and I would argue that not just in that crisis but beyond it, we are more aligned than we\u2019ve been in many years.\nSo let me say a few words about Ukraine-Russia and then we can get to a conversation.\nThe aggression that we\u2019re seeing from Russia has provoked an extraordinary response in Ukrainians who are fighting valiantly to defend their country, to defend their people, to defend their independence.\u00a0 They, of course, are foremost responsible for the success they\u2019ve had thus far in repelling the Russian aggression.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also fair to say that the strong support that they\u2019ve received from the United States and from many other countries around the world \u2013 security assistance, humanitarian assistance, economic assistance \u2013 has also been a difference-maker.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing that and, of course, keeping and even building pressure on Russia to end its aggression.\nToday, as many of you will have seen, President Biden announced a significant new security assistance package for Ukraine to help give the Ukrainians what they need now to deal with the particular nature of the challenge that they face now in southern and eastern Ukraine, and this will enable them to better defend their territory against the Russian onslaught.\nWe\u2019re also continuing to work with partners to try to address the crises that Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine has helped exacerbate or even provoke. \u00a0Number one on the top of the list is the food security crisis that we\u2019re seeing around the world.\u00a0 Already pre-existing conditions \u2013 climate, COVID, and now you add conflict \u2013 this has had a profound effect on the ability of a lot of food to get out of what has been a breadbasket for the world, Ukraine, as well as Russia itself for that matter, causing prices to spike in places where food actually is available, causing shortages in places where it is harder to get at.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working very hard on that.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to come back to that when we have a conversation.\nBut let me just say this.\u00a0 Even as the brutal fighting continues, we already see that President Putin has failed to achieve his broader strategic objectives.\u00a0 Instead of erasing Ukraine\u2019s independence, he strengthened it.\u00a0 Instead of asserting Russia\u2019s strength, he\u2019s undermined it.\u00a0 Instead of dividing and weakening the international order, he has actually brought countries closer together to defend it.\nYou all know this very well.\u00a0 This war is not just about Ukraine, even though its principal victims are, of course, Ukrainians.\u00a0 It is an assault, as well, on the fundamental principles of a rules-based international order, a phrase that we throw around a lot, particularly on 68th Street, but one that really still has meaning.\u00a0 And we find it has meaning for countries around the world.\u00a0 They know that these rules, these norms, these standards, these basic principles that we established many, many years ago to try to preserve peace and security actually have been relatively effective in doing that for all of the challenges we\u2019ve had in matching our ideals to practical realities.\u00a0 And they see these rules as being under assault by Russia in Ukraine, as well.\nFinally, let me just add a word on China, and then we\u2019ll have a conversation.\u00a0 Even as we\u2019re doing everything we can to stand up for Ukraine\u2019s security, for its democracy, for its independence, we will resolutely remain focused on other challenges that we face around the world, starting with what we see as the most serious long-term challenge to that rules-based order, and that\u2019s the challenge posed by the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nI gave a talk on China last week.\u00a0 In it I said that China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the ability to do so \u2013 economically, diplomatically, militarily, technologically.\u00a0 It\u2019s also an integral part, of course, of the global economy.\u00a0 It\u2019s critical to our ability to solve big, global challenges, from COVID to climate.\u00a0 So you put all that together, and that makes it, for us, the most consequential and complex relationship of any we have in the world.\u00a0 Simply put, we\u2019re going to have to be dealing with each other for years and years to come.\u00a0 The question is how most effectively to do that, in terms of our interests and our values.\nOne of the things that we believe strongly \u2013 and this has been a debate and discussion going on for many years in Washington and New York and in other places \u2013 but where we now land is that we can\u2019t rely on Beijing to change its own trajectory.\u00a0 What we can do, and what we\u2019re working to do, is to shape the strategic environment around Beijing to advance our positive vision for an open, inclusive international system.\nAs I described last week, summing it up, our plan is focused on three things: invest, align, compete.\nInvest in ourselves, something we\u2019ve gotten away from over many decades.\nAlign with our allies and partners, because our collective weight together has a much greater impact than any of our countries acting alone.\u00a0 When we\u2019re dealing with some action or conduct by China that we find objectionable, it\u2019s one thing when the United States takes it on alone, as 20, 25 percent of world GDP.\u00a0 It\u2019s another when we\u2019re aligned with partners and allies, and maybe it\u2019s 50 or 60 of world GDP.\nAnd then, finally, compete with China to defend our interests and build our vision for the future.\u00a0 At the same time, as we\u2019ve tried to make clear, we still see important areas of cooperation, and we\u2019ll pursue those wherever we can.\nThe last piece is this.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got a really hackneyed acronym that my colleagues here at State are sick of hearing me say, and it\u2019s R-O-W, ROW, rest of world.\u00a0 Beyond China, beyond the crisis in Ukraine, we\u2019re determined to ROW, to keep the focus on the rest of the world, to make sure that American diplomacy is engaged in trying to make things just a little bit better, a little bit more peaceful, a little bit more hopeful, a little bit more prosperous, a little safer for our own citizens.\nSo whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s dealing with crises and conflict from Ethiopia to Yemen, we\u2019re engaged, we\u2019re doing that.\u00a0 That\u2019s what our diplomacy is all about.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what President Biden asked us to do.\u00a0 He wanted to make sure that, even as we reasserted our engagement in the world, that we led with our diplomacy.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do.\nSo let me stop there.\u00a0 And Dan, back over to you.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Well, thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your kind words about the magazine, and we\u2019ll look forward to getting your byline back in at some point when you have time.\nLet me start with Ukraine, and especially the question of how we define success in U.S. policy, and I mean that in two regards.\nFirst, on the ground, the clear and insistent message from the administration is, as the President put in his op-ed yesterday, \u201cNothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\u201d\u00a0 Does that mean that, if the Ukrainians are ready to keep fighting and we go back to February 23rd lines, the United States is prepared to keep up our support, militarily and economically, until they have achieved what they want to achieve on the battlefield?\u00a0 Or if they say, \u201cWe want to go back to 2013 lines,\u201d even with regards to Crimea, would we continue that support?\nAnd then, second, with regard to Russia, you talked about the ways in which Russia has been weakened.\u00a0 The administration has talked about the need to deliver Russia a strategic defeat.\u00a0 Can you say more about what that looks like?\u00a0 How, in a successful scenario from the U.S. perspective, will Russia and Russian power look after this war, from the way it looked at the beginning?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 And those are \u2013 I think those are great bookend questions, because they, in fact, go together.\u00a0 A few things.\nFirst, when it comes to Ukraine, from my perspective, we cannot and will not be less Ukrainian than the Ukrainians.\u00a0 We\u2019re also not going to be more Ukrainian than the Ukrainians.\u00a0 And fundamentally, where this ends up really needs to be a decision by the Ukrainians, a decision that we\u2019ll support.\nBut broadly speaking, and this goes to the second part of your question, here\u2019s what we see as principles to guide us as we\u2019re working through this.\u00a0 First, whatever happens, we want to make sure that we end up with a Ukraine that is independent, sovereign, and has the capacity to defend itself and, ideally, deter any future aggressions, from Russia or from anyone else.\u00a0 That\u2019s one.\nSecond, Russia should have a lesser ability to repeat this exercise in the future.\u00a0 So some of the measures that we\u2019ve taken, including the export controls \u2013 which are having a significant impact and will have a growing impact on Russia\u2019s ability, for example, to modernize its defense sector\u00a0\u2013 those will, as I say, have an impact over time and make it maybe a little less likely that Russia does this in the future, as well as Ukraine\u2019s ability to really have a strong deterrent, something that we can do something about going forward.\nThird, we want to make sure that our NATO Alliance is doing what is necessary to shore up its own defense and deterrence.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made a very good start of that over \u2013 in recent months.\u00a0 We have a NATO summit coming up where we\u2019ll take that\u00a0\u2013 additional steps forward.\nAnd finally, two other things.\u00a0 I think we want to make sure that we use this aggression as an opportunity also to help Europeans as they move away from decades-long dependence on Russia for energy.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing that start in a very significant way, in ways we haven\u2019t seen before.\u00a0 We\u2019d like to see that continue, and we\u2019re taking steps to help.\nFinally, moving beyond Europe, it\u2019s important that China take the right lessons from this.\u00a0 And I think what China has seen thus far, at least, is countries coming together in unprecedented ways to make sure that we are supporting Ukraine in terms of providing it what it needs to defend itself, to deal with its economic situation, to deal with the humanitarian crisis; that we\u2019re exerting extraordinary pressure, unprecedented pressure, on Russia; and, as I said, that we\u2019re also making sure that our own defenses and deterrence are built up.\u00a0 China\u2019s looking at this very closely, very carefully.\u00a0 We want to make sure that it takes away the right lessons.\nBut fundamentally, Dan, where this actually ends up tactically on the battlefield, where lines are drawn, we are looking to Ukraine to decide that.\u00a0 We will continue to support them, to make sure that they have what they need to deal with Russian aggression now, and also that they have the strongest possible hand to play at a negotiating table if and when it emerges.\u00a0 I believe one eventually will.\u00a0 Most of these things end in some fashion diplomatically.\u00a0 I hope that that\u2019s sooner rather than later.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the signs we\u2019re seeing right now don\u2019t suggest that Russia\u2019s prepared to engage in a meaningful way in diplomacy.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0\u00a0And you mentioned the assistance package that the President announced yesterday, and one piece of that was multiple-launch rocket systems that the Ukrainians have been pressing for publicly, and I presume privately as well, for some time.\u00a0 This was the latest instance of what seems to be an intense and careful effort by you and your colleagues to weigh, on the one hand, the risks of escalation between the United States and Russia and NATO and Russia, and on the other hand, the need to give the Ukrainians what they say they need and what we assess they need to fight effectively on the battlefield.\nIn the case of the rocket systems, Foreign Minister Lavrov had, of course, warned that this would be, quote, \u201ca serious step toward unacceptable escalation.\u201d\u00a0 That was a warning that the administration evidently discounted.\u00a0 But can you talk through a bit how you assess that process, how you make that calculation, and why in this case you, despite that warning from the Russians, decided that this was a step the United States should take?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0First, as a matter of broad principle, our objective, of course, is to help the Ukrainians bring this aggression to an end, not to expand it, not to widen it, whether in Ukraine or beyond.\u00a0 President Biden\u2019s been clear about it from day one.\nSomething else the President\u2019s been very clear about from day one, including directly with President Putin, and that is exactly what we would do in the event that Russia pursued the aggression that it was threatening and that we saw coming many, many months ago, and he had conversations with President Putin well before the aggression began to just be very clear with him about what to expect: what to expect in terms of our support for Ukraine, including with security assistance, as well as economic and humanitarian assistance if that proved necessary; what to expect in terms of the massive consequences that would befall Russia if it pursued the aggression; what to expect in terms of NATO strengthening its own defenses.\nSo we have not been hiding the ball on that.\u00a0 There in a sense have been no surprises.\u00a0 All of this was made clear to President Putin well in advance in an effort to deter him from proceeding with the aggression.\u00a0 Tragically, he went ahead anyway.\nAnd then, Dan, all along we have tried to make sure that what we are providing to the Ukrainians, as well as what others are providing, meet the moment.\u00a0 And that is, the equipment we provide is what they need to deal with what Russia is actually doing.\u00a0 So for example, what was provided to the Ukrainians in the initial stages of the aggression, particularly in defense of Kyiv, with things like Stingers and Javelins, really answered the moment.\u00a0 And by the way, that\u2019s not something that started on February 24th or February 25th.\u00a0 It actually goes back to last Labor Day, when the President did an initial drawdown package.\u00a0 Another very significant drawdown package, as we call them \u2013 this is the release of articles that our Defense Department has at hand \u2013 another very significant one at Christmas, so well before February 24th.\u00a0 And then, of course, since February 24th, we\u2019re now on our 11th package.\u00a0 But each of these is tailored to meet the moment.\u00a0 As the conflict has changed, as it\u2019s moved to \u2013 away from Kyiv because of the extraordinary courage of Ukrainians, but armed with what they needed to push the Russians back \u2013 as this has moved to the south and east, the nature of the conflict has changed.\nAnd one of the things that is necessary \u2013 and we have heard from the Ukrainians on this \u2013 was the need for some longer-range artillery, because the Russians were now in a position where their supply lines were shorter because all of this is much closer to Russia.\u00a0 They controlled, before February 24th, a chunk of the Donbass.\u00a0 They could use that to position their forces and position their equipment, and then fire things at relatively long range at the Ukrainians.\u00a0 Ukrainians had to have some way of getting back at that and not simply being under fire from the Russians.\u00a0 So the systems that are being provided now are designed to help them do that.\nBut it was also important to us that we get assurances from Ukraine that this equipment would not be used to attack Russia in Russia because as I said at the start, we don\u2019t seek to escalate this conflict.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to bring it to a close, but bring it to a close in a way that defends the principles at stake and defends Ukraine\u2019s independence and sovereignty.\u00a0 So that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been \u2013 how we\u2019ve been looking at this.\u00a0 And, again, I think, whatever the Russians say, we\u2019ve been very clear from the start about what we were going to do, and we\u2019re doing it.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0\u00a0We could of course, keep going on Ukraine all afternoon, but let me keep your real caution in mind and turn to a different subject.\u00a0 You mentioned the speech you gave on China last week, and I\u2019d urge anyone who hasn\u2019t listened or read or read the speech to go do so because it really is the most substantial statement of U.S. strategy on China that\u2019s been made in some months.\u00a0 But I want to focus on one dimension of our strategy and our policy.\nYou stressed in that speech that we don\u2019t seek to block China from becoming strong, from becoming a major power.\u00a0 And yet you also made clear that Beijing\u2019s vision of and approach to global order is not acceptable from our perspective.\u00a0 The rejoinder from Chinese analysts and policymakers is that this is what they always hear from American officials, that we welcome your strength, but everything you do with that strength we find objectionable.\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering if you can say a bit about what the appropriate role for a strong China is.\u00a0 Are there ways in which the rules-based order of the international system can and should change to accommodate that strength?\u00a0 What do you see a strong China doing?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So a few things on this.\u00a0 It really is worth repeating and reiterating: we are not seeking to block China.\u00a0 We\u2019re not seeking to keep China down.\u00a0 As I said in the speech, we\u2019re certainly not looking for conflict, and we\u2019re not looking for a new Cold War.\u00a0 But the profound differences this.\u00a0 I believe China wants a world order, which is good because order is usually better than the alternative.\u00a0 But the profound difference is this:\u00a0 The order that we\u2019ve sought to build very imperfectly, but that we\u2019ve sought to build, is profoundly liberal in nature.\u00a0 The order that China seeks is illiberal.\u00a0 We disagree, and it\u2019s as basic and fundamental as that.\u00a0 And so to the extent that China\u2019s taking steps that would undermine the liberal, in the broadest sense of the term, nature of the order, we\u2019re going to oppose that.\u00a0 And again, we\u2019ve been clear about that.\u00a0 There\u2019s no secret to it.\nOn issue after issue, a China that is acting in a positive, productive way should be a major contributor to dealing with the problems that the world faces, from COVID to climate, non-proliferation.\u00a0 I could go down the list.\u00a0 And we will continue to seek its cooperation, its coordination, on that.\u00a0 Just a week ago, 10 days ago, we had the presidency of the UN Security Council this past month, in May.\u00a0 We used it to focus on the growing global food insecurity crisis that we\u2019re dealing with, a product of, as I said, of COVID, of climate, and now conflict because the Russian aggression in Ukraine is denying so much wheat and other grains to the world market, blockaded in Ukrainian ports by the Russians.\nWe\u2019ve sought to work with China on that.\u00a0 In fact, we invited them to take part in the ministerial meeting that we had on the food crisis.\u00a0 Regrettably, they chose not to join, but the door is open.\u00a0 China has a tremendous ability to use its power, its influence, to productive ends.\u00a0 And again, we would welcome that.\nOn COVID, it is vital going forward, even as we\u2019re trying to bring COVID to an end, that we build a stronger, more effective, more agile global health security system that includes better real-time exchange of information, access for experts, the ability to see some kind of pathogen emerging and to be able to do something about it.\u00a0 China could be a major player in that.\u00a0 I hope that it would be.\nSo in these in so many other issues \u2013 obviously non-proliferation when it comes to North Korea, when it comes to Iran \u2013 China has a major role to play.\u00a0 But ultimately \u2013 Dan, this is what I come back to \u2013 we can\u2019t decide for China.\u00a0 We don\u2019t purport to do that. We can\u2019t compel it to do X, Y, or Z.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to make its own decisions.\u00a0 What we can do is shape the environment in which it makes those decisions, and that\u2019s what the strategy that we put forward is all about, particularly when it comes to aligning with allies and partners.\u00a0 And there I have to say we have seen in the 15 months or so that we\u2019ve been in office a growing convergence in attitudes toward China, toward the challenge that it represents.\u00a0 Because some of the things that we\u2019re concerned about, we\u2019re not unique.\u00a0 There are shared concerns, shared grievances, and the more we\u2019re able to, as we say, align with other countries in dealing with them, the more effective we\u2019re going to be.\u00a0 Because again, if it\u2019s an economic matter, for example, if we\u2019re 20 or 25 percent of world GDP, well, that\u2019s one thing for China to have to contend with.\u00a0 If we\u2019re aligned with European partners, with Asian partners, it may be 50 or 60 percent of world GDP.\u00a0 That\u2019s a very different matter; it\u2019s something that China has to take seriously.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0 Let me go to one other ROW topic, and that is Saudi Arabia, and whether or not the President in fact goes later this month as has been reported.\u00a0 There has certainly been I think a surprising degree of progress in the relationship given the administration\u2019s statements about the crown prince and about the state of U.S.-Saudi relations early on in \u2013 after Inauguration Day.\u00a0 If the President does go, do you expect to see progress from Saudi on some of the human rights concerns that you expressed and the administration expressed early on?\u00a0 Do you expect to see certain steps taken to end the war in Yemen as a part of that trip, or is the need to open the oil spigots and the possibility of steps towards normalization with Israel sufficient reason enough for the President to go?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Dan, when we came in, President Biden was determined that we recalibrate the relationship with Saudi Arabia, and to make sure that it \u2013 that relationship was serving our own interests, as well as our values, as we move forward.\u00a0 But also preserving it, because it also helps us accomplish many important things, which I\u2019ll come to in a second.\u00a0 And that\u2019s largely what we\u2019ve done.\nOf course, we had the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\u00a0 That was something that we and so many others around the world took very, very seriously.\u00a0 One of the things that we did early on and that I did at the President\u2019s direction was, of course, to release our own report on his murder.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t underscore the \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the significance of that, because having that report out with the imprimatur of the United States Government I think has real meaning.\u00a0 At the same time, we initiated the so-called Khashoggi Ban to make sure that any country that seeks to use tools of repression against people abroad who are criticizing in one way or another, the government would pay a price for that.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve actually used it multiple times since.\nAt the same time, we thought it was very important to engage Saudi Arabia to deal with people\u2019s lives going forward, and to make sure that we were doing everything possible to help secure those lives.\u00a0 Yemen was one of the most important places that we wanted to do that.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve seen as a result of our work with Saudi Arabia, as well as with the UAE, and of course with the United Nations and some other countries, is real progress in actually dealing with one of the worst conflicts the world has seen over the last decade.\u00a0 We helped achieve the first truce in eight years in Yemen just a couple of months ago.\u00a0 I\u2019m hopeful that that truce is now going to be extended.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see what happens over the next couple of days.\nBut as a result of that, we have more humanitarian assistance moving to different parts of Yemen.\u00a0 We have, in effect, a \u2013 the guns relatively silenced, which means the people are not being killed and injured.\u00a0 We have attacks against Saudi Arabia that have ceased \u2013 and by the way, there are 70,000 Americans in Saudi Arabia, so not only do we have a commitment to defend Saudi Arabia as a partner, but we also have the interests of Americans to look out for.\u00a0 And we have the possibility, however fragile, of moving toward a more enduring peace in Yemen.\u00a0 Again, that\u2019s part of the recalibration of the relationship, and we\u2019re \u2013 applaud the work that Saudi Arabia\u2019s done to try to move us forward.\nAt the same time, we\u2019re engaging constantly, including me in my own conversations with my Saudi counterparts, on human rights in Saudi Arabia itself, including individual cases, as well as more systemic issues.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia is a critical partner to us in dealing with extremism in the region, in dealing with the challenges posed by Iran, and also I hope in continuing the process of building relationships between Israel and its neighbors both near and further away through the continuation, the expansion of the Abraham Accords.\nSo all of that is critical.\u00a0 And yes, energy of course is a critical piece to this, too.\u00a0 We want to make sure that there is sufficient supplies of energy on world markets at a time that this is being increasingly challenged.\u00a0 And we want to make sure that prices are held in check so that consumers don\u2019t suffer, and Saudi Arabia is a critical player.\nThe point I\u2019m making in a long way is we want to make sure that through the relationship we are addressing the totality of our interests in that relationship.\u00a0 And yes, that goes to values and it goes to human rights and democracy; it also goes to other interests that we have that are necessary for the well-being of the American people.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to put all of that together and take a comprehensive approach to Saudi Arabia, as we do with any other country.\u00a0 But I think you\u2019ve seen over the last 15 months or so a more effective recalibration that is making sure that our interests are front and center.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0 I\u2019m going to ask you a very quick, more personal question while Sam prepares questions from members and readers.\u00a0 You\u2019ve worked for at least two secretaries of state in the past.\u00a0 You\u2019ve observed many more in your various jobs over the last couple of decades.\u00a0 What has surprised you about being in the actual chair?\u00a0 What are the challenges that you did not anticipate or fully appreciate when you were a staffer?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So when I first started working for President Biden when he was in the Senate and he was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dan, I started with him back in 2002.\u00a0 And the job I held then was staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u00a0 And when I started, someone told me very presciently, there are two words in your title of staff director; only one of them counts, and it\u2019s not \u201cdirector.\u201d\u00a0 So like anyone who\u2019s been in staff jobs for many, many years, making the transition in and of itself is kind of interesting.\nBut I\u2019ve got to say it just gives you a greater appreciation for what those you\u2019ve worked for and worked with for many years have to engage in every day, because ultimately in any institution the buck stops somewhere.\u00a0 In this institution, the State Department, it stops with me.\u00a0 There\u2019s a much bigger buck that stops at the desk of the President, but that\u2019s a responsibility that I feel, that I feel strongly, and that is much more acute by actually sitting in the chair for however long I\u2019m in it.\u00a0 So I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably the most important thing.\nNow, having said that, I had one huge benefit coming into this job, which is I got to spend two years as John Kerry\u2019s deputy during the Obama administration.\u00a0 And so watching him, seeing how he did the job up close virtually every single day \u2013 as well as, of course, having had the opportunity to work in different ways with Secretary Clinton, Secretary Albright, but also to be inspired by, to read about people like Jim Baker, like George Shultz, and to \u2013 and Colin Powell, who I considered a friend and a tremendous source of advice over many years \u2013 all of that just made a huge difference.\nBut, like anything, you can be familiar with something academically, you can be familiar with it by seeing it up close.\u00a0 It\u2019s always a little bit different when you\u2019re actually doing it.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0 Well, I will resist the temptation to ask follow-up questions, and Sam, let\u2019s go to some of the questions from folks on the line.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, to ask a question, please type in your name and question in the fields below and click submit.\u00a0 As a reminder, this meeting is on the record.\u00a0 Our first question is from Bonnie Glaser, who asks:\u00a0 \u201cAre you concerned about possible Chinese efforts to provide material support to the Russian economy, either legally or illegally, as Russia\u2019s economy weakens as a result of international sanctions?\u201d\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Bonnie, in short, the answer is yes, and it\u2019s something that President Biden brought up directly with President Xi when they spoke by video conference a couple of months ago.\u00a0 As the \u2013 this was just when the Russian aggression started.\u00a0 We had warned our Chinese counterparts for some weeks that this was likely and indeed going to happen.\u00a0 I think they were surprised, if not by Russia taking some action, certainly by the extent of that action.\u00a0 And one of the things that President Biden said to President Xi is we would look very unkindly at the prospect of China providing material support to Russia, either on the military side or taking steps that, for example, undercut the sanctions that we would \u2013 we were compelled to impose on Russia as a result of its aggression in Ukraine.\nI have to say thus far we have not seen from China any systematic effort to help Russia evade sanctions, nor have we seen any significant military support from China to Russia.\u00a0 On the other hand, the so-called \u201cno limits\u201d partnership that President Xi and President Putin signaled just weeks before the Russian aggression \u2013 we certainly see aspects of that continuing, particularly China continuing to advance Russia\u2019s efforts politically and diplomatically, parroting some of the Russian propaganda, even amplifying it.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s deeply unfortunate.\nAnd ultimately, I think it really risks doing damage to China\u2019s reputation.\u00a0 China will have to make its own calculations about that.\u00a0 One of the things that President Biden noted for President Xi when they spoke after the \u2013 some weeks after the aggression was this remarkable exodus of companies from Russia as a result of the aggression \u2013 seven, 800 companies, the leading brands from around the world, who didn\u2019t want their reputations to be at risk by doing business in Russia.\u00a0 And, of course, doing business in Russia was also made more complicated by the sanctions.\u00a0 But the sanctions themselves didn\u2019t drive this exodus.\u00a0 It was really companies deciding on their own that they were not going to do business as usual in a country that was committing this kind of aggression.\u00a0 That\u2019s something I think that China also has to factor in as it thinks about its relationship with Russia, what support it does provide, as well as thinking about its own policies going forward in its more immediate neighborhood.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0 Sam, let\u2019s go to the next question.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Our next question is from Anthony Richter, who asks:\u00a0 \u201cThis month the UN Security Council must decide whether to renew the travel ban on Taliban leadership.\u00a0 Given a steady stream of Taliban decisions negatively affecting the rights of Afghan women, how will the U.S. approach this critical vote?\u201d\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So with the Taliban takeover, a few things happened at the same time.\u00a0 One of those was a UN Security Council resolution setting out the expectations of the international community for the Taliban in Afghanistan.\u00a0 Those included, among other things, an expectation that it would continue to provide for freedom of travel, so that people, if they so choose, could leave the country; that it would not countenance terrorism emanating from Afghanistan and would take steps to deal with it; and that it would uphold the rights, the basic rights of Afghans, including women and girls.\nWhat we\u2019ve seen in recent months has been, I think, a serious reverse gear on women and girls in particular.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the lack of access to education for girls above the sixth grade.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen various requirements, including the imposition of wearing a veil, on women, and then penalizing their husbands or fathers if they fail to do so.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen other restrictions on their ability to get an education, to work, to engage in society, including, for example, even commentators on television.\nSo all of this goes directly counter to the expectations of the international community that are in a UN Security Council resolution.\u00a0 They also go against the expectations of the community that were expressed in many statements that the United States helped initiate, including with over 100 signatories on one of these statements at the time of the Taliban takeover.\nAnd what that says is that we\u2019ve been very clear with the Taliban that, to the extent they seek to have more normal relations with any country, including the United States, we have expectations that they will live up to commitments that they themselves made, as well as, as I said, the expectations expressed by the international community.\nSo we\u2019ll see what happens in the next couple of weeks.\u00a0 But I think the international community writ large, the United States in particular, has been very clear about what we\u2019re looking for from the Taliban.\u00a0 And to the extent that they are not making good on those expectations and those commitments, that will have a real impact on the extent to which their relations with the rest of the world can be normalized in any way.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0 As a follow-up on that, have the escalating warnings or fears of the worsening humanitarian crisis and food crisis in Afghanistan changed our assessment of how to approach these questions at all?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Dan, I\u2019d say two things on that.\u00a0 First, even as we\u2019ve made clear what our expectations are \u2013 and, by the way, other expectations included access for humanitarian workers and humanitarian assistance, as well as a more inclusive and representative government \u2013 two things on this.\u00a0 We believe that, whatever the profound differences we have with the Taliban, and however they are falling \u2013 and clearly falling \u2013 short of the expectations that we have set and others have set, it\u2019s hugely important that we do everything we can to make sure that humanitarian assistance gets to people in need in Afghanistan.\nWe remain the leading provider of humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 We\u2019ve worked very hard to make sure that that assistance could get to where it\u2019s needed, and that humanitarian organizations could function effectively in Afghanistan.\u00a0 They are in the lead in doing that, but we want to make sure that, to the extent we can support that, we are.\u00a0 That includes, for example, issuing multiple licenses, just to make crystal-clear to countries and institutions around the world that the sanctions that remain in place are not designed in any way to block the provision of humanitarian assistance.\nThe second piece of this is broader, and it goes to the question of the relationship between what we\u2019re doing on humanitarian assistance and, more broadly, what can be done so that, irrespective of anything else, Afghanistan has a basically functioning economy, so that people have a little bit of money in their pockets and can provide what they need for themselves.\u00a0 And whether it\u2019s a teacher, whether it\u2019s a humanitarian aid worker, whether it\u2019s a doctor, potentially whether it\u2019s even a civil servant, there has to be a basically functioning economy.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been looking very hard at ways to do that that are not a direct benefit to the Taliban, but that can bring benefits to the people.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something we\u2019re working on very actively.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0 Sam, let\u2019s get in one more quick question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Our last question is from Emerita Torres, who asks:\u00a0 \u201cSecretary Blinken, I believe your plan to modernize U.S. diplomacy is critical, including getting more Americans at home aware and involved in policy.\u00a0 How will the State Department\u2019s institutional structure and practices change to facilitate this effort?\u201d\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, and I really appreciate the question because it is something of real focus for me, and that is a modernization agenda that we put out some months ago.\nAnd the story with these things is often the same:\u00a0 Secretaries come and go, they all have reform plans, they all seek, in one way or another, to change the department.\u00a0 We tried to be inspired by a lot of work that had already been done, and a lot of it has been done, including, by the way, by the council in various reports about how to make this department more \u2013 even more effective, more agile, more responsive to the needs of the American people, and more reflective of the country that we represent.\nWe took those \u2013 that work to heart.\u00a0 We spent a lot of time talking to our own people about those questions.\u00a0 And of course, we consulted with Congress, because there\u2019s been a lot of good work done there over the years in thinking about how to strengthen the department.\u00a0 And all of that came together in a modernization agenda that time doesn\u2019t allow me to get into, but basically we\u2019re focused on a few core things.\u00a0 Instead of having 97 priorities, we\u2019ve really just got a handful.\nOne of those is making sure, for example, that our people have the tools in hand to do their jobs effectively in the 21st century.\u00a0 So we have a modernization agenda that goes to technology, but also goes to flexibility in the workplace.\u00a0 That, by the way, also makes sure that we can attract the best talent going forward.\u00a0 Because we\u2019re in a competition for that talent with other parts of government, with the private sector.\u00a0 We want to make sure that what we have on offer is going to bring people into the department.\nWe\u2019ve focused our efforts, as well, on critical issues that have not necessarily been the things that the department has been known for in the past, but that are actually critical to the well-being of Americans going forward \u2013 like climate, like global health, like economics, and of course, like dealing in the cyber and digital world.\u00a0 We just stood up a new bureau for cybersecurity and digital policy.\u00a0 We got that done in record time, with strong support from Congress.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have a senior envoy in office to deal with emerging technology.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re working on strengthening what we do on global health.\u00a0 And of course, we have John Kerry, who\u2019s been leading our efforts on climate.\nWe\u2019re also building up everything that we do on economics because these are the things that are front and center that actually have an impact on American lives, and the department needs to be in a place where it\u2019s attracting talent in those areas \u2013 again, areas that have not been necessarily right in the forefront of what we\u2019re known for and seen to be doing \u2013 and that we generate talent, including in the way people are trained throughout their careers.\nAnd then finally, let me say this.\u00a0 It\u2019s vitally important that we have a department that actually reflects the country that we represent.\u00a0 And this is not simply because \u2013 and it is the right thing to do \u2013 it is certainly not an act of charity.\u00a0 It\u2019s fundamentally because it\u2019s the smart and necessary thing to do.\u00a0 We\u2019re operating in, to state the obvious, an extraordinarily diverse world.\u00a0 And the comparative advantage that we bring to the table is having one of, if not the most, diverse countries on Earth.\u00a0 The idea that we would not bring the fullness of that diversity into the work we do at the department makes no sense.\u00a0 It shortchanges us in the world.\u00a0 It shortchanges our foreign policy.\u00a0 The ability to bring these different perspectives and experiences to bear that may give unique insights into how a diverse world is operating and affecting our interests, it would be a huge mistake to leave that off the playing field.\u00a0 At the same time, as we\u2019re grappling with problems \u2013 whatever they are \u2013 having that diversity of perspectives, opinion, experience, it\u2019s going to come up with a better solution.\nSo we\u2019ve been engaged in a very significant effort to really and genuinely make sure we have a department that looks like America.\u00a0 We appointed the first chief diversity and inclusion officer in the department\u2019s history.\u00a0 She and her team report directly to me.\u00a0 We have senior officials in every bureau responsible for this portfolio.\u00a0 We have a strategic plan that will be coming out very shortly, a five-year plan, on how to do this.\u00a0 And part of that is actually starting at the very beginning of the pipeline, making \u2013 reaching out and engaging with communities that are underrepresented in the department, and kind of opening their eyes and minds to the prospect of serving in government, and hopefully serving at the State Department.\nWe now have for the first time paid internships, and that in terms of the socioeconomic impact it\u2019ll have on broadening the aperture to bring people in at the outset of their careers to test out whether they might want to come here, that\u2019s going to have, I think, a significant impact.\nThere\u2019s a lot to be said on this, but I commend to those who are interested what we put out on the modernization agenda, but we\u2019re determined that by the time we\u2019re done here, we have a department that is even more responsive to the needs of the American people.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is this.\u00a0 None of this is flipping a light switch.\u00a0 It is turning an aircraft carrier.\u00a0 It takes time.\u00a0 It takes sustained effort, and it\u2019s not going to be done in two years or three years.\u00a0 But my hope is that, as we\u2019re doing these things, we are helping the culture evolve in the department, and we\u2019re also creating an ongoing demand signal from everyone here that will continue through the next administration and the administration beyond that.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0 That is a great note to end on.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, a huge thank you for joining us and helping us kick off what will be a series heading into the fall, and I will look forward to welcoming all of you back for subsequent events in the next few months.\u00a0 And again, Mr. Secretary, a huge thank you and best of luck in these intense months ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Dan, thank you very much, and I really was glad to be able to join everyone today.\u00a0 And let me just close by saying we continue to look to, to be inspired by, to rely on the pages of\u00a0Foreign Affairs.\u00a0 The number of times that I\u2019ve read something there that has sparked an idea, helped create an initiative, given me a good argument and very constructive criticism, I can\u2019t even count them.\u00a0 This is so vital to what we do.\u00a0 It\u2019s vital to our democracy.\u00a0 It\u2019s vital to our conduct of foreign policy.\nSo all I can say is this:\u00a0 It\u2019s great to celebrate these 100 years, but even more important are the next 100 years, and I\u2019m just grateful that we\u2019re all joined in this journey together.\u00a0 So thank you for everything you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 Thank you to everyone who contributes to\u00a0Foreign Affairs, to everyone who edits it, to everyone who reads it.\nMR KURTZ-PHELAN:\u00a0 We will hope to persuade you to create some more room on your bookshelves for future issues.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thanks, all, for joining.\u00a0 Have a good afternoon.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks very much.\n\n"}, {"url":

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be able to host my colleague and friend, the Foreign Minister of Finland, here at the State Department in the Benjamin Franklin Room.\u00a0 Our partnership, the partnership between Finland and the United States, has been rooted deeply in our shared values of democracy, of human rights, rule of law and a shared commitment to strengthening the international rules-based order.\u00a0 We\u2019re collaborating on virtually every pressing challenge of our time.\u00a0 As a result, there\u2019s always a lot to discuss when we get together, and we probably could have spent another hour talking about the many things that we\u2019re working on.\nBut today, of course, we focused a great deal on Finland\u2019s recent application to join NATO.\u00a0 The United States fully supports Finland and Sweden joining the Alliance, and I continue to be confident that both countries will soon be NATO Allies.\u00a0 Finland and Sweden more than meet NATO\u2019s democratic, military, economic criteria for membership.\u00a0 They\u2019re committed to upholding NATO\u2019s sacred Article 5 guarantee: an attack on one is an attack on all.\u00a0 And both countries have a proven track record of honoring their commitments.\nSince 2014, Finland has been an enhanced opportunities partner of NATO and maintains a high degree of interoperability with the Alliance.\u00a0 In plain English that means that our militaries work together seamlessly, and the country brings specific military expertise and capabilities in the high north and the Baltic Sea.\nBut it\u2019s not just Finland\u2019s military capabilities that will make NATO stronger, but its free and open democratic society.\u00a0 Indeed, we see that in the way that Finland decided to apply for NATO in the first place.\u00a0 The move was driven by strong public support.\u00a0 According to recent polls, three-in-four Finns want their country to join the Alliance.\u00a0 Finnish people, press, and politicians debated the prospect openly.\u00a0 And when the country\u2019s democratically elected parliament put the issue to a vote, 188 out of 200 members supported applying for membership.\u00a0 That is what a democratic process looks like.\nThe decisions by Finland and Sweden continue the trend that we\u2019ve seen since President Putin launched his war of aggression in which he failed to achieve a single one of his strategic aims.\u00a0 Instead of ending Ukraine\u2019s independence, President Putin has strengthened it.\u00a0 Instead of asserting Russia\u2019s strength, he\u2019s undermined it.\u00a0 Instead of dividing NATO, he\u2019s united it and now pushed more countries to apply to join.\nFinland and Sweden\u2019s applications also reaffirm NATO\u2019s \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy which has been a cornerstone of the Alliance since its very founding.\u00a0 That door will stay open, reflecting our belief that every country should have the right to choose its allies and partners and to pursue membership if it chooses.\u00a0 That is not a provocation or a threat to Russia.\u00a0 We say this often, but it bears repeating: NATO is and always will be a defensive Alliance.\u00a0 NATO does not seek confrontation with Russia, but rather we aim to prevent it.\nThe reason that more countries want to join NATO is simple:\u00a0 They have seen the Russian Federation repeatedly attack its neighbors without provocation.\u00a0 And so not unreasonably, they\u2019re concerned that they could be next.\u00a0 The only countries that have anything to fear from NATO are those that plan to attack one of the Allies.\u00a0 As President Biden made clear last week in his meeting with the Finnish president, during the accession process the United States and our Finnish partners will remain vigilant against threats to our shared security, and we will work together to deter and confront any aggression.\u00a0 The same holds true for Sweden.\nThe United States will also maintain our robust exercise activity and presence in the Baltic Sea region.\nSo simply put, Finland can depend on us, and I\u2019m confident that we can depend on Finland.\u00a0 The trust is built on experience.\u00a0 We\u2019ve collaborated for decades on the Arctic Council working together to advance a peaceful region where cooperation prevails on climate, on the environment, on science and safety, and where sustainable economic development benefits the local population.\nFor years, Finnish troops have served shoulder to shoulder with U.S. and NATO forces in Kosovo, in Afghanistan, in Iraq.\u00a0 Together, we cofounded the European Center for Excellence for countering hybrid threats, which Finland hosts.\u00a0 And since February 24, we\u2019ve been closely aligned in our response to Moscow\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ve repeatedly voted together to condemn Russia\u2019s unjust invasion in the UN General Assembly and, of course, in the Human Rights Council, where we voted together to suspend Russia.\u00a0 We\u2019ve worked together to impose costs on the Russian Government and its proxies for this unjust war and the atrocities they are committing.\nAs a member of the European Union, Finland has helped craft and support EU sanctions which were closely coordinated with and complementary to our own.\u00a0 Earlier this week, Finland joined more than 60 countries that have signed on to a roadmap to tackle the growing global food security crisis, which has been significantly worsened by Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.\nPekka and I talked about this at some length in our conversations both with regard to Ukraine and more generally what we can do and what we will do together to address this crisis around the globe.\nFinland has also stepped up to provide security assistance and non-lethal aid to the Ukrainian Government.\u00a0 The Government is committed to take in some 23,000 refugees, and Finnish universities have opened thousands of spots for Ukrainian students fleeing the war.\u00a0 Finnish schools have opened thousands of chairs to younger Ukrainians, and we\u2019re grateful for that incredible response.\nOne final point.\u00a0 Squarely focused as we are today on how NATO can defend members against further Russian aggression, this alliance is also critical for protecting our shared security and values from other threats, including emerging challenges like cyber-attacks, infectious disease, a warming climate.\u00a0 That\u2019s yet another reason that we look forward to being able to call Finland and Sweden our allies and draw upon their leadership in the years ahead.\nSo Pekka, we\u2019re already working so closely together, but I suspect that will become even closer with you as we deepen what is already a vital partnership between Finland and the United States.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER\u00a0HAAVISTO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 And first I want to thank Secretary of State Mr. Blinken, my good friend Tony, for this opportunity of to again meet here in Washington and discuss and exchange views in today\u2019s meeting.\u00a0 I think we had an excellent discussion.\nWe highly value our close cooperation between Finland and the United States.\u00a0 As discussed today, we look forward to further deepening our bilateral engagement and continuing our close consultations on key foreign and security policy questions.\nThe main topics today were the security situation in Europe, Finland\u2019s NATO membership application, and the war in Ukraine.\u00a0 First a couple of words about our application.\u00a0 Finland submitted on May 18th, at the same time with Sweden, our application for NATO membership.\u00a0 Finland\u2019s decision to apply for NATO membership is based on a comprehensive, democratic process and strong support from the people.\u00a0 Finland\u2019s accession to NATO would strengthen the security and stability of Northern Europe as well as wider transatlantic security.\u00a0 Finland is a security provider and would further strengthen NATO as an Ally.\u00a0 We are very grateful for the unwavering and strong support from the United States for our NATO membership bid.\u00a0 We look forward to taking our excellent relationship to a new level as a NATO Ally.\nTurkey has raised questions in conjunction with Finland\u2019s and Sweden\u2019s membership applications.\u00a0 It is understandable that different issues may be raised by different allies along the process.\u00a0 Finland has been in active contact with Turkey \u2013 I have been visiting Turkey twice this spring \u2013 at different levels regarding our NATO membership bid.\u00a0 We wish to continue our constructive dialogue with allies and are ready to continue discussing the outstanding issues with Turkey.\u00a0 We take every NATO members\u2019 concerns seriously.\u00a0 With Turkey we are now in an open, direct, and constructive dialogue process to clarify all issues.\u00a0 This is important.\nWe highly appreciate the strong support from the allies along the process.\u00a0 We also hope for a swift ratification of our membership once the accession protocol has been signed.\nThen a couple of words about Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 Finland strongly condemns the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 We continue to urge Russia to stop the military actions immediately.\u00a0 We are strongly supporting Ukraine both nationally and through the European Union.\u00a0 Finland\u2019s support to Ukraine includes humanitarian assistance, development cooperation, and material and arms assistance.\u00a0 Ordinary Finns have also shown great solidary with Ukraine and Ukrainians who have fled to Finland, as mentioned by Tony.\nRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine is an attack against the entire European security order.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great breach of international law and a violation of the Charter of the United Nations.\u00a0 Russia is flagrantly violating international law in Ukraine.\u00a0 We need to ensure accountability for war crimes.\u00a0 Finland supports the investigation by the International Criminal Court, ICC, by granting financial support and by seconding experts.\nThe EU and the United States have shown extraordinary speed, determination, and unity as a response to Russia\u2019s actions, including extensive sanctions.\u00a0 Sanctions have been powerful and hit Russia hard.\u00a0 I wish to thank the United States for an exceptional collaboration.\u00a0 Finland is ready to move forward with new sanctions and to consider all options, including energy.\u00a0 New EU sanctions package is being prepared.\nOur multilateral fora, Finland \u2013 on multilateral fora, Finland continues its close cooperation with partners and is actively discussing the key matters, for example, global food security, as discussed, and has been raised by United States.\u00a0 We also thank the United States for active global outreach.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you for joining us this afternoon.\u00a0 We will now take a question from each side, beginning with Shannon from ABC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 On expanding NATO, have you seen any progress towards getting Turkey onboard?\u00a0 And what are you willing to do \u2013 what demands are you willing to satisfy \u2013 in order to move that process along?\nAlso, secondly, Mr. Secretary, you spoke with your Ukrainian counterpart today about security assistance.\u00a0 Is supplying American long-range missile systems on the table?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I think as you heard from the Foreign Minister, Finland and Sweden are working directly with Turkey to address some of the concerns that it raised.\u00a0 We\u2019re also talking to Turkey.\u00a0 I saw the Turkish Foreign Minister in New York about a week ago, and those conversations continue.\nI don\u2019t want to characterize the conversations beyond saying that, first, there is a very strong consensus in NATO for the admission of Finland and Sweden, and I remain confident that we will work through this process swiftly and that things will move forward with both countries.\u00a0 As Pekka said, it is a process.\u00a0 In that process, countries raise concerns that they may have.\u00a0 We work through them; that\u2019s what Finland and Sweden are doing right now with Turkey, and I\u2019m confident that this will move forward.\nWith regard to security assistance to Ukraine, yes, I spoke to my counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, this morning.\u00a0 We speak regularly, and this is a constant conversation about the\u00a0\u2013 among other things, the needs that Ukraine has to make sure that it has in hand what it needs to deal with the Russian aggression as well as, ultimately, to strengthen the hand that it will have at any negotiating table that emerges in the future.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a constant process.\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin set up what I think is a very effective mechanism when he brought about 40 countries together at Ramstein, Germany a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0 So there\u2019s now an active contact group bringing all these countries together to focus the assistance that Ukraine needs and to make sure that countries are doing what they need to do to provide it.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to get ahead of that process, including with future deliveries of assistance.\u00a0 All of that is in train and will unfold in the days and weeks ahead.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAAVISTO:\u00a0\u00a0Maybe from our side, first just to mention our prime minister, Sanna Marin, visited two days ago Kyiv and also Bucha and, of course, was shocked what they saw there and all the destruction.\u00a0 And Finland is committed to continue supporting Ukraine and we have been also sending the little packages to Ukraine.\u00a0 The military support to Ukraine is very important at this moment.\nIn regarding Turkey, our delegations visit actually Wednesday both from Sweden and Finland.\u00a0 Turkey had a \u2013 good negotiations there, long negotiations, agreed to continue those talks, and of course, we rely on NATO \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy, which is also supported by Turkey, and we think that these problems can be solved that \u2013 which Turkey has been raising.\u00a0 And it\u2019s probably very important that some results could be achieved before the Madrid summit, which is an important moment for NATO and also for us as applicant countries, in the end of June.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0Next we\u2019ll turn to Laura from Finnish MTV News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, so what concretely the United States is going to do with Turkey so that they would accept Finland joining NATO?\u00a0 And what would be the timeline for this?\u00a0 Do you believe that would really happen before the Madrid summit?\nAnd similar question to Minister Haavisto.\u00a0 Is it really possible that this could happen before the Madrid summit?\u00a0 And did you receive any concrete promises what the United States could do to help Finland in this process with Turkey?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So again, in the first instance, the most important thing is that Finland and Sweden are speaking directly to and with Turkey, and working through some of the concerns that Turkey has raised and finding ways to address them.\u00a0 We very much support that process; as I mentioned, we\u2019re engaged with Turkey directly as well.\u00a0 But the focus is on the work that Finland, Sweden, and Turkey are doing together to address the concerns.\nAnd again, as I said, I\u2019m confident this is going to move forward.\u00a0 As Pekka alluded to a moment ago, we do have the NATO summit coming up in a few weeks, and our full expectation is that this process will move as we head into the summit as well as at the summit itself.\nSo again, beyond that I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics.\u00a0 But there\u2019s an ongoing, very active conversation between Finland, Sweden, and Turkey that we\u2019ll support in any way that we can.\u00a0 I suspect NATO will do so as well.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAAVISTO:\u00a0 Thank you for the question.\u00a0 Actually, a couple of weeks ago I participated in Berlin the NATO ministerial meeting.\u00a0 We were invited by \u2013 both Sweden and Finland \u2013 there by German host and NATO hosts.\u00a0 And I have to say that when we had this roundtable discussion about Finnish and Swedish membership, which that day had not yet been decided in our parliament but already could guess what is coming, we got extraordinary support from majority of the NATO members, very open support.\u00a0 And it looked like countries are competing who will ratify first the applications.\u00a0 And of course, that was a very positive signal to us.\nAt the same time, countries have the right to raise concerns.\u00a0 Turkey has raised some concerns regarding the PKK issue, terrorist issues, and so forth.\u00a0 The PKK is a forbidden organization in Finland.\u00a0 We are part of those solutions in the European Union, where terrorist organizations are listed.\u00a0 It\u2019s the same in Sweden and so forth, and these are the answers that we are giving, of course, in this case to Turkey.\u00a0 We, of course, hope that the process goes smoothly and rapidly because this \u2013 what we call the grey zone between the \u2013 putting the application in and finally getting approved as NATO members, of course, includes some security concerns.\u00a0 We have got extraordinary strong assurances from countries like U.S., UK, and many others during this period, but, of course, it\u2019s not the same as the NATO Article 5 security guarantees, and that\u2019s why we would hope that this process goes smoothly and rapidly.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 That concludes our press conference for today.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-at-a-reception-in-recognition-of-eid/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

evening, everyone.\u00a0 And I have to say I\u2019m tempted after you\u2019ve heard the extraordinary eloquence of Rashad and Nadia to just say enjoy the rest of the evening, because what can I add to that?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you both so much.\nAnd I also do want to start, even though this is a celebration, with what both of our friends referenced, and that is the horrific events in Texas.\u00a0 I suspect most of you have had the same reaction.\u00a0 I have to tell you it\u2019s really hard to look at the images on TV of these children, 10 years old, each with their own story, each so vibrant, each with so much ahead of them, and as a parent, as I suspect many of you are, you put yourself in the place of their parents, and it\u2019s unfathomable.\u00a0 It\u2019s just unfathomable.\nSo I know we all have them in our hearts, and I hope \u2013 you said something very beautiful about the need to recommit ourselves to empathy.\u00a0 I hope that that part of the spirit of Ramadan is something that we can take from this evening and every evening, and think about that, think about that in our own lives.\u00a0 It\u2019s so important.\nBut this is a celebration, and I really want to say to everyone welcome,\u00a0assalamu alaikum, a belated Eid Mubarak to you and your families.\nThis is the first reception that we\u2019ve had in this storied room, the Benjamin Franklin Room, since COVID.\u00a0 The very first.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I am very happy to be back here and I\u2019m very happy to be back here with all of you.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s very fitting.\nNow, a little bit of history:\u00a0 Benjamin Franklin, of course, was our nation\u2019s first diplomat.\u00a0 He charted the Gulf Stream.\u00a0 He pioneered electricity.\u00a0 He authored the very first treaty of the United States.\u00a0 He helped forge a new ethos of self-government.\u00a0 And he did virtually none of this while sober.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I know that\u2019s not going to be a problem for us this evening, but I\u2019m not sure what lesson to draw from that.\u00a0 But I\u2019m thinking very hard about it.\nTo all of our distinguished guests, including members of our diplomatic community, thank you so much for being here.\u00a0 Religious and civil society leaders, friends, family, thank you for joining us this evening.\nThere was an extremely young guest here a few moments ago who I was particularly eager to meet who may have left the room briefly, but it\u2019s wonderful to see \u2013 oh, yes, there you are.\u00a0 How old are you?\u00a0 How \u2014\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Her.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Ah, wonderful.\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 That\u2019s my daughter.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So we see the incredible sweep of this community, and I\u2019m \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re here as well.\nAnd a big thanks to start to our colleagues at the Office of International Religious Freedom for getting us all together tonight, for organizing this reception, and Rashad, especially to you for your leadership, which has been extraordinary.\nJust over the past few months, Rashad and his team have helped drive our foreign policy priorities forward, traveling, for example, to Bangladesh to meet with local Rohingya refugees; to Mauritania, where they met with government and civil society leaders across Africa to discuss shared efforts to protect religious minorities; most recently to Saudi Arabia, to participate in a forum with religious leaders across multiple faiths to advance interfaith cooperation.\nJust yesterday, I had the opportunity to spend a good deal of time with the head of the OIC, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, where we together are doing more and more around the world, something that I\u2019m very pleased and proud of.\nI also want to extend a welcome to our Muslim colleagues here from across the State Department, and I see a few of you in the room.\u00a0 President Biden has made it a priority to build a federal government that actually reflects our country, and this for me is an absolute priority.\u00a0\u00a0 And it\u2019s not an act of charity; it\u2019s not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u00a0 It\u2019s because it\u2019s the smart and necessary thing to do.\u00a0 We are operating in an incredibly diverse world, and the idea that we would not bring our greatest strength \u2013 our own diversity \u2013 to those efforts makes no sense.\u00a0 It would be to penalize our foreign policy.\nSo we are working every day to build a State Department that reflects the country that we\u2019re here to represent and to take advantage of what is really our greatest competitive advantage in the world.\u00a0 And I\u2019m reminded of that every single day, as I get to witness the many contributions that Muslim colleagues here in the department, both at Main State and posts around the world, are making to our foreign policy.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful for it.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to each and every one of you for helping advance America\u2019s interests and values around the world.\nIt\u2019s an honor to host each of you here at the State Department for Eid Al-Fitr.\u00a0 Eid is a celebration of so many of the values that we hold dear as Americans and as members of this institution: love of family, the pursuit of peace, a commitment to justice.\u00a0 Throughout Ramadan, those of you celebrating acted on those values as you visited loved ones, you gave donations to those in need, you deepened your connections with your communities.\u00a0 Tonight, we have a chance to celebrate those values and celebrate the many contributions of Muslims and Islam to the United States.\nAs Rashad said, respect for religious freedom is a core American value.\u00a0 It goes to who we are.\u00a0 It\u2019s as old as this country itself.\nAs you get a chance to walk through these rooms, the Diplomatic Reception Rooms this evening, you will notice that they are named for some of our founding fathers, many of whom long ago affirmed the United States respect for Islam and other faiths, including John Adams, including Benjamin Franklin, including Thomas Jefferson.\nPresident Jefferson hosted the very first White House iftar more than two centuries ago, when, one night, he asked that dinner be served at precisely sunset because he knew his guest, the Tunisian envoy to the United States, was observing Ramadan.\u00a0 That\u2019s how far back this goes.\nSupporting religious freedom isn\u2019t just one of our deepest held values. \u00a0It is also, like our diversity, absolutely essential to our national security.\nWe know that when people are discriminated against because of their religious beliefs \u2013 whether in their education, in their careers, in any other part of their life \u2013 they can\u2019t make their fullest contribution to their communities\u2019 success, entire countries become worse off.\u00a0 And when governments violate this basic human right, it ignites tension, it sows division, which can \u2013 and indeed often does \u2013 lead to violence, to conflict, to less stable societies.\nToday, we continue to see governments, armed groups, individuals persecute people because of what they believe, including Muslims, around the world.\nIn Burma, the regime continues to commit atrocities against Rohingya, among other religious and ethnic minorities.\u00a0 You all know this is not new.\u00a0 In March, I determined that Burma\u2019s military had committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd by the way, some of you may have heard the case that we made at the Holocaust Museum in laying out what is being done, what was done, what continues to be done to the Rohingya.\u00a0 And I really commend to you the extraordinary exhibit at the Holocaust Museum that \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s still on.\u00a0 I hope it is.\u00a0 But it shows the entire trajectory of this genocide, these crimes against humanity.\u00a0 It shows how it starts with seemingly small things, and then builds and builds and builds.\u00a0 And we see this story in other parts of the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly powerful warning to us, as well as testimony, evidence, about the fate of the Rohingya. \u00a0And so if the exhibit is still on, I really urge you, if you\u2019re here, to go and take a look.\u00a0 I think it will resonate very powerfully with so many of you.\nAnd of course, in Xinjiang, China, authorities continue to commit crimes against humanity and genocide against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs as well as members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.\u00a0 We will continue to do everything we can to spotlight the human impact of these crimes.\u00a0 Just to cite one example, our embassy in Paris recently, a few weeks ago, did this when they heard from two Uyghur activists at their Iftar dinner \u2013 and we will work to hold accountable those who are responsible.\nAs we gather tonight, we remember the many Muslim communities worldwide \u2013 including Uyghurs, including Rohingya \u2013 who can\u2019t gather with loved ones to celebrate religious holidays because of this persecution.\nThis department, this administration, will continue to speak up for the rights of Muslims and people of all faiths, including through venues like the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance, a network of nearly 40 countries dedicated to advancing freedom of religion and belief around the world.\u00a0 Next week, we\u2019ll actually release our annual International Religious Freedom Report.\u00a0 This offers a comprehensive review of the state of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and territories.\nAnd this report, in my judgment at least, is an incredibly powerful document.\u00a0 The fact of shining a light on abuses, on persecution, doing it in a fact-based way, and having the imprimatur of the United States Government behind it, can have in and of itself a very powerful effect.\nThrough our diplomatic posts and our bureaus, we will continue to engage with Muslim communities in the United States and worldwide, so that we can uplift and support the tremendous contributions that they\u2019re making every single day.\nWe see you as diplomatic, religious, civil society leaders, as our partners in these efforts, because you\u2019re doing the work of strengthening your communities every day.\u00a0 And as Rashad said so well, I can\u2019t begin to overstate the impact and the importance of civil society both in the work that you do and the fact that you hold us in government to account as well.\nTo name just a few examples: some of you are welcoming and helping resettle Afghan refugees across the country, including Dr. Hashimi.\u00a0 Some of you are Afghan refugees who served as translators, aid officers, locally employed staff in our embassy in Kabul, and we are so lucky and fortunate to have you here in the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Still others are helping their communities cope with COVID-19, including by providing mental health support.\nMany of you are serving in large institutions, some of you are serving in small nonprofits, but there is a common thread, a common thread that that weaves its way through your work.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply this:\u00a0 You\u2019re each contributing to a stronger, kinder, more prosperous country for all of us.\nTogether, your efforts are a clear manifestation of the spirit of Eid \u2013 a spirit of service, a spirit of charity, a spirit of equality, a spirit of inclusion.\u00a0 So, simply put, to each and every one of you:\u00a0 Thank you for your service and thank you for being here tonight.\nNow, we are simply the meager opening act \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 for what is really ahead of us.\u00a0 We have some young performers from the Virginia-based ADAMS BEAT Choir with us this evening, so I\u2019m going to stop talking and we are really going to start a show.\u00a0 So here you go.\u00a0 And again, thank you.\u00a0 Eid Mubarak to everyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-angolan-foreign-minister-tete-antonio-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

(Cheers.)\u00a0 Thank you, Ambassador Bodine, for a truly incredible and overly generous introduction.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if it will be possible to live up to anything near what you said, but I am grateful for your remarks, and grateful as well for your remarkable service to this country over so many years.\nPresident DeGioia, Dean Hellman, Provost Groves, distinguished faculty and staff, proud parents and grandparents, supportive and rival siblings (laughter); devoted aunts, uncles, and friends; and most of all, members of the Georgetown School of Foreign Service Class of 2022 (cheers):\u00a0 Thank you, thank you, thank you for the honor of being part of this outstanding institution\u2019s commencement celebration.\nNow, I\u2019m not a Georgetown alum, but I am the son-in-law of two of them, Tony and Donna Ryan.\u00a0 Standing up here today in front of Healy Hall probably earned me more points with them than the current job that I hold.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s probably also true of my former boss, President Clinton, class of \u201968.\u00a0 So thank you, Georgetown.\u00a0 The only difference, Mr. President, is that, like you, they actually earned their honors.\nSo I want to start by kicking the elephant out of the room.\u00a0 Yes, NYU got Taylor Swift as their commencement speaker.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nNow, my staff did not let me bring my guitar up here to dedicate a performance of \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d to President Putin.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 They said it would be \u201cundiplomatic\u201d and also \u201ccringe.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Also, since when is cringe an adjective?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIn any case, guitar or not, I am thrilled to be here.\nThis is a special day for many reasons.\u00a0 And maybe the most exhilarating is that this is indeed the first in-person commencement since 2019, so it\u2019s just wonderful to be in the same place with all of you.\u00a0 And I really want to commend these graduates for persevering through lockdowns, Zoom classes, quarantining, and \u2013 for some of you \u2013 through loss, including a beloved classmate.\nI know this has not been an easy road.\u00a0 But you have traveled it together, and you\u2019ve done it while practicing the core principle of cura personalis \u2013 of taking care of yourselves and taking care of one another.\u00a0 So today, I hope you\u2019ll take a moment to savor the fact that you have done something extraordinary.\u00a0 You\u2019ve completed a world-class education at one of the finest schools for international affairs on the entire planet.\u00a0 (Cheers.)\nNow, this accomplishment is yours, but it also belongs to everyone who loved and supported you along the way.\u00a0 None of us achieves everything on our own.\u00a0 So before we go any further, can we please have a huge round of applause to all the family and friends who helped make today possible?\u00a0 (Cheers.)\nThere\u2019s someone else who\u2019s already been mentioned that I want to mention as well \u2013 someone that we dearly wish was here with us today, and who would be cheering for this class with all her might \u2013 and that is the great Madeleine Albright.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Madeleine was a strong Georgetown partisan.\u00a0 This was her cherished home for decades.\u00a0 And as has been noted \u2013 in a little twist of history \u2013 she was the speaker for that last in-person SFS commencement three years ago.\nAnd I have to tell you it feels a little bit like she has passed a torch to me today, and not for the first time.\u00a0 After all, I sit at her desk every day.\nSo on the occasion of the Class of 2022\u2019s commencement, I thought what I\u2019d do is talk a little bit about her and about two other secretaries of state we said goodbye to since last year, Colin Powell and George Shultz.\nNow, they were three very different people \u2013 different backgrounds, different political philosophies, different styles of leadership.\u00a0 And the times during which they were secretary were different, too.\u00a0 But they devoted their lives to service.\u00a0 They left their mark.\u00a0 And their stories hold lessons for each and every one of us, especially for you, the graduates of this school.\nNow, let\u2019s face it:\u00a0 If anyone is going to appreciate secretary of state stories, it\u2019s someone with the words \u201cforeign service\u201d on their diploma.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI know that every young person graduating today is immediately inundated with advice, and it can probably feel impossible to sort through it all.\u00a0 So let me say this:\u00a0 Don\u2019t think of this as advice, just a few stories from a few people who led remarkable lives and who once were sitting right where you\u2019re sitting, deeply interested in the world, wondering how they would fit in.\nAnd I know they wouldn\u2019t mind if just for today we drop the honorifics.\u00a0 So if it\u2019s all right, for today they\u2019re not secretaries.\u00a0 They\u2019re Madeleine, they\u2019re Colin, they\u2019re George.\nThe first lesson is about remembering where you came from.\u00a0 Colin drilled this into his three kids as they grew up.\nHe was the son of Jamaican immigrants in the South Bronx.\u00a0 His block, Kelly Street, had all kinds of people on it \u2013 West Indians, African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Jews like the Klein family, who lived downstairs from the Powells.\u00a0 They had the only television in the building and they would invite the entire neighborhood \u2013 all the kids over \u2013 to watch it on Tuesday nights.\nColin later said his neighborhood stuck with him as a model for America at its best, a place where diversity made people\u2019s lives richer, more vibrant, and where people looked out for one another even when they looked different.\nColin brought that spirit to every team that he built.\u00a0 It\u2019s why he worked so hard, as he used to say, to make the State Department look more like America.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why he\u2019d be so proud of the outsized cohorts of Pickering, Rangel, and Payne Fellows here at the School of Foreign Service \u2013 including 33 current fellows, and 37 more starting next year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMadeleine came to the United States at age 11 as a refugee. Her family had been driven from their home in Czechoslovakia twice \u2013 first by the Nazis, then by the communists.\u00a0 She already had experienced the horrors of war; she hid in shelters in London as bombs dropped from the sky.\nShe never forgot why it mattered for countries to stand up to tyrants and open their arms to the displaced.\u00a0 That was true whether she was speaking at the United Nations Security Council, swearing in a new group of American citizens, or meeting with refugees uprooted by war.\u00a0 She couldn\u2019t help but put herself in the shoes of people fleeing repression, because she had once walked in those shoes.\nGeorge kept a giant globe in his office as secretary.\u00a0 Before any new ambassador left for their post, he would administer one last test.\u00a0 Show me your country on the globe, he\u2019d say.\u00a0 So they\u2019d spin the globe and they\u2019d look for Argentina or Nigeria or Indonesia, wherever they were going.\u00a0 And George would gently take their finger and move it and put it on the United States.\u00a0 This is your country, he would say.\nIt was his way of reminding America\u2019s diplomats that no matter how far they traveled, the people that they served were still here.\u00a0 Of course, if the members of this class stood before that globe, you\u2019d point at dozens of different countries, some of which were not even on the map when George was secretary.\nBut here\u2019s the point:\u00a0 No matter where you go or what cause you serve, try to hold on to what\u2019s shaped you.\u00a0 Use those first coordinates, the places and people that make up your Map of the Modern World.\nAnd try to remember this for other people.\u00a0 It\u2019s worth putting some work into learning where other people come from, especially people whose map is vastly different from yours.\u00a0 That is the foundation of empathy, and it\u2019s handy no matter where you go.\nThe second lesson is about always being a student.\nMadeleine started teaching here 40 years ago.\u00a0 So I tracked down the most recent syllabus for her course, America\u2019s National Security Toolbox.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how it starts:\u00a0 \u201cI am looking forward to both teaching and learning from you.\u00a0 Together, [we\u2019ll] do our best to make sense of [what\u2019s] happening in the world.\u201d\nMadeleine saw every student who passed through SFS as someone that she could learn from.\u00a0 She\u2019d meet individually with every student that she came across during her time here.\u00a0 She quoted students in her books.\u00a0 In her interviews, she often said things like, \u201cI have a student who\u201d or \u201cMy students tell me.\u201d\nAnd as her daughters shared at her memorial service, Madeleine brought a stack of your papers with her to the hospital.\u00a0 She was still learning from you right till the very end.\nLikewise, George always looked to engage people at every level.\u00a0 So some of you may know we have a system at the State Department that produces policy memos.\u00a0 Some of you are familiar with it.\u00a0 Indeed, a junior staffer would write a draft, it works its way up through the hierarchy, until eventually a senior official signs off on it.\nWhen George had a question about a memo, he didn\u2019t ask the senior person.\u00a0 He called the person who drafted it.\u00a0 He\u2019d ask them to swing by his office.\u00a0 Many had never been in a room with a secretary of state.\u00a0 Now they were debating policy with one, because George knew that these desk officers had information that no one else did.\nAnd as secretary, Colin would sneak away from his security detail to talk to people he probably wouldn\u2019t otherwise meet.\u00a0 One day, he went down to the State Department garage.\u00a0 Now, those of you who know the garage know that it\u2019s too small for all the cars to fit.\u00a0 So every morning, the parking attendants line the cars up in very, very tight rows.\u00a0 When they saw George \u2013 excuse me, Colin walking up, they thought he was lost.\u00a0 But he had come to talk.\nHe asked them where they were from, how did they like the job.\u00a0 And they told him things that only they could know \u2013 like how they decided which car got out first at the end of the day.\u00a0 If the person actually knew their names and treated them like human beings, they got out first.\u00a0 If they acted like the attendants were invisible, they were last.\nDecency ruled.\nLearning from others is a way of showing respect.\u00a0 It tells people that you see them, that you value them.\nAs anyone who knew Colin, Madeleine, or George can tell you, they spent their whole lives in learning mode.\u00a0 This openness, this curiosity, meant that they were always stumbling across new ideas and new ways of seeing things.\u00a0 And it meant life never stopped being interesting.\nThe third lesson is about getting lost.\u00a0 And not just in the ICC here on campus.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIt\u2019s incredibly tempting to see the lives of the super-accomplished as somehow following a straight line that led all the way to the top.\u00a0 But in real life, it rarely goes that way.\nColin\u2019s parents didn\u2019t go to college, so they pinned very high expectations on him.\u00a0 His mom decided he should study engineering, so he signed up for it.\u00a0 But he just couldn\u2019t get through mechanical drawing; he switched to geology.\u00a0 A family meeting was called.\u00a0 His parents made clear their disappointment.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t making friends at school either, and back home on Kelly Street, his neighbors were calling him \u201ccollege kid,\u201d and not always in a nice way.\u00a0 He felt like he didn\u2019t quite fit in anywhere.\nMadeleine got married three days after graduating from Wellesley.\u00a0 By age 24, she was mom to twins.\u00a0 One after another, she pushed on doors, only to find them shut.\nWhen she and her husband at the time \u2013 who was a journalist \u2013 had dinner with the editor of his newspaper, Madeleine said that she too wanted to be a reporter.\u00a0 The editor immediately shot her down.\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to compete with your husband,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Madeleine was silent.\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s why she later urged so many women to learn to interrupt.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYears after, she said, \u201cAll of a sudden, these things that I thought I was going to be able to do, I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d\nGeorge was halfway through his senior year at Princeton, on a date at a football game, when word spread that Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor.\nSoon after, he drove with a friend to New York City to sign up for the Royal Canadian Air Force.\u00a0 That was the quickest path at the time to actually get into action.\u00a0 Both of them failed the eye test.\u00a0 Dejected, they went out for drinks and learned one of life\u2019s most painful lessons: Beware of bars with tattoo parlors in the back.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 George and his friend emerged with matching tattoos of the proud old Princeton tiger \u2013 on their tails.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo if you\u2019ve had a big setback in your time at SFS and did not tattoo Jack the Bulldog on your rear, consider yourself a step ahead of George.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nThe point is this:\u00a0 We assume that giants like them always had it figured out.\u00a0 But they went through times when they felt profoundly lost.\u00a0 Everybody does.\u00a0 If you have no idea what\u2019s next for you, even though that\u2019s probably what everyone is asking you today, don\u2019t be scared.\u00a0 That\u2019s okay.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way it is.\nAnd don\u2019t get knocked off your stride by all the Instagram and LinkedIn posts by peers celebrating their lives.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve got it all figured out, either.\u00a0 Don\u2019t compare their outsides to your insides.\nThat also goes for the times when people are not at their best selves with you.\u00a0 As Colin used to tell his team, \u201cWe always need to treat people with a little more respect than they deserve, because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in their lives.\u201d\u00a0 A lot of times, it\u2019s got nothing to do with you.\u00a0 Just keep going.\nNot long after switching to geology, Colin kept crossing paths with a bunch of guys from the ROTC.\u00a0 He figured he\u2019d give it a try.\u00a0 Putting on the uniform, he found that it fit.\nMadeleine went back to school to get her Ph.D., which is how she met a brilliant academic whose family, like hers, had fled the Nazis: Zbigniew Brzezinski.\u00a0 When he became national security advisor, he hired Madeleine.\nGeorge and his tiger returned to Princeton, finished their senior year, and enlisted in the Marines \u2013 the start of what turned into a lifetime of service to the United States.\nThey found their way. You will, too.\nThe final lesson is about sticking with it for the long haul.\nIn Madeleine\u2019s 2019 commencement speech, she drew parallels between 2019 and 1919, and warned of the rising tides of authoritarianism, nationalism, isolationism.\nShe made the case \u2013 as she did so often \u2013 for why service, your service, was crucial to meeting the challenges that we face.\u00a0 She said, and I quote, \u201cYou must remember that there is not a page of this institution\u2019s hundred-year history of which [we\u2019re] proud that was [authored] by a chronic complainer.\u00a0 We are doers.\u00a0 We have a responsibility not to be prisoners of history but to shape [it].\u201d\nThere\u2019s not really any doubt in my mind that all of you will find a way to serve, if that\u2019s what you choose to do.\u00a0 That\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u00a0 That\u2019s who you are.\nBut to make a real dent, you\u2019ve got stick with it.\u00a0 Progress takes a long time.\u00a0 It can feel like you\u2019re getting nowhere.\u00a0 Don\u2019t give up.\nThat\u2019s the story of George, Madeleine, and Colin.\u00a0 Each served in many ways over their lifetimes \u2013 as teachers and soldiers, as diplomats and advocates.\u00a0 Some of those hats fit better than others.\u00a0 But they kept at it, despite losses, despite setbacks, even seeing the progress they worked so hard to achieve get rolled back.\nThey endured because they learned to take the long view, to accept that every cause worth fighting for would actually outlive them; to aim for the big wins, but also to savor the small ones.\nJakub Hlavka grew up in a tiny town in the Czech Republic.\u00a0 In 2007, when he was a junior in high school, he came across Madeleine\u2019s memoir in the local library.\u00a0 He was so moved by the story he sent her a note in Czech telling her that she\u2019d inspired him to pursue a career in international relations.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t expect to hear back.\u00a0 Then he got a reply from Madeleine, saying he was making a wise choice, telling him to keep at it.\nSix years later, Jakub was sitting in her seminar at a grad \u2013 as a grad student at SFS.\u00a0 Today, he is a public policy professor at USC, where he tries to emulate Madeleine every single day.\nI work with people like Jakub every day at the State Department, people whose trajectory Madeleine helped to shape.\nSuzy George, my chief of staff, got her first job in government when Madeleine was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and spent the next several decades by her side.\nNed Price, the spokesperson at the State Department, described seeing Madeleine walking down Prospect Street when he was a freshman here at SFS, feeling like he\u2019d just spotted Madonna.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSarah McCool, who manages my team\u2019s schedule, also wrote a letter to Madeleine when she was in high school.\u00a0 And Madeleine answered her, inviting Sarah to come meet with her before a speech that she was giving.\nEach of these individuals \u2013 and they\u2019re here today \u2013 is part of Madeleine\u2019s legacy, and our country is so much better for it.\nWe often measure the impact of public servants, especially in international affairs, with a big ruler \u2013 the rise and fall of great powers, conflicts and alliances.\u00a0 But one of the things that made Madeleine, Colin, and George great was that they always measured their progress in the steps of the people around them.\nWhen Colin was secretary, George sent him a letter that said, and I quote, \u201cI am always amazed at the way people presume leaders in government focus almost exclusively on policy problems and [on] their own ups and downs.\u00a0 But leadership is about the people under your charge.\u00a0 A real leader is conscious of what he [or she] leaves behind.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the thing about this kind of work.\u00a0 It will always outlast us.\u00a0 So what we leave behind matters.\u00a0 We need others to pick up where we left off.\nWhen I look out at all of you today, I see hundreds of people ready to carry the baton for another leg, picking up where George, Madeleine, and Colin, and so many others left off.\nAnd so, graduates, as you leave the school of service for a life of service, I hope that you\u2019ll see that everything you need to serve \u2013 to serve with purpose \u2013 is right here.\nLet the loved ones celebrating you today help remind you always of where you came from.\nLet your professors and fellow graduates and all that you learned in this extraordinary place remind you of the joy of forever being a student.\nKnow that you will get lost, and that the losses and setbacks may well outnumber the wins.\nAnd as you stick with it, you\u2019ll find that even the smallest steps forward will do more than sustain you.\u00a0 They will fulfill you.\u00a0 They will lift you up.\u00a0 They\u2019ll lift up others.\u00a0 They will help shape this world for the better.\nSo Class of 2022, we welcome you with open arms to the ranks of the doers, and we can\u2019t wait to see all that you \u2013 all that you \u2013 will get done.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-kazakhstani-foreign-minister-mukhtar-tileuberdi-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

President Shahid, Director General Vitorino, thank you for your leadership at this first International Migration Review Forum. These are unprecedented times. There are more migrants on the move around the world today than at any time since World War II, some 95 million. As people leave their homes in search of safety and opportunity, undertaking perilous journeys, it\u2019s critical that countries and institutions work together to make migration safer and more orderly.\nForging that common approach to managing migration and protecting vulnerable people is the intention of the Global Compact for Migration. The United States supports that vision. We seek migration policies that are grounded in human rights, human dignity, transparency, and state sovereignty. And we\u2019re committed to partnering with civil society, with governments, the private sector, and international institutions like the United Nations, because this is a challenge that no one of us can solve alone.\nThe countries here today have taken important steps since the Global Compact was adopted in 2018. For example, several of our neighbors in the region have provided legal status and services to people fleeing repression and made education available to their children. International organizations and nongovernmental groups are providing support after climate-related disasters and training local officials in climate resilience and adaptation to help communities that are now threatened with being displaced because of the climate crisis. We also welcome efforts by civil society to keep governments focused on human rights and humanitarian assistance, because migration is not an abstract notion. Every migrant is a human being deserving of dignity and protection.\nThe United States will work closely with our partners to build on the progress that\u2019s being made. Next month, at the Summit of the Americas, we\u2019ll continuing developing a collaborative response to irregular migration throughout our hemisphere where the issue is particularly acute. Together, we\u2019re working on the root causes of irregular migration, including a lack of economic opportunity, insecurity, corruption and repressive governance, climate-related emergencies, to address why people are leaving their homes in the first place. For example, Vice President Kamala Harris rallied the private sector to invest more than a billion dollars to create economic opportunities in Central America.\nWe\u2019re working to expand legal pathways for migration, including allocating more than 50,000 additional temporary worker visas this year, expanding family reunification programs, and funding support for vulnerable migrants and refugees around the globe.\nWe\u2019re also helping to improve protections for migrants worldwide, in part through our work with the International Organization for Migration and the International Labor Organization, to combat human trafficking and to promote ethical cross-border job recruitment.\nThere\u2019s another migration issue that is front of mind today. Almost 13 million people have fled or been displaced in Ukraine since President Putin\u2019s war began in February. I want to commend the countries that are welcoming Ukrainian refugees and supporting the humanitarian response. We remain united in supporting Ukraine and opposing this senseless war.\nThe United States will continue to work for safe, orderly, and humane migration around the world. As a nation built and enriched by immigrants, this issue is particularly close to our hearts. Thank you to everyone here for your commitment, and we very much look forward to our work in the months and years ahead. Thank you very much.

destroying Ukrainian grain storage facilities; stealing stocks of food in the parts of Ukraine that it illegally occupies.\nThe consequences of these actions have been devastating:\u00a0 The food supply for millions of Ukrainians \u2013 and millions more around the world \u2013 has quite literally been held hostage by the Russian military.\nThe World Food Program recently estimated that a third of all Ukrainians are facing food insecurity, with children, pregnant women, the elderly at heightened risk of malnutrition.\nIn besieged cities like Mariupol, Russian forces have repeatedly blocked the delivery of food and other lifesaving aid to tens of thousands of trapped civilians.\u00a0 A mother who recently escaped from the city talked about the agony of watching her six-year-old daughter suffer the daily pang of hunger and being powerless to do anything about it.\u00a0 \u201cI just sobbed,\u201d she said, \u201cscreaming into a pillow when no one could see.\u201d\u00a0 She and her children eventually escaped.\u00a0 Countless thousands of others are still trapped.\nThe Russian Government seems to believe that using food as a weapon will help accomplish what its invasion has not: to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people.\nStill, Ukrainians are going to great lengths to feed their own people and to feed the world.\u00a0 Farmers in Ukraine continue to risk their lives to produce wheat and other crops.\u00a0 Many have returned to fields that are filled with mines.\u00a0 They wear bulletproof vests and helmets as they harvest.\nAnd as we\u2019ve heard already \u2013 powerfully \u2013 this morning, it\u2019s not only Ukrainians who are suffering.\nAs a result of the Russian Government\u2019s actions, some 20 million tons of grain sit unused in Ukrainian silos as global food supplies dwindle, prices skyrocket, causing more around the world to experience food insecurity.\nThis includes countries already under enormous duress \u2013 the secretary-general alluded to a number of them \u2013 like Lebanon, which usually gets 80 percent of its wheat imports from Ukraine; Somalia, already on the brink of a famine even before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine and which must now deal with rising wheat and flour costs.\nThe Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community\u2019s sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis.\nSanctions aren\u2019t blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways; Russia is.\nSanctions are not emptying Ukrainian grain silos and stealing Ukrainian farm equipment; Russia is.\nSanctions aren\u2019t preventing Russia from exporting food and fertilizer; the sanctions imposed by the United States and many other countries deliberately include carveouts for food, for fertilizer, and seeds from Russia, and we\u2019re working with countries every day to ensure that they understand that sanctions do not prevent the flow of these items.\nNo, the decision to weaponize food is Moscow\u2019s and Moscow\u2019s alone.\nDon\u2019t take my word for it.\u00a0 Even Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s security council, former Russian president, recently said that Russia\u2019s agricultural products were, and I quote, its \u201cquiet weapon,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 He then added, and I quote, \u201cQuiet but ominous,\u201d end quote.\nThis council has a unique responsibility to address the current crisis, which constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.\nThat starts by strongly and unequivocally calling the Kremlin out for its atrocities in Ukraine, and for worsening the global food crisis through an unprovoked war of aggression.\nMore concretely, members of the council \u2013 and, for that matter, every UN member state \u2013 should press Russia to stop actions that are making the food crisis in Ukraine and around the globe worse than it already was.\nStop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.\nAllow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine.\nStop preventing food and other lifesaving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities.\nStop threatening to withhold food and fertilizer exports from countries that criticize your war of aggression.\nAll of this is essential to save lives in Ukraine and to save lives around the world.\nThe Russian Federation is not the only government or organization to exploit food insecurity for its own cynical ends.\nIn South Sudan, armed groups and warring parties have for years blocked humanitarian assistance to civilians.\u00a0 Experts estimate that up to 7 million people will face crisis levels of food insecurity in the country in this year.\nIn Syria, with the Kremlin\u2019s ongoing support, the Assad regime has besieged communities like Eastern Ghouta, and caused the widespread starvation of its own people.\u00a0 It also routinely obstructs the cross-border delivery of lifesaving humanitarian aid, robbing and even attacking United Nations convoys, as we\u2019ve discussed repeatedly in this council.\nThis council must consistently call out governments and armed groups when they use similar tactics, like attacking the means of food production and distribution, blocking humanitarian aid from reaching those in need, besieging civilian populations.\nThe United Nations was created with the aim of advancing human rights and preventing atrocities, including, including the atrocity of using starvation as a weapon against civilians, like during the Siege of Leningrad by the Nazis, during which an estimated 1 million Russians lost their lives, including many who starved to death.\u00a0 Among the victims was the 1-year-old brother of President Putin; or during the Holodomor, during which millions of Ukrainians died of hunger due to a Soviet campaign of forced collectivization and terror.\nIt is on us to prevent this history from repeating itself, to make sure that the past is not prologue.\u00a0 It\u2019s simple:\u00a0 The lives of millions of people depend upon it.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-meeting-with-u-s-mission-to-the-united-nations-personnel/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

we need to find coordination; we need to do consultations.\u00a0 And again, all of that is happening here.\nAnd as Linda said, it is happening at extraordinary speed, an extraordinary pace.\u00a0 I know that the \u2013 sometimes the worst words in the English language is \u201cWashington\u2019s coming to town.\u201d\u00a0 So I know how much has gone into just these couple of days and the extraordinary work that\u2019s been packed into a couple of days, particularly the food security work that we\u2019ve been doing yesterday and again today at the Security Council.\u00a0 And I deeply appreciate all of the effort that\u2019s gone into that.\nGetting together with some 30 countries yesterday, also with African ministers, 10 countries, the Security Council meeting today, the migration forum on top of that \u2013 all of this made possible, by the way, by the remarkable protocol team, Matthew Miller \u2013 are you here, Matthew?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Protocol is vital everywhere, but probably no more so than right here, and it\u2019s multiplied by almost 200, so we\u2019re really grateful for that.\nSo many of you also worked this spring to do what many people thought was impossible, which was, again, to help rally the world in opposition to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and in support of Ukraine.\u00a0 UN resolutions at the General Assembly that got extraordinary support, 140, 141 countries \u2013 again, that doesn\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 It\u2019s because of so much of the work that you\u2019re doing, not just in the moment, but it\u2019s also the product of the work you\u2019re doing every day to build relationships, to build confidence, to build trust.\u00a0 So again, I deeply appreciate that.\nLet me say, too, that I know that even as we\u2019re intensely focused on Ukraine, as I mentioned, there are so many other things going on that you\u2019re taking on every single day.\u00a0 I have a really hackneyed acronym that my colleagues in Washington are tired of hearing me talk about, but it is, nonetheless, important \u2013 ROW, R-O-W, rest of world.\u00a0 Even if something very intense is going on, like Ukraine, we are, we have to be, focused on the rest of the world, and you\u2019re doing that.\u00a0 And for those of you who are working different portfolios that may not be in the spotlight at the moment, thank you for what you\u2019re doing.\nAs I mentioned before, even as we\u2019ve been dealing with Ukraine, our diplomacy, including diplomacy that\u2019s been centered here at the UN, has helped get a truce, for the time being at least, in Ethiopia.\u00a0 And as result, humanitarian assistance is getting up into Tigray.\u00a0 We helped get a truce in Yemen after eight years, and again, as a result, humanitarian assistance is flowing.\u00a0 We have maybe a chance for a longer-lasting peace.\u00a0 More than 500 million COVID vaccines have gotten through to other countries, free of charge, through COVAX, and \u2013 with no strings attached.\u00a0 I could go down a list, but it shows that we are ROW, you are ROW.\u00a0 You are making a difference every single day.\nSo I\u2019m grateful to the work that you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 I really wanted to just come by and say thank you.\u00a0 I also wanted to say, as Linda said, this the first gathering that you\u2019ve had in this room in a while.\u00a0 That is because, of course, we\u2019ve all been living with COVID-19 for the last two years.\u00a0 And I know the disruptive effect that it\u2019s had not only on the way you\u2019ve had to do your work, but for so many of you in your own personal lives.\u00a0 And some people have been affected directly, and it makes everything that we all do more challenging.\u00a0 And yet, you\u2019ve come through that with tremendous professionalism and tremendous skill.\nSo to all of you here, I know being in New York you have the great benefit of being in the city, but I also want you to know you\u2019re a crucial part of what we\u2019re doing in Washington.\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t do our diplomacy, we couldn\u2019t do our foreign policy, we couldn\u2019t be as effective as we are being without the work that you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 So simply put, thank you, thank you, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-food-security-ministerial/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Welcome.\u00a0 Thank you all so much for being here today.\nWe meet during what is the greatest global food security crisis of our time.\u00a0 It\u2019s a crisis that we all know has been building for years, driven in part by the pandemic, driven by an accelerating climate crisis.\u00a0 Between 2016 and 2021, the number of people living in acute food insecurity, the level when a person\u2019s inability to consume adequate food puts their lives or livelihoods in immediate danger, that has skyrocketed from 108 million people to 161 million people around the world.\nIt was this growing crisis that led Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield to make the nexus between food security and conflict the focus of a UN Security Council meeting that she chaired in March of last year.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why the United States made robust commitments at the secretary-general\u2019s UN Food Systems Summit last September.\nAll of that \u2013 all of that was before the Russian Government\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which, according to the World Bank, may drive 40 million additional people worldwide into extreme poverty and food insecurity this year.\u00a0 Indeed, every driver of the crisis that we\u2019ll discuss today has been made worse by President Putin\u2019s war of choice.\nThat\u2019s why we thought it was so important to convene this high-level group to put a brighter spotlight on the devastating impact of this crisis and to marshal the global effort that is needed to address it.\u00a0 This is something we\u2019re intently focused on every day at the State Department and across the United States Government.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a crisis that demands a global response.\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll have the opportunity to lead a session in the Security Council on how conflicts like this one are fueling food insecurity and how rising food insecurity is threatening peace and security around the globe, problems that we have to tackle as parts of a whole.\u00a0 Today, in our gathering, we want to focus on what we can do to save lives now and address the long-term drivers of this problem.\nI\u2019ll start by offering four suggestions, at least on the part of the United States, about what we can do.\u00a0 But having said that, this meeting is really about hearing the perspectives of a range of colleagues and countries, both on how this crisis is affecting lives in your respective countries but also on what we can do together to address it.\nFirst, from our perspective, we need countries to step up with substantial new contributions to fill the gaps faced by humanitarian organizations and agencies that are battling food insecurity which are forcing humanitarian groups to make incredibly wrenching decisions about when and where to cut lifesaving assistance.\u00a0 The cost of doing business for vital organizations like the World Food Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNICEF, and others \u2013 the cost of doing business is going up.\u00a0 We have to help them continue to do their business.\nIn particular, as well, countries with significant grain and fertilizer reserves as well as those with financial resources need to step up and do it fast.\u00a0 The United States has announced more than $2.3 billion in new funding for emergency food assistance to meet global humanitarian needs since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 Today, given the urgency of the crisis, we\u2019re announcing another $215 million in new emergency food assistance.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll do much more.\u00a0 We expect our Congress very soon to approve approximately $5.5 billion in additional funding for humanitarian assistance and food security.\nGovernments and international organizations can also come together to compel the Russian Federation to create corridors so that food and other vital supplies can safely leave Ukraine by land or by sea.\u00a0 There are an estimated 22 million tons of grain sitting in silos in Ukraine right now, food that could immediately go toward helping those in need if it can simply get out of the country.\nSecond, we believe we must address the global fertilizer shortage.\u00a0 Consider Africa, where the cost of fertilizer has already quadrupled since the start of the pandemic and has skyrocketed further since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 One way to address this is by creating incentives for countries to produce more fertilizer as the United States is doing by committing $500 million to boost U.S. production.\u00a0 We can also help farmers maximize fertilizer efficiency learning from advances made by countries like Ethiopia.\nSome have tried to blame the sanctions imposed on Russian \u2013 on the Russian Federation by the United States and many other countries for worsening this crisis.\u00a0 This is false.\u00a0 When we imposed sanctions on Russia in order to end the war as quickly as possible, we deliberately and carefully created exceptions for agricultural goods and fertilizer.\u00a0 We\u2019re working every day to get countries any information or assistance they need to ensure that sanctions are not preventing food or fertilizer from leaving Russia or anywhere else.\nAs with its decision to start this unjustified war, responsibility for the disruption of these supplies and the suffering that it\u2019s causing around the world lies squarely and solely with the Russian Government.\nThird, we believe we must increase investments in agricultural capacity and resilience.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the United States is doing through our Feed the Future program, which will invest $5 billion in more than 35 countries over five years, as well as our longstanding support of international agricultural research centers.\u00a0 It\u2019s also the focus of the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate[1], which we launched a year ago with the United Arab Emirates to try to turbocharge investment in climate-smart agriculture.\nFourth, we believe that we have to help poor and vulnerable populations bear the colossal impact of this crisis.\u00a0 International financial institutions have a critical role to play in doing this.\u00a0 That\u2019s why our Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened a session with the leadership of the international financial institutions just a few weeks ago and pushed for the development of the International Financial Institution Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity, which was released on the margins of today\u2019s G7 financial ministerial.\nFinally, if we want to save lives, we all have to be willing to shoulder added risk.\u00a0 Last week, President Biden traveled to a family farm in Illinois.\u00a0 He talked about how farms like the one he visited are working to double crop, harvesting two crops from the same field in the same year.\u00a0 Now, this is something that doesn\u2019t always work.\u00a0 The growing seasons are short.\u00a0 Weather doesn\u2019t always cooperate.\u00a0 But as the President said, that\u2019s a risk we have to take.\u00a0 So our government is working to provide additional insurance for American farmers who are willing to give it a try.\nIf we take these steps together \u2013 meeting the urgent need for food, fertilizer, and financing; investing more in the resilience of agriculture and vulnerable populations \u2013 we will meet this crisis, we\u2019ll help prevent others like it, most important, we will save countless lives.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake, but I\u2019m convinced that if we come together, we can address this challenge.\nSo thank you so much again for being here.\u00a0 It\u2019s now an honor and a privilege to give the floor to the secretary-general, who has been a leader in rallying the response to this crisis.\nMr. Secretary-General.\n\n\n\n[1]\u00a0Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate\n\n\n\n"}, {"url":

She\u2019s an outstanding veteran diplomat.\u00a0 We hope the Senate will move quickly to confirm her, just as we hope Congress will move quickly to pass the $40 billion supplemental funding bill to ensure that our ability to provide assistance to Ukraine is not interrupted.\nThis morning I had an opportunity to meet with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba, part of what is an ongoing conversation with him on the phone, in person, whenever we have an opportunity to actually see each other.\u00a0 And I conveyed to him again our commitment \u2013 unwavering commitment \u2013 to Ukraine.\u00a0 NATO\u2019s unified response, which we affirmed once more today, will continue.\u00a0 Allies were joined here in Berlin by the foreign ministers from Sweden and Finland.\u00a0 Both countries are close and valued defense partners of NATO and the United States.\u00a0 And the United States would strongly support a NATO application by either Sweden or Finland should they choose to formally apply to the Alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019ll respect whatever decision they make.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve long supported NATO\u2019s Open Door policy and the right of all countries to decide their own futures, their policies, their security arrangements.\nWe also spent time here in Berlin laying the groundwork for next month\u2019s summit in Madrid. NATO is going to release its new Strategic Concept laying out how the Alliance will sustain and strengthen transatlantic security in the face of President Putin\u2019s aggression as well as other emerging threats.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll look ahead to our continuing efforts to fortify our force posture on NATO\u2019s eastern flank and to strengthen our defense partnerships beyond the region \u2013 for example, with Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, all of which will be represented in Madrid.\nFinally, from here we\u2019ll be traveling to Paris to attend the second ministerial meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council.\u00a0 President Biden\u2019s initiative to align some of the world\u2019s largest economies on the most important trade and tech issues of the day is bearing very significant fruit and delivering real results.\u00a0 Together we\u2019re working to shape norms and set standards on emerging technology, build more diverse and resilient supply chains, coordinate our approaches to export controls and investment screening mechanisms, acting together to stop unfair trade practices that harm our workers and our companies.\u00a0 The TTC has already proven highly useful for facilitating U.S.-EU cooperation \u2013 for example, on the swift imposition of export controls on Russia after it invaded Ukraine.\u00a0 I\u2019m very much looking forward to our meetings in Paris and continuing to deepen what is an abiding partnership between the United States and the European Union.\nAnd with that, happy to take some questions.\nMS ALLEN:\u00a0\u00a0First question will be from Ellie Kaufman of CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary, did you have a chance to speak with your Turkish counterpart today?\u00a0 Will they allow Sweden and Finland to move forward with the process of applying to NATO membership?\u00a0 And if not, did they express what their concerns are to you?\nAnd on another issue, is the U.S. going to send any U.S. personnel to the West Bank to investigate the killing Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, an American citizen?\u00a0 Also, you spoke with a member of her family.\u00a0 Who did you speak with and what was conveyed to you?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Second part first:\u00a0 We support an investigation of Shireen\u2019s killing.\u00a0 I had an opportunity to speak to \u2013 directly to her brother, Anton.\u00a0 I believe other members of the family were on the phone and listening in.\u00a0 I had a chance to express our deep condolences for her loss, our deep respect for the work that she did as a journalist for many years \u2013 widely respected around the world \u2013 as well as the need to have an immediate and credible investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.\nHere in Berlin, yes, I did have a chance to talk to my Turkish counterpart, the foreign minister.\u00a0 When it comes to Sweden and Finland and their potential accession to NATO, this is a process.\u00a0 And NATO is a place for dialogue; it\u2019s a place for discussion.\u00a0 It\u2019s a place for talking about any differences that that we may have.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to characterize the specific conversation that we had either with the foreign minister or within the NATO sessions themselves, but I can say this much:\u00a0 I heard, almost across the board, very strong support for Finland and NATO[i]\u00a0joining the Alliance if that\u2019s what they choose to do.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very confident that we will reach consensus on that.\nMS ALLEN:\u00a0\u00a0The next question is from Annmarie Hordern of Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 First question:\u00a0 We heard from the Turkish foreign minister about what they would like in terms of the prospect of the prospective NATO members of Finland and Sweden.\u00a0 And part of that is about \u2013 they say that those members should not impose export bans.\u00a0 So is Turkey asking the United States and its allies to lift export bans specifically on weapons, and is that something the U.S. is even willing to discuss?\u00a0 And given the fact that this has now become a negotiation, aren\u2019t you worried that the Open Door policy is potentially now going to become a negotiation tactic for any future prospective members?\nAnd you were also here meeting with your European counterparts.\u00a0 You know the EU is at the moment trying to get a European oil ban on Russia.\u00a0 Every single day Putin is funding his war with tens of millions of dollars being made by exports of fossil fuels.\u00a0 Are you worried that if Europe is unable to come to this agreement, it is going to damage this alliance and also just further this war?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019ll just repeat what I said about Turkey.\u00a0 I had an opportunity to talk to the foreign minister.\u00a0 We had a conversation about this in the context of the NATO meetings, which I\u2019m not going to characterize beyond saying that there is very strong consensus for bringing Finland and Sweden into the Alliance if they choose to formally apply.\u00a0 And as to the differences between Turkey, Finland, and Sweden that have been talked about, there\u2019s an ongoing conversation, and the bottom line is this:\u00a0 When it comes to the membership process, I am very confident that we will reach consensus.\nSecond, with regard to energy, that was actually not a focus of our conversations today.\u00a0 But we very much support the efforts that Europe, the European Union is making to wean itself off of Russian energy, whether that\u2019s oil or ultimately gas.\u00a0 This is a reliance that\u2019s been built up over many, many decades.\u00a0 It\u2019s not going to end overnight, but Europe is clearly on track to move decisively in that direction.\u00a0 And we very much support the European Union\u2019s efforts to put in place an embargo on the importation of Russian oil.\u00a0 That process is for the European Union to pursue.\nAs this is happening, the United States has taken a number of steps to help.\u00a0 And so for example, to the extent that there are any gaps that result in the energy that Europe is getting, we have already redirected significant supplies of liquefied natural gas to Europe.\u00a0 The President\u2019s committed to continuing to do that throughout the rest of the year \u2013 at the same time to make sure that there is bountiful energy on world markets and also to try to ensure that price hikes that have resulted from Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine are evaded and kept under control.\u00a0 The \u2013 we initiated a historic release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \u2013 a million barrels a day over six months.\u00a0 That was matched by a number of countries through the International Energy Agency. And of course, we established a task force with the European Union to work on these very issues.\u00a0 That task force is actively engaged as we speak.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0But can I just \u2013 just \u2013 the question really is about the fact that Hungary is putting a lot of hurdles in the way to get to this point.\u00a0 And when you and your allies speak, it\u2019s always about this unity, but clearly there\u2019s not.\u00a0 So if they\u2019re not able to get to an end agreement on oil, doesn\u2019t that just show that there is a lot of divisions in this so-called unity the United States has with the Europeans?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So it\u2019s interesting.\u00a0 With the \u2013 I guess the benefit of just a little distance from events, this has been going on for many months now \u2013 Russia\u2019s mounting aggression, then its aggression, and the response from countries around the world, but principally the United States and Europe, the most immediately concerned with that aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 And throughout this process, at virtually every turn, we\u2019ve said that we were going to do X, Y, and Z.\u00a0 Skepticism was expressed from various quarters about our ability to do that, and yet, we\u2019ve done it.\u00a0 We said from the get-go that if Russia pursued its aggression against Ukraine, there\u2019d be massive consequences for Russia, including unprecedented sanctions.\u00a0 A number of people said: oh, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u00a0 Well, it did.\u00a0 There have been massive consequences and we have unleashed truly unprecedented sanctions.\nMany said that certain countries, certain partners wouldn\u2019t go along with various sections, and yet, they did.\u00a0 At other stages, people said that the European Union or European countries would not, for example, provide lethal defensive assistance to Ukraine, and yet, they have.\u00a0 At virtually every stage of the process of implementing \u2013 deciding on and implementing new sanctions, there have been those who said: oh, they\u2019re not going to do it; it\u2019s too hard; there\u2019s not consensus.\u00a0 And yet, they did, and they have.\nSo I think the lesson from the last six months is that we have seen unprecedented unity. \u00a0We have seen unprecedented action.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very convinced that that\u2019s going to continue as long as Russia\u2019s aggression does.\nMS ALLEN:\u00a0\u00a0Last question comes from Thomas \u2013 I want to make sure I get his name right.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s Thomas Gutschker with Frankfurter \u2014\nMS ALLEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thomas Gutschker from FAZ.\u00a0 Thanks so much.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s correct.\u00a0 Thanks for taking my question.\u00a0 It\u2019s about the Strategic Concept and the discussion you are having on that.\u00a0 Some allies are now saying they see the future of relations with Russia in the framework of containment.\u00a0 Do you think that is the right term, the right concept to frame future relations with Russia?\u00a0 And somewhat related to this, do you see any more reason to keep up the NATO-Russia Founding Act?\u00a0 I know so far NATO has said Russia has walked away.\u00a0 NATO has also said it\u2019s not restricting anything that\u2019s going on right now.\u00a0 But of course, the next step could be to simply say: we also walk away from it; we no longer consider this to be a viable document.\u00a0 What\u2019s the U.S. position on that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 A lot of these issues will be fully discussed and fully elaborated on at the NATO Summit in Madrid in June.\u00a0 And much of the work that we were doing today was in furtherance of that Summit and the work the leaders will bring to conclusion, including the Strategic Concept.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t want to get into any detail about that; everything is being drafted as we speak.\u00a0 There were very positive and substantial inputs to that drafting process over the last couple of days, and I\u2019d say we had a very good discussion about it.\nAt the heart of NATO and at the heart of the Strategic Concept is the notion of defense and deterrence.\u00a0 That\u2019s what bring \u2013 brought the Alliance together in the first place, and that includes with regard to deterring and defending against any aggression from Russia.\u00a0 I can say with confidence that that will be fully reflected in the Strategic Concept.\u00a0 Beyond that, let me leave it to the Summit, to the leaders to describe in more detail how the Alliance sees its relationship with Russia going forward.\u00a0 That will be something that will be, I think, fully aired at the Summit in Madrid.\u00a0 Thank you.\nThank you.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n\n\n[i]\u00a0Sweden\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-cambodian-deputy-prime-minister-and-foreign-minister-prak-sokhonn/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

so many people here in person today.\nWe\u2019re delighted to have you join us both in this historic room and online.\nFor more than 30 years, the World Food Prize has recognized and celebrated individuals who advance the cause of food security and nutrition around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s the U.S. Department of State\u2019s honor to host this event in person this year after two years of fully virtual events.\nWe\u2019re glad to be joined by Special Envoy for Global Food Security Dr. Cary Fowler.\u00a0 I\u2019d also like to thank Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack for participating in this event.\u00a0 While he\u2019s unable to join us in person, we\u2019re grateful for his pre-recorded remarks for today\u2019s ceremony.\nAt the State Department and particularly in the bureau I\u2019m responsible for, the Bureau for Economic and Business Affairs, we greatly value our longstanding relationship with the World Food Prize Foundation.\u00a0 Our mutual focus on promoting innovation and science-based solutions, much like the prize\u2019s namesake, Dr. Norman Borlaug, are needed more than ever to address the complex food security challenges facing the world.\nUnfortunately, those challenges are being exacerbated at this very moment by Vladimir Putin\u2019s unjustified, unprovoked war against Ukraine, which has put millions more around the globe at risk of food insecurity.\nRussia and Ukraine are two of the world\u2019s most significant exporters of agricultural commodities and fertilizer.\u00a0 And by conducting his war of aggression against Ukraine, Putin has guaranteed that the costs of his reckless campaign will be felt beyond Ukraine by the world\u2019s most vulnerable citizens for years \u2013 and for years to come.\nThe work of the World Food Prize Foundation is more important now than ever as we face both the consequences of this war and other challenges, like climate change and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnd now to announce this year\u2019s World Food Prize laureate, I welcome to the stage World Food Prize Foundation President Barbara Stinson.\u00a0\u00a0(Applause.)\nMS STINSON:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you, Assistant Secretary Toloui \u2013 thank you to Secretary Blinken; our thoughts are with you; thank you for inviting us in \u2013 Under Secretary

appreciate 20 years of incredible partnership with the State Department, and I\u2019d also like to thank Secretary Tom Vilsack.\u00a0 We appreciate your partnership over these many years, working with us to announce the 2022 laureate, and I\u2019m also happy to welcome Jennifer Moffitt, Chavonda Jacobs-Young, also here with us today.\nOther friends are also here from USDA, and truly, our partners from around the world, everyone here in the room \u2013 we thank you.\u00a0 Special guest, his honor \u2013 His Excellency Hailemariam Desalegn, welcome \u2013 from Ethiopia.\u00a0 Thank you.\nAt the World Food Prize Foundation, our mission is to elevate innovations and inspire action to sustainably increase the quality, quantity, and availability of food for all.\u00a0 Today we recognize an individual who epitomizes this mission.\nLet me also thank Paul Schickler, who\u2019s here with us as chair of our board of directors, and the council of advisors.\u00a0 We have representatives of the council of advisors \u2013 they\u2019d give us sage advice throughout the year \u2013 and we have both Dr. Jacobs-Young with us today, Mort Neufville, and Ismail Serageldin.\u00a0 Thank you for coming.\nDr. Norman Borlaug was the father of the Green Revolution, and it\u2019s said to have saved over a billion lives through his agricultural innovations.\u00a0 He envisioned an annual prize honoring significant and measurable achievements in improving the world\u2019s food supply, and he inspired others to action.\u00a0 Dr. Gebisa Ejeta is one of those, 2009 World Food Prize laureate and the chair of our independent group of experts who support the selection committee of the World Food Prize.\u00a0 Thank you to Gebisa.\nToday I announce the 2022 World Food Prize laureate, who will join 51 others who advanced human development through their innovations in food and agriculture, but also for nutrition, aquatic foods, soil health, food technology and infrastructure, economics, and humanitarian leadership.\nI am pleased to have one of our laureates here today, David Beckmann.\u00a0 He received the 2010 World Food Prize.\nWe are faced with unprecedented challenges in global food security, with the war in Ukraine, escalating food prizes, food availability and access challenges, and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and climate change.\u00a0 This triple threat impacts our world\u2019s hungry, poor, and vulnerable the most.\nToday we recognize and elevate the work of our 52nd laureate, who\u2019s making seminal global contributions to climate change modeling for transforming food systems.\u00a0 She has spent four decades cultivating our understanding of biophysical and socioeconomic impacts that climate change and food systems have on each other, improving the methods that we use to predict these trends.\u00a0 Her collaborative research provides the scientific evidence used by thousands of decision makers in more than 90 countries that are striving to both mitigate the impacts of and adapt to climate change.\u00a0 Our laureate\u2019s work shows that data-driven strategies curb climate change impacts and enhance sustainable food production at the same time.\nAn agronomist and a climatologist, she has been a leader in the field of food and climate since the early 1980s when she carried out some of the first studies on how climate change would impact food production in North America.\u00a0 She quickly escalated this work and elevated to global studies, incorporating economics, social research, using agricultural science and climate modeling to better understand and predict trends.\u00a0 She was one of the first to document the impacts of climate change on our food supply.\nHer work as lead and co-lead author on international assessments contributed to our scientific foundation of the UN Framework Convention for* Climate Change.\u00a0 Her research directly supports work in more than 20 countries to develop national adaptation plans and to determine their contributions.\u00a0 She founded the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Program[1], AgMIP.\u00a0 It\u2019s a global transdisciplinary network of more than a thousand leading researchers from around the world.\u00a0 AgMIP sets the gold standard for climate and food systems modeling.\u00a0 Our laureate led the development of protocols to improve model performance in diverse conditions, and coordinated assessments across many different disciplines and scales.\nAs a farmer herself, our laureate understands the importance of centering farmers in agricultural research, as both the most important beneficiaries of the research and custodians of practical indigenous knowledge.\u00a0 AgMIP helps us understand climate risks in various scenarios, and assures that both public policy and our investments are going to serve farmers of all types equitably.\nFor her energy and insight this brilliant trailblazer brings to addressing climate change and transforming food systems, I am so pleased to announce that the 2022 World Food Prize laureate is Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig of the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDr. Rosenzweig is a senior research scientist and head of the Climate Impacts group at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.\u00a0 I am pleased to have Administrator of NASA Bill Nelson here with us today.\u00a0 Thank you for coming.\u00a0 To learn more about Dr. Rosenzweig, see her story. It\u2019s going to be passed out as you leave the room.\u00a0 It\u2019s available on our website right away, now, and \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 boom \u2013 and it\u2019s also going to be an opportunity to learn more about her at Live with the Laureate, which is a webcast that we\u2019ll present on Thursday, May 26th.\nAnd it will be my honor to present the World Food Prize at the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines on Thursday, October 20th, so please plan to join us.\u00a0 The 2022 International Borlaug Dialogue will take place in Des Moines.\u00a0 It will be in person and virtually.\u00a0 As always, we will be addressing the theme of feeding a fragile world \u2013 to address the nexus of agriculture, climate change, and food and nutrition security.\nThank you all for coming today.\u00a0 Thank you for celebrating.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to turn it back to you, Assistant Secretary Toloui.\u00a0 I hope to see all of you in Des Moines, where you can meet the 2022 World Food Prize laureate, Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, President Stinson, for those remarks.\u00a0 And congratulations to the New World Food Prize laureate, Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig.\u00a0 I\u2019m very proud that my home state of Iowa is going to be hosting the ceremony.\nI\u2019d now like to turn to Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose Fernandez, who will offer congratulations and remarks of his own.\nUNDER SECRETARY FERNANDEZ:\u00a0 Thank you and good morning.\u00a0 And thank you, Ramin.\u00a0 My talking points say, \u201cThank you for that warm introduction,\u201d but I\u2019ll cut the warm for \u2013 (laughter).\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 And thank you really for the work that you and your team are doing, the good work that you\u2019re doing to strengthen food security worldwide, especially in the face of Russia\u2019s further invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 And Barbara , I \u2013 as someone who went to Iowa when I was assistant secretary three times, it\u2019s a real show.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of fun, and it\u2019s a real celebration.\u00a0 So hopefully \u2013 hopefully I can get back there.\nThank you again, Barbara, to you and to everyone at the World Food Prize Foundation for your outstanding work in fighting world hunger and supporting extraordinary individuals like this year\u2019s laureate, Cynthia \u2013 Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig.\nI don\u2019t need to tell you this: this is a critical moment for food security.\u00a0 In 2021, more than 160 million people worldwide experienced acute food insecurity, a 19 percent jump \u2013 a 19 percent jump \u2013 from the year before.\u00a0 Millions more are poised to fall into food insecurity due to the Russian Government\u2019s war in Ukraine.\u00a0 As many of you know, Ukraine supplies a significant amount of the world\u2019s wheat and corn, but this can\u2019t happen when farmers have been forced to fight or have had to flee invading troops, and when they don\u2019t have the diesel fuel to operate tractors and other equipment.\u00a0 Russian troops have destroyed port facilities, they\u2019ve blocked food shipments in the Black Sea that get food to the rest of the world, and as a result, it\u2019s not only displaced Ukrainians who are going hungry, but it\u2019s also created hunger around the world for people who depend on these crops.\nThe issue of food security has grown even more urgent, and the effects of food insecurity are widespread and are devastating.\u00a0 When there is food insecurity, farmers lose their livelihoods.\u00a0 Parents spend hours every day trying to secure their family\u2019s next meal.\u00a0 Hungry children struggle to learn, and they suffer irreversible health consequences.\u00a0 Already vulnerable populations are always, always hit hardest, and food insecurity also holds back broader economic growth and increases the risk of violent conflict and civil unrest.\nThis is a humanitarian crisis; it\u2019s a health crisis.\u00a0 It\u2019s an economic and national security issue. And simply put, it\u2019s a moral issue.\u00a0 No child \u2013 no child on Earth should have to go hungry.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the U.S. \u2013 and a lot of this is through Ramin\u2019s good work \u2013 is committed to the global fight against food insecurity both by addressing the root causes of hunger, and also by meeting the immediate needs of those suffering worldwide.\nOne of those root causes is the climate crisis.\u00a0 Climate change has already had a significant and negative impact on global agricultural production, and its impact is only going to get worse.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing rice fields drown in floods; we\u2019re seeing other crops wither in drought.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen shellfish die in more acidic oceans, and crop diseases are spreading to new regions.\u00a0 We likely would not understand all of these problems as well as we do today without the work of Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig, this year\u2019s World Food Prize laureate.\nAs you\u2019ve heard, Dr. Rosenzweig was one of the first scientists to document how climate change affects food production.\u00a0 Thanks to her research, we can better predict how rising temperatures, extreme weather, and carbon dioxide will affect food production and quality.\u00a0 And the work she\u2019s done for NASA, for the United Nations, and the U.S. Congress has empowered lawmakers and also policymakers to make smarter decisions to protect agriculture against the changing climate.\nFor example, the U.S. recently launched an initiative with the UAE, with the United Arab Emirates, called the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate, or AIM for C.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re investing $4 billion in climate-smart agriculture to develop crops that are more resilient to threats like pests and extreme weather.\u00a0 And this will build upon Dr. Rosenzweig\u2019s foundational research.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for her pioneering work, and we\u2019re proud to be an ally in this fight, and we\u2019re proud to be an ally with the World Food Prize Foundation.\nThe State Department has created an action plan.\u00a0 It\u2019s created an action plan to bring partners together to address food security that\u2019s been caused by Putin\u2019s war.\u00a0 And this plan has five components.\nFirst, we\u2019re tackling immediate disruptions to the global food supply and mobilizing resources to meet urgent humanitarian needs.\u00a0 President Biden announced recently that the U.S. is prepared to provide one billion dollars to this effort.\nThe second component is that we\u2019re stepping efforts \u2013 stepping up our work to mitigate the global fertilizer shortage by collaborating with other countries to increase production.\nThird, we continue to boost agricultural capacity and resilience through Feed the Future, which is the U.S. Government\u2019s global hunger and food security initiative.\u00a0 Feed the Future provides support to countries in order to improve local nutrition and make their agricultural systems more resilient.\nFourth, we\u2019re working with our partners, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and many other multilateral organizations and development banks, to cushion the impact of rising food prices on poor people.\u00a0 This includes strengthening social safety nets and scaling up cash transfers to the most vulnerable.\nFinally, and fifth, we are pursuing all of these efforts with intensive diplomacy in our bilateral relationships and in international forums.\u00a0 For example, in a couple of weeks, in two weeks, Secretary Blinken will host a ministerial in New York at the United Nations, a ministerial that we\u2019re calling a global food security call to action.\u00a0 This is going to bring together those countries most affected by food insecurity together with those best positioned to help.\u00a0 And Secretary Blinken will chair a meeting of the UN Security Council that\u2019s going to be focused on the current hunger crisis.\nAs we continue this work, we will be joined by a new member of our team, who I\u2019d like to introduce right now, Dr. Cary Fowler.\u00a0 Dr. Fowler has a resume that we can all dream of.\u00a0 He\u2019s our new Special Envoy for Global Food Security and he brings decades \u2013 decades \u2013 of experience to the State Department.\u00a0 Dr. Fowler is a renowned agriculturalist and he\u2019s going to be indispensable in our work and in our fight against global hunger.\nIt\u2019s people like Dr. Rosenzweig, like Dr. Fowler, and each of you here today who make progress against food insecurity possible.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you all for your dedication to this worthy fight.\u00a0 And congratulations again to Dr. Rosenzweig for this well-deserved recognition.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0 Thank you, Under Secretary Fernandez, Jose, for your remarks.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have to warm up those introductions next year.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nNow I\u2019d like to turn everyone\u2019s attention to the video screens.\u00a0 Secretary Tom Vilsack from USDA was unable to attend today, but he\u2019s provided prerecorded remarks for this event.\nSECRETARY VILSACK:\u00a0(Via video remarks) It\u2019s my honor to join guests from all around the world in celebrating the 2022 World Food Prize laureate, Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig.\u00a0 Dr. Rosenzweig embodies the leadership, innovation, and experience necessary to face the intersecting challenges of global hunger and the climate crisis and to empower agriculture to be a meaningful solution to address these challenges.\nA farmer first, her early influences in agricultural came from working the land and cultivating a love for food on the farm.\u00a0 Through work that thus far has spanned four decades, she set out to discover what will happen to our food with the climate changing so rapidly and has been at the cutting edge of using modeling to predict outcomes.\nShe completed the first transdisciplinary model projections of the effects of climate change on food production in North America in 1985, becoming one of the first scientists to document that climate change was already impacting the cultivation of our food supply.\u00a0 She started the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project to significantly improve agricultural models and scientific and technological capabilities for assessing the impacts of climate variability and change, as well as other driving forces on agriculture, food security, and poverty from local to global scales.\u00a0 This type of interdisciplinary work has and will continue to aid USDA in making investments in programmatic decisions, particularly as we develop climate-smart agricultural approaches, build on a greater understanding of the impacts of climate change on our food systems.\nIn addition, her work on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change demonstrated a way forward on food and agricultural systems.\u00a0 Among the key findings in the 2019 report she coauthored, we find optimism through the recognition that healthy and sustainable foods present major opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving health outcomes.\nShe also shines a bright light on the importance of agricultural training programs that inspire the next generation of climate, agriculture, and food leaders.\nTraining and retraining will become even more pertinent with ongoing climate challenges.\u00a0 Changing crops, pests, rainfall amounts, and seasonal patterns means ag systems will need even greater and more innovative training and information-delivery models for farmers.\nAt USDA, we\u2019re proud to partner with the World Food Prize Foundation on the Wallace-Carver Fellowship, which offers college students a valuable opportunity to learn firsthand from scientists and policymakers at research centers and field offices.\nJust as Dr. Rosenzweig\u2019s on-the-job experience, training, and education propelled her forward in her career, we are training and inspiring the next generation of leaders who will follow in her footsteps.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019ll continue to pursue climate-smart agricultural methods and innovative solutions to drive transformation in climate action, in no small part thanks to her groundbreaking work.\nCongratulations to her on this incredible, successful career, which is culminated in this noble and well-deserved honor.\u00a0 This generation and future generations thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0 I\u2019d like to thank Secretary Vilsack for those remarks, and to all of our USDA colleagues who\u2019ve \u2013 who joined in sharing that video today.\u00a0 We\u2019re \u2013 we work very closely with USDA here at the State Department on these global food security challenges.\nAnd with that, let me welcome Dr. Cary Fowler, the Department of State\u2019s new special envoy for global food security, to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDR FOWLER:\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 It is a good morning, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 Under Secretary Fernandez, President Stinson, Assistant Secretary Toloui, honored guests, it\u2019s my honor to be with you today.\u00a0 I\u2019m particularly thrilled as today\u2019s laureate announcement ceremony marks the first official public engagement in my new role as special envoy for global food security.\u00a0 I very much appreciate the trust shown to me by President Biden and Secretary Blinken.\nAgriculture is facing an historically unprecedented combination of challenges: the task of producing more food with less land, with less water, in the context of escalating conflict, and in the face of a rapidly changing climate.\u00a0 Is agriculture ready for this?\u00a0 Are our crops adapted?\u00a0 Are our farming systems and institutions prepared?\nEveryone looks to World Food Prize laureates both for hope and for solutions.\u00a0 However, there is no quick fix or easy answer.\u00a0 The recipients of this award have labored long and brought innovation and creativity to bear to answer these questions.\u00a0 The World Food Prize recognizes and celebrates the grand masters of global food security.\u00a0 These are men and women who are not only brilliant in their specific fields, but, like the best chess players, they are superb strategists.\u00a0 They have recognized big problems, usually intractable and often invisible to others, and they\u2019ve navigated past all the obstacles on the board to solve them.\u00a0 Most laureates labor quietly and with little notice or fanfare until their names are read out in this building.\u00a0 The announcement here at the State Department recognizes the importance of their work and their personal sacrifices, and it signals our nation\u2019s profound gratitude.\nMost importantly, though, I hope that this inspires the next generation of budding scientists and researchers to follow in their footsteps in striving for a world where food is truly available to all.\u00a0 Congratulations to Dr. Rosenzweig and thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLOUI:\u00a0 Dr. Fowler, thank you.\u00a0 It\u2019s a delight to have you in the building at this important time.\nAs we conclude today\u2019s ceremony \u2013 and I\u2019d like to thank Jos\u00e9, Under Secretary Fernandez, President Stinson, Secretary Vilsack for their involvement today.\u00a0 It should be clear to everyone who is here in person and participating virtually how seriously the United States Government takes this issue.\u00a0 Through pioneering initiatives like the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, we\u2019re working with governments, companies, researchers, and philanthropies around the world to drive investment toward our most pressing agriculture innovation priorities, and I\u2019d encourage you all to join us in \u201cAIMing for Climate,\u201d and we\u2019re grateful to the contributions you\u2019re already making to these goals.\nI also want to thank President Barbara Stinson and the entire World Food Prize Foundation for their tireless efforts to strengthen global food security and food systems and advance human development.\u00a0 The State Department and our government partners look forward to participating in the October Borlaug Dialogue events in Des Moines and to continuing our efforts throughout the year to advance our common objectives to build sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems.\nThank you again for everyone \u2013 to everyone for joining us today, and once more, congratulations to our 2022 World Food Prize Laureate Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\n\n[1]\u00a0Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement

(Laughter.)\u00a0 So I\u2019m not sure what the lesson to be drawn from that is, but there\u2019s something there.\u00a0 I also suspect he couldn\u2019t get confirmed for a job, but that\u2019s another matter.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI also am very pleased to see an old friend and colleague, the Secretary General Almagro.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 Congratulations on your very well-deserved leadership award.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nAnd then I want to extend a very special welcome to the ambassadors from the region who are here today.\u00a0 You\u2019re at home here in the State Department.\u00a0 Welcome, welcome, welcome.\nAnd indeed, it\u2019s welcome to \u2013 wonderful to welcome this council back to the State Department for the annual conference, again something we\u2019ve not been able to do for the last couple of years.\u00a0 But we are now back; you are now back.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful for that.\nSo as Andres said, in a little over a month, the United States will host a Summit of the Americas for the first time since that inaugural summit in 1994.\u00a0 And I have to tell you, it\u2019s a little bit of a personal bookend for me, because at the time of the Miami summit in 1994, I was a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and got to work on the summit.\u00a0 Some of the things he said at the summit actually may have reflected some of the things I put into the speeches, and it\u2019s a very strong and early memory of my time working for President Clinton.\nMy memory is \u2013 and we fact-checked this in the archives \u2013 the early drafts that we produced for President Clinton received a fairly healthy amount of editing from the president and others, but clearly to the benefit of the speeches and clearly to the benefit of the summit.\u00a0 But this is very much a homecoming, and I am so glad that we have the summit back in the United States.\nAs with so many who took part in that first summit in \u201994, Miami left a lasting impression on me \u2013 capturing the enthusiasm of the moment, the promise of the democratic aspirations of the region that we share, promise that we still very much see.\u00a0 And today what I\u2019d like to do is just to set out a little bit how the Biden administration will use the forthcoming Summit of the Americas to continue building on that promise.\nNow, it\u2019s no secret to anyone in this room that the summit comes at a challenging time for the region.\u00a0 COVID-19 has taken the lives of 2.7 million men, women, and children in our hemisphere.\u00a0 That accounts for more than 40 percent of global reported deaths.\u00a0 It\u2019s the highest per capita loss of any region in the world.\u00a0 The pandemic has also inflicted massive economic harm throughout the region \u2013 job losses, declining income, rising poverty.\u00a0 And it has had massive social implications: we have seen fewer kids in school, more youth out of work, and a ravaging of the public health sector.\nNow, with the Russian Government\u2019s brutal war of aggression on Ukraine, many of these preexisting problems, these preexisting conditions, have been made worse, raising the price of essential commodities throughout the Americas, from fertilizer to wheat to petroleum, cutting off key export markets for many industries in the Americas, and forcing households across the region to make very wrenching choices as the cost of living skyrockets.\u00a0 So all of this is very much felt and is very much present.\nThese are just some of the short-term headwinds that we have to deal with.\u00a0 They come atop longstanding challenges.\u00a0 We know in many parts of the hemisphere that we share there remains a lack of economic opportunity and inequity.\u00a0 An accelerating climate crisis, widespread violence and insecurity, endemic corruption, declining trust in government \u2013 all problems that are leading people across the Americas to leave home in search of places where they have a better shot of providing for their loved ones, even if the journey comes with the most profound risks.\nOne of my colleagues at one of the meetings we were having some months ago talked about this phenomenon, the extraordinary migration that we\u2019re dealing with not only in our own hemisphere but around the world.\u00a0 And she talked about the need to try to establish what she called a right to remain.\u00a0 And creating for the conditions for that right to remain are something that I think all of us need to be thinking about and working on together.\nNow, in the face of what are incredibly serious challenges, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of the fact that for the vast majority of countries in our hemisphere, there is still a strong agreement on the best way to address these challenges, and that\u2019s through democracy.\u00a0 That\u2019s not because democracy has a perfect track record, of course.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 It\u2019s because citizens across the region still believe that they should be the ones to chart the path of their nations.\nYet, as every government participating in the summit knows, we can\u2019t take the democratic character of this region for granted.\u00a0 It\u2019s not inevitable.\u00a0 It depends fundamentally on people\u2019s continued belief that they can improve the system from within \u2013 as we say here in the United States, that we can work together to form a more perfect union.\u00a0 And to keep that faith, we have to show people that democracies can do better, that they can deliver what people want and what people need.\nI think that requires learning from our experience in the nearly three decades since that first Summit of the Americas in 1994.\u00a0 So what I\u2019d like to do quickly is to just share a few thoughts about some of the important lessons that might inform our actions going into next month\u2019s summit, lessons that we might take from the experience of the last few decades.\nFirst, we should avoid falling into blocks of left and right, liberal and conservative, and instead focus on what actually brings us together as democracies.\u00a0 That means recognizing our shared interest in strengthening the pillars of our fellow free and open societies like the rule of law, like respect for human rights, like free and fair elections, a vibrant, independent press, which is front and center in my mind today.\u00a0 This is actually World Press Freedom Day, which we started out by going over to the Foreign Press Center and talking to reporters from around the world, many of whom are quite literally putting their lives in danger to try to bring the facts, to try to bring information, to try and bring the truth to people around the world.\nThis approach that\u2019s resisting labels of left and right, liberal and conservative, but instead is focusing on the common fundamental principles that bring us together, that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019ve been taking, including at the recent Summit for Democracy that President Biden convened late last year.\u00a0 Twenty-six countries from the Americas took part in the summit.\u00a0 That accounts for more than a quarter of all the participants in the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 Every one of those countries showed up with concrete commitments to make their democracies stronger \u2013 Trinidad and Tobago to increase transparency in public spending, Costa Rica pledging to expand an effective community-based violence prevention program.\u00a0 The list goes on.\u00a0 But in each of these ways, we\u2019re making an effort to demonstrate that democracies can effectively produce more and better results for people across a wide spectrum of activities.\nSecond, there was tremendous enthusiasm in 1994 for the ability of open markets and free trade to create broad-based opportunity and improve conditions of workers across the hemisphere.\u00a0 And this past decade has seen remarkable growth across the region, millions more people lifted out of poverty and into the possibility of being part of the global middle class.\u00a0 But I suspect everyone in this room knows very well that growth also brought some downsides, notably immense inequality, including right here in the United States.\u00a0 Instead, a lot of the disillusionment citizens in the Americas feel with democracy is a result of this gap between what democracies promised and what they\u2019ve delivered, notably in the concrete standard of living that people have been experiencing.\u00a0 The gap, as President Clinton framed it in 1994, between\u00a0deechos\u00a0and\u00a0hechos, words and deeds.\u00a0 And this is a gap we always, always have to mind if we want to make sure that we have sustained support for what we\u2019re doing.\nThe answer, of course, is not to give up on free markets and trade, but to set the terms of trade and investment in ways that benefit all citizens, not just those on the very top:\u00a0 eliminating the barriers that keep small business from joining the formal economy; combating the corruption that robs the resources and energy of innovators and communities alike; broadening access to emerging technologies that are increasingly crucial to actually doing business \u2013 something that we\u2019ll drive at at the upcoming summit with the first-ever regional agenda for digital transformation.\nIn my judgment, we also have to do more to reinforce social safety nets, because even the most effective economic policies are not going to benefit all communities at the same time.\u00a0 We have to be there for those who are left behind.\nDelivering growth with equity also demands tapping into one of the most powerful engines for opportunity in the Americas: the private sector.\u00a0 And I would start by saying the U.S. private sector.\u00a0 The United States is already the top trading partner for more than two-thirds of the hemisphere\u2019s countries.\u00a0 In 2019, U.S. foreign direct investment in the Americas totaled $1.3 trillion dollars.\u00a0 U.S. trade with countries in the region totals $1.5 trillion every year \u2013 more, by far, than any other country in the world.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the volume that\u2019s so significant.\u00a0 It\u2019s how the United States invests that matters:\u00a0 openly, transparently, with respect for labor and human rights; in a way that\u2019s sustainable for the environment and without piling debt upon countries that they can\u2019t afford to get out from under.\nAt the same time, our diplomats are working to raise the standards of investment in countries around the hemisphere \u2013 so that this approach becomes the rule, not the exception.\nConsider the Call to Action for an investment in Central America that Vice President Harris launched in December, and that\u2019s already raised more than $1.2 billion in commitments from the U.S. private sector.\nAs part of this call, Parkdale Mills, one of the world\u2019s major providers of cotton consumer products, committed $150 million to building a new facility in Honduras.\u00a0 This investment is going to help shift production of a million pounds of yarn per week from Asia to the Americas, increasing regional supply, increasing resilience of supply, while also supporting approximately a thousand new, good-paying jobs between Honduras and the United States.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just one example of what is possible.\nWe also have to close another gap in our economic development approach \u2013 and that \u201cwe\u201d when I say \u201cwe have to close that gap,\u201d that includes the United States and leading multilateral institutions active in the region.\u00a0 That is, we have to do more to meet the region\u2019s and reach the region\u2019s middle-income economies.\nThere is something of another kind of middle-income trap that I know many of our closest neighbors experience: countries that are not quite developed enough to qualify for membership in groups like the G20 or the OECD, and yet too developed to qualify for aid from institutions like the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank.\u00a0 Even modest increases in public investment in these countries will go a long way toward stimulating more private investment in their economies.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking at other ways to deal with this trap.\u00a0 This is something that I\u2019ve heard again and again from colleagues throughout the hemisphere.\u00a0 And countries that have been on the front line of being ravaged by COVID or climate \u2013 we need to find more effective ways to make sure that they have the resources necessary to deal with these challenges.\nThe same is true, I\u2019d say, for the investments that we make within countries, so that we can support growth not only from the bottom up, but also from the middle out.\u00a0 That means doing more to stimulate investment in the region\u2019s working class \u2013 the entrepreneurs, women- and minority-led small enterprises, and others who are ready to grow their businesses but lack the capital or access to the formal economy to do so.\u00a0 This has been a major focus of the U.S.\u00a0 Development Finance Corporation.\u00a0 It\u2019s invested more than $10 billion in Latin America and the Caribbean, including a hundred million to help women-owned small businesses in Mexico weather the pandemic.\nThird, we need to build greater regional resilience to make our hemisphere less vulnerable to global disruptions in the supplies that we need most and that, for many of us, we have taken for granted over many years, and now we suddenly realize the fragility in the system that we built.\u00a0 This is one of the most hard-earned lessons of the pandemic.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a hard-earned lesson of Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.\u00a0 Building this kind of resilience demands pooling our individual strengths to make our democracies stronger as a whole.\nNow, I think we\u2019ve made a start on that \u2013 from the supply chain working group that the United States has created with Mexico, which includes a special focus on semiconductors and information communications technology; to the work of the newly formed Alliance for Development in Democracy formed by Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Panama, the United States \u2013 to strengthen supply chains in the areas of health, food security, and technology.\nFourth, even as we stay focused on strengthening democracies from within, we need a shared approach to autocracies in the region.\u00a0 And this includes continuing to support the individuals and groups in closed countries who are fighting so bravely to advance human rights and democracy, as we\u2019ve done for decades.\u00a0 We have a responsibility also to speak up and speak out collectively when we see governments weakening democracy at home, clamping down on the free press, threatening political opponents, undermining the independence of the courts.\u00a0 This is another one of democracies\u2019 inherent strengths: we believe in holding one another to account.\u00a0 And that includes the United States.\u00a0 And I can tell you that there is always more force and power in this and effect in this when we\u2019re actually able to do it collectively.\u00a0 And this points to, among other things, the vital role that the OAS plays and continues to play.\nIt also means taking the argument to closed countries, and to citizens across the hemisphere, about which system is actually better in delivering for its people.\u00a0 In Cuba, Venezuela, more recently Nicaragua, repressive governments offer a false choice between respecting people\u2019s rights and improving their welfare.\u00a0 But the decades since that first Summit of the Americas have demonstrated that non-democratic governments in the Americas have delivered neither \u2013 and instead produced rising corruption and declining standards of living.\u00a0 The debate about which system does better by the people it\u2019s supposed to serve is one that we should welcome.\u00a0 We can at once be humble about where democracy has fallen short, and confident about its stronger track record than autocracy.\nFinally, we have to remember that there\u2019s not a single challenge that we face in the Americas that our democracies are better off facing alone individually.\u00a0 That was true in 1994.\u00a0 It\u2019s true today, maybe even more true today.\u00a0 The way forward on virtually every challenge that\u2019s affecting the lives of citizens in all of our countries is through closer collaboration, closer coordination, coming together, working together \u2013 especially when it comes to the most intractable problems, like the migration challenge, the root cause drivers of which, as we\u2019ve seen, simply can\u2019t be addressed by short-term fixes, and where the incentives often favor passing onto others the problems that we\u2019re all better off tackling together as a region.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve joined Colombia and Panama in convening a pair of ministerial meetings to foster a more candid, concrete discussion about how we can work together to support communities that are hosting large populations of migrants; creating legal, humane pathways to migration; improving border security; combating transnational criminal organizations that prey on migrants; and addressing, as we were talking about earlier, the root causes that are leaving so many people to leave their homes.\u00a0 As a result of this effort, I am confident that we will get to a regional declaration on migration and protection at the upcoming summit \u2013 something that can benefit all of our countries, and especially benefit people across the region.\nTogether is the only way forward on addressing the accelerating climate crisis, which communities across the hemisphere are feeling more and more acutely.\u00a0 We see the region coming together on this, too.\u00a0 More countries in the Americas signed onto the Global Methane Pledge than any other region in the world \u2013 24 and counting.\u00a0 That commits them and each of us to cut global methane emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030.\u00a0 If \u2013 if \u2013 the world\u2019s major methane producers join us in meeting this pledge, this would be the equivalent of taking every plane out of the skies and every ship off the seas in terms of the emissions they produce, a dramatic step forward in trying to meet the test of dealing with climate change.\nTogether is the way forward on health security, too.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen how weaknesses in any one country in preventing, detecting, responding to outbreaks can put people in every country at risk.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we have donated more than 67 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to countries across the Americas \u2013 free of charge, no political strings attached.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why the budget that we put forward to Congress just last week aims to double down on our investments in public health and pandemic preparedness in our hemisphere, while also seeking significant funding to continue leading the global response to COVID-19.\nPerhaps most important, together means enlisting partners beyond our governments.\u00a0 And it\u2019s here that I\u2019d like to conclude.\nOf all the forces driving democratic progress in the Americas since 1994, none \u2013 in my judgment \u2013 has been more critical than the region\u2019s vibrant, diverse, and growing civil society.\u00a0 Whether those are journalists shining a light on corruption, human rights defenders documenting gross abuses, indigenous rights organizations giving voice to underserved communities \u2013 the work of these citizens has given people hope that we can still improve democracy from within, that the gap between\u00a0deechos\u00a0and\u00a0hechos\u00a0can still be closed.\nThat\u2019s why the United States has planned the most inclusive Summit of the Americas in history, ensuring that civil society groups, leaders from the private sector will not just be included in the meetings in Los Angeles; they\u2019ll be able to engage directly with the governments.\nI\u2019m confident that if we embrace this and other lessons learned since the first Summit of the Americas \u2013 focusing on what unites us as democracies rather than what divides us; ensuring not only growth, but greater equity; deepening regional resiliency in the face of shared challenges; and standing together in addressing autocracy and democratic backsliding alike \u2013 we will not only strengthen our individual democracies; we will do better at what is our number-one responsibility, and that is delivering on the fundamental needs and the fundamental hopes of all the peoples in this hemisphere that we share.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-mexican-foreign-secretary-marcelo-ebrard-before-their-meeting-2/", "title":

Meeks, Ranking Member McCaul, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for having me here today to speak about the administration\u2019s proposed budget for the State Department, but thank you more broadly \u2014\nMR CHABOT:\u00a0 Secretary, could you pull the mike a little closer, maybe?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yes, sorry.\u00a0 That better?\u00a0 Let me try that.\nBut thank you as well for your partnership and also for your leadership.\u00a0 That CODEL that both of you led in Poland at a critical moment made a big difference, and it\u2019s been gratifying to be able to work with both of you and other members on this urgent issue but also on many others.\u00a0 And I deeply appreciate it.\nAnd I did recently get back from Kyiv with Secretary Austin, where we wanted to show as well as deliver on America\u2019s commitment to the Government and to the people of Ukraine.\u00a0 This brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has underscored to me the power and the purpose of American diplomacy.\u00a0 Our diplomacy is rallying allies and partners around the world to join us in supporting Ukraine with security, economic, humanitarian assistance, to impose massive costs on Russia for its aggression, to strengthen our collective security and defense, and to address the war\u2019s mounting global consequences, including the refugee and food crises that have flown from it.\nWe have to continue to drive this diplomacy forward, also to seize the strategic opportunities and address some of the risks that are presented by Russia\u2019s overreach as countries reconsider their policies, their priorities, their relationships.\nThe budget request before you predates the crisis, but fully funding it and the new emergency resources that the President requested earlier today is critical to ensuring that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is a strategic failure for the Kremlin and serves as a powerful lesson to those who might consider following its path.\nThe supplemental resources Congress provided in March have made a decisive difference on the battlefield, helping Ukrainians defend their country and win the battle for Kyiv.\u00a0 Your support also helped meet the mounting costs caused by the Kremlin\u2019s brutal invasion in Ukraine itself, across Europe, around the world, while bolstering the security of our allies and partners.\nThis assistance was provided with broad bipartisan support and sent a clear signal of the United States commitment to the Ukrainian Government and to its people.\u00a0 We ask that Congress do the same with the emergency request that\u2019s before you as of today, which seeks $20.5 billion for security assistance, $8.5 billion for economic assistance, and $3 billion for humanitarian aid, including to address the growing global food security crisis, which is a direct result of Russia\u2019s aggression. \u00a0Approximately $14 billion of this request would be directed to the State Department and to USAID.\nLet me just underscore: We can\u2019t take our progress so far for granted.\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s enduring independence and sovereignty depends in no small part on ensuring that the country\u2019s brave defenders have what they need to keep up the fight and meet the urgent needs of their people.\nBut Mr. Chairman, to your point, as we focus on this urgent crisis, the State Department continues to carry out missions that are front and center to our diplomacy, like responsibly managing great power competition with China, facilitating a halt to fighting in Yemen and Ethiopia, pushing back against the rising tide of authoritarianism and the threat that it poses to democracy and human rights.\nWe also have evolving challenges that require us to develop new capabilities, like the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease, an accelerating climate crisis, a digital revolution that holds enormous promise but also real peril.\nLast fall, I had a chance to set out a modernization agenda for the department and for U.S. diplomacy to enable us to even more effectively respond to many of these complex demands.\u00a0 And in no small part thanks to the FY22 budget approved by Congress, we\u2019ve been able to make real progress on this agenda, though much remains to be done.\nTo give just a few quick examples, we\u2019ve strengthened our capacity to shape the ongoing technological revolution so that it actually protects our interests, it boosts American competitiveness, it upholds our values.\u00a0 With bipartisan Congressional support and encouragement, we just launched a new bureau for cyberspace and digital policy, with 60 team members to start.\u00a0 And I am grateful for the support and the advice that we got along the way.\nWe\u2019re also making headway on ensuring our diplomats reflect America\u2019s remarkable diversity.\u00a0 This is a tremendous source of strength for our diplomacy.\u00a0 The department\u2019s first ever chief diversity and inclusion officer has spearheaded an effort to analyze and address the obstacles that have been preventing under-represented groups from joining but also advancing at the State Department.\u00a0 We\u2019ve expanded the Pickering and Rangel fellowship programs and, Mr. Chairman, as you said, paid internships at State, again with strong Congressional input and support.\nMy first 15 months on this job have only strengthened my conviction that these and other reforms aren\u2019t just worthwhile, they\u2019re essential to delivering for the American people.\nEnsuring we can deliver on this agenda will require sustained funding, some new authorities, and most importantly, partnership from Congress. \u00a0That\u2019s why I\u2019m grateful to have worked with Congress to re-establish a formal dialogue on the State Department authorization.\u00a0 Last month, we sent congressional staff the first package of legislative authorities required to meet the challenges we face, and we expect to send more in the coming weeks and to working with you on State authorization.\nIf we want to deepen our capability in key areas like climate and multilateral diplomacy; if we want to expand on Secretary Powell\u2019s vision of a Foreign Service training float; if we want to strengthen global health security and the capacity to prevent, to detect, and respond to future outbreaks \u2013 we\u2019ll need some additional resources.\nIf we want to be able to swiftly stand up new missions, to deploy our diplomats when and where they\u2019re needed, and make these decisions based on risk management, not risk aversion, we\u2019ll need to reform the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act.\nThere are other things that I would point to that we need to do, but we look forward to working with you on that.\nSo in the interest of time, let me stop there.\u00a0 And of course, we can address these and many other issues throughout the course of the testimony.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Very good to be with everyone.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/opening-remarks-by-secretary-antony-j-blinken-before-the-house-subcommittee-on-state-foreign-operations-and-related-programs/", "title":

if we want to expand on Secretary Powell\u2019s vision of a Foreign Service training float; if we want to strengthen global health security to prevent, detect, and respond to future outbreaks \u2013 we need these additional resources.\nIf we want to be able to swiftly stand up new missions, to deploy diplomats when and where they are needed, and make these decisions based on risk management rather than risk aversion \u2013 we need to reform the security \u2013 the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and the Accountability Review Board statute.\nIf we want to rapidly scale up the response to crises like refugee surges and epidemics, while also avoiding costly overhead, we need more flexible domestic hiring authorities.\nThese are just a few examples, and I just want to stress in closing:\u00a0 This is not about advancing the goals of any one administration or any one party.\u00a0 It\u2019s about refocusing our mission and our purpose on the forces that are affecting the lives of all of our fellow citizens \u2013 their livelihoods, their security \u2013 for decades to come.\nSo I really appreciate the opportunity to speak today about why this matters, and look forward to working with this committee, the subcommittee, Congress as a whole, as a partner in these efforts.\nThank you very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-opening-remarks-before-the-senate-committee-on-appropriations-subcommittee-on-state-foreign-operations-and-related-programs/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

imposing massive costs on the Kremlin; strengthening our collective security and defense; addressing the war\u2019s mounting global consequences, including the refugee and food crises that you both alluded to.\nWe will, we have to continue to drive that diplomacy forward, to seize what I believe are strategic opportunities, as well as address risks presented by Russia\u2019s overreach as countries are reconsidering their policies, their priorities, their relationships.\u00a0 The budget request before you predated this crisis, but fully funding it is critical in my judgment to ensuring that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is a strategic failure for the Kremlin and serves as a powerful lesson to those who might consider following its path.\nAs we\u2019re focused intensely on this urgent crisis, the State Department continues to carry out the missions traditionally associated with diplomacy, like responsibly managing great power competition with China, facilitating a halt to fighting in Yemen and Ethiopia, pushing back against the rising tide of authoritarianism and the threat that it poses to human rights.\nWe also face evolving challenges that require us to develop new capabilities, such as the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease, an accelerating climate crisis, and of course a digital revolution that holds both enormous promise but also some peril.\nLast fall, I had an opportunity to set out a modernization agenda for the department and for U.S. diplomacy to respond to these complex demands.\u00a0 In no small part thanks to the FY22 budget approved by Congress, we\u2019ve been able to make real progress on this agenda, though much remains to be done.\nTo give just a few examples, we have strengthened our capacity to shape the ongoing technological revolution so that it actually protects our interests, it boosts our competitiveness, it upholds our values.\u00a0 With bipartisan congressional support and encouragement, we recently launched a new Bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy, with 60 team members to start.\u00a0 And I am grateful to Congress, to this committee, for long supporting this effort, for the ideas that you shared in how best to do it.\nWe\u2019re also making headway on ensuring that our diplomats reflect America\u2019s remarkable diversity, which is one of our greatest strengths, including in our diplomacy.\u00a0 We have, as the Chairman noted, our first ever chief diversity and inclusion officer, who is spearheading an effort to analyze and address the obstacles that prevent underrepresented groups from joining and advancing at State.\u00a0 We\u2019ve expanded the Pickering and Rangel fellowships and created, for the first time \u2013 thanks to the support of Congress and this committee \u2013 paid internships at State, along with strong congressional input and support for all of these efforts.\nAnd we\u2019re showing results.\u00a0 We recently welcomed a new cohort of 179 exceptional Foreign Service professionals.\u00a0 That\u2019s putting our department on track for its largest\u00a0annual intake in a decade.\nMy first 15 months in this job have only strengthened my own conviction that these and other reforms are not just worthwhile; they\u2019re essential to our national security and to delivering for the people we represent.\nToday\u2019s meeting marks, by our count, the 100th\u00a0time that I\u2019ve had an opportunity to brief Congress, which is one of the ways I\u2019ve worked to meet the commitment that I made in my confirmation before this committee to restore Congress\u2019s role as a partner both in our foreign policymaking and in revitalizing the State Department.\nEnsuring that we can deliver on the agenda will require sustained funding, some new authorities, and maybe most important of all, partnership from Congress.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I\u2019m grateful for the chairman and ranking member\u2019s request to establish a formal dialogue on the State Department authorization, a request that we have delivered on and we\u2019re going to look forward to working in detail with you as the authorization process moves forward.\nIf we want to deepen our capability in key areas like climate, like pandemic preparedness, like multilateral diplomacy; if we want to expand on Secretary Powell\u2019s vision of a Foreign Service training float; and equip our workforce with the training, with the tools, with the technology that we need for today\u2019s challenges \u2013 we need some additional resources, and those are set out in the budget.\nIf we want to be able to swiftly stand up new missions, deploy diplomats when and where they\u2019re needed \u2013 and I very much agree with the ranking member on this \u2013 and make those decisions based on risk management rather than on risk aversion \u2013 we need to reform the State Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and the Accountability Review Board statute.\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s laid out as well.\nIf we want to rapidly scale up in response to crises like refugee surges and epidemics while also avoiding costly overhead, we need more flexible domestic hiring authorities.\nThis is not about advancing the goals of any one administration, any one party.\u00a0 It\u2019s about refocusing our mission and purpose on the forces that really affect the lives of our fellow citizens \u2013 their livelihoods, their security \u2013 for decades to come.\nSo I very much appreciate this opportunity to speak today about why this matters, and look very much forward to continuing to make this committee, and Congress as a whole, a full partner in these efforts.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-secretary-lloyd-austin-remarks-to-traveling-press/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

just returned from Kyiv, where we went at the request of President Biden and the invitation of President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 We had an opportunity to demonstrate directly our strong support, our strong ongoing support for the Ukrainian Government and for the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 This was, in our judgment, an important moment to be there, an important moment for Ukraine, for the war \u2013 an important moment to have face-to-face conversations in detail about the extraordinary support that we\u2019ve provided: security, economic, humanitarian, as well as the massive pressure that we\u2019ve been exerting on Russia, and then to talk in detail about how we carry that forward across all of those fronts.\nI would say that, without putting words in his mouth, President Zelenskyy expressed deep appreciation for President Biden\u2019s leadership and for the incredible generosity and support of the American people.\u00a0 In turn, we expressed deep admiration for his leadership, for the extraordinary courage of Ukrainians in standing up to and pushing back this Russian aggression.\nPart of our commitment going forward involves a number of things that I was able to share with President Zelenskyy yesterday, including the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next[i]\u00a0week, including President Biden\u2019s intent to nominate a new ambassador to Ukraine, Ambassador Bridget Brink \u2013 currently an ambassador, someone I\u2019ve served with for a long time, deeply experienced in the region, who\u2019ll be a very strong representative for the United States in Ukraine.\nWe had an opportunity as well to talk about where this goes from here, with the success that Ukraine has had.\u00a0 It\u2019s also true that Russia continues to try to brutalize parts of the country, and the death and destruction that we continue to see is horrific.\u00a0 But Ukrainians are standing up, they\u2019re standing strong, and they\u2019re doing that with the support that we have coordinated from literally around the world.\nThe strategy that we\u2019ve put in place \u2013 massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia, solidarity with more than 30 countries engaged in these efforts \u2013 is having real results.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeing that when it comes to Russia\u2019s war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding.\u00a0 Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine \u2013 to take away its sovereignty, to take away its independence.\u00a0 That has failed.\u00a0 It\u2019s sought to assert the power of its military and its economy.\u00a0 We of course are seeing just the opposite \u2013 a military that is dramatically underperforming; an economy, as a result of sanctions, as a result of a mass exodus from Russia, that is in shambles.\u00a0 And it\u2019s sought to divide the West and NATO; of course, we\u2019re seeing exactly the opposite \u2013 an Alliance more divided[ii]\u00a0than I\u2019ve ever seen it and, indeed, new countries considering applying for membership.\nThe bottom line is this.\u00a0 We don\u2019t know how the rest of this war will unfold, but we do know that a sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene.\u00a0 And our support for Ukraine going forward will continue.\u00a0 It will continue until we see final success.\nSecretary?\nSECRETARY\u00a0AUSTIN:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 And first of all, let me echo what\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Blinken\u00a0has said in terms of the characterization of our meeting.\u00a0 I think it was a very productive meeting, very engaging session, and we were very happy to have that opportunity.\nSo during the meeting, we expressed our deepest condolences to the president for the loss of so many civilians and, of course, the loss of those courageous troops that have done just a magnificent job of pushing back Russian forces.\u00a0 We also expressed our admiration for their professionalism and for their commitment to defend their democracy.\u00a0 Just it\u2019s been extraordinary to watch, and I think everyone would agree with me there.\nI agree with\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Blinken\u00a0that the president did express his deep appreciation, along with the minister of defense and the chief of defense, their deep appreciation for what the American people have continued to do to ensure that we get them as much assistance as possible, as quickly as possible.\nSo our focus in the meeting was to talk about those things that would enable us to win the current fight and also build for tomorrow.\u00a0 And again, a very productive discussion.\u00a0 We talked about security force assistance and we talked about training, and we also talked about the key things that we\u2019re going to discuss in the session that I\u2019ll conduct tomorrow at Ramstein with a number of ministers of defense and chiefs of defense.\u00a0 This session is focused on doing things to generate additional capability and capacity for the Ukrainian forces.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s a great opportunity to get a good update from the CHOD and from the minister of defense and from the president on the things that they are focused on, the things that they need.\u00a0 That\u2019ll enable us to have a more productive discussion with the CHODs and ministers of defense tomorrow.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Missy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Austin,\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Blinken, I\u2019m just wondering if you can tell us what you saw during your visit to Kyiv, on your journey on the way to Kyiv and what you saw in the city.\u00a0 Were you able to speak to any Ukrainians outside the government and what did they tell you, if so?\nAnd then for either of you, do you see a scenario where international support enables Ukraine to avoid losing this war to Russia, but isn\u2019t able to fully expel Russian forces or reclaim its victory, and how would you think about such a scenario?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY\u00a0BLINKEN:\u00a0 Happy to start.\u00a0 In terms of what we saw, we took a train into Kyiv from southwestern[iii]\u00a0Poland, so didn\u2019t see a lot except looking out the train windows on our way in.\u00a0 And in Kyiv itself, we went right to the presidential palace.\u00a0 We spent about three hours with President Zelenskyy, with his senior team.\u00a0 That was the entire focus of our visit.\u00a0 We wanted to focus on the work that needed to be done in looking at the game plan that we have, how we\u2019re moving forward across all of these different lines of effort.\u00a0 So that was the entire focus.\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t much of an opportunity to talk to average Ukrainians.\u00a0 We certainly saw people on the streets in Kyiv, evidence of the fact that the battle for Kyiv was won and there is what looks from the surface, at least, to be normal life in Kyiv.\u00a0 But that\u2019s in stark contrast to what\u2019s going on in other parts of Ukraine, in the south and the east, where the Russian brutality is doing horrific things to people every single day.\nIn terms of wars won and lost, again, I come back to the proposition that in terms of Russia\u2019s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded because the principal aim that President Putin brought to this, in his own words, was to fully subsume Ukraine back into Russia, to take away its sovereignty and independence, and that has not happened and clearly will not happen.\u00a0 Where the contours of the war goes from here, how much death and destruction continues, obviously that\u2019s of deep concern.\u00a0 We want to do everything we can to help the Ukrainians bring this to an end on the possible terms as quickly as possible.\u00a0 Much of the work that we\u2019re doing is enabling them to strengthen their hand both on the battlefield right now, but also, eventually, at a negotiation if there is one.\nSECRETARY\u00a0AUSTIN:\u00a0 I agree with\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Blinken.\u00a0 We were focused on the conduct of the meeting and engaging the senior leadership, so we didn\u2019t get a chance to do any walkabouts or engage civilians or citizens on the street.\u00a0 On the way in, it did look like things were beginning to come back to normal.\u00a0 It was Easter day, so in the \u2013 in Kyiv, so certainly a number of people would have been at home and not out on the street.\nIn terms of our \u2013 their ability to win, the first step in winning is believing that you can win.\u00a0 And so they believe that we can win; we believe that they \u2013 we can win \u2013 they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to do everything we can \u2013 continue to do everything we can to ensure that that gets there.\u00a0 So we\u2019re engaged with the CHOD, engaged with the minister of defense, and as this fight evolves, their needs will change.\u00a0 And so as those needs change, we\u2019d like to be one step ahead, but we\u2019re going to be responsive to what the CHOD and the MOD believe that they need.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Jenny.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Austin, I have a question about aid deliveries.\u00a0 How are you tracking the Stingers and the Javelins and the \u2013 those sensitive weapons?\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing more and more imagery of those weapons falling into the hands of Russian-backed forces in Donbas.\u00a0 Do you have a plan to track those weapons?\nAnd in terms of humanitarian aid,\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Blinken, there\u2019s an article in the\u00a0Boston Globe\u00a0today quoting a USAID official saying that the billion dollars in aid passed by Congress has not even been transferred to USAID accounts and that much of the aid that\u2019s supposed to be going into Ukraine has not been delivered, calling it a critical strategic failure. \u00a0How do you plan to fix this problem?\nSECRETARY\u00a0AUSTIN:\u00a0 The first part of the question, Jen \u2013 thanks for that question \u2013 in terms of our ability to track the weapons that are going in.\u00a0 As you know, we don\u2019t have any forces on the ground, so that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s difficult for us to do.\u00a0 We did have a very good discussion with both the CHOD and the president and minister of defense on the necessity to make sure that those weapons are tracked and, as best possible, to make sure that they\u2019re protected from falling into the hands of adversaries.\nNow, when you\u2019re in a fight, as you know, if a specific battle is lost, then you have less control over that \u2013 over your ability to control items.\u00a0 But they are focused on this issue and they know we are concerned about it, and we\u2019ll continue to engage.\nSECRETARY\u00a0BLINKEN:\u00a0 And Jennifer, in terms of the humanitarian assistance, hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance has already gotten in not only to Ukraine, but to surrounding countries that are caring for Ukrainians who have been displaced, who are refugees.\u00a0 Literally every day, as we speak, aid is going in.\u00a0 This is aid.\u00a0 If you were here in a few hours, this won\u2019t be here.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be on a plane on its way, or some other means, on its way to Ukraine, and then it is dispersed throughout the country.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had detailed conversations with our Ukrainian partners about making sure that once the assistance gets into Ukraine, it then is dispersed, as the\u00a0Secretary\u00a0of Defense was saying about the weaponry, in an effective way.\u00a0 And if there are bottlenecks there or challenges there, we\u2019re working through them.\nBut what I\u2019m seeing, at least, is that aid is getting here and other distribution points, it\u2019s getting out the door incredibly quickly.\u00a0 Again, this place is going to look different five or six hours from now than it does right now.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Will.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks so much.\u00a0\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Austin, you mentioned keeping abreast of what the Ukrainians need.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen sort of some 155 millimeter Howitzers and other things be processed through here.\u00a0 What did President Zelenskyy say he needs next?\nAnd for\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Blinken, I understand you may have spoken with the UN\u00a0secretary-general about his upcoming visit.\u00a0 What is the strategy for engaging \u2013 for his engagement or for (inaudible) engagement with Moscow and Kyiv to see if (inaudible)?\nSECRETARY\u00a0AUSTIN:\u00a0 As you\u2019ve heard us talk or say in the past, recent past, the nature of the fight has evolved because the terrain that they\u2019re now focused on is a different type of terrain.\u00a0 So they need long-range fires.\u00a0 You\u2019ve heard them express a need for tanks.\u00a0 And we are doing everything that we can to get them the types of support, the types of artillery and munitions that will be effective in this stage of the fight.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ll get a chance to \u2013 we\u2019ve done a lot, as you know.\u00a0 You\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve done here in the recent past with the 800 \u2013 the recent $800 million authorization provided by the President allows us to provide five battalions of 1-5-5 Howitzers, hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery.\u00a0 And so we\u2019re also engaging our colleagues in other countries for the same type of capability, and we see indications early on that they\u2019re going to \u2013 they\u2019re going to be \u2013 many countries are going to come forward and provide additional munitions and Howitzers.\nSo we\u2019re going to push as hard as we can as quickly as we can to get them what they need.\u00a0 This will be a great topic of conversation for our meeting tomorrow as we go down to Ramstein.\nSECRETARY\u00a0BLINKEN:\u00a0 And in terms of the\u00a0secretary-general, I spoke to the UN\u00a0secretary-general on Friday and he is heading to Moscow early this week, and our expectation is that he\u2019s going to carry a very strong and clear message to Vladimir Putin, which is the need to end this war now \u2013 the need for a ceasefire; the need for humanitarian corridors, for aid to get in, for people to be able to get out; the need for Russia to stop its brutalization of Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s a clear, direct message that he should be carrying on behalf of virtually the entire international community.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 John.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Are you defining America\u2019s goals for success any differently in Ukraine now than you were at the beginning of this war?\u00a0 And if so, what are those goals today?\nSECRETARY\u00a0AUSTIN:\u00a0 You want?\u00a0 I\u2019ll just start and I\u2019ll let the\u00a0Secretary\u00a0of State to give his thoughts.\u00a0 But I think \u2013 and he\u2019s already kind of indicated the first piece of this.\u00a0 We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory.\u00a0 We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\u2019t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.\nSo it has already lost a lot of military capability, and a lot of its troops, quite frankly.\u00a0 And we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability.\u00a0 We want to see the international community more united, especially NATO, and we\u2019re seeing that, and that\u2019s based upon the hard work of, number one, President Biden, but also our Allies and partners who have willingly leaned into this with us as we\u2019ve imposed sanctions and as we\u2019ve moved very rapidly to demonstrate that we\u2019re going to defend every inch of NATO.\nSECRETARY\u00a0BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, and really nothing to add.\u00a0 I think the\u00a0Secretary\u00a0said it very well.\u00a0 Thanks.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question.\u00a0 Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Mr.\u00a0Secretary, were you able to offer President Zelenskyy any idea about timing for reopening the embassy in Kyiv, not simply the return of diplomats to Lviv?\nAnd then for both of you:\u00a0 President Zelenskyy, when he kind of leaked the \u2013 that you guys were going there on Saturday, said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t come with empty hands.\u201d\u00a0 You obviously didn\u2019t go with empty hands, but did you get the sense that he is satisfied with what it was that you did bring?\nSECRETARY\u00a0BLINKEN:\u00a0 Matt, in terms of the embassy, we will have American diplomats back in Ukraine starting next[iv]\u00a0week.\u00a0 They\u2019ll then start the process of looking at how we actually reopen the embassy itself in Kyiv.\u00a0 I think that will take place over a couple of weeks would be my expectation.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing it deliberately, we\u2019re doing it carefully, we\u2019re doing it with the security of our personnel foremost in mind, but we\u2019re doing it.\nAnd with regard to President Zelenskyy, again, without wanting to characterize him too much, I can just repeat what I said earlier.\u00a0 He expressed to both of us deep and repeated appreciation both for President Biden\u2019s leadership but also for the generosity of the American people.\u00a0 I think he said,\u00a0Lloyd, that the United States has been Ukraine\u2019s strongest supporter, something that they won\u2019t forget.\u00a0 And look, we never \u2013 we never come empty handed because this is \u2013 as the\u00a0Secretary\u00a0of Defense said, this has been an ongoing process where we have been, from before day one \u2013 because remember, the initial drawdowns that President Biden ordered go back to last Labor Day, months before the aggression.\nWe wanted to make sure that if Russia pursued the aggression, that Ukrainians had in hand the tools they needed to stop it, to push it back, and that\u2019s exactly what happened thanks to their courage, to their commitment, but also thanks to the equipment that they had in hand from before the war started they were able to do that.\u00a0 But as the\u00a0Secretary\u00a0said, this has been evolving, and so the nature of our assistance and the assistance we\u2019re getting from others has been evolving.\nSECRETARY\u00a0AUSTIN:\u00a0 And as you would expect, he did express gratitude to the American people and our allies and partners for what they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019ve done from the very beginning and continue to do.\u00a0 But he\u2019s in a fight, and so while he\u2019s grateful for all the things that we\u2019re doing, he\u2019s also focused on what he thinks he\u2019ll need next in order to be successful.\u00a0 And again, they have the mindset that they want to win; we have the mindset that we want to help them win, and we are going to do that.\nNow, in terms of specific types of things that we were able to discuss and kind of lay out, we reminded them that Thursday President Biden signed a drawdown and on Saturday Howitzers were showing up from that drawdown package.\u00a0 That is unimaginable speed, and it\u2019s due to the hard work of all the men and women who are working day out \u2013 day in and day out to do the kinds of things that they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to remain focused on giving him what he needs to be successful in the future, and that\u2019s what you\u2019d expect.\u00a0 You\u2019d expect for him to say, \u201cThanks, but\u201d \u2013 and he\u2019s really grateful \u2013 \u201cbut let\u2019s focus on what needs to be done.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019ll get a chance to talk some more about that in our meeting with the CHODs tomorrow, and I look forward to that meeting.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, gentlemen.\nSECRETARY\u00a0BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n\n\n[i]\u00a0\u2026this

interpreter) A very good morning to you all, and welcome to the press conference called by Erika Mouynes, Minister of Foreign Affairs, after the ministerial on migration where the national government talks about joint actions to deal with the growing phenomenon of irregular migration at the highest level. \u00a0It is my honor to leave you with Minister Erika Mouynes, Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MOUYNES:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you very much for your interest.\u00a0 Before getting to the questions, I would like to establish what I think is a vital agreement or vital achievement of the ministerial meeting held in Panama, the great welcome at which this has been received at the highest level \u2013 ministers of foreign affairs, defense, development banks, international organizations \u2013 31 delegations were here.\u00a0 Their very presence is a show of support, and the involvement of the United States, the declared destination of most migrants who cross through our country, has been fundamental.\nOver a year ago, when we made a call to attention about the unprecedented increase regarding migrants crossing our borders, we were facing a regional migration crisis.\u00a0 The cooperation between countries of origin, of transit, and destination countries for transcontinental migration was shown to be an efficient alternative to combat this unstoppable phenomenon, but we cannot relax.\u00a0 Reality is what it is, and we need a regional strategy that is ongoing when facing these issues.\u00a0 We must continue with the work that we have started.\nMr. Secretary.\nMR VASQUEZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 We will now hear from His Excellency Secretary Blinken, Secretary of State from the United States of America.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 It is a pleasure to be in Panama, the bridge of the world and the heart of the universe, with Foreign\u00a0Minister Mouynes, Minister of Security Pino, and my friend and colleague Secretary Mayorkas.\u00a0 I also want to start by thanking our outstanding embassy team here in Panama City, including our charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, Stewart Tuttle, for their great work in sustaining and strengthening our friendship with Panama.\u00a0\u00a0 So we have just concluded a set of ministerial meetings to discuss a challenge that affects all 22 countries represented here: managing migration in our hemisphere.\u00a0 Precisely because it affects all of us, this is a challenge that we have to solve together, and that was at the heart of our discussions today.\nHere in Panama we talked about some of the most urgent aspects of this issue, including helping stabilize and strengthen communities that are hosting migrants and refugees; creating more legal pathways to reinforce safe, orderly, and humane migration; dealing with the root causes of irregular migration by growing economic opportunity, fighting corruption, increasing citizen security, combating the climate crisis, improving democratic governance that\u2019s responsive to people\u2019s needs.\nYesterday Panama and the United States signed an arrangement to increase our bilateral cooperation across all of these issues.\u00a0 This is the second one we\u2019ve made.\u00a0 The first was with Costa Rica.\u00a0 We hope to announce more in the coming weeks and months.\u00a0 This is how we deepen our coordination and this is how we make more progress in helping vulnerable people, support communities, and protect the security of our borders.\u00a0 Our work together is going to continue at the Summit of the Americas in June, where we hope that leaders from across the region will be able to lay out shared principles for a shared response to regional migration and forced displacement.\nI also want to mention the international organizations that joined us here in Panama.\u00a0 They are critical partners in everything that we\u2019re working to do \u2013 the International Organization for Migration, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, the World Bank \u2013 and also equally important partners, multilateral development banks, they joined us here as well, including the Andean Development Corporation, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 This is the kind of cross-cutting coordination that the challenges of irregular migration demand.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for everyone\u2019s participation and everyone\u2019s contributions.\nI want to thank the Government of Panama for being a leader, a partner on this issue, and for bringing all of us together for two days of what were productive talks, productive planning, and action.\u00a0 As President Cortizo and I discussed yesterday, the partnership between Panama and the United States is one of the strongest that we have in the Americas.\u00a0 Our countries work together every single day on the issues that matter most to our people.\u00a0 Our economic relationship is strong, with more than $13 billion in bilateral trade between us that\u2019s supporting thousands of jobs in both our countries, and 72 percent of all goods that travel through the Panama Canal are either going to or coming from the United States.\nWe\u2019re proud to be the largest humanitarian donor to international organizations in Panama, and their work complements Panama\u2019s own assistance to migrants and refugees.\u00a0 We\u2019re working closely on counterterrorism and counternarcotics through our security cooperation and combating organized crime and money laundering through law enforcement cooperation.\nWe\u2019re also fighting COVID-19 together.\u00a0 More than 70 percent of Panama\u2019s population is fully vaccinated, a remarkable achievement that that the United States was proud to support with a donation of more than 500,000 Pfizer vaccine doses.\nWe applaud Panama\u2019s leadership on climate, including the work that you\u2019ve done on reforestation and decreasing energy emissions.\nAnd our countries stand together to support shared values here at home and around the world.\u00a0 We value Panama\u2019s strong voice in the region on democracy.\u00a0 We stand with Panama\u2019s voice to strengthen its own democratic governance, fighting corruption.\u00a0 And we appreciate how Panama stood firmly against Russia\u2019s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine and affirmed the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that lie at the heart of the United Nations Charter.\nYesterday, Secretary Mayorkas and I visited the Panama Canal, something that I\u2019ve \u2013 like so many millions of people \u2013 read about, studied.\u00a0 But when you see it, as I did for the first time, it really gives you a \u2013 gives you pause at the extraordinary feat of human engineering, human ingenuity, but also the powerful symbol of the historical partnership between our countries, a reminder that Panama is at the center of so much global economic activity and connection \u2013 a gateway between the continents and oceans, a leader in the region and beyond, a true friend and partner to the United States.\u00a0 And for that, we\u2019re very thankful.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR VASQUEZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) His Excellency Pino, Minister of Public Safety.\nSECURITY MINISTER PINO:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good morning, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, I would like to thank you for this time that we have spent together while working out in the field and working bilateral meetings and in multilateral meetings as well.\u00a0 We have tackled this issue from many angles.\u00a0 I thank Secretary Mayorkas for going with us to (inaudible), which is (inaudible) as has been said, because it is a way of understanding what happens to migrants as they travel through Panama.\nFirst of all, Panama, in order to strengthen the willingness to work on this issue of global concern, migration, signed a letter of intent where it reaffirms its willingness to continue to deal with this issue on the \u2013 at the bilateral level with the United States, where we\u2019d have an historic relationship in the area of security,\u00a0which must be supported increasingly every day because these issues must be dealt with in a timely manner quickly, because these are issues that affect the future.\u00a0 Migration is here due to changes that are happening at the global level, so I appreciate this visit.\u00a0 And Panama here reaffirms its willingness to continue to work on this via the signing of the letter of intent.\nFinally, I led issue number two, the working group for security, with ministers and vice ministers of security as well as delegations of\u00a0(inaudible)\u00a0countries who are with us here.\u00a0 It is clearly reflected \u2013 we saw the good intentions \u2013 and for the first time, I was able to see how at the multilateral level we tackle this scourge.\u00a0 We saw examples of how different countries deal with the issue.\u00a0 And now we must bring our efforts together and act quickly because migratory flows will continue and will increase.\nWe saw the need to promote stabilization, control measures, awareness campaigns, and preventing irregular migration.\u00a0 And the risks that are linked to this phenomenon \u2013 transit routes must be safer.\u00a0 We must harmonize migratory policies.\u00a0 We must preserve the environment.\u00a0 We need to look at new schemes and more work-related migration schemes \u2013 traceability \u2013 we need technology and tools; we need to exchange information in a timely fashion.\u00a0 And we must improve our cooperation in order to improve security in the region.\nDuring my time as minister of security and during my career in security agencies, I\u2019ve never seen a meeting that was as aligned around one single issue \u2013 a common issue \u2013 where countries have come to an agreement.\u00a0 We have set forth a route, but this route and the destination \u2013 we must travel this route quickly.\u00a0 And I can say and affirm that there is a great deal of willingness on behalf of the countries who participated, and I appreciate that.\u00a0 I appreciate that call that was made through the Panamanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because this is a golden opportunity, and we must continue to build on this issue for a better future for our countries.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\nMR VASQUEZ:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Words now from Secretary of DHS Alejandro Mayorkas from the U.S.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 Our gratitude to President Cortizo, Ministers Mouynes and Pino for convening, hosting, and welcoming us here in beautiful Panama.\u00a0 By bringing us together from across this region, we are demonstrating the commitment shared by each one of us and our nations to resolve, to address our joint hemispheric challenge of irregular migration, its impacts, its complexities, and the factors causing it.\nThese issues have tested our governments and our citizens in the United States, Panama, and throughout the Americas.\u00a0 And this task has been made more difficult and more urgent in the face of an ongoing pandemic, natural disasters worsened by climate change, threats to public safety and economic security, and much more.\nNone of these matters exists in isolation.\u00a0 Each requires creative and unified solutions.\u00a0 All of them demand our cooperation and our partnership.\u00a0 The presence of leaders from so many countries at this ministerial demonstrates the urgency of this issue for our entire hemisphere and reinforces our shared determination to engage in this kind of collaboration.\nFor the Department of Homeland Security that I am proud to represent, our immediate goals are crystal-clear: think regionally about stemming migration flows through enhanced prevention and enforcement; create viable legal pathways in the spirit of regional responsibility-sharing; address root causes by investing in the stabilization of communities that need it most; foster and grow legitimate trade and travel between our countries that will help our communities prosper; and attack the shared dangers of transnational crime.\nTo meet these objectives throughout this week\u2019s meetings, ongoing consultations, and building on bilateral and regional arrangements and agreements, we will do what we can to strengthen access to stronger protections and legal pathways for refugees and vulnerable migrants.\u00a0 We will focus on ways to help prevent these individuals and families from experiencing the desperation that drives people to embark on these dangerous journeys in the first place.\nWe will seize the opportunity presented by this ministerial to identify the support and resources that will help stabilize communities affected by migration and strengthen humane border management across the region. We will build on the growing momentum in our hemisphere and toward a regional responsibility-sharing and a recognition that each country must do its part to address irregular migration in our region, which involves so much human suffering.\u00a0 This is one step in a larger effort.\nOne of our next opportunities, as my friend and colleague Secretary Blinken stated, will come at the Summit of the Americas in my hometown of Los Angeles, California, where we will focus on the theme of building a resilient, sustainable, and equitable future in our hemisphere.\u00a0 But before then, now, we will act.\u00a0 We will tackle the shared challenges, seize the opportunities, and begin to realize our shared goals and underlying values.\nThank you once again for your welcome and partnership.\nMR VASQUEZ:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you.\u00a0 Now (inaudible) we will open our Q&A session for different media outlets.\u00a0 First, we will (inaudible) Isa\u00edas Cede\u00f1o from TVN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Hello, good morning.\u00a0 I would like to know specifically what the promises are that will be undertaken by the U.S. (inaudible) in order to talk on migration as countries of origin where this problem originates (inaudible).\u00a0 We haven\u2019t had \u2013 Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti, for example, have not been present at this meeting.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0\u00a0So our plans have a number of different components to them.\u00a0 One critical first step is reflected in the ministerial that we have convened today that has brought together so many different nations.\u00a0 And that is to address the root causes of why individuals flee their homes, leave their countries of origin for lands that are unfamiliar to them \u2013 the process of stabilization.\nSecondly, to build legal, orderly, and humane pathways so individuals do not need to place their lives, their well-beings, the well-beings of their loved ones, in the hands of smugglers and traffickers who only seek to exploit them for profit.\nThird is to develop humanitarian programs for individuals already resident in the countries other than those of their origin so that we can settle them in a stable and prosperous manner, address their needs, present them with the opportunities of a stable life in their new homes.\nLastly, of course, in the United States, we have significant humanitarian programs, the asylum program.\u00a0 But we also take pride in being not only a nation of immigrants but a nation of laws.\u00a0 Those who qualify for relief under our nation\u2019s laws will be provided a home in the United States and an ability to resettle in the States.\u00a0 Those who do not qualify will be repatriated to their countries of origin, and so to give integrity to our system and to stand as a nation of laws as well as a nation of relief.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And I really have very little to add because Secretary Mayorkas covered it so well.\u00a0 I would only emphasize one point because it\u2019s really what brought us together here today, and that is this sense of shared responsibility.\u00a0 What is very powerful in the meeting today, in work that was done in the lead-up to this meeting including by Panama and Foreign Minister Mouynes, is building on that shared \u2013 sense of shared responsibility.\nWe know that virtually every aspect of this problem demands coordination, cooperation, consultation, and not only among governments but among international organizations, international financial institutions, civil society, and so on.\u00a0 That\u2019s very much the spirit of what took place today.\u00a0 It\u2019s the spirit that will animate the Summit of the Americas and its own focus on migration.\nAnd it is, I think, the difference-maker because to underscore Secretary Mayorkas\u2019s points, we have two challenges.\u00a0 One is dealing with this effectively in a sustainable way, and that involves going at the root causes.\u00a0 What is it that is driving people to make the decision to leave their homes, to leave their families, to leave their countries, to leave everything they know to make an incredibly hazardous journey with all the dangers that go along with that?\u00a0 What is it that drives them to do that?\u00a0 How do we address those challenges so that people feel the confidence that their future can be in the country that they come from?\nBut we know that that takes time.\u00a0 It takes sustained effort.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 But in the meantime, we have to be able to address the problem as it presents to us right now, and that goes with some of the practical cooperation that we\u2019re taking, including through the work that we did today, including through the bilateral work that we\u2019ve done with Panama on a new arrangement that we have for enhancing our coordination and cooperation on dealing with migration.\nSo we have to be able to deal with the short-term challenge even as we address the long-term drivers, which is the only sustainable way to get at this.\u00a0 And all of that comes together in enhanced coordination, cooperation, shared responsibility.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Our first question goes to Alfonso Fernandez Sanchez of EFE.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hello, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 The U.S. Government has underscored the need to tackle the root causes of migration in the Northern Triangle.\u00a0 Do you think these countries are making enough efforts?\u00a0 And particularly, are you worried about the decisions against freedom of speech and press in El Salvador by President Bukele?\u00a0 Do you think he\u2019s going down the authoritarian slope?\n(Via interpreter) (Inaudible) and do you think that the U.S. is complying with all that they are supposed to comply with these migratory things?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 First, what we are experiencing in our own hemisphere is multifaceted, and of course, there are challenges that are clear in the so-called Northern Triangle countries, in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, but also Nicaragua, Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and then people now coming into our hemisphere from beyond who are also on a migratory path, including coming to the United States.\u00a0 So we\u2019re looking at this comprehensively and looking at what we can do together to meet the challenge, wherever it comes from.\nWith regard to the Northern Triangle countries, we\u2019re working with each of them in different ways to address both short-term challenges but also these long-term drivers.\u00a0 I would note that Vice President Harris, among other things, led a very significant call to action from the private sector to make new investments in the Northern Triangle countries.\u00a0 And since that call to action, I think we\u2019ve seen something like $1.2 billion in additional investment that, over time, as it takes root, will create new opportunities for people and help take away some of what\u2019s driving them to leave, which is the lack of economic opportunity.\u00a0 But it has to be comprehensive.\u00a0 Economic opportunity, governance, combating corruption, dealing with insecurity \u2013 all of these things are vital.\nBut I think it\u2019s also fair to say that none of the countries in question, of course, can do this alone.\u00a0 The demands are extraordinary, so this is where all of us come into play, but it\u2019s also where the international financial institutions, as well as international organizations, come into play.\u00a0 And bringing all of that together with the goodwill and intentions of the governments in question, I think we can make a real difference.\nWhen it comes to El Salvador more exclusively, look, we have a strong partnership with the people of El Salvador.\u00a0 El Salvador has experienced setbacks in democratic governance, in the separation of powers, the rule of law.\u00a0 And we look to President Bukele to make progress in addressing some of those setbacks.\nWe also urge El Salvador to implement the state of emergency in a manner that is consistent with human rights.\u00a0 We can tackle violence and crime while also protecting civil rights and fundamental freedoms.\u00a0 These two things are not in opposition to each other.\u00a0 I would note, for our part, that the United States has provided tens of millions of dollars recently in funding to deal with the problem posed by gangs.\u00a0 We continue to cooperate and coordinate closely, including also with a number of pending extradition requests of gang leaders, to help address the problems posed by criminality and gangs.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MOUYNES:\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 Regarding the participation of the U.S., I believe first of all I would say that their participation, as I said before, because the U.S. is the destination of most of the migrants, their participation here is fundamental, but also not only from the work that we have been doing \u2013 I started working and talking about this about a year ago when I called an alarm because of the increase of migrants that we were seeing, and the ally that has helped us all the way has been the U.S.\u00a0 And what we are doing now is to show the result of that working together with all the countries in the region, but the U.S. is a leader in this.\nI think that the fact that we are here together, we have security, foreign policy on both sides of the country, because these are the priorities.\u00a0 For us, migration and \u2013 are issues for us and for the U.S., and it\u2019s also a priority for the security issue for Panama and for the U.S.\nMR VASQUEZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 Adames from SerTV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 We are here live, and this is for the foreign minister.\u00a0 This is the third meeting held in this country to deal with irregular migration.\u00a0 However, how does financing work together with multilateral support in the area of migration?\u00a0 And what is the agreement that will be arrived at as a result of this meeting?\nFOREIGN MINISTER MOUYNES:\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 (In progress) meeting, because when you were talking specifically about the root causes and how to settle populations, infrastructure \u2013 infrastructure creates prosperity.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2013 it creates development, and that is what we need to strive for.\u00a0 And in order to do that, we need to get them involved, to get their commitment so they hear reality, so they hear what is going on in each country to have specific proposals drafted, to involve the private sector.\nSo they need to be a part of this exercise.\u00a0 We have three of the most important banks represented here, as well as international organizations.\u00a0 This is the way to work together and to create regional projects little by little to create the development that we need.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Priscilla Alvarez of CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Mayorkas, in light of the increase of Cubans at the U.S.-Mexico border, what does the U.S. hope to accomplish in migration talks with Cuba this week?\u00a0 And is there consideration within the administration to delay the end of Title 42?\nAnd for Secretary Blinken, on Ukraine.\u00a0 Russia and Ukraine say a humanitarian corridor has been established for Ukrainians who are women, children, and elderly to leave Mariupol.\u00a0 Does the U.S. urge Ukrainians to depart the city that way?\u00a0 Is there reason to believe it is a safe exit and is the U.S. helping in those efforts?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the dialogue between the United States and Cuba, but as everyone knows, we have had migration accords with the country of Cuba for many, many years.\u00a0 Those were discontinued, and we will explore the possibility of resuming that.\u00a0 And that is a reflection of our commitment to legal, orderly, and humane pathways so individuals, including Cubans, do not take, for example, to the seas, which is an extraordinarily perilous journey.\nTitle 42 \u2013 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a while ago now that the use of Title 42, which is a public health authority and not an immigration policy, will discontinue as of May 23rd, and we are in the Department of Homeland Security and throughout the government planning accordingly.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to Ukraine and the situation in Mariupol and humanitarian corridors, a few things.\u00a0 First, what the world witnessed just a couple of weeks ago when the receding Russian tide from Bucha revealed what was left in its wake in terms of death, destruction, atrocities \u2013 we can only anticipate that when this tide also, at some point, recedes from Mariupol we\u2019re going to see far worse, if that\u2019s possible to imagine.\nSo the conditions there, the situation there as a result of this Russian aggression are truly horrific.\u00a0 And of course, we want to see people who are in harm\u2019s way, if they\u2019re able to, leave it safely and securely.\u00a0 The judgment on whether the humanitarian corridor established to do that from Mariupol is safe and secure is one ultimately that the Ukrainian Government is going to make.\u00a0 We will \u2013 we\u2019re certainly assisting in that process, giving our own evaluations and assessments.\u00a0 And ultimately the decision to leave is going to be a burden on the people themselves to make that very difficult decision.\nWhat gives pause is the fact that there have been agreements on humanitarian corridors established before that have fallen apart very, very quickly, if not immediately, principally because the security has been violated by Russian forces.\u00a0 And so people leaving, believing that they can do so safely and securely, were fired upon.\nSo this is a very, very difficult decision to make, to evaluate not only whether what\u2019s been agreed to, if something\u2019s been agreed to, is safe and secure, but whether Russia will actually live up to whatever obligations it\u2019s undertaken to make sure that people can leave safely and securely.\u00a0 Again, this is for the Government of Ukraine to decide.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do anything we can to try to inform that decision.\nMR VASQUEZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Colleagues, with that question, then, we bring to a close today\u2019s press conference after the ministerial conference on migration.\u00a0 Once again, we would like to thank you very much, thank you for your professional coverage of this event.\u00a0 I wish you all a great day.\n\n"}, {"url":

\u2013 there are victims of criminal organizations.\u00a0 They\u2019re exposed to multiple risks that attempt against human rights.\nFacing this reality, we cannot be indifferent.\u00a0 Our countries also work in a coordinated manner to find solutions in the short, medium, and long range.\u00a0 We have an international humanitarian approach with shared responsibility among the countries of origin, transit, and final destination of these irregular migrants.\u00a0 That is why we have to strengthen the policies of the region to be able to drive the economic growth in our countries to generate human growth opportunities and to create better living conditions for our peoples.\nIt is fundamental, achieving joint agreements and articulated agreements to tackle this migration phenomenon (inaudible) humanitarian organizations.\u00a0 It is opportune to highlight what I mentioned already in the General Assembly of the United Nations back in September.\u00a0 Irregular migration is

this.\nToday I reaffirm Panama\u2019s commitment to work jointly with friendly countries as strategic partners in the search of joint solutions with cross-sectional policies and concrete actions that will promote regular migrations, orderly and safe, respecting human rights.\u00a0 I do appreciate all of you here present for your participation, your will, and determination to work in a regional integration to tackle the irregular migration phenomenon within the context of international migration.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nMR VASQUEZ:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Ladies and gentlemen, having heard the opening remarks of His Excellency the President of Panama, Mr. Laurentino Cortizo Cohen, we open the floor to Erika Mouynes, Foreign Relations Minister, who will open the ministerial regional meeting on migration.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MOUYNES:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter)\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 I would like to thank one more time your attendance, for just by being here is a clear support to the initiative to tackle the impact on irregular migration in a continental manner.\u00a0 We all care, we have made this a priority, and we need to work together.\u00a0 Migration is a current phenomenon and it is a complex one.\u00a0 It is a world phenomenon.\u00a0 And this phenomenon in particular responds to particular joint circumstances that magnify the COVID pandemic, climate change, war, conflict, and economic issues.\u00a0 By working together with our neighboring countries and the United States, we are trying to approach this phenomenon in a responsible, effective, and humanitarian-focused way for which we have advocated since the very beginning, like our president said.\nFigures are clear.\u00a0 In August of 2021, influx through the Dari\u00e9n border came to a peak of 2,800 migrants in a day.\u00a0 Today, it doesn\u2019t go over 100 daily.\u00a0 So we have motives to be optimistic, but we cannot falter because, one more time, the figures are still increasing.\u00a0 Reality is harsh, and these events of \u2013 which are unexpected create migration waves and compels us to be prepared not only to be able to offer assistance but also not to have a negative impact.\u00a0 There will be always cataclysms, new conflicts, but we can create effective and long-lasting control with a regional and continental strategy, but it has to be a permanent role.\nToday we are providing continuity to something that we already began.\u00a0 So today before we begin we should have three set objectives: one, coming to agreement in a working framework that will facilitate the standardization of migration policies in the region; number two, broaden the efforts of collaboration to fight trans-country organized crime; and number three, to concrete the cooperation dynamics among states, international organizations, and development banking in the region to have the structural basis to stop the structural basis that prompt migration.\nFriends, your presence here is important, and it conveys the will to work together, sharing this responsibility to approach this challenge that is going to define the 21st century.\u00a0 It will be collaboration, commitment, and consensus that always works.\u00a0 Today we have an opportunity to speak with one voice, being certain that our meeting will mark a milestone in the history of our continent.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone, and Erika, thank you so much for bringing us all together.\u00a0 We are all living what is truly a historic challenge, and that is the fact that more people on our planet are on the move, forcibly displaced from their homes, than at any time since the Second World War.\u00a0 That is the magnitude of the challenge, and we feel it strongly in our own hemisphere.\u00a0 We\u2019re focusing on different aspects of the problem today.\nThis morning in this first session, I know we want to focus on one particularly urgent aspect of the challenge: \u00a0How can we more effectively work together to help stabilize and strengthen communities across the region that are generously hosting large numbers of migrants and refugees?\u00a0 The millions of people who have made the difficult and often dangerous decision to leave their homes we know do so for a variety of reasons \u2013 poverty, a lack of economic opportunity, repressive governance, corruption, political upheaval, conflict and insecurity.\u00a0 All of these challenges already there are exacerbated by COVID-19 and by the climate crisis.\nUltimately, we all know this: the only lasting, sustainable response to irregular migration is to tackle its root causes.\u00a0 But that takes time.\u00a0 And in the meantime, many cities and towns simply don\u2019t have the resources they need to provide for their own citizens, much less meeting the needs of migrants who are with them.\nAs Erika said, we know that no country, no community can solve a challenge as complicated as irregular migration alone.\u00a0 We have to work together to support the front-line communities hosting migrants and refugees with increased resources for public health and safety, for stronger social services, for more resilient infrastructure, for opportunity for all \u2013 for migrants and host communities alike.\nWe\u2019re making some progress.\u00a0 Just to cite a few examples.\u00a0 Colombia has registered more than 1.9 million Venezuelans for temporary protected status, and more than 600,000 have officially received that status.\u00a0 That gives them documentation and legal protections that are critical for integrating into their local community.\nIt also means that more migrants can be vaccinated against COVID-19, which is critical to ending the pandemic and boosting economic recovery.\nIn that same spirit, the United States is expediting family-based petitions at our embassies throughout Central America so that migrants with family members in the United States are able to go there sponsored by the family members, and they can move much more quickly through the process as a result.\nWe\u2019re also expanding visas for eligible groups \u2013 for example, 20,000 additional H2B temporary agricultural worker visas that Secretary Mayorkas recently announced.\u00a0 And a critical piece of this is the role that multilateral finance and development institutions have been doing to provide more resources to front-line communities.\u00a0 We have to work together to bring these efforts to scale throughout the hemisphere.\nAgain, with some examples.\u00a0 The Inter-American Development Bank is boosting public health education and social protection in migrant host cities in Ecuador.\u00a0 In Belize, the bank is running programs to increase educational opportunity for girls both from migrant families and from local communities.\u00a0 And again, this is such a critical piece.\u00a0 The support that we need to give to migrants we have to find ways also to make sure that local communities are getting support, getting help \u2013 are benefitting.\u00a0 Otherwise, we know that none of this will be sustainable \u2013 politically, economically, socially.\nIn five Colombian cities, the bank is facilitating housing and helping local governments build institutional capacity to assist migrants, both of which are critical for them to integrate more seamlessly into our communities.\u00a0 The World Bank\u2019s Global Concessional Financing Facility has been instrumental in providing development assistance to countries worldwide that are affected by the refugee crisis, including economic and social support to Colombian communities hosting Venezuelan refugees.\nSo programs like these help point the way forward.\u00a0 We need that kind of cross-cutting coordination \u2013 local and national governments, multilateral institutions, businesses, civil society \u2013 all working toward safe, orderly, and humane migration throughout the region and supporting the communities so that they can do right by these vulnerable populations.\nOf course, even as we\u2019re doing this, as I said at the outset, we have to remain resolutely focused on addressing root causes, in particular some of the economic drivers of migration, and there, again, we\u2019re making some progress.\u00a0 To name just one example, Vice President Harris\u2019 call to action to the private sector just several months ago has rallied $1.2 billion in investments to support long-term social and economic progress in northern Central America.\nFinally, many of us will meet again in Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas in just a few weeks\u2019 time in June.\u00a0 There, we\u2019ll have an opportunity to address the deeper issues driving irregular migration like improving public health, strengthening our democracies.\u00a0 By adopting a Los Angeles declaration on migration and protection that sets forth our shared principles for a collaborative, coordinated response to migration and forced displacement as President Biden has proposed, our countries can take our partnership on this issue to the next level of effectiveness, and we can make a profound difference in the lives of our most vulnerable fellow citizens and in the future of our shared region.\nSo I hope we can use our time together as well today to lay the groundwork for a strong declaration by our leaders when they gather in California in June.\u00a0 But to each and every one of you, we\u2019ve been working together over many months now at the United Nations, Colombia, here in Panama.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your commitment.\u00a0 Thank you for your leadership.\u00a0 Thank you for your partnership as we work together to promote safe, orderly, and humane migration across the Americas.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs", "location": "Panama City, Panama", "date": "April 19, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 It is wonderful to be with so many colleagues in this extraordinary setting with this extraordinary history, as Erika was just describing it to us.\u00a0 I very much want to thank President Cortizo, my friend the foreign minister, the people of Panama, for so generously hosting us for this week\u2019s Ministerial Conference on Migration and Protection.\u00a0 And a special note of gratitude to Panama, to you, Erika, for all the work that you\u2019ve been doing to bring all of us together in what has to be a shared responsibility.\nI am joined here by my friend and colleague, Ale Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security of the United States.\u00a0 We\u2019re both so eager to discuss with our fellow ministers the urgent migration challenges that we\u2019re facing.\u00a0 No two countries experience them in the same way.\u00a0 All of us bring our own concerns to this discussion but also this sense of shared responsibility to meet the migration challenge throughout our region.\u00a0 And we\u2019re very much looking forward to hearing and sharing specific experiences and specific solutions.\nThis issue is a priority for the United States.\u00a0 We have a strong interest in protecting the security of our borders in a safe, orderly, and humane way.\u00a0 We care about the well-being of millions of people across the hemisphere who have made the desperate decision to leave their homes and communities in search of a better life.\u00a0 The journeys are often dangerous.\u00a0 Migrants are vulnerable to exploitation of all kinds.\u00a0 Many are children, and their fates, their futures, are highly uncertain.\u00a0 We have a responsibility, a shared responsibility, to look out for them.\nLike you, we\u2019re concerned about the rising tensions in communities across the region that have become home to huge numbers of migrants and are now pushed to the brink, unable to meet people\u2019s needs, whether they\u2019re migrants or their own citizens.\u00a0 And we\u2019re focused on the underlying issues that are pushing so many people to become migrants in the first place, including poverty, a lack of economic opportunity, corruption, political upheaval, insecurity \u2013 all of which has been made worse by the climate crisis and, of course, by COVID-19.\nSo I think what we have all come to understand, the common realization that I think is shared with everyone in this room, is that no one country can meet these challenges or solve them alone.\u00a0 The United States is committed to working in partnership with all of you across every dimension of this issue from taking on migrant smuggling networks, to improving humane and effective border management, to countering misinformation, to developing legal pathways for immigrants and refugees seeking a safe place to call home.\nIn particular, we have to work together to help stabilize and strengthen communities that are hosting large populations of migrants.\u00a0 We have to help them get the tools that they need to rebuild their lives, including access to jobs and education.\u00a0 And we have to make sure that our support directly benefits the communities themselves with increased resources for public health and safety, social services, better infrastructure, opportunity for everyone.\nSo this has to be a job for all of us, for our governments, doing it together.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also a job for the international community writ large \u2013 NGOs, multilateral development and financial institutions, regional and global public health and climate agencies.\u00a0 The United States will help bring together these different groups and leverage all of their contributions to this challenge.\nI have to tell you I\u2019m very glad to see here tonight and tomorrow as we meet representatives from key organizations, including the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF.\u00a0 Institutions like these were created to help us meet challenges too great for even our countries together to solve, which is exactly what we\u2019re called on to do now on behalf of the region\u2019s most vulnerable people.\u00a0 And to those agencies and organizations that have already given and implemented assistance, thank you.\nI know that we\u2019ll do good work together here in Panama.\u00a0 We have to.\u00a0 And I hope that the additional momentum that we build here, complemented by what we did in Colombia \u2013 and my deep appreciation to our colleagues from Colombia for bringing us together some months ago \u2013 all of that needs to carry forward in concrete, practical ways.\nIn June, many of us will come together again in Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas that President Biden will be hosting.\u00a0 There we\u2019ll have an opportunity to address the deeper concerns that drive irregular migration by strengthening our democracies, fighting corruption, building resilience in our health care systems, promoting more equitable economic growth, combating the climate crisis.\u00a0 All of these things in their own ways have an impact on the challenge that we are coming together here tonight and tomorrow to deal with.\nPresident Biden set a goal for the summit that our countries adopt a declaration on migration and protection that sets forth shared principles for a collaborative, coordinated response to migration and forced displacement.\u00a0 So I hope our discussions here today and tomorrow in Panama will contribute to a strong declaration by our leaders when they gather in California in just a few weeks\u2019 time.\nSo, simply put, to each and every one of you, thank you for your leadership at what is a critical moment.\u00a0 Erika said it very well.\u00a0 There is \u2013 we have a regional challenge, a hemispheric challenge, but it\u2019s also a global challenge.\u00a0 There are now around the world more people on the move, displaced from their homes, than at any time since the Second World War, some 95 million people.\u00a0 By definition, this is a challenge that we have to stand together to meet, work together to meet, join together to meet.\nWith that, it is my pleasure to introduce my friend and colleague, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you and good evening.\u00a0 My thanks to President Cortizo, Ministers Mouynes and Pino, for welcoming us to this beautiful country.\u00a0 Earlier today I visited the Panama Canal, and it was a very uplifting visit.\u00a0 I did so with my colleague and great friend, Tony Blinken.\u00a0 And the canal represents the promise of economic prosperity and the hope for advancement, and not just today but in the days to come.\nYesterday I had a very different visit.\u00a0 Minister Pino so generously gave of his time to show my colleagues and me the Dari\u00e9n region and to pass over the treacherous land that the most vulnerable people try to pass in the hope of a better future.\u00a0 It is very difficult to see that land and to understand the depths and breadth of the treachery that vulnerable individuals seek to cross with the hope of a better life.\nI remember a father of a friend of mine growing up who grew up in very difficult circumstances once said that one\u2019s \u2013 when one\u2019s back is up against the wall, the only direction one can move in is forward.\u00a0 And it is our obligation collectively to close the divide between the promise of economic prosperity that the canal represents and the vulnerability that the Dari\u00e9n region represents for so many who seek a better life.\u00a0 And I want to thank the ministers for bringing us all together to work on an effort that requires a collective response, because the movement of people in the Western Hemisphere, and frankly in other parts of the world, is not the challenge of one country or two; it is the challenge of the region and of the hemisphere of which we are a part.\u00a0 And we must take a look at the individuals who are vulnerable as members of our community, and we must deliver a response of and by the community.\nThe most enduring way in which we can address this challenge which has been with us for far too many years is to deliver stabilization, to deliver for the people in their homes the promise that the canal represents, and allow them to understand and actually realize that they do not need to leave their homes to experience the promise that so many of us here represent and are obligated to deliver to others.\nAt the same time, as we work on that most enduring solution of addressing the cause for migration, we must also extend a hand, an outstretched hand, of humanitarian relief to those who are already outside of their homes to be able to provide them with the promise of that prosperity wherever they might be so that the dangers of the journey that they once anticipated ahead of them they need no longer take.\u00a0 The promise of humanitarian relief and the stability of settlement and integration, as well as an understanding that the laws that guide our extension of humanitarian relief must be honored, and for those who do not qualify we must apply those laws equally.\nThese issues and the lines that draw \u2013 are drawn between the relief and the response that we must impose when that relief is not warranted are very, very difficult to draw.\u00a0 They are very difficult decisions, but we as leaders in our respective countries, and together as leaders of a community throughout a region and a hemisphere, are obligated to make those difficult decisions, and that is what makes this convening so very important \u2013 bringing us together to make those difficult decisions in partnership and in friendship with one another so that we can deliver the promise of a better future to those who do not see it and so that we can accept this responsibility in a shared and, therefore, most effective way.\nI thank you all so very much.\u00a0 I look forward to our very important conversations tomorrow.\u00a0 And again, my thanks to our wonderful hosts here in this beautiful country of Panama.\u00a0\u00a0Gracias.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "American Trade Hotel", "location": "Panama City, Panama", "date": "April 19, 2022", "content": "\n\nMS OBALDIA:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0 My name is Olga de Obald\u00eda.\u00a0 I am the executive director of the Panama Chapter of Transparency International.\u00a0 Our organization is called Foundation for the Development of Civil Liberties, or\u00a0Fundaci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo de la Libertad Ciudadana.\u00a0 It is a pleasure for us, our organizations from the nongovernmental sector that are interested in democratic institutions, anticorruption, and transparency, to welcome today to Panama Mr. Secretary Antony Blinken, and I would like to welcome as well the government officials that are here, the embassy officials that are here, the champions of corruption from three countries \u2013 Venezuela, Guatemala, and Ecuador \u2013 and local activists that are our comrades-in-arm in this fight against corruption in Panama.\nI\u2019ve been asked to give you a brief introduction before I\u2019ll let you hear from the star of the meeting, Mr. Blinken, and I\u2019ll start by mentioning something about the American Trade Hotel where we are right now.\u00a0 The American Trade Hotel and Plaza Herrera \u2013 Herrera \u2013 just in front of us here are symbols of the resilience of Panama in the \u2013 and we are in the Old Historic District of Panama.\u00a0 This plaza dates from colonial times, and the building where we are right now \u2013 sorry \u2013 and the building where we are right now dates from the republican period.\u00a0 It was built in 1917 and housed the American Trade Development Company, and in the hall next door was the first Citibank that helped finance the Panama Canal.\nAfter falling through disrepair, it ended up housing dangerous gangs in the \u201860s, \u201870s, \u201880s, \u201890s, and the 2000s, and at some point the building was called the Grey Skull Castle, if you can imagine that.\u00a0 And through community movement and local investors, the building was rescued and it\u2019s right now one of the symbols of Panama\u2019s resilience.\u00a0 Panama has been through colonial times, republican times, to a dictatorship, to an invasion, and a new era of uninterrupted democracy since 1990.\nHowever, our democracy right now is being threatened by corruption in multiple fronts.\u00a0 I will just mention four of them, and I\u2019m sure that most of the local press and the local officials are very well informed of what we are facing through regarding corruption and lack of transparency.\nTo start with, let me mention the critical impact of the impunity and the judiciary; second, the corrupt clientelist structure and practices in the national assembly that trickles down to communities and affects electoral fairness; third, a lack of fiscal accountability in the use of public resources; and fourth, a lack of a robust legal framework to fight and prevent corruption in the public and the private sector.\nOur instruments to measure corruption are telling us that Panama is stagnant in the fight against corruption.\u00a0 For the last 10 years, Panama has had an average rating of 36 over 100 in the Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International.\u00a0 Moreover, the last transparency index of our parliament showed that Panama has the fourth most opaque parliament or congress in the whole of the Americas.\u00a0 That has an impact, a terrible impact, on the population, and in the last few years, Panama\u2019s population has been showing a lack of faith in democracy.\u00a0 Sixty-five of Panamanian \u2013 65 percent of Panamanian citizens, when asked, are not choosing democracy as their favorite form of government.\nOn top of that, we need to understand that the relationship between national security and corruption that was so well outlined in the June 3rd memo of the White House regarding the matter is the same thing in Panama.\u00a0 Our national security right now is being threatened by the inclusion in politics and private financing of politics for monies that are known to be from organized crime.\u00a0 And I think you all \u2013 most of you know about these facts, and I think this is enough for me.\u00a0 I thank you for the opportunity of talking to you about these matters that are extremely important for us, and I give you Secretary Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And I appreciate very much the reference to being a featured attraction, but the truth of the matter is these are the stars of the evening \u2013 our colleagues who are on the front lines of fighting corruption in various parts of our hemisphere.\nWe\u2019re here principally because our friends and colleagues in Panama are bringing together countries from around the hemisphere to help deal with the extraordinary phenomenon of irregular migration.\u00a0 But one of the things we know very well is that one of the drivers of that irregular migration is corruption and the revulsion at corruption that people are feeling in many countries in our hemisphere and around the world.\nIf you look at, as well, the drivers of so many popular movements in every part of the world over the last couple of decades, you often find a revulsion at corruption as being one of if not the driver of these movements.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a good, good reason for that, as Olga said so well.\u00a0 It is draining resources from countries that could be put to much better use supporting the people and supporting their needs.\u00a0 It breeds incredible and understandable cynicism about government and about leadership.\u00a0 It fuels all sorts of illicit enterprises.\u00a0 And of course, it helps perpetuate nondemocratic rule in country after country.\nSo it is at the source of so many challenges, and we are incredibly gratified that we have champions who at great, often personal risk, as well as professional risk are leading the effort to uncover corruption, to create greater transparency in their societies, to prosecute those responsible \u2013 and again, in some cases at such risk that you\u2019ve had to leave the countries that you\u2019re from for your own safety and well-being.\nThe United States is working hard to support these efforts throughout our hemisphere and indeed around the world.\u00a0 Part of it is by elevating the work of those who are combating corruption, and we are honored and proud to do it.\u00a0 Part of it is by supporting civil society through the funding, assistance, training that we give.\u00a0 Part of it is trying to make sure that we\u2019re doing what we can to protect those who are on the front lines of this effort.\nSo I was really anxious to be here, not to talk to you but to hear from you, to listen to the work that you\u2019re doing, the challenges you\u2019re facing, and to learn a little bit about how we can do even better and do even more to help in this fight and to help you in your efforts.\u00a0 So let me turn it over to you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-meet-and-greet-for-embassy-staff/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken at a Meet and Greet for Embassy Staff\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "audience": "U.S. Embassy Panama City", "location": "Panama City, Panama", "date": "April 19, 2022", "content": "\n\nMR TUTTLE:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0 What a fantastic turnout from Mission Panama.\u00a0 Really delighted.\u00a0 Give yourself some applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Now, I know that ever since President Biden was inaugurated, there\u2019s been a lot of buzz at this embassy about when the Secretary of State would be visiting, and it\u2019s obviously with tremendous pleasure that I can \u2013 obviously I don\u2019t need to surprise you.\u00a0 He\u2019s right here next to me, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo I mean \u2013 and I think what\u2019s important to note \u2013 we all know what\u2019s going on in the world today, right?\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of crises, a lot of issues we\u2019re dealing with, some of monumental importance.\u00a0 The fact that Secretary Blinken has chosen to be here today in Panama with us \u2013 along with, not by coincidence, Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas as well \u2013 is an indication of not only the strength of our bilateral relationship with Panama but also the importance of the issues that they are here to address.\nSo Secretary Blinken became the 71st Secretary of State on January 26th of 2021, but he was obviously a familiar face to many of us in the department, having been the deputy secretary for a number of years during President Obama\u2019s second term; prior to that, the deputy national security advisor; and in President Obama\u2019s first term, the national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden.\u00a0 That was a relationship that had continued on from their time at the Senate, where the Secretary was the Democratic staff director at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a committee that then-Senator Biden served on for many years and which he chaired for quite a time while they were there together.\nSo, Mr. Secretary, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that when I was looking at your bio, we both had our first experience in the State Department in the 1990s in the same year.\u00a0 Now, I know what you\u2019re all thinking \u2013 his career has progressed a little faster than mine.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But I\u2019m a magnanimous guy, so no hard feelings, right?\u00a0 In fact, Secretary Blinken has a soft spot in my heart, because in your very first virtual meeting with all the chiefs of mission of the Western Hemisphere, I made a comment that I was hoping would be taken as humorous, and the Secretary actually chuckled.\u00a0 He did, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Now, just letting you know that you had me at a smirk, but thanks for going above and beyond the call.\nSo with that, hey, let me turn the microphone over to the man you\u2019re here to see, Secretary of State Tony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, thank you all very, very much.\u00a0 It is great to be here with Mission Panama.\u00a0 Wow, and greetings all the way up there.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I hadn\u2019t realized that we started at the same time, but look, in fairness, the office that I started in was on the sixth floor of the State Department, in the front office of what was then called the European and Canadian Affairs Bureau.\u00a0 And if you go there now you can still see \u2013 I think they\u2019ve changed it a little bit, but the previous occupant of that office, Stewart \u2013 the one right before me \u2013 was a large safe, which gives you some idea of what the office was like.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And as I say, basically over the course of about 30 years I managed to move up one flight of stairs and get some windows.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I\u2019ll take that.\nBut to Stewart\u2019s point \u2013 and first let me start by thanking you so much for your leadership here at what really is a critical time.\u00a0 And the fact that we\u2019re here is evidence that not only is this partnership important, it\u2019s increasingly vital.\u00a0 We have \u2013 and we talked about this with the president today and the foreign minister.\u00a0 We\u2019re at a time of challenge, where democracies are being challenged, and having a strong beacon of democracy here in Panama makes a big difference at this time.\nWe\u2019re, of course, facing an incredible challenge when it comes to irregular migration not just in our own hemisphere but quite literally around the world.\u00a0 There are now more people on the move around the world, displaced from their homes, than at any time since World War II.\u00a0 And we\u2019re feeling that here in our hemisphere.\u00a0 Panama has really stepped up in a big way to be a leader in making sure that we see this as a shared responsibility, which is really the focus of our trip here today.\nBut mostly I wanted to come by to say thank you to each and every one of you for the incredible service that you\u2019re performing.\u00a0 I have a couple things I want to say about that, but let me just give some thanks.\u00a0 I caught the tail end of the dancers and percussionists.\u00a0 Really remarkable; thank you so much for that.\u00a0 And I am especially glad to see that we have obviously some first and second-tour members of the team here.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I\u2019m looking forward to talking to you guys when we get a chance.\nBut one of the things that\u2019s really remarkable here is \u2013 we talk a lot about interagency collaboration back home.\u00a0 This is the model of it.\u00a0 By our count, there are 42 agencies represented here, everything from Ag to DOD to DOJ to Treasury, and so on down the line.\u00a0 To each and every one of you, if you\u2019re here from one of our partner agencies, thank you for the remarkable collaboration.\u00a0 We can\u2019t do what we do without that partnership, and this is really a model for the way that\u2019s supposed to work.\nYou\u2019ve been getting out and about despite the challenges of COVID.\u00a0 I know there\u2019s been an Embassy on the Road program, visiting provinces west of Panama City \u2013 should I \u2013 actually, here, I\u2019ll hold it.\u00a0 There we go, thank you.\u00a0 Sorry about that.\nMeeting community, business leaders; folks from all walks of life; visiting schools, touring farms, reaching diverse populations.\u00a0 And that kind of outreach is vital, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing it.\nI\u2019m also incredibly glad to know that the Peace Corps is on its way back, volunteers coming back in July after the COVID-19 pause.\u00a0 So Peace Corps, welcome back to Panama.\nAnd then, of course, we have a remarkable security partnership here with our partners.\u00a0 Together you are doing, we are doing, search and rescue missions, stopping illegal fishing, fighting drug trafficking.\u00a0 All of that happening out of this embassy.\nBut what I really wanted to focus on just for a minute is the culture of this mission and what each and every one of you is bringing to it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all been through, and you\u2019ve been through, an incredibly challenging time with COVID-19 over the last couple of years, and I know that\u2019s had a profound effect on people\u2019s professional lives, in many cases on your personal lives.\u00a0 Some of you have lost family members, loved ones, gotten sick, and you\u2019ve had to do your jobs in a different way, a much more difficult way, and yet you kept doing it.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve also kept the spirit alive, and that\u2019s so important, making sure that you had each other\u2019s backs as we worked through COVID.\u00a0 And I know that everything from virtual cooking classes to virtual bingo \u2013 it sounds funny, but it really is a powerful way of keeping people connected when they were forced to part, so thank you for doing that.\nAnd I\u2019m grateful as well to all of you for engaging in service, service to this country and this community.\u00a0 The Green Team with beach clean-ups, embassy volunteers working with local schools.\u00a0 The last event, I am told, had some 200 volunteers.\u00a0 That\u2019s a powerful bit of diplomacy, too.\u00a0 It really shows us connecting with our Panamanian friends and addressing issues that actually have an immediate impact on their lives as well.\u00a0 So I\u2019m thankful for it.\nAnd then I was told that you had your own special version of the Winter Olympics.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So interesting events that I had not realized were normally part of the Winter Olympics.\u00a0 Dodgeball.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Trivia \u2013 a lot of training has to go into that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Musical chairs for section leaders.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And then my personal favorite, a sack race in the diplomatic pouch.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Now that is a very good use of the diplomatic pouch.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut in all of these ways, and everything you\u2019ve done, spring garden parties.\u00a0 By the way, I heard that there was a lamb that made a repeated escape from this, showing that the lamb understands that one of our most sacred values is freedom.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut in all these ways big and small, this is how you build, this is how you keep a community together, especially during challenging times.\u00a0 And to you, Stewart, to the entire team here, to the acting DCM, everyone \u2013 thank you for coming together and for pulling together.\nFinally, wherever I go there are two groups of people that I especially want to give a special shout-out to.\u00a0 The first \u2013 and I saw some of our colleagues as we were coming in \u2013 are Marines.\u00a0 Every embassy that you go to, no matter where it is in the world, the very first person you\u2019re likely to see walking into an embassy is a Marine.\u00a0 We can\u2019t do our jobs without them doing their jobs.\u00a0 This partnership is something that\u2019s truly sacred to our institution.\u00a0 And to our Marine brothers and sisters, we are grateful for you every single day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd second \u2013 and all of you who are Americans here know this so very well \u2013 the lifeblood of any embassy everywhere in the world is our locally engaged staff.\u00a0 And I know that there are a number of you here.\u00a0 I want to say thank you to you for what you do every single day to bring our countries closer together.\u00a0 And there are a few people I just want to mention by name because this is really extraordinary.\nRoberto Ortiz.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if Roberto is here.\u00a0 Forty years of service.\u00a0 So Roberto, thank you.\u00a0 (Cheers and applause.)\nMirtha Arhona.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if Mirtha is here.\u00a0 Right there.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Cheers and applause.)\u00a0 It can\u2019t possibly be right.\u00a0 It \u2013 this can\u2019t be \u2013 it can\u2019t be right.\u00a0 It says 50 years of service.\u00a0 Is that possible?\u00a0 That can\u2019t be right.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd then I have here Mabel Camarena.\u00a0 Mabel, are you here anywhere?\u00a0 (Cheers and applause.)

Ford School of Public Policy, welcome back to those of you who just watched the first half of our fourth annual Vandenberg Lecture, and welcome to those of you who are just tuning in.\u00a0 I\u2019m John Ciorciari, an associate professor here at the Ford School and director of our Weiser Diplomacy Center, which is co-sponsoring today\u2019s events, along with the university\u2019s Democracy and Debate initiative and Detroit Public Television.\nIn the past hour, my colleague, Dean Michael Barr, spoke with Senator Chris Coons about the war in Ukraine and about forging a new foreign policy consensus in Washington.\u00a0 I now have the great pleasure of introducing a special guest to continue the conversation with a focus on diplomacy: United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nI\u2019ll keep this very brief so that we can get quickly to his insights.\nAntony Blinken is the 71st Secretary of State and has been a leader in shaping U.S. foreign policy over three decades and over three presidential administrations.\u00a0 Among other senior roles, he served as deputy secretary of state between 2015 and \u201917, as President Obama\u2019s principal deputy national security advisor before that, and also as a senior director at the National Security Council, as a senior official at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and elsewhere at the State Department, including a start to his career focused on European affairs, which will be a particular focus of today\u2019s conversation.\nI\u2019m joined in this conversation by Dean Barr and a classroom full of very excited Ford School students, including three of whom will join us here on the chairs to ask some questions of their own.\nWith that, please join me in welcoming Secretary Blinken to the fourth annual Vandenberg Lecture and to the Ford School.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 John, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 And it\u2019s wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to see my friend Michael.\u00a0 We go back a long ways to the days of the Clinton administration, but really wonderful to see you there.\nI just want to acknowledge a few people at the outset, particularly the president, Mary Sue Coleman.\u00a0 Grateful for her support for so much of what we do.\u00a0 There are a few people who have been involved with you either now or very recently who are \u2013 have been good friends or close colleagues.\u00a0 Carol Giacomo, former member of the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0editorial board who\u2019s at the Weiser Diplomacy Center who\u2019s a terrific friend and colleague.\nI think either with you today or tuning in today is another friend and colleague and someone for whom I have a tremendous amount of respect and appreciation, and that\u2019s Steve Biegun, who was the deputy secretary of state here.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been colleagues for a long time.\u00a0 I know that he is a Michigan grad, Michigan dad, and I think soon to be a Michigan professor again.\u00a0 So it\u2019s great to be with Steve, even virtually.\nAnd one of the things that I also have a deep appreciation for is the work that we\u2019re doing together between the State Department and the university.\u00a0 We have the Diplomacy Lab, which is I think a great initiative that really puts together students with foreign policy practitioners to try to solve concrete problems and bringing new ideas to us, new insights to us, and we\u2019re really thankful for that collaboration.\nWe have a Diplomat in Residence in Shannon Farrell, who\u2019s there as well.\nNow, part of this is all part of a very devious plot, which is to try to encourage folks from Michigan to think about making a career in diplomacy, in foreign policy, maybe even here at the State Department.\u00a0 We want to do everything that we possibly can to open your eyes, open your minds to that possibility.\u00a0 And so through some of these initiatives, through some of the people that have been involved in the university, I hope that that happens.\nI just want to say a couple of things at the outset, and I\u2019m really eager to get to questions and conversation with each of you.\nThere\u2019s obviously been, and remains, a huge focus on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, and I suspect we\u2019ll have a chance to talk about that.\u00a0 But one of the challenges that we have, one of the obligations that we have, is to make sure that even as we\u2019re focused relentlessly on something like this aggression, we\u2019re also doing the rest of our business and that we are carrying out the responsibilities that we have to try to advance America\u2019s interests and values in the world, day in, day out.\nI have a really hackneyed acronym that I\u2019ve been using with my team here, what is ROW, R-O-W, \u201crest of world.\u201d\u00a0 We can\u2019t lose sight of that even as we\u2019re dealing with something as all-consuming as Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 And in fact, we are ROWing, and I\u2019d just point to a couple of quick things to demonstrate that this department is working around the world, around the clock.\nJust in the last couple of weeks, thanks to American diplomacy, determined American diplomacy \u2013 sometimes quiet, but effective \u2013 we helped get a ceasefire in Ethiopia, which after many, many, many months where, among many other things, humanitarian assistance was not getting through, particularly to the northern part of the country in Tigray, that is now moving again.\u00a0 It\u2019s fragile, but it\u2019s a start.\nYemen \u2013 a horrific war, one of the worst in the world for the last almost decade \u2013 American diplomacy helped get a truce.\u00a0 And again, fragile, but that could lead to a more enduring ceasefire.\u00a0 Already we\u2019re starting to see humanitarian assistance flow again.\u00a0 My hope would be that we create a foundation for negotiation that leads to the end, finally, of that conflict.\u00a0 We\u2019re a ways from that, but it \u2013 that is happening.\nJust a couple of weeks ago, more or less unnoticed, we got our 500 millionth dose of COVID-19 vaccine around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re on our way to donating 1.2 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year, doing it primarily through this thing called COVAX, which makes sure that it\u2019s done equitably, that those who need it and can\u2019t afford it are getting it.\u00a0 We do it with no political strings attached, unlike some other countries out there.\u00a0 That\u2019s happening too, and a lot of American diplomacy and effort goes into that.\nWe got a couple people who are being illegally detained in Afghanistan out just a few days ago, an American citizen and a legal permanent resident who\u2019s a British national.\nSo I say all of that to illustrate the fact that even as the world is focused and we\u2019re focused on Ukraine, a lot is also going on every single day to try and advance our interests around the world.\nAnd finally this: The bread and butter of this institution for many, many years has been dealing when necessary with great power competition.\u00a0 And of course, we had that throughout the Cold War; we have that now in different ways with Russia, with China, which I suspect we\u2019ll talk about.\u00a0 And that remains at the heart of what we do.\nSo do issues of peace and security, of trying to resolve conflicts, prevent conflicts.\u00a0 But as important, we are focused \u2013 and have to be \u2013 on the issues that are having a profound impact on the lives of our fellow citizens every single day.\u00a0 And whether that is global health and COVID-19, whether that\u2019s climate and the existential crisis we face, whether it is emerging technologies that more than anything else are shaping lives, we\u2019re making sure that this department is really acting in the 21st century in ways that are addressing the needs of the American people.\nJust in the past couple of weeks, I cut the ribbon on a new bureau in the department for cyber security and digital policy so that our department is helping to advance our efforts around the world in making sure that as these policies are being shaped we\u2019re not only at the table, we\u2019re leading the conversation.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll soon have a senior envoy to deal with emerging technology, to make sure that as the norms and standards and rules that are being set around the world for how these technologies are used, we\u2019re in the lead on that effort.\nAs we speak, my illustrious predecessor, now the President\u2019s Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry, along with our Assistant Secretary Monica Medina, is in Palau for the Our Oceans Conference to advance efforts that we\u2019re making on climate and on the environment.\u00a0 And so we\u2019re very focused on that.\nAs I mentioned, we continue to get vaccine doses out there, but more than that, we\u2019re bringing countries together, mobilizing them to deal with the gaps that exist around the world in getting vaccines, getting shots into arms, as well as trying to build back better a global health system that can deal more effectively with the next pandemic, because we\u2019ll be facing one.\nSo in all of these ways and more, including on economics, which is so foundational to everything we do, we\u2019re making sure that we have a department that is fit for purpose to actually deal with the challenges that we\u2019re facing around the world that are having an impact on the lives of Americans.\nAnd the last thing I\u2019ll say is this.\u00a0 We are eager for some of you I hope who are listening to come and be a part of this.\u00a0 One of the things that is so essential for our country going forward, for our place in the world, is to make sure that new generations come in, come into the department, lead our efforts, put their minds, put their energies, put their passions to America and the world and to doing what we can to advance the interests that we have and the values that we share.\nSo I hope through the work that you\u2019re doing at Michigan, through some of the experiences you\u2019ll have, some of you at least will be led in this direction.\u00a0 I can tell you you\u2019ll have a very welcoming place to do it.\u00a0 So come on down to Washington.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR CIORCIARI:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to turn to our first student questioner.\u00a0 Hannah Kraus is a second-year master of public policy student and one of our Weiser diplomacy fellows.\u00a0 And so Hannah, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you so much for being here.\u00a0 I wanted to ask a question related to Ukraine.\u00a0 Watching the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold has brought to mind another act of Russian aggression with particular significance to me and my family: the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia.\u00a0 At the age of 18, my father watched Soviet tanks roll into his city of Prague to crush the liberalizing reforms of the Prague Spring.\u00a0 This event eventually brought him to the U.S., where he declared asylum, where he met my mother, and where I was born.\u00a0 For my family and for many others in Central and Eastern Europe, these are the memories, fears, and traumas that the current Russian invasion of Ukraine invokes.\nNow as the fighting in Ukraine shifts to the Donbas region, what are the limits and possibilities for how the U.S. approach could adapt?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Hannah, thank you.\u00a0 Thanks for sharing that, first of all.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve got to tell you, that resonates with me powerfully, just on a personal level.\u00a0 Like you, I had family that, in one way or another, are relatively recent arrivals to the country, and in ways similar to yours.\u00a0 My grandfather fled pogroms in what is now Ukraine at the turn of the last century.\u00a0 My stepmother fled Hungary and fled communists in Hungary before \u2013 a couple of decades before the Prague Spring.\u00a0 So \u2013 and came to America.\u00a0 And I have a late stepfather who survived concentration camps during World War II and was liberated by the United States.\nSo what you say resonates deeply with me, and in fact it motivates a lot of what I do and think about and try to act on.\nWhen it comes to what we\u2019re seeing now in this Russian aggression against Ukraine, there are a lot of things going on.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to get it down into a short conversation.\u00a0 But let me just highlight a few things.\nFirst, we of course have what is literally being done to people in Ukraine every single day, which is the brutalization of the country in ways that are increasingly being revealed to the world.\u00a0 We saw the images that came out of Bucha just about a week ago.\u00a0 As the Russian tide was being pushed back from different parts of Ukraine, we have seen what\u2019s left in its wake.\u00a0 And it\u2019s horrifying.\u00a0 People executed with their hands tied behind their backs.\u00a0 Bodies left in the streets.\u00a0 Buildings reduced to rubble.\u00a0 Atrocities committed, as we know from those who experienced them, in the most terrible ways.\u00a0 And I\u2019m afraid to say that as this moves forward, the world is probably almost certainly going to see more of that.\u00a0 And Bucha may have simply been a prelude to many horrors yet to be revealed.\u00a0 So that\u2019s very motivating in what we\u2019re doing in trying to stop this war, and I\u2019ll come to that very quickly in a second.\nBut there\u2019s another aggression going on.\u00a0 And that\u2019s an aggression against some of the basic principles that undergird the international system that are necessary to try to keep peace and security around the world \u2013 principles that evolved from two world wars, that were enshrined in the UN Charter, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all sorts of founding documents at the end of the Second World War that were designed to try to make sure to the best of our ability that something like this wouldn\u2019t happen again.\nAnd some of those principles \u2013 like the idea that one country can\u2019t simply assert that might makes right and change the borders of another by force; that one country can\u2019t simply dictate to another its policies, its choices, its future; that one country can\u2019t exert a sphere of influence to try to subjugate a neighbor or neighbors to its will; that one country can\u2019t simply deny the very existence of another, its independence, its sovereignty \u2013 all of those principles are also being aggressed by Russia in Ukraine.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so important for us to stand up not only in defense of Ukraine, but also in defense of those principles.\u00a0 Because if we allow them to be violated with impunity, it opens a Pandora\u2019s box not just in Europe, but potentially in every place around the world where others are watching and taking note and taking lessons.\nSo that gets to what we\u2019re doing about it.\u00a0 And here there are a lot of things that have gone into \u2013 gone into our consideration.\u00a0 But principally, we are doing a lot to help Ukraine effectively defend itself.\u00a0 We\u2019re putting extraordinary and unprecedented pressure on Russia, and we\u2019re shoring up the NATO Alliance to make sure that countries in that Alliance are properly defended against the threat of even more Russian aggression directed at them.\nWhen it comes to Ukraine, the extraordinary courage of the Ukrainians is what\u2019s at the heart of what they\u2019ve been able to do, in ways that I think many people would not have expected.\u00a0 But while that\u2019s at the heart of it, part of the reason that they\u2019ve been able to be as effective as they are is because we have supported them and supplied them going back well before Russia committed this aggression.\u00a0 If you go back to last summer, President Biden initiated the first of what are now more than half a dozen what we call drawdowns of military equipment.\u00a0 So this goes back to the end of last summer, well before the aggression.\u00a0 Another very significant one over Christmas \u2013 again, before the aggression \u2013 so that when Russia did go in, the Ukrainians had in their hands some of the tools that they needed to push back.\u00a0 And part of the reason they\u2019ve had success to date in pushing the Russians away from Kyiv and back toward the east is precisely because they had this.\nJust yesterday, the President did another drawdown of almost a billion dollars, $800 million, in the kinds of things that Ukraine needs to effectively defend itself.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been focused on making sure that to the best of our ability, we and others can get into Ukrainian hands as quickly as possible the kinds of things that they can use effectively as quickly as possible.\u00a0 Now we\u2019re looking at doing other things that may require, for example, some training, because some of the things that Ukrainians have asked for, they\u2019re not yet trained on.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking and working on all of that.\nSecond has been this unprecedented pressure on Russia.\u00a0 Again, going back to last fall when we saw this aggression looming and mounting, we warned \u2013 I warned \u2013 that if Russia did it, there would be massive consequences, including unprecedented sanctions.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure that people fully took that at face value.\u00a0 Well, I think that we\u2019ve demonstrated that we were dead serious about it.\u00a0 And what we have seen, what we have done in coordination with countries around the world, is unprecedented.\u00a0 And the pressure it\u2019s exerting against Russia is very, very real.\nWe\u2019ve seen an economy that is now pretty much wiping out all the gains of the last 15 years.\u00a0 Most forecasts suggest that Russia will contract by 15 percent or more over the next \u2013 between now and the end of the year.\nWe have seen something else that\u2019s been quite remarkable and that was not the direct product of our sanctions but I think was a product of the isolation that we\u2019ve helped induce, and that is an exodus of virtually every leading company from Russia.\nAnd finally, the export controls that we\u2019ve put in place \u2013 again, in coordination with many other countries \u2013 over time are going to have a real bite because they\u2019re going to deny Russia the technology that it needs to effectively modernize key industries, including defense.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to make it a lot harder for Russia to do these kinds of things in the future.\nAnd finally, as I said, we\u2019ve been in ways that we haven\u2019t seen before shoring up our own NATO Alliance.\nHaving said all of that, the President has to make sure that he is looking out for the interests of the American people.\u00a0 One of those interests is making sure to the best of our ability that we don\u2019t get into direct conflict with Russia, that we avoid doing things that could lead to a wider war.\u00a0 We want to end this war, end the Russian aggression, not broaden it out in ways that would be good for no one.\nSo we\u2019re resolutely committed to NATO and to our Article 5 obligations, to making sure that any aggression against any inch of NATO territory is defended against and protected.\u00a0 We will continue to do everything we can for Ukrainians to make sure they have the means in their hands to defend themselves and ultimately to strengthen their position at some eventual negotiated diplomatic resolution.\u00a0 The hard part is \u2013 look, I know this much:\u00a0 A sovereign, independent Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 The hard part is that there will \u2013 the death and destruction that continues to take place is truly horrific.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to do everything we can to help bring this war to an end as quickly as we possibly can, but we\u2019re also prepared for this to go on for some time.\nMR\u00a0CIORCIARI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 And Secretary Blinken \u2013 thank you, Hannah, for your excellent question.\nSecretary Blinken, I want to ask a follow-up on the diplomatic response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 Chris Coons pointed out in the last hour that while the response has been strong from NATO and EU partners, the response globally has been much more varied.\u00a0 Dozens of countries have abstained from votes condemning Russia at the UN General Assembly, as you know, and many have dragged their feet on implementing sanctions in alignment with the United States and its closest partners.\u00a0 What can the U.S. Government do to most effectively elicit stronger support from countries in regions like the Middle East, Africa, or South Asia, who allege either that participation in the sanctions would challenge norms of nonalignment or who accuse the United States of double standards in its response to Ukraine vis-\u00e0-vis other conflicts?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So John, first of all, I\u2019m really, really glad that you had Chris Coons with you earlier today.\u00a0 He is not only a great partner, he\u2019s a terrific friend, and beyond that he is one of the strongest, wisest voices that we have on foreign policy in this country, and he is a remarkable leader in the Senate.\u00a0 I think you heard from him as well some of the partnerships that he has, including for example with Senator Graham, where on a bipartisan basis they are helping to advance our foreign policy.\u00a0 And it\u2019s something that I deeply appreciate, so I\u2019m glad you heard from Chris.\nLook, there are a lot of things going on here, and it\u2019s a moving picture.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a still shot.\u00a0 And it\u2019s important to look at that moving picture.\u00a0 You note rightly that in a number of these votes, for example at the United Nations, that some countries abstained on critical votes.\u00a0 Well, in some cases an abstention is a significant step beyond a no vote, a rejection.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve moved a number of countries in a number of places from no to abstain.\u00a0 That in and of itself in this international system that we deal with says something, and it says something to other countries too.\nGoing back to the very first significant vote, 141 countries from every continent voted to have their voices heard against the Russian aggression and in support of Ukraine.\u00a0 And that is really the foundation, and that spoke volumes in and of itself.\u00a0 We had a successful vote recently that suspended Russia from its participation in the UN Human Rights Council.\u00a0 Again, a lot of countries taking part in that.\nBut having said that, we have to recognize some realities.\u00a0 A number of countries have had longstanding, decades-long relationships with Russia.\u00a0 Some of them have built up within that strong defense relationships where they\u2019ve been dependent on Russia for defense equipment and technology.\u00a0 Moving away from that takes time.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 It\u2019s a transition.\u00a0 In some cases, when those relationships developed we were not in a position to do the same thing ourselves.\u00a0 Now we may be, and in some cases now we are.\nAnd so part of this is about giving people a choice \u2013 not forcing a choice, giving them a choice \u2013 and then working on that over time.\u00a0 But it is in some cases turning around an aircraft carrier.\u00a0 It takes time.\u00a0 We have to be smart about it, patient about it.\u00a0 Some countries will come to the assistance of Ukraine when it comes to humanitarian assistance, but not security assistance.\u00a0 Some countries will vote one way or another way.\u00a0 But we\u2019re working to bring countries along on different aspects of this.\nThe second point is this \u2013 and you\u2019re right about this as well \u2013 different parts of the world, different countries are experiencing this in different ways.\u00a0 And they\u2019re experiencing it in the context sometimes of their histories.\u00a0 They\u2019re experiencing it in the context of recent history as well, including for example, places where we\u2019ve intervened in the past, and they raise very legitimate questions about how what\u2019s happening now and Ukraine fits with that, and I\u2019m happy to get into that.\u00a0 But I think what we\u2019ve been clear about is this:\u00a0 There are times when \u2013 even though we usually deal with shades of gray, there are times when there really is black and white.\u00a0 And in this case, we have a clear aggressor, and we have a clear victim, and countries should take account of that.\nSecond, we all, in our better days, try to adhere to the principles of the UN Charter.\u00a0 This is clearly an aggression against those very principles that countries should want to see upheld, especially by a permanent member of the Security Council \u2013 Russia, in this case.\nBut third \u2013 and this is what we really have to be attentive to and focused on \u2013 this aggression is having consequences way beyond Europe in people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 Commodity prices have gone up dramatically.\u00a0 Food scarcity, food prices in particular \u2013 I was in Morocco and Algeria recently. \u00a0This is what\u2019s being felt there.\nNow, that\u2019s not as a result of our sanctions; it\u2019s as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 Quite literally, Ukrainian farmers, instead of dealing with their crops, have to choose between fighting or fleeing.\u00a0 Russians are blockading Ukrainian ports so that the wheat \u2013 of which, as you know, Ukraine is one of the world\u2019s leading suppliers \u2013 to the extent it can actually get to market can\u2019t get out of the country, because ships are not allowed to leave from Black Sea ports.\u00a0 Farms are literally being intentionally bombarded by the Russians so that they can\u2019t produce.\nSo we\u2019re doing a number of things to be attentive to the fact that people around the world are suffering from this, including making sure that the leading organizations that work to provide food to countries and people who need it like the World Food Program at the UN, the Food and Agricultural Organization, that they\u2019re better resourced, because the price of doing business has just gone up for them.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to make sure that countries that have large stockpiles of food, from China and India, are releasing some of that to the world market.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to make sure that our own producers of fertilizer are incentivized to produce more, to get more out there, because if there\u2019s a shortage of fertilizer or it\u2019s priced out of the market for too many farmers, we know that yields next year are going to go down, supply will go down, prices will go up.\nSo in all of these ways, we\u2019re working to actually engage the problem as it\u2019s having an actual impact on other countries, and that\u2019s coloring the position that they\u2019re taking on this.\u00a0 And of course, finally, our diplomats are engaged every single day trying to deal with the challenges this is posing for other countries, and hopefully, bringing them along to the position that we have.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR BARR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I\u2019m honored to introduce you to our next student who\u2019s joining us up here today, second year master of public policy student of Maheen Zahid.\u00a0 So please, Maheen, take it from here.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Afternoon.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m interested in international relations and foreign policy, so I\u2019m so thrilled that you could join us today.\nSo my question to you is about refugee resettlement.\u00a0 Over the last few years, Europe has said that it is facing refugee crisis.\u00a0 After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, however, European nations open their borders to accept Ukrainian refugees.\u00a0 Here in the States, ever since the withdrawal from Afghanistan in September of last year, around 70,000 Afghans were accepted \u2013 that too, not as refugees, but on humanitarian parole.\u00a0 President Biden recently announced that the U.S. would accept up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine.\u00a0 How is it easier to welcome refugees in this case, and has the comparative swiftness with which Ukrainian refugees were and will be absorbed informed how the U.S. and its allies are now thinking about their own refugee policies?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great question, but first let me say thank you for or letting me know and letting us know your own interest in pursuing this career.\u00a0 That\u2019s really good to hear, and I hope you\u2019ll do it.\nSo let\u2019s put this in context.\u00a0 For well more than a decade now we have been \u2013 and that when I say we, I mean the world \u2013 has been living through a period of forced migration unlike any we\u2019ve seen since World War II.\u00a0 And if you go back to 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, we\u2019ve been seeing migratory crises, and within them refugee crises of course in Syria, in Iraq, in half a dozen countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, in our own hemisphere.\u00a0 And fast forwarding to today, of course, we now have Ukraine \u2013 to the point where there are something like 95 million people who have in one way or another been forcibly displaced from their homes.\nAnd within that group, there are probably 30 million or so refugees.\u00a0 If you put them all into one country, it would be bigger than South Korea, bigger than Spain.\u00a0 That\u2019s the magnitude of the problem, and it\u2019s a global challenge.\u00a0 The world is focused now on Ukraine.\u00a0 It was focused a few years ago on Syria.\u00a0 And the question is:\u00a0 What can we effectively and rightly morally do about it?\nThe United States for decades and decades has been the primary refuge for those seeking it from around the world, and we\u2019ve taken in more refugees than any country historically.\u00a0 But in recent years, that\u2019s moved in another direction.\u00a0 By the time we came to office, the ceiling \u2013 because a ceiling is established every year on the number of refugees that you take in \u2013 that ceiling had been cut to 15,000.\u00a0 And as a practical matter, far fewer than that were actually getting into the United States.\u00a0 When President Biden took office, one of the first things that we did was to focus on that, and we looked at what needed to be done to start to get us back to the place that we\u2019d been historically, which as \u2013 again, as the leading country when it comes to taking in refugees. And President Biden is on a path to re-elevate the ceiling of refugees that we take in to 125,000.\nThe problem is, again, this was not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 We have to do it in a way that that allows us to effectively bring in that many people, because the system in the meantime had been broken.\u00a0 There\u2019s an entire resettlement infrastructure that had atrophied over the \u2013 over the previous years because of this move away from taking in refugees.\u00a0 And until that system can be effectively rebuilt, it\u2019s very hard to actually bring in that many people.\u00a0 The resettlement institutions themselves internationally had also atrophied.\u00a0 I just met, I think yesterday, with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, and we were talking about this at some length.\nSo part of this for us has been rebuilding, and that started well before the Ukraine crisis, not at all motivated by that.\u00a0 It was literally something that we started on day one of this administration.\u00a0 And we\u2019re getting there.\u00a0 But as important as that is, besides the refugee program, which as I say has a cap and it has regional allocations, there are many other pathways to coming to the United States, legal pathways that we have been working on and trying to strengthen.\u00a0 And there are various things that we can use in our law to bring in \u2013 to bring more people in, including for example, reuniting families that have been split apart, work visas and permits of one kind or another, humanitarian parole.\u00a0 There are a whole number of ways of doing this.\nBut that also has to be done making sure that we have a system, a migration system that\u2019s based on the rule of law, that deals also with the problem of illegal migration effectively, so that we have effective, strong, safe, humane borders.\u00a0 All of this has to has to come together, and we\u2019re working to do just that.\u00a0 In our own hemisphere, we also have extraordinary challenges when it comes to migration.\u00a0 There are more people on the move in our own hemisphere than ever before.\u00a0 And whether it is Mexico, whether it\u2019s Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, whether it\u2019s Nicaragua and Venezuela, whether it\u2019s Haiti, whether it\u2019s Haitians who have migrated to Chile and Brazil and are now trying to make the move north, all of this is coming to play for a whole variety of reasons, all at once.\nSo there, we\u2019re working very hard to bring our entire hemisphere together so that we deal with this as a shared responsibility.\u00a0 We\u2019re gonna have a Summit of the Americas in a few weeks\u2019 time where this will be front and center on the agenda.\u00a0 And one of the things that I hope results from it is a regional compact on shared responsibility for dealing with migration.\u00a0 Ultimately, there are different drivers of migration and refugees in different parts of the world.\u00a0 In our own hemisphere, it tends to be more than anything else an economic driver.\nBut one of my colleagues spoke very eloquently about this \u2013 another foreign minister from a Latin American country.\u00a0 We were meeting months ago, and she said that we ought to \u2013 there ought to be established a right to remain, that the conditions in countries that are causing people to feel compelled to leave, that\u2019s what we need to address.\u00a0 In our own hemisphere, as I said, a lot of it is economic opportunity, so dealing with some of the root causes involves helping countries really create opportunity in ways that people can see that they have a future at home.\nIn other parts of the world, whether it\u2019s Ukraine, whether it\u2019s the Middle East, whether it\u2019s Africa, it\u2019s often conflict.\u00a0 And a big part of our responsibility and our work at the State Department is to try to prevent these conflicts from erupting in the first place, or to bring them to an end as quickly as possible if they have, and at the same time doing a lot more to help countries of first refuge for someone who\u2019s a refugee be able to support them and to deal with the challenges that it poses to those countries.\nI\u2019ll end with this:\u00a0 We saw in Syria six, seven, eight years ago that Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, were bringing people in from Syria that in the case, for example, of Lebanon was somewhere between a quarter and a third of the entire population was a Syrian refugee.\u00a0 Try to imagine, if that was the case in the United States, the kinds of conversations we\u2019d be having.\nSo one of the obligations I think we have is to make sure that countries that are countries of first refuge have the means to deal with that effectively, to make sure that not only can a refugee have a job, not only can their kids go to school, but the local population, the indigenous population, also is supported because it\u2019s a huge drain on countries\u2019 resources.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve got to make sure that this somehow is a win-win.\nEurope\u2019s done a remarkable job with Ukrainians to date.\u00a0 They put in place a system that supports them, that allows them to move around Europe, that allows them to unite with family members who may already have been in other parts of Europe, that gives them social support, economic support for two years.\u00a0 That\u2019s extraordinary.\u00a0 But that\u2019s not available everywhere, and a lot of this work is something that we\u2019re trying to drive around the world.\nSo it\u2019s a monumental problem, it\u2019s a global problem, it\u2019s a global challenge.\u00a0 We have to be playing our part, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\nMR BARR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, and thank you, Maheen.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to call up the next of our Ford School students for a question.\u00a0 Hanna Schechter is an undergraduate senior at the Ford School, and let me turn things over to Hanna.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, for being with us this afternoon.\u00a0 My name is Hanna and my focus in the Ford School has been on diplomacy, so I greatly appreciate you being here.\nThis past spring break, I was able to travel to Washington, D.C. to interview policy analysts and foreign ambassadors regarding the war on Ukraine.\u00a0 In these conversations, we explored diplomatic and economic tools being used as well as the importance of having a unified international response in regards to the current sanctions regime.\u00a0 As the PRC tries to present itself as a neutral party, how feasible do you believe it is to convince Beijing not to undermine sanctions, while at the same time not jeopardizing isolating the PRC further to support Russia?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s a great question, and I think a really, really important one.\u00a0 You saw that before \u2013 just before Russia invaded Ukraine, the \u2013 Russia and China put out a joint statement that was about 5,000 words in length and that had maybe as its most defining line the notion that they had a partnership without limits.\nWell, I think to some extent those limits, in fact, are actually being tested right now because China is in a challenging position.\u00a0 It says repeatedly that its policies are based, among other things, on the \u2013 on upholding the UN Charter and the principles that underlie it.\u00a0 I might dispute that, but leaving that aside, well, those very principles, that very charter, is being challenged right now by Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 And so we look to China to stand up to defend the principles that it purports to espouse, and it has not exactly done that.\nI think it\u2019s in an \u2013 increasingly in an uncomfortable position precisely because there\u2019s a huge disconnect between what it purports to stand for and what it\u2019s actually doing with regard to Russia\u2019s aggression, and I think that\u2019s having a big impact on its reputation around the world, in many parts of the world from Africa to the Middle East to Asia itself.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something that it has to factor into its thinking and its decision making.\nPresident Biden spent a couple of hours on a video conference with President Xi a few weeks ago in which we made very clear that we were watching carefully to see whether China in any way supported Russia\u2019s war efforts either by literally supporting it materially or undermining or helping Russia evade sanctions.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we continue to watch very carefully, but these are decisions that China has to make.\nAnd at the same time, there was just recently a meeting between the European Union and China where China is looking to develop, strengthen, deepen its relationships with Europe, with the European Union, with the countries in Europe.\u00a0 I think it heard and it got a lengthy earful from Europe about the concerns that Europe has about the aggression by Russia in Ukraine and what China is doing or not doing to stand and speak against that aggression.\u00a0 So all of these things will play out over time, but I think it is something that China very much has to factor into its calculus.\nAnd again, I come back to this proposition that, again, no matter what you think of how we got there, whatever narratives Russia has tried to spin about what caused this, it really comes down to a very fundamental proposition, which is we have an aggressor, we have a victim, and this is not about siding with the United States.\u00a0 It\u2019s about siding with right versus wrong; it\u2019s about siding with the basic principles of the international system or for chaos and conflict.\u00a0 And ultimately, China has to choose.\nMR BARR:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken, and thank you, Hanna, for the terrific question.\u00a0 I know we\u2019re slightly over the hour, Mr. Secretary, so I want to be conscious of your time.\u00a0 Do you have time for a question or two or are you at the hour?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sure, I think we got one more question.\u00a0 We can do that.\nMR BARR:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 So this is a question that is about the moment we\u2019re in in international diplomacy.\u00a0 This is obviously the Vandenberg Lecture series.\u00a0 Senator Vandenberg famously worked across partisan lines to really forge a new system after World War II that brought us NATO, that brought us the Marshall Plan, that really built the alliances that you are now working with today.\u00a0 Do you have a vision for what this world might look like, and what would it take to actually get back to a place where we could have a strong system of international alliances in the future?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Michael, first of all, it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to throw yourself in the same sentence with Vandenberg or Kennan or Marshall or any of the other architects of what was a truly extraordinary achievement.\u00a0 So I think I approach this with equal doses of humility, but also some confidence, because I\u2019m convinced that the United States at its best still has a greater capacity than any other country on Earth to mobilize others in common cause and hopefully for the greater good.\nAnd to some extent we\u2019ve seen that in action.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that in action when it comes to Ukraine.\u00a0 Our engagement, the President\u2019s leadership has done I think to date a very effective job in mobilizing others \u2013 mobilizing others in support of Ukraine, mobilizing others to put this extraordinary pressure on Russia, mobilizing others to make sure that our own alliance is properly resourced and defended.\u00a0 And that doesn\u2019t just happen; it is the product of getting in there, rolling up your sleeves, engaging, and doing that every single day.\u00a0 And so I think we\u2019ve seen already the traditional existing alliances stand up in ways that I suspect people didn\u2019t really expect and maybe thought those days were gone.\u00a0 They\u2019re not.\u00a0 But that\u2019s necessary, but it\u2019s also not enough.\nOne of the reasons that the President instructed us from day one to really focus on revitalizing, re-energizing, rebuilding as necessary our alliances, our partnerships, our engagement in international institutions, it is because there is a sort of founding vision that he has and that we share.\u00a0 First, it\u2019s that American engagement and American leadership is necessary because in its absence, one of two things: either someone else is filling the void, and increasingly maybe that\u2019s China, and probably not in a way that\u2019s going to advance our interests and values; or, maybe just as bad, no one fills it, and then you tend to have a vacuum, and vacuums often get filled with chaos and conflict before they get filled by anything good.\nSo there is a renewed premium on our engagement and our leadership, and we\u2019ve tried to step up to that.\u00a0 But equally, the flip side of that coin is engagement to what end and by what means?\u00a0 And for us, there\u2019s equally a premium on making sure that we are working with others, not against them or at cross purposes.\u00a0 Because not a single one of the challenges that we face can be effectively dealt with by the United States acting alone.\u00a0 Ukraine is a very good example.\u00a0 We are far more effective having brought other countries along in defense of Ukraine, putting pressure on Russia, defending our own alliance.\nBut the same is true for the things that I mentioned earlier that are having a direct impact on the lives of virtually every American.\u00a0 When it comes to climate, the truly existential challenge that we face, we\u2019re 15 percent of global emissions \u2013 even if we do everything right at home, that doesn\u2019t account for the other 85 percent.\u00a0 So we have to engage the rest of the world, as John Kerry is literally doing right now, to try to bring other countries along in raising their own ambitions, helping to support countries that need help with adaptation and building resilience, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing, starting with getting back into Paris, through COP, et cetera.\nCOVID, we know \u2013 and it\u2019s become trite, but it \u2013 we forget this at our peril: no one\u2019s safe till everyone\u2019s safe.\u00a0 And as long as the virus is percolating somewhere, it could be mutating, and we might end up with a variant that defeats the very strong tools that we\u2019ve now put in place to deal with it.\nSo we have a strong incentive in bringing other countries along to get the rest of the world vaccinated.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 We\u2019ve mobilized more than a dozen countries now to take ownership, to take leadership in filling the gaps that still exist on vaccination, dealing with the last mile, supply chains, getting shots into arms, supporting health care workers, et cetera, et cetera, particularly in Africa, where the gap is huge between vaccination rates there and in other parts of the world.\nEmerging technologies, the things that are really shaping the lives of our people, the smartphones that we all have in our pockets \u2013 the standards, the norms, the rules by which those technologies are used, that\u2019s probably going to have a greater impact on the lives of everyone sitting in this room today than just about anything else.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t do that alone; we can\u2019t dictate that.\u00a0 We have to bring other countries along, and that goes with diplomacy.\nIn these windowless conference rooms around the world where these norms and standards and rules are getting decided and getting shaped, we\u2019ve got to be at the table.\u00a0 And now we are.\u00a0 Just a couple weeks ago, I actually literally cut the ribbon \u2013 I\u2019ve never got a chance to do that before, with a giant pair of scissors \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 in the State Department. \u00a0We have a bureau that we just stood up in record time, thanks to terrific support from Congress on a bipartisan basis, to help lead on cybersecurity and digital policy so that the United States, in all of these places around the world where this is getting decided, is there at the table, and hopefully even at the head of the table.\u00a0 And we\u2019re back and doing that.\nAnd so to the extent that there is a vision, it really is about a reassertion of American leadership and engagement, a conviction that we have to do this with partners, with allies, within international institutions, as well as, where necessary, on our own.\nAnd finally, the last point I\u2019d make is this:\u00a0 We have to be investing in ourselves.\u00a0 That also gives us tremendous strength when we\u2019re dealing abroad.\u00a0 President Biden\u2019s been committed to that.\u00a0 We used to dedicate about 2 percent of our GDP to investments in research and development from the government.\u00a0 That\u2019s got \u2013 that got down to about 0.7 percent of GDP.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to change that, because those investments \u2013 which were catalysts for invention and for the private sector \u2013 led to everything from the internet to GPS to so many other things in between.\u00a0 And we\u2019re at a competitive disadvantage if we\u2019re not making those investments.\u00a0 Same for infrastructure; same for education.\nWe used to be leaders in all of those areas when it \u2013 comparative to other countries.\u00a0 We\u2019ve fallen back to \u2013 from one or two to 10, 11, 12, 20.\u00a0 Guess who has risen up in our place?\u00a0 China.\u00a0 So we\u2019re making those \u2013 we\u2019re trying to make those investments now.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to stand us in very good stead.\nThe last thing is this:\u00a0 I hope in touching on some of these areas that there are many among you who will say:\u00a0 Ah, now I see a way that something I\u2019m really interested in is actually relevant to our foreign policy, I can see a way \u2013 I\u2019m interested in climate, I\u2019m interested in technology, I\u2019m interested in global health, I\u2019m interested in economics.\u00a0 But you know what?\u00a0 If you are, that\u2019s exactly why we need you and want you here at the State Department, because you\u2019ll have an opportunity to help lead our country in those areas and, as a result, lead our efforts around the world to make sure that we\u2019re trying to make the world just a little bit better, a little bit safer, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more healthy.\u00a0 That\u2019s ultimately what this is all about.\u00a0 That\u2019s what benefits our own people.\u00a0 And this is a great part \u2013 a place to be a part of that.\nSo I hope that\u2019s something that you take away and think about, and that we\u2019ll see a few of you here in Washington.\nMR BARR:\u00a0 Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Please, everyone, join me in thanking Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-dutch-foreign-minister-wopke-hoekstra-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary

Thank you very much for having us in what is truly an unprecedented era in history.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also a time where we see more than ever the tremendous importance of the transatlantic bonds.\nThank you very much for your leadership, for making sure that you and NATO work seamlessly together, for making sure the excellent bond between our two countries is as strong as ever.\u00a0 And we will make sure that we continue to work together on all the challenging events \u2013 currently Ukraine, but there is much more to do, much more geopolitical challenges that we will face, and we value very much the bilateral bonds but also the excellent relationship between the U.S. and the European Union.\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, all.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-egyptian-foreign-minister-sameh-shoukry-before-their-meeting-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs Ms. Lee Satterfield, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu, Ambassador of India to the United States of America Ambassador Sandhu, Minister of External Affairs of the Government of India Minister Jaishankar, staff members of the Department of State, employees of the Embassy of India, alumni of exchange programs of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Howard University students, faculty, staff, and distinguished visitors, I\u2019m Dr. Anthony Wutoh.\u00a0 I\u2019m provost and chief academic officer of Howard University.\nAnd it is certainly my pleasure to welcome you to the historic Founders Library, the national treasure of Howard University.\u00a0 The library is the home of the university\u2019s museum and Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, one of the world\u2019s largest repositories dedicated to the history and culture of people of African descent.\u00a0 It is also home to the bust of Mahatma Gandhi the Government of India gave to Dr. Martin Luther King when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.\u00a0 The King family donated it to Howard University upon his death.\nIt is fitting that Howard is the setting in which to celebrate the educational and cultural exchanges that undergird the strong bilateral relationship between India and the United States of America.\u00a0 Indian and Indian American students and faculty have called Howard alma mater since the turn of the last century, including perhaps our most celebrated Indian American alumna, Vice President Kamala Harris.\nThis year, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research and Howard University celebrated the tenth anniversary of our partnership.\u00a0 Our schools work cooperatively on curriculum development and conduct faculty exchanges.\u00a0 Pharmacy students and students from other disciplines from both schools conduct clinical rotations at our respective hospitals in Washington and in Mysore.\u00a0 And Howard\u2019s relationship with the Department of State is just as rich.\nI am proud to note Howard is a Historically Black College and University institutional leader, a major producer of Fulbright scholars and researchers.\u00a0 All of the Howard undergraduate students in the audience today are Larry Palmer envoys.\u00a0 The Palmer envoys program is named after Ambassador Larry Palmer, who served as Howard\u2019s ambassador of residence from 2018 until his unfortunate passing last April.\nSelected from HBCUs across the country, Palmer envoys are students interested in international affairs.\u00a0 The biweekly sessions demystify the State Department and make it more accessible to exceptional students who might not otherwise consider State Department exchanges, fellowships, and employment.\u00a0 Ambassador Palmer also oversaw all of the diplomatic fellowships administered by Howard University \u2013 the Pickering, Rangel, and Payne fellowship programs.\u00a0 His envoys are a tribute to his commitment and to the future of the diplomatic corps.\u00a0 I\u2019ll ask for a second if the Palmer envoys will please stand and be recognized.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt is now my pleasure to invite to the podium the 75th United States Secretary of State, Secretary Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon, everyone, and it is absolutely wonderful to be in this incredible setting with so much history as well as such an extraordinary future here with our Palmer colleagues.\u00a0 I actually was going to ask if we could have class outside \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but, and I should point out that I changed my pin.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been pinned by Howard University and I\u2019m honored by that.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo Mr. Provost, thank you so much for the introduction and for your leadership here at Howard.\u00a0 And to my good friend, to my colleague, the Foreign Minister of India Jaishankar, thank you for being with us today for now the second day in a row.\u00a0 We spent all day yesterday together, starting at breakfast, ending at dinner.\u00a0 We had an incredibly productive session of what we call our 2+2, the foreign ministers and defense ministers of both of our countries working together on a common agenda and punctuated, I would say, by a really important virtual meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Biden.\nSo we\u2019re grateful and I am also so pleased to have our friend and colleague, the Indian ambassador here, Ambassador Sandhu, Assistant Secretary Satterfield, Assistant Secretary Lu, and many colleagues from the department.\u00a0 Thank you, each and every one of you, for being here today and also for helping bring us together today.\nIt is incredibly fitting that we\u2019re meeting at Howard University to talk about how to deepen the educational ties between India and the United States.\u00a0 As I have come to learn, and as we heard a little bit about, throughout its history this institution has played an important role in building bonds between our countries.\u00a0 And really, it\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of those bonds not just as we look back but, I believe, as we go forward.\nLet me tell you about one key figure from what has been already a very storied past.\u00a0 Howard Thurman, former dean of Rankin Chapel here at Howard, I\u2019m sure familiar to many of you.\u00a0 Going back to September of 1935, Thurman led a four-member delegation on what was a monthslong pilgrimage to India.\u00a0 He was trying to find lessons from the country\u2019s independence movement that might be relevant to the racial justice movement in the United States.\nNear the end of the trip, Thurman met with Mahatma Gandhi.\u00a0 They talked, the books record, for about three hours, covering a wide range of issues: segregation, faith, nonviolent resistance.\u00a0 The conversation and the trip made a lasting impression on Thurman.\u00a0 So when he came back to Howard, he developed his interpretation of nonviolence \u2013 not as a political tactic, but as a spiritual lifestyle.\u00a0 He shared his views with sermons, speeches, and eventually what came to be an incredibly influential book,\u00a0Jesus and the Disinherited.\nSo Gandhi\u2019s views and Thurman\u2019s interpretation of those views \u2013 of nonviolence \u2013 they, of course, would influence one of the greatest figures in our nation\u2019s journey, Martin Luther King, Jr.\u00a0 As he traveled the country laying bare the sins of segregation, Dr. King carried two books with him.\u00a0 One was the Bible, the other\u00a0Jesus and the Disinherited.\nThese connections and so many others across our shared history make clear that our people do share a special bond, and that as the world\u2019s oldest and largest democracies, our countries always have something to learn from each other.\nThat\u2019s why we see our cultural and educational ties continue to grow every single year.\u00a0 We\u2019re incredibly fortunate in the United States to have 200,000 Indians studying at our universities, enriching our campuses, enriching our fellow citizens.\u00a0 And we see many American students studying and working in India through programs like Fulbright, the Gilman fellowships, including some who are here today.\nTo make it easier for people to continue learning from each other, Jai and I announced yesterday a working group, a Working Group on Education and Skill Training, which will bring academic institutions in the United States and India together to develop new joint research programs.\u00a0 The group will also focus on creating more opportunities for universities to partner on exchange programs that Assistant Secretary Satterfield runs so that ultimately more of our people can learn alongside each other.\nNow, I know I don\u2019t need to tell this group about the importance of building stronger bonds between our higher education systems.\u00a0 Many of you have benefited from studying in each other\u2019s countries.\u00a0 And you\u2019re using that knowledge now to teach in the other\u2019s country.\u00a0 That\u2019s a very powerful thing.\u00a0 You\u2019re developing recommendations on how India and the United States can support each other\u2019s clean energy transitions.\u00a0 You\u2019re promoting trade between our countries and more equitable opportunities that flow from that trade.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just to name a few examples of the things that people are working on.\nSo in foreign policy, one of the things we talk a lot about is the importance, the strength, the imperative of people-to-people ties.\u00a0 We do a lot of work as diplomats between our countries, but ultimately what really matters are those bonds between our people \u2013 between students, between businessmen and women, between academics, between tourists and others.\u00a0 This is what really brings us together.\nAnd when we\u2019re talking about that, in effect we\u2019re talking about you: those who do the daily work of sharing their perspectives, sharing their knowledge with each other, and in so doing, building what are really lifelong personal and professional relationships with each other.\u00a0 That\u2019s what makes all the difference because these kinds of connections, the people-to-people connections, many of them fostered by the exchange programs that we run, they actually build lifelong connections and a lifelong appreciation for each other\u2019s countries, cultures, histories, and futures.\u00a0 And as a result, we are better able to take on shared challenges together.\nI believe firmly that we will need your continued collaboration, your hard work, your leadership for the biggest challenges we face, whether it\u2019s combating COVID, whether it\u2019s building a more inclusive global economy, whether it\u2019s tackling the climate crisis.\nTo put it another way, the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership, I am convinced, is absolutely crucial, essential, for addressing the problems of the 21st century, and your work is at the heart of that relationship.\nSo I\u2019m really anxious to hear about some of the experiences that you\u2019ve had, your ideas for how we can better develop, better deepen the educational and cultural ties between India and the United States.\nBefore we do that, though, it\u2019s a great pleasure to turn it over to my friend, Foreign Minister Jaishankar.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Secretary of State Tony Blinken, Ambassador Sandhu, Assistant Secretary Satterfield, Assistant Secretary Lu, my colleague, additional Secretary Vani Rao, Honorable Provost, faculty, students:\u00a0 Let me say what a great pleasure it is to join you all today at this education event at Howard University.\u00a0 And I really thank the Department of State and the Indian Embassy for this initiative and, of course, the university for hosting us.\nMany of you would be wondering why two foreign ministers who clearly had a fairly busy day yesterday chose to meet again at an education event at a university.\u00a0 And the answer is that our business as foreign ministers, as diplomats, is about connecting countries, connecting societies, and we do that through connecting people.\nAnd when it comes to people, the most natural place to focus is on young minds with a curiosity about the world, of people whose lives are still very much ahead of them.\u00a0 If our presence today enhances your interest in India-U.S. relations, then I can say, and I\u2019m sure, Tony, you would agree with this, that it\u2019s a good day\u2019s work for us.\nBut there is also a particular reason why I think the Howard University is a appropriate venue for this exercise.\u00a0 When we speak about the India-U.S. connect, the most powerful symbol of that is the inspirational bond between Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that Secretary Blinken also spoke about.\u00a0 And as he told us, that bond was forged through the relationship which was build by Howard Thurman, the dean of the chapel, and later by Dr. William Stuart Nelson, who was the dean of the School of Religion.\u00a0 It is also fitting that this university hosted in September last year the Gandhi-King Lecture, which was delivered by Ambassador Sandhu here, and is currently celebrating the India Hawadiya.\nBut Howard University is not just a part of our shared past.\u00a0 It is very much part of the future that awaits us.\u00a0 As we contemplate that future, a big part of that, a big role in that, is going to be played by the relationship between our two countries, and that relationship has undergone a real transformation in the last two decades.\u00a0 Whether it is our strategic and security cooperation or our economic or technology partnerships, it is making its weight increasingly felt in world affairs.\nA key driver of this change has been its human element.\u00a0 The 4.4 million Indian diaspora has literally defined our image in this society and helped forge relationships that are an enormous source of strength for us in our work.\u00a0 At its center are students, academics, researchers, and professionals who have contributed to America\u2019s progress even as they remain the bridge between our two societies.\nFor our ties to grow it is equally necessary that there is a better understanding of India and the world on the part of young Americans.\u00a0 Your appreciation of a civilizational state and a democratic \u2013 and a fellow democratic polity that is daily overcoming enormous odds is essential.\u00a0 After all, we are natural partners only when our people have a strong sense of connect.\nAnd that is why Secretary Blinken and I were especially pleased yesterday to launch the Working Group on Education and Skill Development that he spoke about.\u00a0 It will enable us to explore a range of opportunities that exist in the field of education, research, innovation, and entrepreneurship.\nWe are also committed to taking forward the proposal for the Gandhi-King Development Foundation to implement social development projects in India.\u00a0 And in doing so, we would help realize the vision of Congressman John Lewis, who initiated congressional legislation in that regard.\nPolicymakers in both countries are sharply aware of the immense difference that our educational collaboration can make.\u00a0 On the Indian side, our 2020 National Education Policy contemplates, indeed prioritizes, international cooperation in education.\nAt the American end, we recognize the renewed focus on the STEM sector, including in activities that a group which we are both part of called the Quad.\u00a0 The Quad is \u2013 among its many activities is focused on STEM fellowships.\u00a0 I know that my colleague, Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, is looking forward to engaging more intensively on developing this important facet of our relationship.\nSo let me conclude by once again underlining how important it is to develop and nurture these people-to-people linkages.\u00a0 I\u2019m confident that Howard University and other educational institutions will be enthusiastic partners in this endeavor.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0\u00a0And thank you, Mr. Secretary, Minister Jaishankar.\u00a0 I\u2019m Lee Satterfield, the assistant secretary of state for Educational and Cultural Affairs.\u00a0 Our bureau\u2019s mission is to increase mutual understanding between people in the United States and people of other countries.\u00a0 Today, we have a host of students, faculty, and staff with us who have an outsized interest in international affairs.\u00a0 In fact, some of our academic exchange scholars are here today, past participants of the Fulbright program, the Benjamin Gilman program, and the Critical Language Scholarship program.\u00a0 I\u2019m so pleased to be able to moderate today\u2019s discussion, so let\u2019s get started.\nI want to first call on Angel Bryant.\u00a0 Angel is sophomore International Affairs major who is a 2019-2020 Global Citizen Year India Fellow and a 2021-22 Palmer Envoy.\u00a0 Angel has a question for both of you.\u00a0 Angel.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0My question is:\u00a0 What made you all interested in international relations?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m anxious to hear the answer, too.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0\u00a0I really have to think for a moment because it\u2019s been so long a part of my life.\u00a0 Why did I start getting interested in the world?\u00a0 I think part of it was probably an interest in music that \u2013 you heard music beyond your own, and then you wondered: what kind of music, where is it from, what kind of people?\u00a0 I think the food part of it came much later.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It was easier to afford music than food when you were younger.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSome of it really \u2013 I also came from a family environment, which was a little bit international.\u00a0 In fact, I mean, we talk of educational professional exchanges.\u00a0 My father came here when I was about 10 years old on a fellowship \u2013 in fact, on a Rockefeller Fellowship \u2013 to study and to do some sort of professional training here.\u00a0 So I think, again, there\u2019s a little bit of parental influence.\nAnd I guess, in a way this \u2013 I\u2019m talking now of the 1960s, \u201870s.\u00a0 It may sound like prehistory to you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But it was really a time when the world was beginning to globalize much more.\u00a0 I mean, there were more tourists, people \u2013 the idea of traveling abroad, of seeing other cultures come \u2013 I mean, every time actually you would have something foreign happen in your school or university, there\u2019d be tremendous excitement about it.\nI guess it was a combination of all those things.\u00a0 And I still \u2013 the first music album that \u2013 foreign music album that I ever heard, which actually was a American album, a 1959 album called The Hitmakers.\u00a0 I actually now have it in Spotify. \u00a0(Laughter.)\u00a0 And I still listen to it for reasons of nostalgia.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, thank you for sharing that, and thanks for the question.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting because you hear these stories about what drove people to do a certain thing, to pursue a certain career, and I think for a lot of us there is often \u2013 not always, but often \u2013 a connection of what you hear around the breakfast table at home.\nAnd in my case, I had parents and grandparents who in one way or another were relatively recent immigrants to the United States and had stories of one kind or another that I think really put in a sort of spotlight for me what our country at its best \u2013 which is not always the case \u2013 can represent to the world.\u00a0 And I heard that from a very young age.\u00a0 I had my grandfather who fled pogroms in, interestingly enough, what is now Ukraine back at the turn of the last century; later, a stepmother who fled communists from Hungary; a stepfather who survived the concentration camps and was liberated by the United States.\u00a0 And these stories and others were a big part of it.\nBut then I had an experience at a young age that also ties into what we\u2019re talking about, and that is the experience of actually living abroad as an American.\u00a0 When I was nine years old, we moved to France, and I moved there with my mom and my stepdad.\u00a0 And I spent nine years in France from age nine to 18, all the way through high school.\u00a0 And that experience \u2013 actually living abroad, seeing your own country through the eyes of others, expanding your own horizons to a different country, culture \u2013 and being, of course, in France, that opened up all of Europe with a Eurail pass and a few other things back in the day \u2013 that had a profound impact.\nAnd one of the things that happens when you\u2019re an American abroad \u2013 and this was roughly the same period as Jai was talking about \u2013 for me, this was \u2013 we moved in 1971.\u00a0 There was a lot going on in the world in the \u201970s, as there is today.\u00a0 And whether it was the Vietnam War which was still happening, whether it was the Cold War which remained \u2013 what seemed to be its height, whether it was conflict in the Middle East, all of these things were part of the conversations that we were having in school.\u00a0 And because America, one way or another, was often in the middle of these things, you\u2019d find yourself almost acting like a junior diplomat, somehow representing your country, defending it, getting into conversations, discussions, arguments.\nAnd I think that as much as anything else really got me interested in foreign policy generally and in diplomacy.\u00a0 How do we find ways to have these conversations?\u00a0 How do we find ways to try to bring people together who are bringing so many different perspectives to bear on the questions of the day?\u00a0 And so that was really, I think, what drove me.\nBut I\u2019ll say one last thing because I think it\u2019s important especially to folks who are just starting out.\u00a0 I managed to try a whole bunch of different things before I wound up doing what I\u2019m doing, and finding that I had virtually no talent for any of them \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 wound up where I am.\u00a0 But it\u2019s important if you have the opportunity to try different things because you may not figure out what it is that you want to do right away.\u00a0 If you\u2019re fortunate, you will figure it out.\u00a0 And for those of you who are pursuing the international fellowships and exchanges, you probably already have a pretty decent idea.\u00a0 That\u2019s a great thing, it\u2019s a powerful thing, but don\u2019t panic if you don\u2019t figure it out exactly right away.\u00a0 If you have the luxury of being able to try these things, experience these things, open yourselves to the world, that in and of itself is a great thing.\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Wonderful perspectives, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Angel, for that question.\nNow I\u2019d like to call on Jasdeep Matharu, a first generation Indian American and proud Howard alumnae.\u00a0 He has a question for the minister.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 My question is the COVID-19 pandemic saw an effective India-U.S. research cooperation in the health care sector.\u00a0 Do you expect this STEM research cooperation to strengthen in the coming days, and if so, which are the priority areas for you?\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 The COVID experience, which has been enormously stressful and in many ways scarring for all of us, if there was a silver lining to it, it actually also showed what friendships and relationships across the world could do.\u00a0 So again, when we speak about you discovered the world, you made friends, you went abroad, a lot of that is personal when you begin out.\u00a0 They can make a huge difference for your country or, frankly, for the world when you start doing it as a policy or as a \u2013 as part of your work.\nNow, the case of the COVID, we actually have three vaccines in India which we are producing which are a direct outcome of our relationship with the United States \u2013 the Novovax, the Corbevax, and the Janssen.\u00a0 The \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t, again, just the vaccines.\u00a0 In fact, during that period, I must share with you a episode when we \u2013 everybody was \u2013 everybody who could make vaccines was busy making vaccines, so it then became difficult to get the supply chain going because it would tend to get disproportionately kind of sucked in by \u2013 in some places.\nAnd I remember at that time reaching out to Tony Blinken and coming here and sharing with him what were all the things we needed in India so that the supply chains which are coming out of the United States would function smoothly and allow for the vaccines to be made.\u00a0 And really, I counted as one of the great achievements in that year that we could actually scale up vaccine production in that way, and it wouldn\u2019t have happened if we had not known.\u00a0 And I will say, I mean, at the risk of embarrassing him, that he really went out of his way to move the American system and get things done.\nNow, last year \u2013 some of you would remember last summer \u2013 in India we went through a very severe, severe wave of COVID due to the Delta wave.\u00a0 And the Delta wave attacked the respiratory system in a much more aggressive fashion, so we had enormous demand for oxygen, for respirators, for certain drugs which were particularly effective for Delta treatment.\u00a0 And there again, I mean, a lot of countries came forward, but I would say the country which really stood out there was the United States.\nSo the point I am making is, I mean, you can look at it from many angles. \u00a0Okay. \u00a0When I look at students coming here, right, I\u2019ve heard, for example, to the focus on STEM.\u00a0 Now, when students come here, they become part of a research community.\u00a0 A lot of it gets into breakthroughs and innovations in various fields.\u00a0 It ends up as inventions, as contributions which affect daily life, especially in a crisis situation like this.\u00a0 So you can see what\u2019s an ordinary person\u2019s normal activity which suddenly translates cumulatively into something very big for countries.\u00a0 And how to actually make that unfold, a lot of that depends on the comfort levels we have, the relationships we\u2019ve built.\nAnd today, I think a part of the very strong trust and bonding between our two countries is this human element that I spoke to in my remarks, the fact that four and a half million Indian diaspora lives here, that people travel back and forth, that there \u2013 and often there are students and professionals who have spent time here and gone back to India.\u00a0 And again, on our side, I mean, we would like, for example, to see many more American students come and study in India, many more American businesses come there, more tourists come there.\u00a0 Because all of this in some way adds to the real sort of, I would say, chemistry and \u2013 between our countries.\nSo the COVID\u2019s really been, to me, very instructive \u2013 what relationships can mean, how they can really deliver at a time of need.\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Thank you so much, and thank you for that question.\u00a0 I\u2019d now like to call on Savon Jackson.\u00a0 He is the program manager for the Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Program here at Howard.\u00a0 He has a question for the Secretary.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So my question is:\u00a0 So while programs like the Fulbright and Gilman scholarships have been great entry points for individuals like myself to learn about India, how else can the U.S. and India partner to encourage more American students to pursue studies within India?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And first of all, congratulations on what you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019ve achieved.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great thing.\u00a0 And I should really probably turn that over to Assistant Secretary Satterfield, because this is exactly the focus of her activities.\nBut we are looking across all different pursuits how we can find ways to connect our countries, including through exchange programs, through fellowship programs, through academic programs, to make that easier and to try to open minds to the prospect of the possibility of doing that.\u00a0 I think you heard very eloquently from Foreign Minister Jaishankar why that matters and why that makes such a difference.\nI would just say from my own experience \u2013 and I said this before, and this is one of the things that we\u2019re going to spend some time talking about over the next few years \u2013 if we can find more ways to give people the opportunity to experience the rest of the world, and especially one of the most vibrant, vital partners and, of course, democracies in the world like India, that\u2019s ultimately going to redound to, I think, the personal benefit of the people who have that experience, but honestly, it\u2019s going to redound to the benefit of our country as a whole.\u00a0 And I want to make sure that we\u2019re doing a good job both in getting that message out but also in finding ways to support it.\nSo the assistant secretary runs an extraordinary part of the State Department that\u2019s responsible for building exactly these kinds of programs. \u00a0And so one of the things we\u2019re doing, especially as we emerge from COVID, is finding ways to further revitalize, re-energize, and carry forward all these programs.\nNow, one of the things that\u2019s really helpful is actually when we get good ideas, because we don\u2019t have a monopoly on ideas, never mind good ideas.\u00a0 So there may be things that are missing that people identify as, well, here is an area where we really could pursue an interesting exchange, and then we need to know that.\u00a0 We need to get your input.\u00a0 We need to get your ideas, your thoughts.\u00a0 And some of that is going to just come from your own experience, from what you\u2019re hearing from your friends and fellow students, and we want to find ways to bring that to the department to try to explore that.\nSo we\u2019ve got, Lee, I don\u2019t know how many different ongoing things that we\u2019re doing, but a lot, but we\u2019re trying to build on them.\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Hundreds.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Hundreds literally.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo here\u2019s one of the interesting things too, and I\u2019ve said this a lot and it goes both ways.\u00a0 One of the extraordinary things about the exchange programs that we have when we bring, for example, young Indians to the United States, but also from countries around the world, is we\u2019ve been pretty good over the years in identifying the rising generation of people.\u00a0 And when we\u2019ve gone back and looked at the numbers \u2013 and these numbers are a little out of date, but for people participating in our exchange programs over the years coming from other countries, usually at a young age, they went \u2013 they would then eventually go back home, and of those over the many years we\u2019ve had more than 50 who went on to win Nobel Prizes; more than 350 who went on to become the leaders, the presidents, the prime ministers of their countries; thousands who went on to lead companies, academic institutions, become prominent in culture and the arts.\u00a0 And I think the same thing is also true, I suspect, of the many people that we \u2013 many Americans that we send to engage in these programs.\nAnd then what happens is, is it builds connections between our people and our countries that outlast any particular government or administration and that build a lasting foundation for our countries to come together.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is this, and here\u2019s the way we look at it, and again, it\u2019s why I think this foundation is so important.\u00a0 When we\u2019re thinking about the problems that we have to try to tackle that are actually affecting the lives of virtually every American in one way or another, the first realization you come to is that we simply can\u2019t effectively deal with these problems alone, that we need to be working in collaboration, in cooperation, in coordination with other countries.\nClimate:\u00a0 We are 15 percent of global emissions.\u00a0 We also have a long historic legacy of having built up emissions, but we\u2019re 15 percent.\u00a0 Even if we do everything right at home, that still leaves 85 percent of emissions from other parts of the world.\u00a0 So we have a strong interest in trying to find ways to work cooperatively as well as to help countries that need the support to adapt, to build resilience, as they\u2019re making their own transitions.\nAnd COVID, where this part \u2013 the work that we\u2019ve done together, it hasn\u2019t simply been to the benefit of both of our countries.\u00a0 It has increasingly been to the benefit of countries throughout the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.\u00a0 The Quad partnership that we put together: 500 million vaccines being donated, distributed, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 But on COVID, if we\u2019re not working together with other countries \u2013 again, even if we did everything right at home, if there is another \u2013 if the virus keeps percolating out there somewhere and new variants develop, one of those variants may come back and bite us.\u00a0 So we have a strong interest in it, but we can\u2019t do it without this collaboration.\u00a0 This is a powerful thing that we did.\u00a0 We had the United States, India, Japan, Australia come together and say we\u2019re going to take pieces of this together, we\u2019re going to manufacture, we\u2019re going to help finance, we\u2019re going to help distribute, and we\u2019re going to get vaccines to people.\nAnd then finally, on all of the emerging technologies, which is something that the United States and India have to work on together, we have to do everything we can to try to shape the rules and the norms and the standards by which these technologies are used because, maybe more than anything else, these phones in our pockets shape our lives \u2013 in good ways and sometimes in bad ways.\nI say all of that because, again, it starts \u2013 our ability to do that starts with you.\u00a0 It starts with these exchange programs.\u00a0 It starts with building these connections, building these relationships, building these friendships, building this appreciation for different countries and cultures.\u00a0 If we get that right, then I\u2019m convinced that no matter what you do in your career or your lives, in some way it\u2019s going to be beneficial not just to you but to the relationship between our countries, relationships that are more necessary than ever if we\u2019re really going to meet the problems that all of our countries face, and maybe find some real opportunity in them too.\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 And you\u2019ll be glad to know, to your point about where good ideas are generated, already some students and members of the faculty here at Howard have already approached me with ideas about more exchanges that we can do and ideas that they have that they\u2019ve already shared with me.\u00a0 So thank you for that.\nAnd the Secretary has also made it a priority for my bureau to make it possible for more Americans to participate in study abroad and programs like that you\u2019ve had the experience to do.\u00a0 So to that point, it\u2019s through strategic partnerships with Howard University and others all across the country, and he\u2019s asked us to look at creating more of those around the United States.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And Lee, can I just say \u2013 because I really \u2013 this is so important to those of you who have done this, who participate in it.\u00a0 President Biden likes to say \u2013 I\u2019ve often heard him say this \u2013 don\u2019t just keep the faith, spread the faith.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So if you\u2019ve done it, if you know it, if it\u2019s been a good experience for you, share that \u2014\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Exactly.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 \u2014 with your friends.\u00a0 Share that with your fellow students.\u00a0 Open their eyes, open their minds, to that possibility.\u00a0 And that, more than anything else, is also what\u2019s going to encourage people to take that chance, take that opportunity.\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Absolutely.\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 By the way, I must tell you.\u00a0 You know Prime Minister Modi was one of those who came on an exchange \u2014\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Yes, on an exchange program.\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 IVLP.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So we were pretty good.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So next I\u2019d like to ask Lyndsie Whitehead.\u00a0 She\u2019s a Presidential Award of Service recipient and a globally-minded educator.\u00a0 She has the next question for the minister.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you both so much for such a robust conversation today.\u00a0 My question is as follows: \u00a0India has announced the new National Education Policy 2020.\u00a0 How do you intend to attract U.S. students to the study in \u2013 to study in India and also to participate in the Study in India program?\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Well, the Study in India program has been there for some time.\u00a0 The education policy came into being in 2020.\u00a0 Of course, after that we had the COVID.\u00a0 So it\u2019s interesting it\u2019s now that we are really focusing on how do we attract more international students and obviously among them more American students.\nIt\u2019s still, quite honestly, work in progress, but the \u2013 what has changed is a much stronger appreciation of the need to have international students.\u00a0 I think the view \u2013 we have long had a tradition, but we haven\u2019t scaled it up the way many countries have.\u00a0 We realize you can\u2019t necessarily leave it to students themselves.\u00a0 There have got to be programs.\u00a0 There have got to be mechanisms, efforts which would actually \u2013 there\u2019s got to be a strong pull factor.\nSo part of what we are hoping to do with the working group that we announced yesterday is to address exactly this problem that we would definitely like to see many more international students.\u00a0 We believe it\u2019s good for our universities.\u00a0 We believe it\u2019s good for our students.\u00a0 And as all of us have clearly recognized today, these exchange programs have a benefit which is way beyond actually the takeaways of the person concerned.\u00a0 The consequence is huge.\nSo in different ways we would try to encourage.\u00a0 It could be short-term exchanges.\u00a0 It could be having students do their degree in India, create fellowships which would facilitate that.\u00a0 So I think there\u2019s a whole sort of menu there in the making, and I hope a lot of what we have done in recent years has been to grow our relationship.\u00a0 And to me the education part of it, particularly the idea of more Americans studying in India, that\u2019s one area where we have not done as well as we would have liked to.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s something \u2013 it\u2019s time to address that more effectively, and I\u2019m very sure that we will do so.\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And Mr. Minister, I will work on that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And unfortunately, we\u2019re out of time.\u00a0 This conversation could go on forever.\u00a0 It\u2019s been so terrific.\u00a0 I want to thank you for your thoughtful questions and thank the Secretary and the minister for their insights and discussion.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a robust discussion.\u00a0 On behalf of our distinguished guests, I want to thank you all for being here.\u00a0 Have a good day.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you all.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-uruguayan-foreign-minister-francisco-bustillo-before-their-meeting/", "title":

to see everyone.\nToday, I once again have the privilege of introducing and welcoming Secretary Blinken back to this briefing room so that he can mark the release of the 2021 Human Rights Report.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken will have some opening remarks, and then he\u2019ll take a couple of questions.\nAfter that, I will then introduce Lisa Peterson, who\u2019s the acting assistant secretary of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.\u00a0 Acting Assistant Secretary Peterson will have remarks of her own, and then she will stick around for a few more questions, and then we\u2019ll proceed with our regularly scheduled programming.\nSo without further ado, Secretary Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Ned, thank you very much.\u00a0 So we got a full program for you this afternoon.\u00a0 I am very pleased to be here with Acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Lisa Peterson to, indeed, introduce the 2021 Human Rights Report.\nSo this is the second time that I\u2019ve joined the launch of this report as Secretary, because it\u2019s important to U.S. foreign policy; it\u2019s important to this department; it\u2019s important to me personally.\u00a0 For many years running, we have seen an alarming recession of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights in many parts of the world.\u00a0 In the time since releasing our previous report, that backsliding has, unfortunately, continued.\nIn few places have the human consequences of this decline been as stark as they are in the Russian Government\u2019s brutal war on Ukraine.\u00a0 That\u2019s especially true in recent weeks, as Russian forces have been pushed back from towns and cities they occupied or surrounded, and evidence mounts of their widespread atrocities.\u00a0 We see what this receding tide is leaving in its wake \u2013 the bodies, hands bound, left on streets; the theaters, train stations, apartment buildings reduced to rubble with civilians inside.\u00a0 We hear it in the testimonies of women and girls who\u2019ve been raped and the besieged civilians starving and freezing to death.\nIn response, people and governments in every region are voicing their condemnation and calling for those responsible to be held accountable.\u00a0 This global outcry has been clarifying.\u00a0 In its disdain for human life and dignity, the Kremlin has reinvigorated a belief in people worldwide that there are human rights that everyone everywhere should enjoy, and underscored why these rights are worth defending.\nAt the same time, civil society, governments, and people around the world are rightly pointing out that Ukraine is, tragically, far from the only place where gross abuses are being perpetrated.\u00a0 They want the international community to shine a spotlight on human rights abuses wherever they\u2019re being committed and to bring the same urgency to stopping abuses and holding perpetrators accountable.\nThe United States shares that goal.\u00a0 This report is just one of the ways that we\u2019re working to achieve it.\u00a0 It contains individual chapters on nearly 200 countries and territories, each of which offers factual, objective, and thorough accounting of their records on internationally recognized human rights.\u00a0 Whether a country is a friend or one with which we have real differences, the measuring stick we apply is the same.\nThat reflects a core principle of human rights: they\u2019re universal.\u00a0 People of every nationality, race, gender, disability, and age are entitled to these rights no matter what they believe, whom they love, or any other characteristics.\u00a0 This is especially important as a number of governments continue to claim, falsely, that human rights need to be applied based on the local context.\u00a0 Little coincidence that many of the same governments are among the worst abusers of human rights.\nThe universal nature of human rights also means that we have to hold ourselves accountable to the same standards.\u00a0 Even as this report looks outward to countries around the world, we\u2019ve acknowledged from day one of this administration that we have challenges here in the United States.\u00a0 We take seriously our responsibility to address these shortcomings, and we know that the way to do it matters: together with citizens and communities, out in the open, transparently \u2013 not trying to pretend problems don\u2019t exist or sweeping them under a rug.\nAnd in fact, that\u2019s what distinguishes democracies \u2013 our willingness, our commitment to pursue that more perfect union.\u00a0 And practicing what we preach at home gives us greater legitimacy when we encourage governments abroad to do the same thing.\nThe report also shows that the United States is concerned not only with civil and political rights, but also economic, social, cultural rights.\u00a0 That means, for example, affirming that promoting access to education and health services, including for reproductive health, is just as critical to advancing human rights as defending freedom of expression and assembly.\nThese interconnected rights are critical to ensuring individuals can reach their full potential, and they\u2019re critical to sustaining healthy democracies.\nSo with that context, let me highlight some of the most alarming findings of the report, which I want to emphasize covers the events of 2021.\nGovernments are growing more brazen in reaching across borders to threaten and attack critics.\u00a0 To give just a few examples, over the last year alone, Iranian intelligence agents plotted to kidnap an Iranian American journalist from her home in Brooklyn; the Assad regime threatened Syrians who were cooperating with efforts in Germany\u2019s courts to prosecute former officials for atrocities; the Lukashenka regime in Belarus forcibly diverted an international commercial flight to arrest an independent journalist.\nGovernments are locking up more critics at home.\u00a0 Today, more than a million political prisoners are being held in over 65 countries.\u00a0 They include more than 600 people unjustly imprisoned in Cuba for taking part in peaceful protests last July; countless Russian anti-corruption activists and opposition leaders, including Aleksey Navalny; opposition presidential candidates in Benin; and Egyptian advocates like human rights lawyer Mohamed El-Baqer.\nWe\u2019ve also seen a rise in governments arbitrarily detaining individuals to try to gain leverage in bilateral relationships, to use them as human pawns.\nThe Chinese Government continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, among other minority groups, to erode fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong, and to carry out systematic repression in Tibet.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban\u2019s takeover precipitated a humanitarian crisis, and has resulted in serious erosion of human rights, from arbitrary detentions of women, protesters, and journalists, to reprisals against security forces for the former government, to growing restrictions on where women and girls can study or work.\nIn Ethiopia, all parties to the country\u2019s conflict, as well as Eritrean forces, have committed atrocities, and thousands of Ethiopians are being unjustly detained in life-threatening conditions.\nWe invest so much effort into documenting these and other abuses year after year, not only because it aligns our most sacred values, but also because respect for human rights is a fundamental part of upholding the international rules-based order, which is crucial to America\u2019s enduring security and prosperity.\u00a0 Governments that violate human rights are almost always the same ones that flout other key parts of that order, just as \u2013 such as invading, coercing, or threatening trade rules \u2013 excuse me \u2013 threatening other countries or breaking trade rules.\u00a0 So our interest in standing up for human rights isn\u2019t only principled; it is vital to our national security.\nHere are some of the other ways that we\u2019re working to support human rights.\u00a0 When senior members of the State Department travel abroad, we meet with human rights advocates, with journalists, and other frontline defenders, as do our ambassadors at every post, even when foreign governments make it clear that they wish we would not.\nWe work with the Treasury Department to apply sanctions and impose visa restrictions on human rights abusers and those who enable and profit from them through the Global Magnitsky Act, the Khashoggi Ban, and other tools.\nWe methodically collect, preserve, and analyze evidence of atrocities and make this information available to the appropriate bodies.\u00a0 Indeed, it was the department\u2019s rigorous documentation, which included our own fact finding and reports by a range of independent, impartial sources, including human rights organizations, that provided a basis for my determination last month that Burma\u2019s military committed genocide and crimes against humanities against Rohingya.\nWe work with business to foster greater respect for human rights, both by encouraging compliance with labor standards and discouraging exports to governments and other entities that may use those goods or services to commit abuses.\nWe\u2019re fully engaged in multilateral institutions, even flawed ones.\u00a0 After regaining a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, we just led a successful effort to suspend Russia from that body, because a country that\u2019s perpetrating gross and systematic violations of human rights shouldn\u2019t sit on a body whose job it is to protect those rights.\nAnd we\u2019re working to strengthen democracy, human rights, and the fight against corruption through the Summit for Democracy.\u00a0 Last December, President Biden convened 100 world leaders, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector, for the first summit.\u00a0 That kicked off a year of action that we\u2019re in the midst of pursuing.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on delivering progress, not just pronouncements, by encouraging countries to make concrete commitments to advance human rights and democracy.\u00a0 And we\u2019re holding one another to our pledges.\nBefore turning to questions, let me just thank everyone who\u2019s had a hand in producing this report.\u00a0 This is an enterprise that cuts across the entire State Department.\u00a0 We have local staff and career officers in posts around the world as well as here in Washington whose determination and rigor are shining a bright light on these issues every single day, and the brave human rights defenders, journalists, and others documenting those abuses from up close, frequently at grave risk to themselves and their loved ones.\u00a0 This is your report too, and we thank you for it.\nSo we\u2019re approaching the 15-month mark since this administration took office.\u00a0 We still don\u2019t have a confirmed assistant secretary for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.\u00a0 Outstanding career officers have stepped up to lead a devoted DRL team that carries this mission forward, and I want to thank you, Lisa, in particular for exceptional service and stewardship at this time.\nBut for the United States to be the best possible advocate of human rights and democracy worldwide, we need a Senate-confirmed assistant secretary.\u00a0 We have a highly qualified nominee for this position, Sarah Margon.\u00a0 I urge the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to allow her nomination to move forward soon.\nWith that, I\u2019m happy to start taking some questions, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Lisa.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Missy.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Well, (inaudible) again.\u00a0 Could you talk about how you think about the tension between the desire to elevate human rights as part of American foreign policy and the desire to halt this recession that you mentioned with the need to shore up alliances that are seen as crucial to American interests with some countries that have problematic human rights records?\u00a0 I\u2019m thinking of Egypt and its relationship with Palestinian authorities, or Saudi Arabia and its oil supplies.\u00a0 How do you think about that tension?\u00a0 And how do you respond to the criticism that the United States is implicitly condoning abuses by those governments?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So this not a new tension.\u00a0 In some ways, it\u2019s an age-old one.\u00a0 And administrations that in the past and now ours that are putting human rights and democracy front and center in their foreign policy have to confront it, and we work through it every single day.\u00a0 It\u2019s different from country to country, partner to partner, circumstance to circumstance.\nBut I think what we\u2019re doing is to just be very forthright in what we stand for, what we look for, and we try to work with countries to make progress.\u00a0 And again, this varies from place to place, but we\u2019re not holding back in what we\u2019re saying.\u00a0 We\u2019re not holding back in what we\u2019re trying to do, but we also are looking carefully to determine how we think we can be most effective in advancing the ball.\u00a0 And whether that is focusing in public on some of the concerns, shortcomings, problems that we\u2019re seeing, whether that\u2019s pushing people in private, we have to make that judgment in each and every case.\nHaving said that, this report, a public report, is very clear about the issues, challenges, concerns we have across the world with nearly 200 countries.\u00a0 And as I said before, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between friend and foe.\u00a0 We apply the same standard everywhere.\u00a0 We do it publicly as in this report.\u00a0 We do it publicly often when I have an opportunity to speak, including in the countries that we\u2019re visiting where we have concerns.\nBut again, part of this is making determinations on how we think we can be most effective.\u00a0 And in most cases, this is a process.\u00a0 It\u2019s not flipping a switch.\u00a0 We don\u2019t expect that things will change from one day to the other.\u00a0 It\u2019s the result of sustained engagement and trying to move partners along.\nFinally, I\u2019d just say that I think we have in a way added credibility, precisely because when it comes to our own shortcomings at home we\u2019re not dodging them, we\u2019re not ignoring them, we\u2019re not denying them.\u00a0 We\u2019re confronting them directly, and in so doing we strengthen our position, we strengthen our voice in advancing rights.\u00a0 But again, this is a process.\u00a0 It\u2019s not something that happens from one day to the next.\u00a0 We\u2019re engaged in it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see where we are over the coming years and the progress that we make in individual places..\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Francesco.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, you were mentioning the situation in Ukraine.\u00a0 Have you made an assessment of any alleged use of chemical agents or weapons in Ukraine?\u00a0 And how credible would you say the reports coming from the Mariupol area are, or do you have any intelligence about an imminent use of chemical weapons?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So when it comes to the reports you\u2019re referring to, we\u2019re not in a position to confirm anything.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think the Ukrainians are either.\u00a0 But let me say this:\u00a0 We had credible information that Russian forces may use a variety of riot-control agents, including tear gas, mixed with chemical agents, that would cause stronger symptoms to weaken and incapacitate entrenched Ukrainian fighters and civilians as part of the aggressive campaign to take Mariupol.\u00a0 We shared that information with Ukraine as well as with other partners, and we\u2019re in direct conversation with partners to try to determine what actually has happened.\nSo this is a real concern.\u00a0 It\u2019s a concern that we had from before the aggression started.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ve pointed to the possibility that these kinds of weapons would be used, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re very, very focused on.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Lisa, over to you.\u00a0 Thanks, folks.\u00a0 See you later.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Thomas Jefferson Room", "date": "April 12, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 I am very pleased for this opportunity to meet with the High Commissioner for Refugees at the UN Filippo Grandi.\u00a0 It\u2019s safe to say that this is a time of extraordinary challenge for everything that you\u2019re doing and everything that we\u2019re so indebted to you and your team for doing.\nI believe, as you said, the number of displaced people around the world now is somewhere in the vicinity of 95 million people.\u00a0 And within that huge number of refugees, I think if you added up all of the refugees and tried to put them in one country, it would be larger than the population of Spain, South Korea, any number of countries.\u00a0 This is a challenge that has been with us for well over the past decade.\u00a0 When I was last in government, we were dealing with particularly acute challenges \u2013 of course, Syria, Iraq, but also in many other parts of the world from Africa to Southeast Asia to our own hemisphere.\nWe\u2019ve only seen that challenge increase, and of course, Ukraine has now added to the mix with Russian aggression displacing within Ukraine or outside of Ukraine two thirds of the children in that country, as well as of, course, many, many adults.\nSo we are simply grateful for the work that you\u2019re doing every single day to try to meet the needs of those who have been forced in one way or another from their homes.\nThe partnership that we have between the United States and UNHCR, working together to find ways to resettle people, to care for them, and I think as well the work that we need to do together not only to resettle, ultimately end conflicts so that people can go home, but also to find more effective ways in helping those communities support the refugees that are with them.\nSo in all of these ways, there is a lot of work to be done, a lot of work we\u2019re doing every single day between us.\u00a0 But mostly this is an opportunity as well just to say thank you, because what you\u2019re doing is an invaluable service to humanity at a time when it\u2019s more needed than ever.\u00a0 So welcome.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, how will the U.S. expedite getting Ukrainians \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Please.\nMR GRANDI:\u00a0 Bear with me, just a few words also on my side to thank Secretary Blinken and his colleagues for welcoming us here at the State Department.\u00a0 And I just want \u2013 he said it all, really.\u00a0 I just want to add, this figure that he mentioned, 95 million \u2013 maybe 96 by the way, who knows \u2013 has gone up by 12 million in less than two months with the crisis in Ukraine, with the Russian offensive against Ukraine and the flight of so many people.\u00a0 So that will be a priority for us to discuss and already I\u2019ve been here a couple of days in Washington and had very good discussions on how to respond to this crisis both in neighboring countries and inside Ukraine.\nBut then, of course, an important message that I\u2019m sure everybody will agree here around the table is that that crisis should not make us forget everything else.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been dealing intensely together with the Afghanistan situation for the past few months, but there are many, unfortunately many, crises in Africa, in the Western Hemisphere, that involve a huge displacement component, and therefore I look forward to continuing our cooperation.\nThe United States is UNHCR\u2019s by far largest donor.\u00a0 It is the largest resettlement country and with our partnership with the United States in these areas has been extremely strong.\u00a0 And I want to take this opportunity to thank this administration.\u00a0 Without the United States, we could not be as effective as you kindly recognized us to be, and we look forward to even strengthening even further this partnership, which is globally and domestically extremely important.\u00a0 So thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-austin-indian-minister-of-external-affairs-dr-s-jaishankar-and-indian-minister-of-defense-rajnath-singh-at-a-joint-press-availability/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

afternoon, everyone.\nForeign Minister Jaishankar, Defense Minister Singh, I am delighted to join my friend Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in welcoming you to Washington, and especially grateful for the chance to return the incredibly warm hospitality that you showed me when I visited New Delhi in July.\nThis meeting today marked the fourth U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue.\u00a0 It built upon the productive meeting last September between president \u2013 between Prime Minister Modi and President Biden as well as the conversation that they had by video today, and on the strong partnership our two countries have developed across nearly 75 years of diplomatic relations.\nAs the world\u2019s largest democracy and oldest democracy, we work together every day to deliver opportunity, security, freedom, and dignity to our peoples.\nWe\u2019re working closely to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\nScientists and institutions across our countries are developing and producing safe and effective\u00a0 COVID-19 vaccines together.\u00a0 We\u2019re working through the Quad Vaccine Partnership, with our colleagues in Australia and Japan, to make these vaccines available throughout the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 As of today, Quad partners have collectively provided more than 500 million vaccine doses; we\u2019re rapidly expanding production to make more at the Biological E facility in India.\nWe\u2019re standing together for our shared commitment to uphold a free, rules-based international order that safeguards sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.\u00a0 Today, we reaffirmed our commitment to promoting regional stability, the rule of law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, and to expanding our strategic partnership with ASEAN.\nRussia\u2019s war against Ukraine is an attack on Ukraine\u2019s people; it\u2019s also an attack on that rules-based order that we both adhere to and defend.\u00a0 The United States will continue to increase our support to the government and people of Ukraine and call on other nations to do the same, just as we call on all nations to condemn Moscow\u2019s increasingly brutal actions.\nRussia\u2019s aggression stands in stark contrast to the vision that the United States and India share for a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And Russia\u2019s actions are having a profound impact not just in Europe and in Ukraine, but around the world \u2013 for example, causing food insecurity and rising prices.\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s farmers have been forced to flee or to fight, as Russian troops intentionally destroy farmland and equipment and prevent Ukraine from exporting their wheat through Black Sea ports.\nOur countries are working together to try to bring more food to world markets, as well as to the World Food Program.\u00a0 And the United States is also focused on securing more funding for the World Food Program and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and producing more fertilizer so that we can help others sustain crop yields in the future.\nWe also discussed our goal of driving inclusive economic growth both for our countries and across the region.\nIndia and the United States already trade to the tune of more than $150 billion each year.\u00a0 But we\u2019re deepening that relationship by restarting the U.S-India Commercial Dialogue and the U.S-India CEO Forum later this year, where our private sector partners can offer recommendations to strengthen even more our trade and investment relationship.\nIn the video meeting that they held earlier today, Prime Minister Modi welcomed President Biden\u2019s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework initiative.\u00a0 It can allow us to increase our collaboration across more issues, including digital trade, supply chain resilience, infrastructure, and tax policy.\nAnd our countries are working together to tackle the climate crisis.\u00a0 The United States is supporting India\u2019s ambitious COP26 clean energy commitments by investing in renewable energy projects and mobilizing private sector financing.\nWe also share a commitment to our democratic values, such as protecting human rights.\u00a0 We regularly engage with our Indian partners on these shared values, and to that end we\u2019re monitoring some recent concerning developments in India, including a rise in human rights abuses by some government, police, and prison officials.\nIn addition to all of these critical issues, I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019re increasing cooperation in a number of other key areas which we focused on today.\nWe\u2019re deepening our defense ties, which I know Secretary Austin will speak to.\nWe\u2019re expanding our cooperation on development around the world \u2013 particularly in Asia and Africa \u2013 by working together to carry out disaster relief, as well as clean energy and climate-smart agricultural projects.\nAnd we\u2019re increasing people-to-people ties, which are really at the heart of the entire relationship.\nWe\u2019re very lucky in the United States to be home to some 4 million Indian Americans, as well as 200,000 Indians studying in our universities.\nWe have a Working Group on Education and Skill Training that we formed today that will increase that number by bringing institutions in the United States and India together to develop new joint research and exchange programs.\u00a0 We look forward to welcoming more Indian students and scholars into our communities.\u00a0 We\u2019re focusing, among other things, on STEM education.\u00a0 I think this is an area of tremendous potential going forward.\nLet me just say in conclusion that very soon after our countries established diplomatic relations some 75 years ago, Prime Minister Nehru came to visit the United States.\u00a0 President Truman met him on the tarmac of the airport.\u00a0 And Prime Minister Nehru noted the importance of the moment, saying, and I quote: \u201cI trust that these two republics of the Western World and the Eastern World will find many ways of working together in friendly and fruitful cooperation to our mutual advantage, and for the good of humanity.\u201d\nSo for nearly 75 years, we\u2019ve done just that.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful to our partners for making it possible for that \u201cfriendly and fruitful cooperation\u201d to continue and to deepen.\nAnd with that, I hand it over to Foreign Minister Jaishankar.\u00a0 Or are we going to Lloyd?\u00a0 Sorry.\u00a0 Let me go to Lloyd first, the Secretary of Defense.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Thanks, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Well, Secretary Blinken, Minister Singh, Minister Jaishankar, it\u2019s great to be here with you for this fourth U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue.\u00a0 As my friend Secretary Blinken has rightly noted, we\u2019re meeting at an important moment in our partnership.\u00a0 It\u2019s been nearly two decades since we signed our first bilateral defense framework, and our partnership has grown immensely ever since.\nToday\u2019s meeting shows that we\u2019re working together to build one of the most consequential partnerships of our time.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made important commitments today that will drive technological innovation and cooperation in emerging defense domains, including space and cyberspace.\u00a0 For example, we\u2019re committed to launching new defense base exchanges later this year between our Space Command and India\u2019s Defense Space Agency.\u00a0 And I\u2019m pleased to announce that just a few moments ago, we signed a bilateral Space Situational Awareness arrangement, and this will support greater information sharing and cooperation in space.\nWe\u2019re also deepening our cooperation in cyberspace, including through training and exercises later this year.\u00a0 And we\u2019re expanding our information-sharing partnership across all warfighting domains.\u00a0 And meanwhile, our defense trade and technology cooperation continues to grow.\u00a0 We recently concluded an agreement to work together on air-launched unmanned aerial vehicles through our Defense Technology and Trade Initiative.\u00a0 And today we agreed to launch new supply chain cooperation measures that will let us more swiftly support each other\u2019s priority defense requirements.\u00a0 India continues to acquire key U.S. defense platforms, and that is forging important and new ties between our defense industrial bases.\nWe\u2019re doing all this because the United States supports India as a defense industry leader in the Indo-Pacific and a net provider of security in the region.\u00a0 And we all understand the challenges that we face there.\u00a0 The People\u2019s Republic of China is seeking to refashion the region and the international system more broadly in ways that serve its interests.\u00a0 And so I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019ve identified new opportunities to extend the operational reach of our militaries and to coordinate more closely together across the expanse of the Indo-Pacific.\nWe welcome the Indian navy\u2019s decision to join the Combined Maritime Forces, Bahrain, and we\u2019ve also committed to more high-end exercises together.\u00a0 Last summer the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group conducted the first-ever combined anti-submarine warfare and air exercise with the Indian navy and air force.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking forward to more of this sort of cooperation as we expand the scope and the complexity of Tiger Triumph, which is our annual major tri-service exercise.\nAnd finally, we made commitments today to reinforce our ties with like-minded countries, including Japan, Australia, and our European allies and partners.\u00a0 Take, for example, the Quad\u2019s newly launched humanitarian assistance and disaster relief mechanism, which will bring together our defense and civil disaster\u00a0\u2013 and civilian disaster relief agencies to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is better prepared for future crises.\nNow, as two of the world\u2019s largest democracies, the United States and India are linked by more than our common interests.\u00a0 We\u2019re bound by our shared values and commitments, including ensuring that the Indo-Pacific stays on a path defined by the rule of law and freedom of the seas and respect for territorial integrity of sovereign states.\nToday\u2019s 2+2 ministerial reflects our deep commitment to maintaining open channels of communication on a range of challenging issues.\u00a0 As strategic threats converge, especially following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it is more important than ever that we stand together to defend our shared values and to preserve the international rules-based order.\nAnd so I believe that the investments that we\u2019ve made together today will help to ensure that our shared vision of a secure, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region thrives in the decades ahead.\u00a0 Ministers, thank you for your partnership and for your leadership as we work together to build that future.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to have you with us\u00a0\u2013 here with us, so thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Now to Minister Singh.\nMINISTER SINGH:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, Dr. Jaishankar-ji, members of press, ladies and gentlemen.\n(Via interpreter) very appreciative of their comments.\u00a0 In the past, it shows that our relationships have expanded in scale, and we have had very meaningful talks this morning.\u00a0 It will help in the momentum and in also expanding and taking it forward.\u00a0 Both of \u2013 both the nations are common and complementary, and we have shared goals which we would like to achieve, and we also have a shared will to achieve it.\nWe have tried to see that we will \u2013 we have talked on very many different aspects, and it\u2019s a very unique thing that as two big democracies of the world, we have had conversation on all the issues and our views converge on each.\u00a0 And we hope to have a free, open, and inclusive rule-based order, which is a common vision that is shared by both our nations.\u00a0 Our partnership is based on Indo-Pacific, and we want to create peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.\nDuring the meeting, we also discussed about our neighbors, and we tried to make sure that our assessment is also shared.\u00a0 During this talk, we have talked about counterterrorism and talk about how this has been used against India.\u00a0 During our comprehensive engagement, we have had very comprehensive results, some of which are as follows, which we\u2019d like to talk:\u00a0 The Department of Space and U.S. Department of Defense have Space Situational Awareness agreement which has been fulfilled.\u00a0 And in the times to come, Defense-Space and Defense artificial intelligence agreement.\u00a0 Third, many other initiatives and agreements which are still in the discussion phase.\u00a0 They have had very good progress, the military scope and also to increase the depth of it, and we have had unanimity on that.\nEven after the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen very big expansion between our military-to-military exercises, and we are happy that the maritime force in Bahrain has been joined as an associated force.\u00a0 This shows that in the western region it will make it more stronger.\u00a0 We are also happy with the COMCASA and BECA implementation, and we are working towards it.\u00a0 In the defense, cyber, and special forces field also, we would like to increase the forces.\u00a0 LEMOA and (inaudible), under these two exercises, we\u2019ve tried to expand the scope of logistics.\nBoth the countries are trying with the closer engagement of the forces.\u00a0 We are fully working technology initiatives also.\u00a0 We want to take speedy decisions and implementation, and for that the processing and procurement review will be done.\u00a0 This is what was decided today.\u00a0 I have talked to American companies for making India an aerospace and (inaudible) program.\u00a0 I have invited them for these programs.\u00a0 We are talking to U.S. companies for co-development and co-production.\u00a0 We\u2019re proposing it to them.\u00a0 We have asked the U.S. companies to work in the UP and Tamil Nadu corridor and invest in that area.\nDuring the hard time of pandemic, the United States have given us a lot of support, and on this occasion, we express our deep appreciation for that, and during this time I would like to thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin and would like to thank them for their leadership.\u00a0 Today\u2019s leadership meeting and the 2+2 meeting shows that we are \u2013 this was an important event to strengthen the relationship between the two nations.\u00a0 And in the areas of mutual interest also, I would like to say that we would support for better \u2013 (inaudible) better contribution.\u00a0 We want that global access should be given, and peace and security should be maintained.\nI would like to once again thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin and would like to thank them for the support in strengthening U.S.-India relationships.\u00a0 I have talked to both the secretaries to \u2013 I have invited them to India for the next 2+2 ministerial dialogue in India.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh-ji, it\u2019s a great pleasure to meet all of you at the conclusion of a productive and substantive 2+2 ministerial today.\u00a0 Earlier in the day, we participated the virtual summit of our leaders, and we also met departmentally.\u00a0 These meetings are taking place at a time when the global order is facing multiple challenges and stresses.\u00a0 Obviously, a good part of my meeting with Secretary Blinken in the morning went to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine that has many ramifications.\u00a0 Even countries far away are worrying about energy security, food security, commodities prices, and logistics disruption.\nNow, this comes on top of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic with which the world has been struggling for the last two years.\u00a0 Quite apart from public health concerns and its economic impact, this has raised awareness about the need for reliable and resilient supply chains.\u00a0 Autonomously, the nature of globalization and the usage of technology has brought to fore concerns of trust and transparency.\nHow to ensure a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific was also on our agenda today.\u00a0 We spoke of developments in and around Afghanistan that have made their ripples felt well beyond.\u00a0 Our conversations also covered recent happenings in the Indian subcontinent.\nStrategic partnerships like those between India and the United States are built through shared interests, common values, and constant nurturing.\u00a0 It is natural that each of us will bring to the relationship our particular perspectives, experiences, and priorities.\u00a0 But when there is a mutual appreciation of the significance of our ties, there is also a desire to better understand each other\u2019s thinking.\u00a0 Our dialogue today, I believe, has helped in that regard.\nThe report card of our bilateral cooperation is an impressive one.\u00a0 Defense minister has already spoken of the great strides made in the field of defense and security.\u00a0 We also partner closely in counterterrorism and maritime security, making the world a much safer place.\u00a0 The integrated perspective that we brought to bear in this 2+2 format only underlines the gains made in different domains in recent times.\nThe economic side of the story is particularly significant.\u00a0 Both trade and investment are steadily growing.\u00a0 We have had discussions today on both of them, as also on connectivity, infrastructure, digital issues, climate action, and energy.\u00a0 Our shared activities in space, science and technology, and health are also noteworthy.\u00a0 We see our cooperation as having a larger relevance of the Indo-Pacific.\nThe bedrock of our relationship, as you would all agree, is its human element.\u00a0 It could be the students who come to universities, the flow of talent that defines our knowledge partnership, or indeed the technology and business relationships which promote innovation.\u00a0 They\u2019re all examples of the human bridge that connects our societies so uniquely.\u00a0 I look forward to highlighting this aspect tomorrow at an event in Howard University, where I would have the pleasure of speaking along with Secretary Blinken.\nIn a changing world, India-U.S. ties have not only kept pace but actually emerged as a major contributor to global peace, stability, and prosperity.\u00a0 This is not just the weight of our expanding partnership but also the impact it makes on addressing global issues.\u00a0 Our vaccine cooperation can enhance its affordability and accessibility.\u00a0 Our B2B and G2G dealings can contribute to better connectivity and reliable supply chains.\u00a0 Our climate collaboration is underlined by the United States joining the International Solar Alliance and co-chairing the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.\nChallenges in the Indo-Pacific have also been a particular focus of our discussions.\u00a0 We appreciate the attention and energy devoted by the United States to the Quad.\u00a0 Its elevation and intensification in the last year benefits the entire Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Indeed, the Quad has emerged as a powerful force of global good.\nSo let me sum up our discussions in three broad points.\u00a0 One, it has helped us today to strategize on mitigating the volatility and unpredictability that the world is currently experiencing.\u00a0 That will be (inaudible) reflected in our policies.\u00a0 Two, it has encouraged us to think together on long-term challenges, especially in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 And three, it has energized our collaborative endeavors to build what is emerging as a key bilateral relationship of our times.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take four questions, alternating two questions per delegation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Rosiland Jordan of Al Jazeera English.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Ministers, Secretaries, thank you.\u00a0 Keeping in\u00a0mind that all four of you have talked about the deep friendship and alliance between the U.S. and India, I have several questions.\nFirst, for Secretary Blinken:\u00a0 Isn\u2019t it problematic that after 48 days of war that India has yet to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion.\u00a0 What more can the U.S. do to persuade India to make what some argue is a symbolic step but still a critical one?\u00a0 And there are a number of reports suggesting that Moscow and Delhi are trying to work out some sort of currency exchange for future energy purchases.\u00a0 Did you tell Secretary Jaishankar that these could risk violations of not just current sanctions but also risk violating CAATSA?\nSecretary Austin, this is a larger policy question.\u00a0 Has the U.S. missed an opportunity in the past 17\u00a0years since the beginning of this strategic partnership to replace Moscow as Delhi\u2019s choice for weapons, for military materiel, not just the training and the robust partnership that we see in the militaries here?\nAnd finally, for the Ministers Jaishankar and Singh, why not condemn Russia\u2019s invasion?\u00a0 Wouldn\u2019t this best reflect India\u2019s foreign policy goals and international standing?\u00a0 And what is the leverage that the Indian Government has to persuade Vladimir Putin that the carnage that we are seeing every day simply must (inaudible) stop, that it\u2019s not helping the Ukrainian people, and that it\u2019s not helping the Russian people?\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 I applaud the multi-part, multi-person question.\nA few things.\u00a0 First, I should note, before getting into the specifics of the question, that Prime Minister Modi and President Biden had a very warm and productive conversation today in their virtual summit.\u00a0 Covered a lot of ground, including some of the things that we mentioned\u00a0\u2013 COVID-19, climate, strengthening the global economy, the free and open Indo-Pacific that we both aspire to.\nOn Russia-Ukraine, they talked about ways of mitigating the profound impact that this is having on global food supplies and prices, commodity markets, and working together to achieve that.\nI would note India has made very strong statements in New York at the UN, the minister, before the Indian parliament, condemning the killing of civilians in Ukraine, calling for an independent investigation of these atrocities.\u00a0 And I would also note that India is providing significant humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine, notably medicines, which are very necessary and in real demand.\nIndia has to make its own decisions about how it approaches this challenge.\u00a0 We as a general proposition are consulting with all of our allies and partners on the consequences of Putin\u2019s war, the atrocities being committed against the people of Ukraine.\u00a0 In our judgment, it is important that all countries, especially those with leverage, press Putin to end the war.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also important that democracies stand together and speak with one voice to defend the values that we share.\u00a0 And we do share, profoundly, the values of freedom, openness, independence, sovereignty, and those values need to apply everywhere.\nIndia\u2019s relationship with Russia has developed over decades at a time when the United States was not able to be a partner to India.\u00a0 Times have changed.\u00a0 Today we are able and willing to be a partner of choice with India across virtually every realm\u00a0\u2013 commerce, technology, education, and security.\u00a0 And that was very much the nature of the conversation that we had today.\nWhen it comes to oil purchases, sanctions, et cetera, I\u2019d just note that there are carveouts for energy purchases.\u00a0 Of course we\u2019re encouraging countries not to purchase additional energy supplies from Russia.\u00a0 Every country is differently situated, has different needs and requirements, but we\u2019re looking to allies and partners not to increase their purchases of Russian energy.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, thanks, Ros.\u00a0 I\u00a0\u2013 regarding missed opportunities, of course, I can\u2019t say much about policy decisions that were made before my time.\u00a0 But what I can tell you is that President Biden truly values strong alliances and partnerships like the one that we have with India.\u00a0 And that\u2019s really what today is all about.\u00a0 It\u2019s about taking a strong relationship and making it even stronger, and working on those things that create interoperability and allow us to work together to promote the things that all of us have talked about.\u00a0 The issue of values is central to our \u2013 this relationship, and we\u2019ll continue to work to strengthen what\u2019s a very strong relationship and so that we don\u2019t miss any opportunities going forward.\u00a0 So thanks.\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 I think I\u2019ll probably answer for both of us.\u00a0 So first of all, thank you for the advice and suggestions in your question.\u00a0 I prefer to do it my way and articulate it my way.\u00a0 Now, as Secretary Blinken has pointed out, we have made a number of statements which outline our position in the UN, in our parliament, and in other forums.\u00a0 And briefly, what those positions state is that we\u2019re against the conflict; we are for dialogue and diplomacy; we are for an urgent cessation of violence; and we are prepared to contribute in multiple ways to these objectives.\nI noticed you refer to oil purchases.\u00a0 If you are looking at energy purchases from Russia, I would suggest that your attention should be focused on Europe, which probably we do buy some energy which is necessary for our energy security.\u00a0 But I suspect, looking at the figures, probably our total purchases for the month would be less than what Europe does in an afternoon.\u00a0 So you might want to think about that.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll turn to Lalit Jha, Press Trust of India.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nDo I need to repeat?\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Mr. Jaishankar, (inaudible).\nMy second question is to Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin.\u00a0 India, being in a tough neighborhood, is seeking to diversify its energy and (inaudible).\u00a0 As Prime Minister Modi says, the final goal is (inaudible), which means \u2013 also means a self-reliant India, and this includes energy independence.\u00a0 U.S. has played a key role in India getting food security through Green Revolution.\u00a0 In that context, my question to both of you is what the United States is offering to help India achieve this goal in the field of both energy and (inaudible).\u00a0 Thank you.\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 So if I could respond to the first question, what are we doing to mitigate volatility and unpredictability that the world is currently experiencing.\u00a0 Well, let me start \u2013 there are a number of things which are happening in the world.\u00a0 Let me start with the Ukraine situation.\nI think part of what we are doing is to press for a cessation of hostilities, which I think everybody would agree would mitigate matters and clearly make the world less unpredictable.\u00a0 We\u2019re also addressing the humanitarian situation.\u00a0 In fact, we have \u2013 the Ukrainians have been in touch with us for \u2013 especially for the supply of medicines.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already provided humanitarian relief to Ukraine, to some of their neighbors, and even as we speak, a shipment of medicines is being delivered or will be delivered very soon to Kyiv.\nWe have discussed the economic consequences as well.\u00a0 I mean, we are looking at it ourselves, but we have discussed it as partners.\u00a0 I think a big concern we have \u2013 and not just we, I think the world has \u2013 is of energy security, of rising prices, of increasing premiums, of limited supplies.\u00a0 So today, you have to understand it is a legitimate concern of countries to ensure their energy security.\u00a0 But an equally big worry which is emerging is of food security.\u00a0 There are concerns across geographies of societies who are importing wheat or sugar or other foodstuff out of the conflict region.\nSo we have discussed today \u2013 not just us, but I think the subject also came up in the virtual summit between Prime Minister Modi and President Biden \u2013 about what could India do to stabilize the global economic situation.\u00a0 And we are quite willing, and in fact we\u2019ve already started responding to the need for greater food supplies, especially wheat most of all but to some degree sugar as well.\u00a0 We have, even as we \u2013 at this moment a number of countries are discussing with us the possibility of greater food supplies, including the World Food Program.\nSo that\u2019s the Ukraine part of the global situation, but that\u2019s not the only problem that we face.\u00a0 I think that COVID has also left us with a lot of uncertainties and a lot of challenges to be addressed.\u00a0 Again, I think part of it is how do you construct more reliable and resilient supply chains, how do you increase trust and transparency, how do we work together on critical and emerging technologies like 5G.\u00a0 And again, we discussed an Indian initiative called performance-linked initiative which would incentivize manufacturing in India, and I think it\u2019s very much in American interest to support it.\u00a0 We also spoke about how we could work together to help with the global health situation.\u00a0 How do we get a shot in every arm?\u00a0 How do we increase the distribution of vaccines?\nAnd the other issue again which has added to global uncertainty is Afghanistan, and how do you stabilize the region, how do you again provide humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 We are, as you know, in the middle of providing 50,000 tons of wheat.\u00a0 How do you deal with the terrorism concerns that the world has in the Security Council, in FATF, et cetera?\u00a0 And I would say in a way, in terms of mitigating and stabilizing, the Quad itself is a great stabilizer.\u00a0 So that too is part of the contribution we are making towards a better world, and making that contribution in large measure through our partnership with the United States.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 You want to start?\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 Yeah, I\u2019m going to start.\u00a0 The question was what are we offering to India in support of its defense security, I think was the question.\nAs you heard in our earlier statements, we\u2019re working closely with India on a range of priorities to support India\u2019s security and its role as a net security provider.\u00a0 It is \u2013 it\u2019s a leader in the region and it actually exports security to the region, and we\u2019re grateful for that.\u00a0 Some of the things that we talked about, as we stated in our opening statements: information sharing, deeper cooperation in space, in cyberspace, liaison exchanges, continuing to work together more frequently and in the \u2013 in exercises but also exercises of increasing complexity.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working with India on a number of things, and we think these things will add tremendous value to the region in terms of security.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And on the last part of the question on energy, first let me say what we\u2019re seeing across the board is that the Russian aggression against Ukraine is having profound impacts not only on the people of Ukraine, the brutalization of the country, but it is having global impacts, including, as we were talking about, on food availability and prices and also on energy.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen significant increases in price there as well.\nOne of the important steps that President Biden took was to proceed with a coordinated release from strategic petroleum reserves that will continue over the next \u2013 for the part of the United States over the next six months to ensure that there is adequate energy on world markets, both to have an impact on availability as well as on price to deal with the disruptions caused by the Russian aggression.\u00a0 I think if that aggression stops, if the conflict stops, it will have a positive impact both on energy availability and prices as well as on food availability and food prices.\nMore broadly, though, India is the third largest consumer of energy in the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big place, a big market.\u00a0 Electricity demand is projected to double by 2030.\u00a0 We\u2019ve dramatically increased our own energy trade with India, diversifying its energy sources.\u00a0 Our energy exports to India now total about $11 billion a year.\u00a0 Ultimately, the most effective way to satisfy this growth, the needs of the Indian people, the Indian economy, is, of course, to honor the climate goals, the ambitious climate goals that India set, including particularly the expansion of renewables.\u00a0 And again, I point you to the very important commitments that Prime Minister Modi made at the COP26.\nWe are committed, for our part, to partnering in India\u2019s clean energy transition, and this needs to be a partnership.\u00a0 We have a responsibility \u2013 a historic responsibility as well as a current responsibility \u2013 in trying to make sure that we\u2019re helping to make available the technology, the financing, the support to help countries make that transition to adapt, to build resilience in dealing with climate change, and making sure that adequate supplies of energy are reaching their people.\nThere is a longstanding Strategic Clean Energy Partnership that is co-led by our Department of Energy and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in India.\u00a0 That is deepening cooperation on energy efficiency and next-generation fuels.\u00a0 And we have the Quad.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got a working group on climate that\u2019s partnering on green shipping corridors and on green technology.\u00a0 Here at the State Department, our own Energy Bureau has done a lot of work, including collaborative studies with Indian researchers on the most economical decarbonization pathways.\nAnd finally, I\u2019d just note our Development Finance Corporation just announced a $500 million loan to First Solar, which will produce solar panel modules in southern India, furthering climate goals, diversifying solar supply chains.\nSo in all these ways and more, we are working both to deal with the impact of the Russian aggression on energy but much more broadly with this combination of helping India meet its energy needs while advancing together the vital climate agenda that we share.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Ryo Nakamura of Nikkei.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much for taking my question.\nTo Secretary Blinken:\u00a0 India plans to deploy S-400 missile defense system.\u00a0 Did you discuss this topic with your Indian counterparts today?\u00a0 Do you rule out the possibility of sanctioning India for its acquisition of S-400?\nAnd to Secretary Austin, India is trying to diversify its procurement of military equipment and weapons by reducing reliance on Russia and purchasing more from other countries, including the United States.\u00a0 I am wondering what steps the Biden administration will take to help India accelerate their diversification effort.\u00a0 Is it an option for the United States to provide financial assistance to India to make U.S. systems more affordable?\nTo Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar:\u00a0 Russia has more and more aligned with China diplomatically, economically, and militarily.\u00a0 How much are you concerned about their alignment in terms of India\u2019s national security?\u00a0 With that concern, do you think India has to reduce reliance on Russia economically and militarily as soon as possible?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 So let me start by saying that we continue to urge all countries to avoid major new transactions for Russian weapons systems, particularly in light of what Russia is doing to Ukraine.\u00a0 We have not yet made a determination regarding potential sanctions or potential waivers under the CAATSA law.\nBut to come back to something I said a few moments ago, there is, of course, a long history and a long relationship between India and Russia, including when it comes to military equipment.\u00a0 That relationship took hold many years ago at a time when, as I said, we were not able to be a partner to India.\u00a0 And again, as I said, we are now both able and willing to be such a partner, to be a security partner of choice for India.\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the areas that we discussed in some detail today.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 On the issue of future systems, we are engaged in active discussions with India on how to best support their modernization needs.\u00a0 And again, as we look at the future, we want to make sure that we maintain the ability to operate together, and so we look forward to those continued discussions.\u00a0 And it also includes a range of options that would make our systems more affordable.\u00a0 So this is work that will continue going forward, and again, look forward to continuing to have them as a strong and reliable partner.\nMINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 This seems to be my day to get a lot of advice and suggestions from the press, so thank you for joining that.\u00a0 But look, we watch what\u2019s happening in the world, like any country does, and we draw our conclusions and make our assessments.\u00a0 And believe me, we have a decent sense of what is in our interest and know how to protect it and advance it.\u00a0 So I think part of what has changed is we have more options than we did before.\nHave a look at us today.\u00a0 We are standing here for a 2+2 with a substantial defense collaboration which has happened in the last decade, which we have been discussing how to take forward.\u00a0 And this wasn\u2019t an option which was there for 40 years before that.\u00a0 So the world is changing.\u00a0 The world will keep changing.\u00a0 What we have to do in our profession is to watch it and see how your interests are best advanced in that.\nAnd I just want to pick up on our \u2013 on the last \u2013 not this question but the previous question which Secretary Blinken answered on the energy side, which is given our energy security concerns \u2013 again, I don\u2019t want this whole subject to go off at a \u2013 on a sort of a political note.\u00a0 Every country looks at its best options, and I think today an expanding India-U.S. energy relationship, which by the way didn\u2019t exist some years ago \u2013 if my memory is right, you are the second-largest LNG supplier to India, I think the fourth or the fifth largest crude oil supplier, a big partner in the renewable side, including the agreement which Secretary Blinken just mentioned.\nSo we have \u2013 there is so much more going on in the world today, and a large part of it is really to fully explore the opportunities between India and the United States.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Pranay Upadhyay, ABP News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hello, ministers.\u00a0 My first question is direct to the defense ministers.\u00a0 (In Indian) major defense partnership agreement signed (In Indian).\n(Via interpreter) My first \u2013 after signing the agreement, what is the roadmap and what is the conversation you have had?\u00a0 And from today\u2019s (inaudible), how can the \u2013 security can be established by India and (inaudible)?\n(In English) And my question to Secretary Austin:\u00a0 In the recent past, we have seen that the U.S. military supply to countries like Pakistan has been used against Indian interest.\u00a0 So when you say that U.S. is ready to forge greater defense cooperation with India, how have you assured India for the greater solidarity and safeguarding the Indian interest?\u00a0 And which are the critical and emerging technologies U.S. is ready to offer India to strengthen the India\u2019s defense and security interest?\nAnd to Secretary Austin, India\u2019s neighborhood right now is going through a deep economic distress, especially in countries like Sri Lanka and other region \u2013 other small countries in South Asia.\u00a0 How U.S. is trying to cooperate with India to have a greater stability in the region as far as the economic stability for \u2013 in the post-COVID world?\nMINISTER SINGH:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) I\u2019m going to reply to this, and as you said, right now, that relationship between U.S. and India, I would like to say that there is a strategic relationship between the two countries and they are strategic partners.\u00a0 And I have insisted that India would focus on co-development of productions and all the investors should come to India.\u00a0 They are welcome.\u00a0 And because in India, they can develop the \u201cMake in India\u201d because we want to build and make everything in India.\nSECRETARY AUSTIN:\u00a0 We\u2019re proud of the fact that today, India has in its inventory a number of platforms that have \u2013 we believe and I think my colleagues would affirm \u2013 that have performed very, very reliably.\u00a0 And so today, what we talked about was how we\u2019re going to increase our sharing of information, how we\u2019re going to deepen our cooperation in space and cyberspace.\u00a0 And again, I think space and cyberspace are two warfighting domains that we want to make sure we continue to develop our own capabilities, but also help our partners to develop capabilities.\nAnd I think those are the types of things that I think will cause us to be dominant in any battlespace, so we really look forward to developing this relationship a lot more and also continuing to work on \u2013 together with our counterparts here, our colleagues, in high-end, complex operations.\u00a0 And that\u2019s how really you strengthen that trust and then \u2013 and build on capability.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And just on the challenges facing the region, this was very much a subject of our conversations today and an ongoing conversation.\u00a0 Let me say a couple things about that.\nFirst, we are trying to deal together with a number of the immediate crises that countries are facing around the world, but including in the Indo-Pacific, including some of India\u2019s closest neighbors.\u00a0 When it comes to COVID-19, we\u2019ve been working through the Quad partnership to effectively deliver hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine.\u00a0 We\u2019re now deepening our work to make sure that we\u2019re getting shots into arms, that we\u2019re supporting health care workers, and that we are building strong supply chains both for the immediate challenge and going forward.\nSimilarly \u2013 we talked about this earlier \u2013 we\u2019re very focused on the impact that the Russian aggression in Ukraine is having on food prices and food availability, and that affects countries in the region as well.\u00a0 India is looking \u2013 taking steps and looking at additional steps when it comes to making food stocks more widely available.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing the same.\u00a0 We\u2019re increasing financing to the World Food Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at what we can do to incentivize the increased production of fertilizers so that even as we get beyond this year\u2019s crops, as people are thinking about next year\u2019s, yields can be sustained and won\u2019t decrease, which would further interrupt supply and raise prices.\u00a0 So in all these areas, we\u2019re collaborating together; similarly on energy, as we just discussed.\nMore broadly, one of the things that we\u2019re talking about is an initiative that President Biden will launch in the weeks ahead, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 And there, working together with countries in the region, we can have a very positive effect and very positive impact on things like building supply chain resilience in ways that actually benefit the economies of countries in the region; on infrastructure investment, which is so needed and so critical, where India and the United States can work together; on making available green technology as part of that effort; building out global health security and the necessary infrastructure that goes with that; working together on digital trade, which is increasingly a part of the lives of people in all of our countries and has tremendous potential, including in a number of these neighboring countries.\nSo in all these ways and more, we are working not only individually, but increasingly we\u2019re working together to make sure that some of the benefits of the changing economy can be brought to these countries as well as helping them to deal with many of the challenges that we\u2019re facing.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\u00a0 This concludes the press availability.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":
