We have fought side by side on numerous battlefields because our way of life, our deeply held beliefs, and our democratic values were threatened.\n(In English) And most recently we\u2019ve decided, again, to stand together to help our Ukrainian friends defend themselves against the aggression of their neighbor.\u00a0 Vladimir Putin has demonstrated time and again that he will stop at nothing to consolidate his power and continue his war of aggression.\u00a0 As the fight continues, we must maintain or resolve to keep Ukrainians safe, armed, and \u2013 as winter approaches \u2013 warm.\n(In French via interpreter) Secretary Blinken and I also discussed the situation in Haiti.\u00a0 This is a thing we are very concerned about.\u00a0 We recently discussed the crises that Haiti is facing at the Summit of the OAS, and we\u2019ve worked together to deliver vehicles purchased by the Haitian Government for their police force.\u00a0 We currently have a team of Canadian officials on the ground in Haiti that are assessing the humanitarian security crisis and finding ways to resolve it.\u00a0 In the immediate term, we must see a humanitarian truce to restore the supply of fuel, water, and food.\u00a0 This will allow the Haitian people to meet their basic needs and allow hospitals to respond to the ongoing cholera outbreak.\nIt was also critical that we sanction that gangs that are fueling the violence on the island, and we both welcome the steps taken by the UN Security Council to impose sanctions.\u00a0 We must keep the pressure on.\u00a0 Canada will continue to monitor the situation closely, and we will help where we can and try to support Haitian led solutions.\n(In English) We had an opportunity to discuss the ongoing situation in Iran.\u00a0 Canada salutes all Iranian who are fighting against tyranny, and we stand with the women and girls who are bravely defying the regime.\u00a0 The message is simple: women rights are human rights.\u00a0 We have a moral obligation to support the brave women of Iran and hold those persecuting them accountable.\nSecretary Blinken and I also discussed our efforts to strengthen international peace and security, including through deepened engagement in the Indo\u2011Pacific region.\u00a0 The United States and Canada are indeed Pacific nations, but we are both connected to our Pacific partners through more than just our shared coastline.\u00a0 We are joined through deep people\u2011to\u2011people ties and a vision for a free, open, and inclusive Indo\u2011Pacific.\u00a0 We both believe in deepening our diplomatic and economic ties as well as strengthening the resiliency of our global supply chain.\nToday, we agreed to hold the first Canada-U.S. Strategic Dialogue on the Indo-Pacific to further align our approaches.\u00a0 And to further economic cooperation in the region, I am pleased to announce that Canada will seek membership to the Indo\u2011Pacific Economic Framework which is commonly known as IPEF.\nSecretary Blinken and I discussed the topic of Arctic security.\u00a0 As regimes with expansionist ambitions with little regard for the rules that govern international behavior are turning their eyes towards the north, we have a responsibility to ramp up our Arctic engagement.\u00a0 Of course, we welcome the United States\u2019 recent Arctic strategy, and I am glad to announce that Canada will host the next round of the Canada-U.S. Arctic Dialogue.\u00a0 There we will advance long term planning to deepen our already strong collaboration in the region.\n(In French via interpreter) The Arctic is undoubtedly the next big geopolitical issue, and Canada intends to be a leader on this issue.\u00a0 This is something we are doing for our security and to fight climate change, as well as to defend the rules that govern our states.\n(In English.) This week marks my first year as foreign minister of Canada.\u00a0 I had to hit the ground running.\u00a0 I would say sprinting.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sprinting.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Sprinting really.\u00a0 In that time we have the chance \u2013 we had the chance to see each other in Washington obviously, but at NATO, at the G7, at the G20, at the OAS, at the UN \u2013 basically around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to have you here.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Merci beaucoup.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0M\u00e9lanie, thank you so much for the incredibly warm reception, the wonderful hospitality, and also \u2013 and maybe most importantly \u2013 the very productive and important conversation that we had with our teams just a short while ago.\u00a0 And that will continue over the next couple of days.\n(In French via interpreter) I\u2019m really delighted to be in Canada.\n(In English) This is actually, I mentioned, my second visit to Canada in this capacity. The first one was a virtual visit in February of our first year.\u00a0 But as I\u2019ve said, nothing can substitute for actually being here in person.\nAs the foreign minister said, we were together in Washington just a few weeks ago.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been together in places all around the world, and I think it speaks \u2013 our own collaboration speaks to the closeness of the Canadian-U.S. relationship and the ground that we had to cover today, and as I said, that\u2019ll continue.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much ground, it just speaks to both the breadth of that relationship as well as the depth of the collaboration that we had.\u00a0 On virtually every issue that matters to our people, the United States and Canada are working together.\nWe discussed, as M\u00e9lanie said, our continued unwavering support for Ukraine as it faces this ongoing aggression from President Putin\u2019s Russia.\u00a0 We applaud Canada\u2019s recent announcement of more than $34 million in new military aid to Ukraine, including artillery, satellite communication services, and winter gear for the soldiers.\u00a0 Canada and the United States will continue working with dozens of partner nations to get Ukraine\u2019s brave defenders what they need to keep fighting for their territory seized by Russia and to keep fighting for their people, strengthening our position on the battlefield and ultimately at any negotiating table that emerges.\nCanada has also committed more than $320 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and welcomed more than 104,000 Ukrainians to Canada through an emergency visa program that allows Ukrainians to come here for up to three years, during which time they can work and their children can go to school and study.\u00a0 Communities from Newfoundland and Labrador to Yukon are supporting this effort, including members of the Ukrainian diaspora that I met earlier today at Caf\u00e9 Ukraine, a community center where volunteers are doing everything from organizing social gatherings and concerts to making newly-arrived families feel a little bit less isolated, helping them find jobs, providing even art therapy for trauma survivors \u2013 all of that for free.\nM\u00e9lanie and I were joined there by Deputy Prime Minister Freeland, whose mother, of course, was born to Ukrainian refugees at a U.S. Army-run refugee camp in Germany.\u00a0 The story of her family \u2013 like my own \u2013 is testament to the long history of people in our nations serving the countries that once provided them refuge.\nThe generosity toward displaced Ukrainians is part of a long tradition of Canadians opening their arms to people in need time and again.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done that with approximately 23,000 Afghan refugees since the Taliban takeover in August of 2021.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done that with more than a million refugees worldwide going back to the 1980s.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite remarkable and something that speaks volumes for Canada around the world.\nMany of the refugees are sponsored by families, by universities, by faith groups and other citizens through a private sponsorship program that Canada launched more than four decades ago that\u2019s helped more than 327,000 refugees build new lives in this country and become a model for the world.\u00a0 We are going to soon pilot a program in the United States very much like it, and it\u2019s been inspired by what Canada has done, where American communities are eager to play a similar role.\nIn addition to our assistance to Ukraine, Canada and the U.S. are also supporting our allies and partners across the Atlantic as they head into winter with heavy energy costs.\u00a0 We\u2019re working together through the G7, we\u2019re also doing it bilaterally, to help mitigate Russian-driven supply disruptions.\u00a0 And we\u2019re accelerating the transition toward renewable energy and away from the dependence on Russia and other unreliable governments.\nThe same goes for other vital inputs in our supply chains.\u00a0 From critical minerals to microchips, we need to be able to source and to make essential products closer to home.\u00a0 That will not only make us more reliable in delivering for our people, but also more competitive in the 21st century economy.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s tax credit for electric vehicles that are made in North America, which President Biden signed into law in August, and creates incentives for Americans to buy vehicles made in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\u00a0 Tomorrow, I am visiting a lithium battery recycling facility operated by the Canadian company Lithion, which is partnering with General Motors to increase our supply of batteries that power these vehicles, and also bring down their costs.\nThis is not a one-off.\u00a0 U.S.-Canada cooperation is deepening at every step of the battery value chain, from mining to production to recycling, benefitting communities on both sides of our border.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we saw in the recent announcement by Ontario-based company Li-Cycle that will invest $485 million in expanding a battery recycling facility in Rochester, New York, \u00a0creating over 200 good-paying jobs.\nThis cooperation is good for both our nations\u2019 competitiveness.\u00a0 It\u2019s good for Canadian and American workers.\u00a0 And it\u2019s good for our planet.\u00a0 And it\u2019s something we\u2019re aiming to replicate across other supply chains.\nThat\u2019s far from the only way that we\u2019re partnering to boost our competitiveness.\u00a0 Let me just mention quickly a couple of things, and we talked about these as well.\nWe will continue to work with Canada to advance the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, to drive our hemisphere\u2019s inclusive economic growth.\nAnd the foreign minister reiterated Canada\u2019s interest in joining the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 As you just heard, we support Canada \u2013 a fellow Pacific nation \u2013 joining this framework.\u00a0 In the coming months, we will consult closely with other IPEF members on the development of a process for considering new members, because it\u2019s not a decision the United States can make unilaterally, but we would welcome Canada\u2019s participation.\nM\u00e9lanie and I also discussed other parts of the world beyond Ukraine, where we\u2019re working together to tackle fundamental challenges to international law and to the United Nations Charter.\nWe\u2019re working together to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its vicious crackdown on brave young women who continue to come out into the streets to demand their rights, more than 40 days now after the killing of Mahsa Amini.\u00a0 We fully support the statement that Minister Joly and 11 other women foreign ministers from around the world issued condemning the regime\u2019s repression.\nThe Iranian regime has also provided the Kremlin with drones and assisted Russia in their use \u2013drones that are being used to kill Ukrainian civilians and destroy the infrastructure they rely on for electricity, for water, for heat.\u00a0 It\u2019s appalling, and Canada and the United States will keep working with our allies and partners to expose, to deter, and to counter Iran\u2019s provision of these weapons.\nWe support Canada\u2019s efforts to rally countries around the world in ending the unlawful practice of detaining innocent individuals and using them as political pawns.\u00a0 Both of our countries have suffered from this.\u00a0 We\u2019re working and we will be acting together to deal with it.\nAnd we talked about shared challenges in our region, including in Haiti, as you heard from M\u00e9lanie.\u00a0 We agree that between deepening food and fuel shortages, the growing cholera outbreak, and gangs blockading ports and terrorizing civilians, the situation is simply unsustainable.\nWe appreciate Canada\u2019s leadership in creating the UN Basket Fund to strengthen citizen security and law enforcement, and in airlifting vital security-related equipment to the Haitian Government last week \u2013 efforts in which the United States has been a proud partner.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to work together to rally international support around helping the Haitian people find a way forward \u2013 from the sanctions adopted unanimously last week by the Security Council against the leaders of gangs and the patrons that direct and profit from them, to other measures aimed at improving security for Haitians.\nAs fellow Arctic nations, as M\u00e9lanie mentioned, and shared stewards of the North American Arctic, we see how climate change is rapidly transforming the region.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re working together to create an Arctic that is more sustainable, peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative, as is reflected in the updated U.S. National Strategy for the Arctic Region that we recently released.\nSo we face a set of complex challenges.\u00a0 But we have the immense good fortune of having a neighbor in Canada that not only shares our interests, but our respect for human rights, our commitment to democracy, our belief that all our people should have equal opportunities to reach their full potential.\u00a0 It\u2019s why we make such a good team.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to taking our relationship and our cooperation to even higher levels.\nI simply couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner in Canada and I certainly could not ask for a better partner in its foreign minister, my friend and my colleague, M\u00e9lanie Joly.\u00a0 So thank you for having us here today.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Merci,\u00a0Tony.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\u00a0\u00a0(In French.)\u00a0 We\u2019ll now be beginning the question-and-answer session.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be taking two questions from Canadian media and two questions from American media.\u00a0 (In French.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 (In French) \u2013 I will ask in French \u2013 (in French).\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Madam Joly, the agreement on \u2013 the Safe Third Country Agreement \u2013 what do you have to say about that?\u00a0 And for Secretary Blinken, are you satisfied with the actual \u2013 with the current agreement?\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you, Christian.\u00a0 Obviously, border security is very important for us and we need to ensure that asylum seekers are treated with compassion.\u00a0 This is an issue that I discussed with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 We have a bilateral agreement on this issue.\u00a0 It is the Safe Third Country Agreement, and those negotiations are ongoing.\u00a0 Of course, our goal is to be able to cooperate with the U.S. on this issue.\n(In English) So indeed, the security at the border is extremely important and we need to make sure that asylum seekers are also dealt with compassion.\u00a0 It is a bilateral agreement that unites the U.S. and Canada on this very question.\u00a0 This issue was raised by me to Secretary Blinken and negotiations are underway, and we\u2019ll make sure that these negotiations are fruitful.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Little to add.\u00a0 As the foreign minister said, yes, this is something we discussed and we\u2019ll continue to discuss.\nLet me just say more broadly, to put this also in some perspective, we are facing a historic migration challenge around the world.\u00a0 We have more people on the move, displaced from their homes, than at any time in recorded history \u2013 more than a hundred million people now.\u00a0 And of course, in our own hemisphere, the hemisphere that we share, that\u2019s also very much the case.\u00a0 And whether it is Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Haitians, Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, we see people on the move throughout the hemisphere.\u00a0 And this is a challenge that has to be addressed and met by the countries of origin, the countries of transit, and the countries of destination.\u00a0 And we have to do it more effectively together.\nPut simply, there needs to be a greater sense of shared responsibility for dealing with migration challenges.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what came out of the Summit of the Americas with the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration.\u00a0 And Canada and the United States are helping to lead those efforts.\nSo across the board, this is something that we\u2019re working on very closely together, in all of its manifestations.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll work through any particular challenges that we have to.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Before I ask my second question, could you answer in French, perhaps?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 English, but \u2013 that\u2019s all right.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I think you have a great accent in French.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Christian, he doesn\u2019t have an accent in French.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Secretary Blinken, concerning NEXUS and the NEXUS pass, what do the U.S. and Canada need to do to get through that impasse?\u00a0 And Ms. Joly, what do you think of the possibility that some NEXUS officials might be armed at the border?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So NEXUS \u2013 this is something else that was discussed in our meeting and we\u2019re both determined to work through it.\u00a0 We both feel strongly that the most powerful bond we have is in the ability of Canadians and Americans alike to move back and forth to our respective countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s what connects us every single day.\nSo we\u2019re committed and determined to work through this.\u00a0 We want to see the backlog it\u2019s created be addressed.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working very hard ourselves, putting in additional personnel and resources in the United States to work through the backlog, and we want to and need to resolve this particular issue so that we can go at 100 percent, 110 percent, both to deal with the backlog and to make sure that we\u2019re doing everything possible to facilitate movement between our two countries.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So indeed, we need to make sure that Canadians that want to have access to a NEXUS card or used to have access to a NEXUS card and want it \u2013 want a new one are able to.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why we are looking actively at how to address the backlog and to address services being rendered, and meanwhile working on our own bilateral relationship when it comes to security at the border.\nSo we\u2019re in solution mode, and we\u2019ll find a solution.\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced.\n(Via interpreter) As the Secretary of State mentioned, we want to make sure that any Canadian who has a NEXUS card or who wants to renew one will be able to do so.\u00a0 We are working together to find solutions to deal with the backlog.\u00a0 What is the French word for that? \u00a0Arri\u00e9r\u00e9,\u00a0yes, the backlog.\u00a0 Thank you to the journalist for answering my question.\nIn any case, we\u2019re dealing with working on that backlog, reducing the backlog, and being able to provide services while pursuing our discussions on the issue of border security.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 We\u2019ll go to the next question, from American media this time around.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Leon Bruneau \u2013\u00a0bonjour \u2013 de\u00a0l\u2019Agence French-Presse.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Bonjour.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0American (inaudible).\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nA question for both of you.\u00a0 You said you talked about Haiti in your discussions.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of talk about potential setting up a security force, or some sort of security force, a police force with some military elements for Haiti.\u00a0 And at the same time \u2013 and I understand it\u2019s a very difficult situation, but at the same time, given past experiences, we don\u2019t see any country really standing up and willing to lead this force, if that is even a good idea, given that in Haiti it may not be so well accepted.\nSo my question for the Secretary is:\u00a0 First of all, do you think that this force, the idea of a force, security force, is a good idea?\u00a0 And who would lead that force, since the United States has said that they would not do so?\u00a0 You said you would support it but you would not lead it.\n(Via interpreter) And to you, Madam Minister, would Canada be ready to lead this force?\u00a0 And if yes, under which conditions?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 First, taking a step back on this as well, we have to look at the big \u2013 the big picture in Haiti and the challenges that the Haitian people face and that we need to help them address.\u00a0 And we know that between human-made and natural-made challenges, Haiti has more than its hands full.\u00a0 We now have a cholera outbreak, on top of everything else, that is very serious.\nBut in order to actually get to a place where we can genuinely help Haitians with the assistance that they need and also make sure that they can be on the path to elections to get to a new government over time, the knot that really has to be broken in the first instance is concerning security, because Haiti now faces a situation where gangs dominate important space in Port-au-Prince, the capital, as well as in other parts of Haiti, preventing assistance from getting through \u2013 everything from food and fuel and water \u2013 by blocking critical ports, critical fuel facilities, and also creating an environment in which people cannot move freely about, which would certainly make an election down the road impossible.\nSo our countries have been working very closely together to do a few things to try to cut this insecurity knot and deal with the gang problem.\u00a0 One is to support the Haitian National Police, including with equipment, with advice, and just recently, as you know, Canada provided armored vehicles to the Haitian National Police with our collaboration.\u00a0 At the same time, we are trying to break the nexus between these gangs and some of the political actors who are financing them and directing them, and that goes to the sanctions that were recently put forward at the United Nations as well as sanctions we\u2019re doing on our own basis to try to get at those who are supporting and directing the gangs.\nHaving said all that, I think it\u2019s a shared view that more likely needs to be done for the national police in support of them to allow them to get a real grip on security and to take back these parts of the capital that the gangs have been dominating.\u00a0 So there is now a second draft resolution in the works at the United Nations after the initial resolution on sanctions that would authorize a non-UN international assistance mission to improve the security situation and enable the flow of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Haiti.\u00a0 And so what we\u2019ve been talking about is what might that look like, what would it need, and we\u2019ve both been talking to a variety of countries to gauge their interest and willingness to participate in that.\nSo that\u2019s the conversation we\u2019re having, but I think we \u2013 and I appreciate very much the fact that Canada has just sent or announced that it\u2019s sending an assessment team to Haiti to look at what would actually be required in terms of supporting the police.\u00a0 But the purpose of any such mission would be to support the Haitian National Police in doing their jobs to make sure that the state once again actually controls the country, not gangs that right now are one of the biggest problems that we face in actually being able to move forward and help Haiti.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So to follow up on that, first and foremost, I think it\u2019s important to remind ourselves that Haiti is facing a triple crisis, the first one being a security crisis.\u00a0 The Varreux Terminal needs to be unblocked.\u00a0 It is fundamental that Haiti be able to supply itself with gas and as well as with clean water, because as Secretary Blinken mentioned, there is an outbreak of cholera right now.\u00a0 So the second also crisis that Haiti is facing is a humanitarian one, and we definitely need to support Haiti to make sure that \u2013 and bring the international community to support Haiti facing this important crisis.\nAnd finally I would say it is also of equal importance to address the political crisis, because there needs to be fair elections happening, and we need to make sure that the environment for these elections to happen is the right one.\u00a0 But to do that we need to address the security and humanitarian issue.\u00a0 So that is why Canada sent an assessment mission.\u00a0 I confirmed it this morning.\u00a0 The goal is to be able to have information coming from the team that is right now in Haiti on these three crises.\nWe\u2019ve said it many times:\u00a0 We will always support solutions that are by and for Haitians, because we believe in the fact that solutions are better when, of course, they\u2019re taken by them and that we support them.\u00a0 That is also why we\u2019re having conversations with the United States on this issue.\u00a0 That\u2019s also why I had a long conversation with the head of the African Union, who is in town, Moussa Faki, this morning about the issue, and also that I had conversations with my CARICOM colleagues, because we need to make sure that it is, yes, Canada and U.S. collaborating with the Haitians, but also with many other countries.\u00a0 At the end of the day we need to make sure that there is strong legitimacy for this approach, and Canada will always be there to support Haiti.\nI think one of the things that we haven\u2019t done, when it comes to Haiti in the past, over the decades of Canada being involved in Haiti, is really sanctioning the people that are at the core of the financing of these gangs, and we need to make sure that we have a strong approach when it comes to sanctioning.\u00a0 And we are working with the U.S., along our United Nations partners, because obviously this conversation is happening at the UN Security Council.\u00a0 There was an important resolution also that was \u2013 that was taken by the UN Security Council on sanctions, and particularly targeting the head of the gangs, which is a so-called \u201cBarbecue.\u201d\u00a0 And we want to make sure that Canada follows suit on this, but the conversation regarding sanction is well and alive, and we need to make sure that the people that are benefiting from the violence in the streets of Port-au-Prince are held accountable.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Our next question will be from Canadian media, and just a reminder that we request that your question be asked in a single interaction.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Mercedes Stephenson, Global News.\u00a0 Thank you for taking our questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and Minister Joly, you were just discussing Haiti.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering, Secretary Blinken, when you came here, if you were hoping for a commitment from Canada to lead this mission and if that is something you would still like to see.\u00a0 And Minister Joly, what the range of options are \u2013 because it will be partially determined by what we\u2019re capable of, which comes to my follow up.\nSecretary Blinken, how does the United States feel about Canada\u2019s current levels of defense and foreign affairs spending?\u00a0 We have a chief of defense staff who has said we can\u2019t do more than the essential.\u00a0 The Canadian Government announced $5 billion they said was new spending for NORAD.\u00a0 It turned out that was recycled.\u00a0 And we\u2019re under enormous pressure to be able to perform even the basic capabilities.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if that concerns the United States, and Minister Joly, if that\u2019s a frustration for you in trying to fulfill your job with Canada\u2019s (inaudible).\u00a0\u00a0Et en fran\u00e7ais,\u00a0as well, please.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Happy to start.\u00a0 So on Haiti, if you look at the draft resolution, that\u2019s before the Security Council right now, the second resolution, it is looking for and asking for countries to provide contributions and personnel of equipment, of other resources for a potential mission, one that would be very limited in scope, limited in time, and in support, as the foreign minister said, of the Haitian National Police, because the purpose is to reinforce their capacity to finally get a grip on the security situation and to deal with the problem of gangs dominating certain critical parts of Port-au-Prince in particular.\nSo we\u2019re talking between us, but also, as M\u00e9lanie said, with many other countries about who might be willing to participate in such a mission, as well as who will lead it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s an ongoing conversation that we\u2019re both having and having with others.\u00a0 So this is a work in progress and we\u2019re continuing to pursue it.\nWith regard to defense spending, I\u2019d say a couple of things.\u00a0 First, Canada\u2019s making extraordinary contributions every single day, particularly as we see with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and the work as well as the very important material support that Canada is providing to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves.\u00a0 And we just saw another significant provision of support, as well as very significant humanitarian assistance both in Ukraine itself, as well as, of course, all of the support that Canada is giving to so many Ukrainians who have come to Canada.\nMore broadly than that, though, we as allies have been working together in NATO for years to continue to strengthen our contributions to our common defense.\u00a0 We had the recent NATO Summit in which we\u2019re working closely on a new Strategic Concept, which will require resources.\u00a0 We have a common commitment that we\u2019ve made many years ago at the Wales Summit to spending a certain percentage of our GDP on defense for countries.\u00a0 This is a work in progress.\u00a0 We\u2019re all making efforts to meet both the commitment it was made in 2014, but also to take into account so much that has changed since 2014.\u00a0 And that requires us, I believe all, to do more to provide for our common security.\nWe took steps at NATO in the face of the Russian aggression to strengthen NATO itself, including on the eastern flank.\u00a0 Canada\u2019s played an important part of that.\u00a0 But I think as we\u2019re talking about this now, we\u2019re looking at new challenges that weren\u2019t even there in 2014 when we all made these commitments to NATO and to our defense spending.\u00a0 So I think we all have to find ways to resource them properly, and that\u2019s part of our conversation.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 So on Haiti, Mercedes, so we have provided $40 million since the beginning of this year for the Haitian police.\u00a0 And we historically have very much been involved in creating their training and really making sure to empower them on the ground.\u00a0 What we\u2019re seeing right now is there is more help needed and the Haitian police need to be able to handle the gangs, which is not the case at this point.\u00a0 And so that\u2019s why the assessment team is in Haiti right now to see what\u2019s the level of organization of the Haitian police and what\u2019s the security situation.\u00a0 What does the Haitian Government has in terms of tools to deal with the gangs that are funded?\nAnd so that is why we\u2019re looking at different options, but we want to make sure that we have the right assessment.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve said it many times \u2013 it needs to be by and for Haitians.\u00a0 So we will be working with Haitians themselves, and we need to work also with many countries around the world to deal with this issue.\nAnd so I think that Canada has always been a very, very good friend to Haiti.\u00a0 We have a strong relationship.\u00a0 Our police forces have strong relationship with Haiti also because they\u2019ve been there in the 19th, at the beginning of the 2000s, and we want to maintain them.\u00a0\u00a0 And more than ever, Haiti needs us.\u00a0 And so of course we will play a role.\nIn terms of military investments and being able to do my job, I think \u2013 looking back at the last year, I think it\u2019s been a very busy year.\u00a0 And I think that we can be proud of Canada\u2019s leadership in the world on many issues, from indeed Haiti but also looking at what we\u2019re doing to support women in Iran right now or, obviously, everything we\u2019ve done on the question of Ukraine.\u00a0 On the question of Ukraine, we\u2019ve spent and invested more than $3.5 billion at this point at all levels.\u00a0 We\u2019re one of the countries that is investing the most per capita.\nWe also are leading, like Tony said, on the eastern flank of Europe, the NATO Latvian forces.\u00a0 And I\u2019m coming up with an Indo-Pacific strategy, and the goal is definitely for Canada to play a bigger role in the region.\u00a0 But as you know, Minister Anand, our defense minister, has a defense policy review to undergo, and so I\u2019m convinced that she\u2019ll show great leadership on this issue.\nSo you want me to say that\u00a0en fran\u00e7ais?\u00a0 Okay.\n(Via interpreter) So, of course, when it comes to Haiti, we have long been involved in creating training for the Haitian police, including through their academy.\u00a0 And this is curricula that was developed through the \u201990s and the 2000s in Canada.\u00a0 Canada has long been a very close friend of Haiti, and our objective has always been to improve and deepen that friendship.\u00a0 No decision will be taken without the involvement of the Haitians themselves.\u00a0 I have always said any solutions must be by and for Haitians because, of course, this is all for them.\u00a0 It is the Haitian people who are suffering now, and they\u2019re the ones who need to be helped.\nWe\u2019ve worked with the Americans and other countries in the region to ensure that we deal with the humanitarian, economic, and political crises there.\u00a0 And something else that\u2019s quite important now is that there currently is an assessment mission there on the ground, and the goal of the mission is to understand what is the state of the police force in Haiti and what is the current security situation.\nWhen it comes to defense, well, we\u2019ve invested over $3.5 billion in the Ukraine crisis since the beginning of the year.\u00a0 We\u2019re also leading NATO forces in Lithuania, and we\u2019re starting to play a greater role in the Indo-Pacific as well.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and myself have had good discussions concerning defense investments, and Minister Anand is currently reviewing the national defense policy, so I\u2019m convinced that that will end in a solution.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(In French.)\u00a0 We\u2019ll now be taking our last question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, Jennifer Hansler from CNN.\u00a0 Thank you so much for taking our questions.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, President Putin today praised the Saudi crown prince and said Russia would look to deepen its relations with Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Will this factor into the U.S.\u2019s response to the OPEC decision?\u00a0 And when can we expect to see the first repercussions for that decision?\nAnd then to both of the ministers, Russia has suggested it could let the Black Sea grain deal expire.\u00a0 Are there any concessions that the U.S. and Canada would consider in order to facilitate the extension of that deal?\nAnd how specifically do you deter Iran from providing drones to Russia, and given the pace of these drone attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, are you confident that the U.S. and Canadian support can be robust and quick enough for Ukraine to keep its heat on and its critical services this winter?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Now would you ask it in French as well?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yeah, sadly only speak Spanish.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0(Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, one of the reasons that we were very disappointed in the OPEC+ and Saudi decision to decrease production was precisely because of the potential impact it would have on oil prices, not only affecting consumers in our respective countries but potentially lining President Putin pockets at the time when he continues to pursue the aggression against Ukraine \u2013 indeed, in many ways, doubling and tripling down on it with the mobilization, the annexation, the loose talk about nuclear weapons, and now the horrific assault on Ukraine\u2019s basic infrastructure: trying to turn the lights out, turn the power off, turn the heat off for the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 So anything that assists that is profoundly wrong and profoundly objectionable.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s worth noting that Saudi Arabia supported the resolution that came before the United Nations General Assembly, where 143 countries condemned the purported annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia.\u00a0 And just recently, Saudi Arabia came forward with, I believe, more than $400 million in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.\u00a0 Both very positive decisions that that we\u2019ve taken note of.\nAs we\u2019ve said, the relationship with Saudi Arabia has been built up over many years, many decades through many administrations, on a bipartisan basis.\u00a0 We will look at this, as we are, methodically and with deliberation for the purpose of making sure that it is working to advance our interests.\u00a0 That\u2019s the objective.\u00a0 And we have a multiplicity of interests when it comes to the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 And as we\u2019re looking at this, we\u2019re \u2013 we want to make sure that, as I said, those interests are being advanced and supported.\nWhen it comes to the grain agreement, first, remember none of this should have been necessary in the first place, because the only reason we had to get this grain agreement is because Russia invaded Ukraine and then blockaded its ports, denying the entire world the benefits of the Ukrainian breadbasket.\u00a0 Thanks to terrific work by the United Nations, by the secretary-general, with the support of Turkey, an agreement was reached where Russia stopped the end of the blockade of Odesa and a process was put in place to allow Ukrainian grain and food products to flow out to the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s been a tremendous benefit.\u00a0 More than nine million metric tons of grain have gotten out through the Odesa ports.\u00a0 Two-thirds of that has gone to the Global South, to countries in Africa and Asia and elsewhere, who desperately needed it.\u00a0 It\u2019s had a very positive impact in lowering prices that\u2019s benefited everyone around the world.\nSo the idea that Russia would now say, ah, it doesn\u2019t want to continue, it wants to turn it off, I think will be met with great anger by countries around the world who are benefiting from Ukrainian grain.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s profoundly in everyone\u2019s interests to make sure that this grain can continue to move out of Ukraine, and certainly we will do everything we can to sustain the agreement.\u00a0 But I think a decision by Russia to discontinue this agreement would the met with deep concern from countries around the world, especially in the Global South.\nWith regard to Iran and the drones that it\u2019s providing to Russia, that Russia is using to kill innocent Ukrainians and to try to destroy the infrastructure of Ukraine, we\u2019ve been warning about this going back many months.\u00a0 Starting in July, we raised concerns that Iran was thinking about providing these drones to Russia.\u00a0 Since well before the Russian aggression, we\u2019ve been going after the Iranian drone networks, the UAV networks.\u00a0 We sanctioned them well over a year ago.\u00a0 We just sanctioned them again a few weeks ago.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to break up these networks.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions, to disrupt this trade, as well as, of course, to help the Iranian \u2013 the Ukrainians, excuse me, harden their own defenses.\nBut I think, again, the fact that Iran is doing this is something that virtually the entire world will find profoundly objectionable.\u00a0 It\u2019s also evidence of the fact that the sanctions that we\u2019ve imposed on Russia, all of us, and the export controls, are having a powerful impact because Russia is unable to produce parts for its own equipment, to manufacture its own equipment, and it\u2019s having to turn to whatever corner of the world it can find to try to get things to continue its aggression.\u00a0 So we are looking very hard at what can be done to stop this, but the first thing is it\u2019s very visible to the entire world.\u00a0 And I think the world is not going to countenance this relationship and the supply of these weapons to Russia.\nFinally, we just proceeded with, I think, our 24th drawdown of defense equipment for Ukraine.\u00a0 As I said, the Canadians have recently contributed additional systems to the Ukrainians.\u00a0 We have a process in place that Secretary of Defense Austin is leading.\u00a0 It was started in Ramstein, Germany, where we\u2019re coordinating the efforts of dozens of countries to make sure that Ukraine continues to get what it needs to defend itself.\u00a0 And this has been an evolving picture over time.\u00a0 As the nature of the aggression has changed, moved to different places, using different means, we\u2019ve adjusted, and we\u2019ll continue to do that, as I said, to make sure that the Ukrainians have what they need.\nThere\u2019s a profound commitment that we have \u2013 but not just the United States and Canada, dozens of countries have \u2013 to make sure that Ukraine continues to get what it needs to defend itself and to take back the territory that was seized from it by Russia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 On the UN grain deal, I must say that I just had a conversation this morning with the head of the African Union, which was very concerned as well that this deal will not be continuing to be supported by Russia.\u00a0 So I think we can really work with many countries around the world \u2013 definitely the U.S. and us, but also working with African countries and Middle Eastern countries that are depending from this important grain deal.\u00a0 And we will continue to voice that support to that deal at the UN through our ambassador.\nI think also that it is equally important for us as a very important grain producer to continue to provide the world with our own grains and food.\u00a0 We\u2019ve increased also massively our support to the World Food Programme; we\u2019re now the fourth biggest donor in the world.\u00a0 And my job is to make sure that, working with the minister of international development, we shed light on the question of food security.\u00a0 We will be going to the G7 next week \u2013 Tony and I \u2013 and definitely as this G7 will be particularly focused on the needs of Africa, we will be looking at how we can continue to support the UN grain deal, but at the same time that we can address the issue of the food crisis.\nAnd finally on the question of Iran, we look forward to working with the U.S. on shedding light on Iran\u2019s involvement in Ukraine and making sure that they\u2019re held accountable.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already, as mentioned, hosted a female foreign minister meeting \u2013 nearly 17 of them were present \u2013 and we also launched a very important declaration to support women in Iran that are fighting for women rights.\u00a0 But I think that the issue of Iran being involved in Ukraine and supporting Russia brings the Iranian regime\u2019s \u2013 how can I say \u2013 inhumanity to another level.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why we will make sure that we hold them accountable.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(In French.)\u00a0 This ends press conference for today.\u00a0 Thank you all for being here.\n\n"}, {"url":

but two, we\u2019ve been able to support them in that effort.\u00a0 And from day one \u2013 as M\u00e9lanie said, even before day one, the United States and Canada working together helped prepare for the rising storm that we saw and then try to make sure that Ukrainians get what they need to fend off the aggression and retake their land.\u00a0 But also making sure that those Ukrainians who left had a place to go and were welcomed with open arms.\nAnd what we see here in this caf\u00e9 is really wonderful because it gives a sense of community to people who have just had to leave everything behind.\u00a0 It creates networks for them to make sure that they can adjust and adapt to their new home, at least for now.\u00a0 I think most people want to go back to the home that they left, and hopefully that\u2019ll happen as soon as possible.\u00a0 But meanwhile the fact that they\u2019re so warmly and generously welcomed in Canada makes all the difference in the world.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0And we want to thank Yaroslav, and \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 (inaudible), and Anton, and all of them \u2014\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Marusia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 \u2014 yes, as well \u2013 for your work here, and we\u2019re proud of the work you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 And this is just Canada, so welcome here.\nMS GARBUTT:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s what we do.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0We welcome people very well.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nMS GARBUTT:\u00a0\u00a0We do.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, tout le monde.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, tout le monde\u00a0(inaudible).\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-at-a-diwali-reception/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

they\u2019ve shared sweets; they\u2019ve given thanks through\u00a0pooja; they\u2019ve lit sparklers.\u00a0 All around the world, from the streets of New Delhi, to the parks of Kuala Lumpur, to right down the street at the White House, people have gathered to share in the simple joy of being around friends and family.\u00a0 And through it all, they have each reaffirmed their commitment to bringing light to their communities.\nThat final obligation of spreading light is maybe more important than it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 So even as we celebrate tonight, we remember those around the world who are not able to freely celebrate their cultural and religious holidays.\nEven in the face of challenges \u2013 especially in the face of challenges \u2013 the State Department will continue to support freedom of belief and celebrate religious diversity around the world.\nAs you heard Rashad mention a few moments ago, religious freedom is a fundamental American value, and supporting it is a priority for President Biden.\u00a0 It\u2019s also an invaluable part of the United States diplomacy, because it actually helps us build bonds with other nations and with peoples around the world.\nOne way that we show our support for religious diversity is through helping to preserve vital pieces of cultural heritage around the world.\u00a0 Through efforts like the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, we\u2019re helping to restore damaged historic buildings; we\u2019re helping to recover lost or stolen cultural objects, like paintings and sculptures.\u00a0 Just this past February, our colleagues at the Mission in Australia, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Indian law enforcement agents, recovered a 500-year-old stolen statue of Hanuman, a Hindu deity, and returned it to the Indian Government.\nAnother way that we demonstrate our support for religious freedom is through celebrations like this one, which is one of many happening across the State Department.\u00a0 For example, in our embassy in Abu Dhabi, guests last week decorated a\u00a0rungolee\u00a0in the main entrance, while at Embassy New Delhi, local staff, community members showcased traditional dances.\nEach of these efforts \u2013 each bond that we build between ourselves and other countries \u2013 makes it easier to collaborate on so many of the pressing issues of our time.\u00a0 And here, too, not surprisingly, our engagement with faith communities is a vital part of our work in our embassies and consulates all around the world.\nFor example, diplomats in our mission to India regularly visit temples,\u00a0stupas,\u00a0gurdwaras\u00a0\u2013 both to promote our shared value of pluralism and religious tolerance, and to partner together on common challenges.\u00a0 And over the past two years, Mission Delhi \u2013 across community members in the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, and Buddhist faiths, among others \u2013 have hosted vaccination drives in places of worship around the country as part of the overall effort to help more than 25 million Indians get their COVID-19 vaccines.\nMany of you are already partners in this work.\u00a0 As members of the diplomatic, religious, and civil society communities, you\u2019re playing an invaluable role in helping to connect us with local populations abroad, and by pushing us to do more to support religious freedom around the world.\nPlease keep it up.\u00a0 We need your energy.\u00a0 We need your initiative.\u00a0 We need your knowledge.\u00a0 We need your expertise.\u00a0 We need all of that if we\u2019re going to continue building mutual respect and understanding, if we\u2019re going to continue expanding religious freedom, and ultimately, if we are going to ensure that light triumphs over darkness.\nWe\u2019ll celebrate that triumph in just a few moments with the lighting of the\u00a0diya.\u00a0 For now, thank you, thank you to everybody for being here tonight, for joining in this celebration, for the community that you have formed together, and for the work that you\u2019re doing not just in this day and on this happy occasion, but every single day to advance the values and the light that we want to spread.\u00a0 Happy Diwali, everyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDoctor, over to you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-israeli-president-isaac-herzog-before-their-meeting-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

And we\u2019re building bridges\u00a0\u2013 in STEM, between our people, between all of our countries.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing that through all of you.\nAs this program now enters its second decade, we\u2019re also expanding its reach.\u00a0 We\u2019ll spread to new parts of our own country, the United States, as well as new regions of the world, starting with the Balkans.\u00a0 We\u2019ll create additional opportunities for collaboration between alums and mentors.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue supporting younger generations of women in STEM.\nSo what I\u2019d like to leave you with is this encouragement, that you continue engaging with the program not just now, not just in the months ahead, but in the years ahead, because we couldn\u2019t be prouder to be your partners and because this has to be a living, growing, expanding, evolving thing.\u00a0 And you\u2019re the ones who can make it be exactly that.\nAs important as five weeks may be, what\u2019s even more important is what follows from it.\u00a0 And again, these connections that you\u2019ve made, these networks that you\u2019re building, that to me is the power of TechWomen.\u00a0 That\u2019s what makes it something that will carry us, carry you, carry our societies far into the future.\nWe know\u00a0\u2013 because we\u2019ve seen it already in the time that the program has existed\u00a0\u2013 we know that you\u2019re going to keep doing remarkable work, not only in your fields but also to support other women.\u00a0 More than 90 percent of the TechWomen alumna who\u2019ve been surveyed have said that they\u2019ve actually gone on to mentor women in their countries.\u00a0 So I hope you\u2019ll continue to build on that tradition, too.\u00a0 Carrying it forward, paying it forward, that\u2019s also the power of TechWomen.\nMy last thought is this.\u00a0 You\u2019ve already heard about some remarkable projects that have come out of this session.\u00a0 But I really can\u2019t wait\u00a0\u2013 we can\u2019t wait\u00a0\u2013 to see all that you\u2019re going to do in the years ahead, that you\u2019re going to do together, that you\u2019re going to do for the betterment of your countries, of your societies, of the world and the planet that we share.\u00a0 This is\u00a0\u2013 you are\u00a0\u2013 the hope that we have for our common future.\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t be prouder to be working with you.\u00a0 Thank you so very much.

Blinken and French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna at a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Benjamin Franklin Room", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "October 21, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0Bonjour, tout le monde.\n(Via interpreter) Catherine, I\u2019m delighted to host you here at the State Department and in Washington.\nIt\u2019s a true pleasure to have my friend and colleague, Catherine Colonna, the French Foreign Minister here in Washington and at the State Department.\u00a0 This is actually the first time that we\u2019ve had the honor of hosting our French colleagues and Catherine here in Washington, despite the fact that we have been closely collaborating over these past five months everywhere from Brussels to Bali, most recently at the United Nations Security Council in the course of a ministerial that the foreign minister presided over on Ukraine.\nOn virtually every issue that matters to our nations and matters to much of the world, I couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner, the United States couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner.\u00a0 And that was reflected in, as usual, the very productive conversation and meeting that we had today.\u00a0 We discussed our united and unwavering response to President Putin\u2019s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 In recent days, we\u2019ve witnessed Moscow\u2019s widespread strikes on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine \u2013 many carried out using drones supplied by Iran.\u00a0 These strikes have a clear goal: to make the Ukrainian people suffer.\u00a0 And the damage they\u2019re inflicting will make it harder for Ukrainians to heat their homes, find safe water to drink, access the electricity that they need to run everything from stores to hospitals to public transportation.\nPresident Putin thinks that these attacks will somehow break the will of Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Instead, he is only deepening their resolve to defend their country.\u00a0 Moscow can knock out the lights across Ukraine, but it cannot, it will not, extinguish the Ukrainian spirit.\nPresident Putin thought he could divide the transatlantic alliance.\u00a0 Instead, he\u2019s brought us even closer together.\u00a0 The United States is working closely with France and other European allies to help make the decisive shift away from dependence on Russian energy.\u00a0 That means developing more diverse, more reliable, more sustainable sources over the long term and helping our friends get through a winter with heavy energy costs.\u00a0 As I assured the foreign minister today, we are not leaving any of our friends out in the cold.\nPresident Putin thought that he could wear down global support for Ukraine.\u00a0 Instead, countries in every region recognize that when the Kremlin tries to redraw the borders of its neighbor by force, it threatens the rules that underpin security and stability for all nations in every corner of the Earth.\u00a0 That is why 143 countries recently voted at the United Nations to condemn Russia\u2019s sham referenda and reject any attempt to annex Ukrainian territory.\nPresident Putin\u2019s declaration of martial law in parts of Ukraine that Russia purports to annex is just his latest attempt to dress up crimes in the language of law.\u00a0 His move also reveals the lie at the heart of Russia\u2019s purported annexation: if 99 percent of people in these parts of Ukraine want to be part of Russia, why does President Putin have to impose martial law to control them?\nThe foreign minister and I spoke about how we can continue to provide robust support for Ukraine\u2019s efforts to defend itself and to deliver vital humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people while also continuing to raise the costs on President Putin and his enablers for their actions.\u00a0 And we reaffirmed our commitment to meaningful diplomacy that can bring an end to the war, even as Moscow continues to demonstrate through its escalatory actions that its claim to be open to diplomacy is as hollow as it\u2019s been since President Putin lost \u2013 launched his invasion in February.\nWe applaud France\u2019s security assistance to Ukraine, including President Macron\u2019s recent announcement of a 100 million euro fund to help supply Kyiv with weapons.\u00a0 France is also host to more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, including thousands who have been welcomed into French households.\nOf course, our cooperation and our conversation extended far beyond Ukraine today.\u00a0 We\u2019re working closely together to rally international coalitions to meet global challenges which no nation or even group of nations can solve alone.\u00a0 That includes our joint efforts to combat the climate crisis.\u00a0 Next week, we\u2019ll hold the second annual high-level meeting of the U.S.\u2011France Clean Energy Partnership, which is ramping up our renewable energy production.\nWe\u2019re stalwart partners in strengthening global health security, as was evident in France\u2019s pledge of nearly $1.6 billion at last month\u2019s Global Fund Seventh Replenishment Conference, which President Biden committed to work with our Congress to contribute $6 billion to that fund.\u00a0 This is the international fund that has done so much over so many years to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, saving literally millions and millions of lives.\u00a0 Our contributions, the United States and France, the two \u2013 to the two largest contributions of any two countries \u2013 will allow us to keep making great strides against HIV/AIDS, against malaria, and against tuberculosis.\nWe\u2019re also working together to advance a free and open Indo\u2011Pacific where all nations can choose their own paths free from coercion.\u00a0 And I thank the minister for France\u2019s support in the negotiations that the governments of Israel and Lebanon reached, a historic agreement to establish a permanent maritime boundary between their two countries.\u00a0 This cooperation and coordination between France and the United States was instrumental in reaching this agreement.\nOur relationship is the embodiment of the approach in the United Nations \u2013 excuse me, the United States new National Security Strategy, which is rooted in strengthening our alliances and our partnerships, finding new ways to weave them together, and working together to shape a more open, secure, and prosperous world.\nThe state visit by President Macron in December, the first that President Biden will host during this administration, is both a testament to our unique friendship and the chance to continue to deepen it.\u00a0 I\u2019m very much looking forward to working with Catherine in the leadup to the visit and long after.\nWith that, Catherine, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0M. Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat, dear Antony, thank you very much for your warm welcome and for our meeting today, the first in Washington, as you rightly cite.\u00a0 As some of you may know, I\u2019ve happily served as a young diplomat in D.C. some time ago, let\u2019s say.\u00a0 Let me turn to French since the Secretary of State is an accomplished French speaker.\n(Via interpreter) Secretary of State, dear Tony, this visit is taking place at a decisive time.\u00a0 Almost eight months ago, Russia brought war back to the European continent by invading illegally Ukraine.\u00a0 It is by doing so threatening our collective security, breaching the fundamental principles of the Charter of the UN and as well as its own commitments, and day after day a trampling upon the laws of war and international humanitarian law given the crimes he perpetrates.\nThe international order we built collectively is being attacked.\u00a0 It is therefore not a regional stake.\u00a0 That war concerns us all as the Kremlin is blackmailing the world on energy, food, and in addition to its attacks against the very same principle that allow the states, the members of the international community, to live together, like I\u2019ve said before.\nThis is the reason why we, France, the United States, our allies, our partners made the choice to provide our staunch support to Ukraine by mobilizing all of our levers \u2013 political, economic, financial, humanitarian, and military.\u00a0 We said it on a number of occasions, and let me repeat it here:\u00a0 We will stand by Ukraine as long as necessary, because such is the interest of Europe, such is the interest of the United States, and such is very simply the interest of the world, which Russia is seeking to divide by expanding its imperialist and colonial ambitions.\nWe find strength and efficiency in our unity.\u00a0 The United States once again was here at the historical moment standing by its European friends who share the same democratic values, standing in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian Armed Forces to allow them to resist, and as we\u2019ve seen for a few weeks to even counterattack.\nAnd I would like to mention not just our unity but also another outstanding unity and underline the fact that the European reaction was historical, because confronted with an unprecedented challenge, the European Union was able to use, and quickly so, its full economic, diplomatic, and military strength.\u00a0 We quickly \u2013 very quickly \u2013 mobilized all of our instruments to hinder the Russian war effort.\u00a0 We enacted sanctions, individual sectorial sanctions, massive ones, 48 hours after the invasion, and seven times in a row since then.\nGiven that we even adopted a next package of sanctions, and on Monday, together with my colleagues of the European Union, we also decided to already work on another set of sanctions in case they were necessary.\nAnd together with the Europeans we also decided to gradually put an end to all energy dependency vis-\u00e0-vis Russia which was structural and which we fundamentally revised.\u00a0 As recalled by President Macron, the example of gas is very telling given that the European dependency dropped from 40 to 7 percent dependency vis-\u00e0-vis Russia for the \u2013 the decision taken at the Versailles summit in March.\u00a0 So within a few months we were able to adapt.\nAs you know, the embargo on coal has been in place since August.\u00a0 The one on oil is coming and will be fully in place on the 5th of December.\u00a0 And these measures are efficient, and please allow me to say because sometimes we hear that they are not.\u00a0 It is part of the propaganda by Moscow.\u00a0 But the Russian economy is impacted, already in recession this year, and we\u2019ll be back to where it were in 2000 within two years.\u00a0 So already 20 years lost and already some major part of the industrial Russian sectors in difficulty \u2013 armament, aeronautics, and automobile \u2014 so the sanctions are producing, having an impact.\nFrom a military point of view I would like to say as well that the European action is very \u2013 is determined, and President Macron recently announced to President Zelenskyy that we would step up our military assistance, delivering some new equipment.\u00a0 And you\u2019re probably aware that we are delivering artillery missiles, munitions, as well as a light tanks. \u00a0We also decided to train at least 2,000\u00a0Ukrainian soldiers in France, and we are developing cooperation in the field of intelligence, which will also be stepped up and will go further.\nSo we are doing our part, as needed, and we also provide humanitarian assistance and working on emergency reconstruction, and that will be more necessary than ever as winter approaches.\u00a0 We need to help the Ukrainian people to continue to hold on good, and we see that the Russians are targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine.\nWe are also welcoming and hosting \u2013 even though France is father \u2013 is at the west, but we have millions of Ukrainian refugees who are welcome in France and Europe.\u00a0 The kids can go to school.\u00a0 We mainly receive women and children.\u00a0 Ukrainians can work in Europe.\u00a0 It is a matter of solidarity, and we are honoring it.\u00a0 We\u2019re also providing an economic and financial assistance in the thousands of\u00a0\u2013 billions of Euros provided both by the European Union and member states individually.\nWe\u2019re also providing some concrete support when it comes to the fight against impunity.\u00a0 At the end of September, we were together at the UN Security Council for the first meeting at a ministerial level since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, dealing with the Russian\u00a0\u2013 the Ukrainian issue, and in particular, the fight against impunity.\u00a0 It was necessary to do so.\u00a0 And what we heard very much showed that Russia is very isolated. \u00a0I discussed with the Secretary of State we are providing our support to the International Criminal Court and to the Ukrainian courts so that those who perpetrate crimes in Ukraine are prosecuted as shall be because there will be no peace without justice.\nFrance also is supporting Ukraine, standing by its allies, European allies and within NATO.\u00a0 We resolutely contribute to strengthening the deterrence and defense posture of the east flank, standing by the side of our Baltic, Romanian, and Polish friends, and by deploying some additional troops, some land and air forces.\u00a0 And the European Union itself already released 3\u00a0billion euros, and we are now at 3.5 billion euros for the\u00a0\u2013 to the decision taken on Monday so that the\u00a0\u2013 what we call the European peace facility can provide Ukraine with what it takes to defend itself.\u00a0 It\u2019s basically some delivery of military equipment.\nIt is in these circumstances where\u00a0\u2013 and it will probably still be the case in the long run\u00a0\u2013 that I came, dear Tony, to talk about our bilateral relationship, and in order to prepare as well the state visit of President Macron very soon, in early December, thanks to the invitation extended by President Biden.\u00a0 And I understand that it is the first state visit organized by this administration, so please allow me to say that it is an honor which means a lot, both for my president and my country.\u00a0 The president said it once again when I saw him on Wednesday to prepare for my visit to Washington, D.C.\nSo we are together preparing for this visit in early December, and we intend to use it to show how vivid our alliance is, the oldest alliance, as is customary to often say.\u00a0 We will be working, of course, on implementing the roadmap, defined just a year ago by both our presidents in Rome in the margin of the G20 meeting in the space of energy\u00a0\u2013 in the areas of space and energy, which are strategic sectors for both our countries.\u00a0 And more than ever, we want to build on this new impulse and resolutely move forward in order to meet the challenges around the world.\u00a0 Some of them I\u2019ve just mentioned, but so many others we need to deal with: climate, energy, the Indo-Pacific, the Sahel, or the fight against terrorism.\nSo I believe that on all of these issues, discussions enable us to show that once again there was an outstanding convergence of views.\u00a0 We see each other often, very often, even though I do not so often come to D.C.\u00a0 And to conclude, the new National Security Strategy that was published this week here in the United States only shows that we share some very close analysis and recommendations.\u00a0 So in this context, we believe that this state visit will once again enable us to show how close we are, how willing we are to work together to meet all of these challenges.\nSo once again, Secretary of State, dear Tony, thank you for your warm welcome, thank you for our discussion earlier today, and thank you for all of the good work we have been doing for quite a while and as our countries have been doing for a long term since General Lafayette, George Washington, or Benjamin Franklin.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll say he is watching us and keeping a friendly eye on us.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll now take questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Kylie Atwood of CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Happy afternoon, and thank you guys for taking some questions.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, two questions, one on Iran and one on Russia.\nWe have heard U.S. officials in recent days be very clear in saying that reviving the Iran nuclear deal isn\u2019t a focus for the United States right now.\u00a0 But is it even possible to salvage that deal?\u00a0 Is the United States willing to strike a deal with the Iranian regime after the death of female Iranian protesters and after Iranian weapons shipments to Russia?\u00a0 And Minister Colonna, the same question to you on the French perspective on that.\u00a0 Is it still in the realm of possibility that France wants to revive the Iran nuclear deal?\nSecond question, on Russia and diplomacy.\u00a0 This week the Russian ambassador here in Washington spoke about a quiet channel of diplomacy that was used around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis to avoid a nuclear conflict.\u00a0 Then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the Russian ambassador here were leading that channel.\u00a0 Has the Biden administration studied that model and considered how to replicate something similar to that going forward to try and trigger a diplomatic path out of this war?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, thanks very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to start and then turn it over to Catherine.\nFirst, with regard to Iran broadly, the JCPOA in particular.\u00a0 Look, right now the eyes of the world are on the protests in Iran, the extraordinary courage of young Iranians, especially women, who are standing up at great personal risk for their basic rights, for their basic freedoms, and encountering once again the brutal repression of their government.\u00a0 And as you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps in recent weeks in solidarity with them, in support of them, in support of every Iranian who simply wants the freedom to express their views and to have their voices heard.\nWe\u2019ve taken \u2013 we\u2019ve issued sanctions against the so-called morality police that are the ones who, among other things, are responsible for the death of Mahsa Amini, and of course we\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure, to the best of our ability, that through technology, Iranians can continue to communicate with one another and with the outside world.\u00a0 And that goes to the work that we did to make sure that we had a license in place that allows technology companies as best they can to get the necessary communications technology to Iranians.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where I think the world\u2019s focus is.\nHaving said that, with regard to the JCPOA, two things.\u00a0 First, there\u2019s no imminent agreement, and there\u2019s no imminent agreement because the Iranians continue to inject extraneous issues into the discussions about the JCPOA.\u00a0 And as long as they continue to do that, there is no possibility, no prospect for an agreement.\u00a0 We continue to believe that a diplomatic resolution to the challenge posed by Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains the best way forward, and we continue to be determined that Iran never acquire a nuclear weapon or the capacity to build one, including the fissile material necessary to fuel one.\nThe JCPOA, when it was in existence, was successful in putting Iran\u2019s program \u2013 its nuclear program \u2013 into a box.\u00a0 And unfortunately, in leaving that agreement, it\u2019s allowed Iran to get out of the box that it was in in terms of its nuclear program.\u00a0 We continue to have an interest in seeing that program put back in the box.\u00a0 We continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to do that.\u00a0 But in this moment there is no prospect for an agreement \u2013 again, because Iran continues to inject extraneous issues into the conversations that we\u2019ve had.\u00a0 And the European Union, our partners \u2013 France, Germany, the United Kingdom \u2013 are all in the same place when it comes to that.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say on this:\u00a0 With or without a deal \u2013 and this was true when the deal was in effect; it\u2019s been true since the deal has no longer been in effect \u2013 with or without it, we will continue to take every step necessary to deal with Iran\u2019s activities, Iran\u2019s aggression, whether it\u2019s in the Middle East or beyond.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeing that now with the provision of UAVs to Russia to help it continue its aggression against the Ukrainian people.\nWith regard to Russia and diplomacy, before I turn it to Catherine, we have been very clear that whenever we have something that it\u2019s important to communicate to the Russians, we\u2019ll do it, and we\u2019ve done it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had occasion to speak to Foreign Minister Lavrov on specific issues that were important to our own security.\u00a0 Other colleagues \u2013 including the Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor \u2013 have communicated with their counterparts, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.\nWhen it comes to diplomacy to end the war, it depends entirely on whether Russia gets to a place where it\u2019s actually interested in stopping the aggression that it started, and we\u2019ve seen no evidence of that in this moment.\u00a0 On the contrary, we see Russia doubling and tripling down on its aggression: in the last month, the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of Russians; horrifically, cannon fodder that Putin is trying to throw into the war.\u00a0 For the 300,000 Russians that had purportedly been mobilized, more than that number have fled the country to avoid having to go to Ukraine.\nSecond, of course, this effort to have the sham referenda and then annex Ukrainian territory, which was rejected by virtually the entire world, 143 countries; now, a horrific bombing campaign against critical civilian infrastructure, against \u2013 as Catherine said \u2013 the facilities across the country that are trying to generate electricity and power for the country to keep the lights on, to keep people warm during the winter \u2013 brutalizing the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 So every indication is that, far from being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy, President Putin continues to push in the opposite direction.\u00a0 The fundamental problem he has is that not only are the Ukrainian people extraordinarily courageous and resilient, they\u2019re also very successful in not only repelling the aggression but taking their land back.\nAnd it all comes down to what I\u2019ve been saying for some time, which is that, with the assistance that we\u2019ve been providing, with the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people, the fundamental difference maker is that Ukrainians are fighting for their country, for their land, for their future.\u00a0 Russia is not.\u00a0 The sooner President Putin understands that and comes to that conclusion, the sooner we\u2019ll be able to end this war.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMR. PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Kylie, we need \u2013 we need to go on to the Foreign Minister, please.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0We \u2013 we\u2019ll \u2013 we consider and will consider every means to advance diplomacy if we see an opening to advance it by whatever means.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019ll always look at it.\u00a0 But as I said, in this moment, Russia shows no signs of being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy by any means.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your question regarding Iran.\u00a0 I say we\u2019re pretty much aligned on this one as well.\u00a0 Let me switch to French on the JCPOA.\n(Via interpreter) Regarding the JCPOA, the Secretary of State responded in detail.\u00a0 A proposal was made to Iran, so that is some very long negotiations.\u00a0 The proposal aims at dealing with the Iranian nuclear situation, which is serious \u2013 very serious.\u00a0 This proposal has not so far been approved by Iran even though we told them there would be no better offer on the table and that it is for \u2013 it belongs to Iran to take a decision and to accept this offer if they can.\u00a0 And President Macron went as far as meeting President Raisi in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York to find out about his mindset.\u00a0 And unfortunately, we could only acknowledge that Iran at the moment was not willing to accept this proposal.\u00a0 So it is for this country to make a decision.\nSecond, and like the Secretary of State, I would like to say how concerned we all by the violence that is being used by the Iranian authorities against demonstrators, people who demonstrate peacefully so \u2013 on a number of occasions.\u00a0 And quickly we condemn this brutal repression against demonstrators.\u00a0 We also recalled the fundamental right of citizens to demonstrate peacefully, to peacefully express their opinion.\u00a0 We also demanded all citizens to be set free.\u00a0 There are a number of French citizens being held in Iran and others.\u00a0 We took a number of sanctions on behalf of the European Union against those responsible for the repression.\nSo that\u2019s been done, and more recently this week, given the support provided by Iran to the criminal action of Russia in Ukraine by way of kamikaze UAVs that were used again only a few days ago, we have at a ministerial level adopted some additional sanctions \u2013 and they are now enforced \u2013 sanctions against those responsible for these armament programs.\nAnd let me say that these UAVs that were used once again this week \u2013 against the civilian \u2013 civil infrastructures and civilians in Ukraine \u2013 this is not only in breach of the commitments by Iran in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolution, but it is also a war crime because they\u2019re targeting civilians.\u00a0 So this is the reason why we took sanctions.\nMR. PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0S\u00e9bastien Blanc, AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I have two questions, one for each of you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, there are currently tensions between France and Germany.\u00a0 Britain is in turmoil.\u00a0 We have a new prime minister in Italy with a coalition who is \u2013 who disagrees on Ukraine.\u00a0 Are you worried about a lack \u2013 a possible lack of cohesion within Europe at a time when cohesion is very much needed against Russia?\n(Via interpreter) And\u00a0Madame la Ministre, is France going to send a military force or a police force to Haiti, as requested by Prime Minister Ariel Henry?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Everything I\u2019m seeing is the exact opposite of a lack of cohesion.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re showing tremendous solidarity, we\u2019re showing tremendous coordination, tremendous cooperation in everything that we\u2019re doing together to support Ukraine, to continue to put pressure on Russia, as well as to shore up our own alliance, NATO \u2013 defensive alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that in the actions that the EU has just taken, including additional sanctions.\u00a0 We see it in the support that just a week ago more than 40 countries came together through the Ramstein process to continue the coordination in supplying weaponry to Ukraine to allow it to defend itself and to take back its territory.\u00a0 We see it in the assistance that the European Union now is providing directly to Ukraine, including direct budgetary support that will help them get through this economic challenge that they\u2019re facing largely because of the Russian aggression.\nSo everything I\u2019m seeing, both in terms of my own conversations and, importantly, the President\u2019s conversations with his counterpart, as well as in the action that\u2019s being taken, speaks to incredibly strong cohesion, solidarity, commitment to this common effort to help Ukraine defend itself, to stand up not only for Ukrainians against this aggression, but to stand up for the very principles that are at the heart of the United Nations Charter and that are important for countries everywhere around the world \u2013 the basic idea that one country can\u2019t change the borders of another by force, that it can\u2019t simply seize the land it wants or eliminate the independence or sovereignty of a country just because its leader so decides.\nTogether, Europe, the United States are standing strong in defense of those basic principles, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s important not just to our own countries but to countries around the world.\u00a0 And it was further manifested by the fact that with a resolution that was led by the European Union at the UN General Assembly just a week ago, 143 countries stood up together in opposition to what Russia is doing in Ukraine.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you, sir.\u00a0 We support the search for stability for Haiti, a country which is once again plunged into violence and poverty still, and we are well aware of the seriousness of the situation which is in the hands of criminal gangs which are only worsening the situation.\u00a0 So in this respect I would like to commend the adoption today at the Security Council of a unanimous resolution, and it is also interesting when we consider \u2013 when we look at the situation of the global order.\u00a0 So I would like to also commend the efforts deployed by the United States for the adoption and \u2013 the quick adoption of this resolution.\nIf an international support force to the police were to be set up, France would contribute probably materially, even though we still \u2013 by way of equipment we will still have to work on the details.\u00a0 But what is important in the moment is that we continue to deploy efforts at the United Nations for such a force to be deployed.\u00a0 At the moment we\u2019re not yet where we should be to contribute to resolving the problem of Haiti.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Missy Ryan,\u00a0Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thank you.\u00a0 You both mentioned the assistance that France is providing to Ukraine.\u00a0 However, there are some in the U.S. Congress who are increasingly voicing concerns about the fact that the United States is giving so much more economic and military aid to Ukraine than many of its major allies or than all of its major allies in Europe, while countries like France, in turn, are giving less proportionally than countries \u2013 smaller European countries like Estonia.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, do you think that countries \u2013 larger European countries like France and Germany \u2013 should be increasing their contributions to Ukraine?\nAnd also for you, Mr. Secretary, last week President Macron in an interview said that France would not use nuclear weapons in retaliation for a potential Russian nuclear strike on Ukraine.\u00a0 Do you think it\u2019s a good idea to preemptively take that off the table?\nAnd for you, Madam Minster, can you tell us how President Macron\u2019s comments ruling out nuclear retaliation makes France and Europe safer?\u00a0 And do you think there should be a way to take into account the significant contributions that France and other European countries have made in taking in and taking care of Ukrainian refugees to help people in the United States, for example, understand how the contributions may not be what they seem to be on the face of them?\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Missy.\u00a0 With regard to assistance to Ukraine, first, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are making together an extraordinary collective effort.\u00a0 And again, you see that in the security assistance that\u2019s being provided by Europe and by the United States alike.\u00a0 You see it in the economic assistance; you see it in the humanitarian assistance that\u2019s being provided.\u00a0 And if you break it down and add it up, Europe is doing extraordinary things.\u00a0 I just mentioned that this week we saw the European Union moving forward with direct budgetary support in the billions of dollars for the Ukrainian Government, something that we\u2019ve been doing over the summer, but it\u2019s very important and very timely that Europe is now picking up this baton, very important to Ukraine as it tries to get through the winter and get through the months ahead.\nSimilarly, when it comes to the defense support to Ukraine, I could cite what France has done and continues to do, which is absolutely vital to the Ukrainians being able to defend themselves and take back territory.\u00a0 That continues; we talked about it today.\u00a0 And the same thing on the humanitarian support.\u00a0 It\u2019s also true that there are literally millions of Ukrainian refugees in Europe being welcomed by a whole variety of European countries \u2013 the kids going to school, the parents being able to work and getting support.\u00a0 That\u2019s significant; that has to be added to the equation.\u00a0 So this is a collective responsibility that we are undertaking collectively, and one of the things that we\u2019re working on virtually every day is making sure that we\u2019re coordinated, making sure we\u2019re being responsive to the needs, and doing it together.\u00a0 So I\u2019ve been impressed with the \u2013 this collective effort.\u00a0 And based on our conversations and based on conversations with other European colleagues, I have no doubt that that will continue.\nWhen it comes to nuclear weapons, two things.\u00a0 There has been loose talk coming from President Putin and from other Russians about this.\u00a0 It\u2019s the height of irresponsibility, particularly coming from a member of the United Nations Security Council.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we look at very carefully and that we take very seriously given what Russia has already done in Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ve to date seen no reason to change our own nuclear posture, but we will track it very carefully.\u00a0 And let me just say for our part \u2013 I\u2019m not going to speak for France or for anyone else \u2013 we\u2019ve communicated very clearly, very directly to Russia the consequences for any use of a nuclear weapon.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I shall continue with this first topic before moving on to the refugees.\u00a0 Madam, echoing what the Secretary of State just said, when one talks about nuclear weapons, one should talk with genuine measurement, if not prudence.\u00a0 So once again I would like to say that we\u2019re calling upon Russia to act as a responsible power.\u00a0 It is a nuclear power and accordingly it has some specific responsibility: nuclear weapons of deterrence.\u00a0 And I think one we recall \u2013 once we recall that nuclear weapons are weapons of deterrence, it says it all.\u00a0 As to the French doctrine recalled by the president of France, that is \u2013 this is the one.\nMadam, you also asked about the fact that Europe is welcoming millions and millions of refugees from Ukraine, usually women and children.\u00a0 They are being well \u2013 I believe they\u2019re well received.\u00a0 And by hosting them, well, it is a matter of solidarity, it is a matter of humanity.\u00a0 So of course it comes at a cost, but it is normal.\u00a0 And I believe when it was assessed that it is costing some 17 of 18 million euros already, and it will continue.\u00a0 But the \u2013 we will need \u2013 the member states shall continue to support to maintain this effort, but I will not use that as an argument.\u00a0 We should speak about the facts, and like the Secretary of State said, France, the European Union in itself, its member states all sharing \u2013 now shouldering their responsibility.\u00a0 They\u2019re already contributing thousands of millions \u2013 billions of euros to microeconomic support, financial support, humanitarian support, et cetera, not to mention the welcoming the refugees, as I just said.\nAnd one last word.\u00a0 Let us not play in the hands of the Russians.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been incredibly united and they bring \u2013 this is our strength.\u00a0 And I would like to call upon each and every one to say that we stand together to defend the principles of international law, according to which an order based on the rules shall not be challenged the way it is being by Russia.\u00a0 We shall clearly say what is at stake.\u00a0 It is not just the fate of Ukraine or the security of the European continent.\u00a0 It is a matter relevant to all and every single country around the world.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Keely Sullivan, France 2.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Thank you, Minister Colonna, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, if I may, I would actually like to ask you a question in French.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Allons-y.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Okay, okay.\u00a0 (Via interpreter.) I would like to ask about a statement that came out of the White House yesterday, according to which there are some Iranian military present in Crimea supporting the Russians with a number of UAV strikes in Ukraine.\u00a0 Do you consider some new sanctions by the United States or some parallel response?\u00a0 And Madam as well, Madam Minister, further to the sanctions approved by the European Union, do you consider something else further to the statement that came out of the White House?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (In French.)\n(In English) First, we\u2019ve been warning going back to July about Iranian plans to provide UAVs to Russia for use in Ukraine, so this is something that we have been seeing in the works and now we\u2019re seeing in reality.\u00a0 Back in September, a month ago, the Russians moved UAVs that they acquired from Iran into Crimea to use against the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 And, as we\u2019ve said, Russian military personnel in Crimea have been piloting these Iranian UAVs, using them to conduct kinetic strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv just in recent days and against all sorts of civilian infrastructure and civilians themselves.\u00a0 That\u2019s truly deplorable.\u00a0 And yes, we also see Iranian military personnel on the ground in Crimea who are assisting Russia in these operations.\u00a0 We believe that Russia\u2019s received dozens of these UAVs so far from Iran, with more potentially in the works.\nBut beyond consistently warning about this, going back well before the Russian aggression, we\u2019ve been taking action against the provision of UAVs by Iran to anyone that\u2019s using them in an aggressive and dangerous way, whether it\u2019s in Yemen, whether it\u2019s in Iraq, whether it\u2019s potentially against Israel, and other countries.\u00a0 We\u2019ve sanctioned the entities that we can find that are involved with this.\u00a0 There are UAV networks, including sanctions going back to last October.\u00a0 We are interdicting the illicit traffic in arms, including UAVs, wherever we can see them, find them, and interdict them.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that in coordination and cooperation with other countries.\u00a0 And we\u2019re continuing to build up the defenses of our partners, including in Ukraine, against the use of UAVs or any other kinds of weapon systems that Iran may be engaged in.\nSo this is a day-in, day-out effort.\u00a0 It goes back a long time.\u00a0 But it\u2019s now spread to Ukraine through Russia, and we\u2019re determined to stand against it wherever it\u2019s happening.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter.) Thank you, madam. As to the sanctions, like I said, we already adopted eight series of sanctions against the Russian war machine and warmongers, and the sanctions will be stepped up if necessary.\u00a0 And I was saying as well that on Monday, we decided to start working on what could be done if it were necessary.\nBut your question was in relation to Iran, and here again let me recall what we said before.\u00a0 The European Union itself took sanctions against those responsible for repression in Iran, and more recently this week, sanctions against Iran due to the delivery of military equipment to Russia used against Ukraine in breach of the commitments taken by Iran and its commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the international community.\u00a0 There is a UN Security Council resolution that prohibits that, and also for being the accomplice of the war crimes committed, perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine.\nSo these sanctions were decided at a political level on Monday.\u00a0 They were finalized yesterday.\u00a0 And they are legally in force as from today.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nFOREIGN MINISTER COLONNA:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-opening-of-a-new-philadelphia-passport-agency-and-at-a-u-s-citizenship-and-immigration-services-naturalization-ceremony/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Because of your work, this facility will soon be able to process more than 150,000 passports every year.\u00a0 And joining in this effort are individuals, people like Julia Nixon, who has processed passports in Philadelphia for nearly four decades \u2013 starting at a time when she was required to physically paste the photographs inside passports with glue.\u00a0 Things have changed just a little bit since then. (Laughter.)\u00a0 Julia, thank you for your service.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nI want to take advantage of this moment just to do a little further advertising because the State Department is also undertaking other initiatives \u2013 redesigning our passports with stronger security features to deter fraud; making our policies more inclusive so that all people can travel with documents that truly reflect their identities.\nWe\u2019re joined by several family members, as well, of Representative Nix, after whom this facility is named.\u00a0 The son of a former slave, he was the first black person to be elected to represent the city of Philadelphia in Congress; he served the city\u2019s residents from 1956 to 1979.\u00a0 During that time, he served on multiple committees, including Post Office and Civil Service Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\u00a0 So this really connects that beautifully because this facility, which began as a post office connecting Americans to each other as well as to the wider world, now a Passport Agency connecting Americans to the world around them.\nCongressman Nix, as a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, pushed for passage of the landmark legislation on civil rights, including introducing a measure to end racial discrimination in the Armed Forces, and later supporting key voting rights legislation.\u00a0 Across each of these efforts, he tried to make a country that hadn\u2019t always treated him equally a little bit more equal.\nTo the Nix family here today \u2013 grandsons Robert Nix III, Michael, Tony, great grandson Jalen, as well as their own families: we\u2019re honored to have you join us today, join us in recognizing and appreciating the extraordinary legacy of Congressman Nix, his contributions not just to this city, but to our country.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThrough his actions, Representative Nix worked to make sure that the first three words of our Constitution \u2013 a phrase that I suspect everyone in this group knows pretty well by now from your naturalization test \u2013 \u201cWe the People\u201d \u2013 extended their promise to more Americans.\u00a0 And throughout his life, he dedicated himself to the idea that the story of America is one of growth, of inclusion, of constant renewal from within.\nEach and every one of you here today embodies that renewal.\u00a0 This is what makes our country strong.\u00a0 You arrived in America from almost every corner of the world, vastly different backgrounds, different perspectives, different journeys.\nAs a journalist in Belarus, Hanna, who\u2019s here with us today, worked with activists to cover human rights violations that were happening in Belarus.\u00a0 She was persecuted for her work; she escaped to the United States.\u00a0 Today, she and her husband, a registered nurse from Macedonia, are proud homeowners in Delaware next door.\nJimmy, trained as a civil engineer in Honduras, came to the United States when the company that he was working for transferred him here to Philadelphia.\u00a0 His work was so indispensable that the company eventually petitioned for him to stay in the United States.\u00a0 He now lives in Delaware with his wife, Melissa, who teaches Spanish at a private school.\nSung came to the United States to attend graduate school, after which he planned to return home to South Korea to become a software engineer.\u00a0 Along the way, he fell in love with another immigrant: his future wife, who came from China to study in the United States.\u00a0 They now live with their two children, ages nine and five, just outside of Philadelphia.\nThe urge to do better for yourself, to do better for your family, to be part of something bigger than any one person or family, that\u2019s something that shaped my life as well.\nMy grandfather, my father\u2019s father, Maurice Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing pogroms at the turn of the last century in Russia.\nMy stepmother, Vera Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing the communists in her native Hungary.\nAnd my late stepfather, Samuel Pisar, ultimately found a home in America after enduring the horrors of the Holocaust.\u00a0 He was liberated from concentration camps by an American GI.\u00a0 He repaid the gift by dedicating his own life to advocating for human rights, and trying to find common ground among former adversaries.\nIn 1961, he became a citizen of the United States, and here\u2019s what he used to say to me and to other members of our family.\u00a0 \u201cYou,\u201d pointing to me, \u201cyou are an American by happy accident of birth.\u00a0 I am an American by choice.\u201d\nEach of you has made that same choice.\u00a0 And with that decision comes a responsibility borne by every generation of immigrants that have come before you: that of being a citizen, of contributing your ideas, your talent, your energy to your communities.\u00a0 You are now partners in the great unfinished work of making this country better for more of its people \u2013 especially those who will come after you.\nThroughout our nation\u2019s history, we have been enriched time and again by the contributions of immigrants and their children.\nThey influence everything from the art that expands our horizons, to the scientific advancements that move us forward, to the food that we enjoy every single day.\u00a0 In fact, earlier today we made a pit stop by Federal Donuts \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 just a few blocks away.\u00a0 I got a chance to sample a few of the chef\u2019s remarkable achievements \u2013 I even helped to make one\u00a0\u2013 influenced in his case by his Israeli background.\u00a0 Another powerful example of our melting pot.\nImmigrants, as we know, have launched world-renowned companies from Apple to Google, AT&T and Pfizer.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been a key source of our national competitiveness.\u00a0 I was in Silicon Valley just a couple of days ago.\u00a0 More than half of the billion-dollar companies produced in Silicon Valley were founded by an immigrant.\nIn my own department, the State Department, those with immigrant roots are leading vital parts of our foreign policy every single day.\nUzra Zeya, whose family immigrated from India to the United States in the 1960s.\u00a0 She now helps uphold human rights around the world as our Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights.\nJulieta Noyes, whose parents fled repression in Cuba.\u00a0 She now helps support persecuted and vulnerable people around the world as our Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.\nAnd Sarah Majzoub, whose parents immigrated from Lebanon, established a successful architectural firm in the United States.\u00a0 She\u2019s now one of my closest aides in my office; she\u2019s a crucial part of making sure that I\u2019m as well-prepared as I can be each and every day.\nSimply put, we could not do American diplomacy without them and without so many other colleagues, who started someplace else and are now here as Americans.\u00a0 And we wouldn\u2019t want to.\u00a0 Our foreign policy is stronger, it\u2019s more effective, because of their service.\u00a0 We come from the most diverse country on Earth.\u00a0 We\u2019re operating in a world that\u2019s incredibly diverse.\u00a0 By definition, this diversity is the source of our strength, and if we\u2019re not making full use of it, we\u2019re shortchanging ourselves.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working every day to make sure that we are making full use of our diversity.\nHere at this Passport Agency in Philadelphia, there\u2019s a mural called The Seeker, by Philadelphia-based artist Michelle Angela Ortiz, who we\u2019re fortunate to have with us today.\u00a0 And I saw her a little bit earlier.\nIt depicts three large circles. \u00a0I hope you get a chance to see it.\u00a0 The first two circles show a host of memories: a girl reconnecting with her grandmother in Korea; a wedding in Jamaica; postcards from Panama, among many others.\nAnd then the third circle shows a young woman, \u201cthe seeker,\u201d who\u2019s looking at these memories\u00a0\u2013 which reflect a tiny sampling of the many experiences that the immigrants carry with them from a past land \u2013 looking at these memories as she forges her path in the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s an experience that binds so many of us together in this country.\u00a0 Here \u2013 as the paper that she\u2019s holding in her hands reads \u2013 we become \u201cout of many, one.\u201d\nSo I hope that you too carry your past with pride, that you share your experiences from your home countries with your new communities.\u00a0 The diverse tapestry of this country is enriched by these perspectives, these experiences, by your citizenship, by your very being.\nSo finally and simply put, I want to say thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for choosing us.\u00a0 Thank you for making that choice.\u00a0 On behalf of the American people, let me be one of the first lucky people to say:\u00a0 Welcome home, my fellow Americans.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Applause.)\nMR SPALTER:\u00a0 All right, good afternoon.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Good afternoon.\nMR SPALTER:\u00a0 Twenty-four candidates from 17 countries came here today to pledge allegiance to the United States of America.\u00a0 Candidates, I will now call the names of your country of nationality.\u00a0 I ask that you please stand and remain standing until all countries have been called.\nAlbania.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBelarus.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBhutan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Bhutan?\nMR SPALTER:\u00a0 Bhutan.\u00a0 There you go.\nChina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nGuinea.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHonduras.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIraq.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nJamaica.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nLiberia.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNepal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe Philippines.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nRussia.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSouth Korea.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTrinidad and Tobago.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTunisia.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUkraine.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd Uzbekistan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nGood afternoon, Secretary Blinken.

This was a post office before \u2013 as Philadelphia\u2019s (inaudible) post office, before it became now the passport agency.

Borlaug International Dialogue", "location": "Des Moines, Iowa", "date": "October 18, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDR. CARY FOWLER: Thank you, Barbara. It\u2019s such an honor to be with all of you today in this place on this day. Years ago, I attended a lecture by Jack Harlan. Dr. Harlan was a geneticist. He was a plant explorer. He was an agricultural historian. Worked at the University of Illinois most of his career.\nAnd the lecture was entitled Self-Perception and The Origins of Agriculture. I\u2019ll never forget it. His point was that how you believe agriculture began has a lot to do with who you are with the perch you occupy in life.\nIf you are an academic you might be tempted to think, well, agriculture must have been invented or discovered by some particularly clever person about 12,000 years ago. If you were very religiously inclined, you would think well, it was a gift from the gods. In most religions, in fact, have a story to explain the origins of Agriculture.\nLikewise today, I think how we understand the current global food crisis and certainly the solutions that we tout, these have to do with who we are and what perch we occupy. If your only tool is a hammer, you will\u2013 you know how that ends.\nSo, I\u2019m certainly as vulnerable to myopia as anyone, I realized that. I realized that the current crisis is as Barbara mentioned, multi-causal. There\u2019s COVID. There\u2019s climate. There\u2019s conflict. But there are also a lot of other things, very high fuel prices, a fertilizer situation, export bans, low, by historical standpoints, grain stockpiles, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut I cannot personally shake the belief that on the list of the 5, or list of the top 10 most important challenges that we face in regards to food security. That climate is 1, 3, 5. When I became executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust back in 2005, I remember saying at my very first staff meeting that this was a climate change organization. I think they thought I was a crazy at that time. But it was a climate change organization because climate changes everything.\nLast month was the 453rd consecutive month in which the global average temperature for that month exceeded the 20th century average. 453 consecutive months of above average temperatures. Of course, higher average temperatures are not the only thing that\u2019s happening with climate change. We\u2019re having more extremes. We\u2019re having longer periods of hot weather.\nAnd this is causing species to migrate. And so, we\u2019re in the midst of seeing new and unique combinations of species in the field\u2013 in agricultural fields around the world. We\u2019re going to have some surprises. They\u2019re not all going to be good ones.\nTake a look at this histogram just briefly. The blue bars there representing a historical distribution of average growing season temperatures in Zambia. The legend is a little bit missing for the red bars. But the red bars are the projection for what will happen between 2040 and 2060.\nAnd what you\u2019ll notice, and I\u2019ll draw your attention to is where they overlap. What this means is that in the future, the best growing seasons of the future will closely resemble the worst of the past. Let that sink in. If you go out in time a little bit further, you\u2019ll see how they actually, almost completely diverge.\nThis is the type of situation that we are going to be dealing with in the future. And I think that the assumption that we can somehow look into the rearview mirror for guidance about the future and that crop production is going to magically continue its historic upward trend. Why?\nBecause well, of course, we need it to.\nThis assumption has really outlived its usefulness. Should we worry about maize and wheat and rice and soy? Absolutely. But these are the crops that are attracting and have attracted historically the most research funding. So, I\u2019m worried about everything else as well about the not so minor, minor crops. These are what you might call orphan crops. They\u2019re orphan crops because they have a lot of potential, but we haven\u2019t been investing in them.\nRoots and tubers, fruits and vegetables, the minor millets, teff, on and on. The crops that are so vitally important for nutrition if you think about nutrition as being more than calories. For many of these crops, there are very few plant breeders. For some crops like yams, for example, there are probably fewer than 10 plant breeders in the entire world. And a lot of crops, perhaps half of the crops that are grown today, have never had a single Mendelian trained plant breeder working on them throughout agricultural history.\nSo, we justifiably I think will focus on how many people do yams feed. But increasingly, I think what we have to ask ourselves is, how many people do yams depend on. And in this case, it\u2019s not many.\nSo how is it that crops evolve? Well, they\u2019re domesticated. Think about that word, domicile, domestic. They\u2019ve entered the home. Their future is literally in our hands. Their adaptation is in our hands.\nThey adapt by formal plant breeding and/or by farmers making selections based on diversity, or they don\u2019t adapt at all. So, we may want to learn a little bit from our own history in the United States. After all, when wheat came to the United States from the Near East, when soy came from Asia, when potatoes migrated northward from the Andes, when sorghum came from Africa, think about it.\nWhen all of these crops first came to the United States, they were experiencing climate change from their native habitats. How did they evolve? How was it that they came to be grown under over such vast acreages in the United States? The answer lies in the selection that farmers made with the diversity that our own government provided them potentially particularly back in the 1800s.\nI will go backwards here for a second. Yeah. So, I think that aside from the top five crops that we have in the world today, basically all of our crops are orphan crops in the countries in which they\u2019re grown. Ideally, I think what we should be doing is to identify the crops that are or could be most important for nutrition. We should be assessing how climate change will affect them. And then with this foundation, we should be ramping up to help those crops, those domesticated crops, those crops in our hands to cope with the climate change that\u2019s on our doorstep right now.\nWe luckily have great resources in the gene banks around the world. We have perhaps 1.5 million to 2 million unique samples of crop diversity that wait to be explored and exploited for the challenge that lies ahead with climate change. Now, in closing, I want to take you back into history a little bit and I want to mention three incredibly important things that happened in a single year in the 1800s, and that year is 1859.\nThe first thing that happened was that in 1859, Edwin Drake drilled the first commercial oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania. The second thing that happened, happened at the hands of this man named John Tyndall in the UK. John Tyndall in the laboratory discovered and proved that CO2 traps heat. And thus, he in a sense discovered the greenhouse effect that was about to be created by the first slide that I showed you about the drilling of oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania.\nAnd the third thing, of course, was the publication in 1859 of Charles Darwin\u2019s book \u201cOn the Origin of Species by Natural Selection\u201d. Darwin put together four basic steps or ingredients that you have to have for evolution, otherwise known as adaptation. We \u2013 he understood that there was inheritance, and that there was diversity. The first chapter of \u201cOrigin of Species\u201d is called variation under domestication. It was about agricultural crops and domesticated species.\nIf you have inheritance which we do, if you have diversity and if you have natural selection working on that diversity, then over time you have adaptation. Well, we still have inheritance, we do have diversity, we still have natural selection, but we don\u2019t have a lot of is time at the moment. And that\u2019s where-we come in.\nThe first two of these events from 1859 presaged the crisis of climate change and food security. The third points to a solution that we have yet fully to grasp. And that solution at least in part and here\u2019s where I acknowledge my own myopia has to do with crop diversity.\nThe very ending of origin of Species by Darwin in his last paragraph he sums up the book and his feelings about what he has uncovered. That last paragraph is to me, it\u2019s like a Bach cantata. It is rich and it is exquisite. And I want to read that last paragraph to you in closing.\nDarwin says, \u201cThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one\u2013 and that, while this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed laws of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.\u201d My friends, I submit to you that this is what we need to keep alive if we hope to have food security in a climate changing world. Thank you.\nBARBARA STINSON: Have a seat.\nDR. FOWLER: OK. Thank you. Pretty warming.\nBARBARA STINSON: We have a few more minutes. So, we\u2019re going to continue the conversation just a bit. Thank you so much for your comments and perspective that you bring in global crop diversity, coming to this position now at the State Department. Just say a little bit about your position as Special Envoy to Global Food Security, it\u2019s a recent appointment. And what is on your agenda as you proceed these especially in these first few months.\nDR. FOWLER: OK. Well, if you were to read the job description that I finally found in the global food security strategy, I don\u2019t want you to look at it because you\u2019ll blame me for anything going wrong.\nBARBARA STINSON: OK. Fair enough.\nDR. FOWLER: It\u2019s a humbling position. It\u2019s\u2013 it is the\u2013 I guess the highest ranking position at the State Department dealing with global food security. So we have a lot to do with diplomacy issues, with coordination, and collaboration with other departments and agencies.\nI think what\u2013 what I have wanted to bring to the position, however, is a more long term view. There is obviously a great deal of attention that gets focused on the immediate humanitarian side of the food crisis. And I don\u2019t begrudge people working on that at all.\nBut I think we have to realize that the humanitarian need is going to overwhelm us unless we put into place the kinds of programs that will help ramp up agricultural production. So people\u2013 countries around the world can be more self-sufficient. So, we\u2019re very interested at the State Department and my office in looking at initiatives that I think will pay off in a big way. The moonshot kind of initiatives that have a lot of cost benefit.\nAnd in that regard, I\u2019ll just mention that we will be trying to be a catalyst for what I mentioned from the podium about assessing crops, importance to nutrition, about their effect, their impact\u2013 the impact that climate change is having, and about trying to catalyze programs in the future that will help those crops adapt to climate change.\nBARBARA STINSON: Wonderful. Well, it\u2019s great to hear that perspective on the work that\u2019s ahead of you. And I really appreciate it in your comments both your advice not necessarily to be able to look into the rearview mirror to find the answers but also to consider 1859 and those seminal events that you mentioned.\nSo, let\u2019s talk just a little bit about the assessment charge that you\u2019re taking up assessing the impact on crops of climate change. This is the business of Cynthia Rosenzweig and those at NASA and the GISS, the Goddard Institute, and particularly her argument project. Can you just say a little bit about the assessment not only of impact on nutrition of climate change but some of the other aspects that you\u2019re hoping to focus on.\nDR. FOWLER: Yeah. Well, yes. Obviously, climate change is having a huge impact already on nutrition. It has deleterious impacts on the actual nutrition of our crops. It lowers the nutritional value of a lot of our crops.\nBut looking forward, one of the things that\u2019s amazed me and frustrated me, frankly, is looking at projections of future food demand. You can go in the academic literature, and you\u2019ll find many, many articles out there about what the food demand is going to be in 2050. Generally speaking, we need to produce 50% to 60% more food by 2050.\nAnd very often, those same articles will give a projection of how much food we will produce. And that\u2019s where the reference to the rearview mirror comes in because I think for the most part, we are looking in the rearview mirror when we project future food production. And you can see the projections being roughly in the realm of 50% more about 2050.\nIf you want to scare yourself though look at the footnotes. And the footnotes will say, well, this projection doesn\u2019t take into consideration climate change, conflict, food, and price inflation, et cetera, et cetera. In other words, all the things that we\u2019re having today.\nIf you in turn go to some of the climate people and look at\u2013 at what they\u2019re projecting for individual crops, well, you see that May\u2019s experts will tell you that one degree centigrade increase in climate will increase pest and disease damage by 10% to 20%. And in some areas of Africa, you can get the projection that well by 2050 with the climate change that they\u2019re looking at there, we won\u2019t be producing 50% more food, we\u2019ll be producing 10% less, and that\u2019s a big variance.\nSo, I think that perhaps one of the things that we can do at the State Department we\u2019re not an implementing agency. We don\u2019t have these types on the ground. Programs is to sound the alarm and to say that let\u2019s be careful. Let\u2019s not make assumptions about future food production.\nLet\u2019s look at what the needs are going to be in the future. And let\u2019s plan backwards from that. And let\u2019s put the programs and the investments in place that we really need to ensure that we can produce the food to feed everyone.\nTremendous perspective really to offer. Can you say a little bit more about the orphan crops \u2013 about the crops that have been considered minor crops and yet we know we need to emphasize that diversity in production going forward. How do you see it?\nWell, I think there are actually two categories at least in my mind of orphan crops. And the first category are of really important crops that we don\u2019t think of as being orphans, but they are. So, that would be anything other than the top four or five crops.\nCrops that are receiving some investment and are very popular and well-known crops, sorghum would be one. Frankly speaking, potatoes and sweet potatoes. And a lot of those types of crops and virtually all the vegetables would be in that category. Simply not receiving the amount of investment that they deserve if you\u2019re considering food security as being as nutrition as being central to food security.\nThe second category that worries me even more would be crops that we take totally for granted. This would be African leafy greens, for example. Crops that are part of the household gardens and developing countries for which there are no plant breeders at all.\nAnd here again, we have to be careful about the assumptions we\u2019re making. Are we assuming that those crops magically are going to be adapted to climates that have never before existed in the history of agriculture simply because we want them to and need them to. That to me is a dangerous assumption. So, we do need to be devoting some attention to those crops as well because they\u2019re disproportionately I think important\u2013 particularly to women, to children because of the supply of micronutrients and very often grown in household gardens.\nBARBARA STINSON: Well, thank you so much. I know everyone appreciates hearing not only your in-depth scientific experience that you bring but that broad policy and diplomatic role that you\u2019ll have in your position. We\u2019re coming up to COP 27. Tell us a little bit about the United States \u2013 not an official position but really what do you\u2013 what are you expecting coming up next month.\nDR. FOWLER: Well, I think COP 27 offers all of us an enormous opportunity to look at the question of crop adaptation\u2013 agricultural systems adaptation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that agriculture hasn\u2019t been let\u2019s say given its due at many of the previous cops, but now here we are. And I think we really have to take advantage of this because frankly, if our agricultural systems don\u2019t adapt to climate change, if our crops don\u2019t adapt to climate change, our crops being on the front lines, if they don\u2019t adapt to climate change, then neither will we.\nAnd so all of our hopes and dreams if you\u2019re an environmentalist or whatever, we\u2019ll, really go down the tubes if we don\u2019t have a successful agricultural system. At the end of the day, we all know that people will do what they need to do to try to feed themselves and their families. And there are many studies out there that will tell you that low productivity agricultural systems lead to environmental degradation.\nIt was only the middle of the 1980s when we saw quite a historic transformation. In the middle of the 1980s for the first time in human history that we were producing more food, the incremental amounts that we were producing every year came from intensification of Agriculture rather than cutting down trees and expanding our croplands. Do we want to go back to what has been the most historically prominent way of increasing food production, which is to cut down more trees and expand cropland or are we satisfied with the route that we\u2019re on now, which is to make better use of the resources that we already have? And I think that\u2019s a message that needs to get out at COP 27.\nBARBARA STINSON: Food productivity over just flat food production.\nDR. FOWLER: Yeah.\nBARBARA STINSON: Well, thank you so much for all of these perspectives. I want to connect part of what you\u2019re talking about with regard to adaptation and the mitigation opportunities within agriculture to the work that Cynthia Rosenzweig is doing and the sessions that we\u2019ll have tomorrow to really explore that the assessment potential of the models that are being used worldwide already. And I just\u2013 I want to thank you for rooting us in history in this conversation.\nI know you\u2019ve laid out some themes that we\u2019ll draw on throughout the discussion. So, thank you so much for your time today and for being with us. And you\u2019re here with us throughout the week, I think.\nDR. FOWLER: I am.\nBARBARA STINSON: I appreciate that.\nDR.

highlighting the ESMA Site Museum in Buenos Aires and its importance to the process of memory, truth, and justice in Argentina.\u00a0 I want to thank Ambassador Arguello for this invitation and the dedication of the Embassy of Argentina staff.\nThe United States applauds Argentina\u2019s recognition of the atrocities that took place during its last military dictatorship.\u00a0 We understand that confronting a painful past is a difficult process but one that is critical to address the need for justice and reconciliation.\u00a0 The steps Argentina has taken in this regard, including criminal trials of former members of the military, demonstrate how far your country has come.\u00a0 Steps to address the human rights violations of the past, in combination with all the complementary work that has been done over the years to seek justice for victims and survivors, demonstrate the unrelenting courage and strength of the Argentinian people and their commitment to human rights.\nBeing a present-day champion of human rights requires addressing the human rights violations of the past.\u00a0 In the case of the ESMA premises, this means acknowledging the horrific acts that were perpetrated there and honoring the memory of the individuals who were kidnapped, tortured, and disappeared, as well as the countless children who were \u201cstolen.\u201d\u00a0 By sensitively preserving the site as a memorial to those individuals, your government is bearing witness to human rights violations and condemning the acts that were committed there.\nI want to applaud the cooperation between the Government of Argentina and Argentine civil society on the ESMA project.\u00a0 The ESMA memorial and what it represents would not have been possible without the work of groups like the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who kept pressure on previous administrations to prioritize transparency and justice for the victims.\nHonoring the memory of those who suffered unspeakable abuses and those who were disappeared not only provides a measure of justice to their loved ones but serves as reminder to future generations that human rights and democracy must remain at the core of our two countries\u2019 domestic politics and foreign policy.\u00a0 It is in this spirit that we look forward to further cooperation in our multilateral initiatives to prioritize human rights in the western hemisphere and throughout the world, in the OAS, the Human Rights Council, and beyond.\nThe United States and Argentina, of course, already work closely on many shared values \u2013 transparency, justice, human rights, and democracy.\u00a0 Our partnership to promote and protect the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons, strengthen worker rights in global supply chains, combat antisemitism and promote racial equity, and support transitional justice and accountability is extremely important not only for Argentina but also for the world.\u00a0 Our human rights collaboration has shined a light on violations occurring in Syria, Ukraine, and Sri Lanka, to name a few, and it serves as an example to every country on what upholding universal human rights standards and the tenets of the UN Charter are all about.\nI would also like to commend Argentina for your commitment to inclusive democracy where all individuals are valued, respected and included in the governing process.\u00a0 Throughout this Summit for Democracy Year of Action, I encourage us to remain focused on ensuring that our democracies deliver for all of our people, and we welcome Argentina\u2019s leadership in this regard.\nAmbassador Arguello, in visiting this space you and your staff have created here, and in reflecting on the abuses suffered by thousands of men, women and children at the former ESMA site in Buenos Aires, I think once more of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo\u2014the \u201cAbuelas\u201d\u2014who reminded us that it is our duty to keep the memory, to keep talking tirelessly, to clarify and spread the truth, and to enlighten the minds of those who still refuse to understand.\nAmbassador, thank you once again for inviting me to be present at the dedication of this powerful and moving memorial space.\n\n"}, {"url":

"speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Hoover Institution", "location": "Stanford University, Stanford, California", "date": "October 17, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY MATTIS: Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s event, a conversation between former Secretary of State Dr. Condoleezza Rice and our current Secretary of State Tony Blinken. At a time when America is navigating its role in a changing world, today\u2019s talk in the finest tradition of the great university where we meet offers a unique opportunity to delve into important issues.\nI\u2019m Jim Mattis, a Fellow here at Hoover, where we seek to improve the human condition by advancing ideas that promote economic opportunity while safeguarding peace. Thanks to their record of devoted service to our nation, little introduction is needed for these two patriots. America is one great, big, promising, exasperating, inspiring, and vexing experiment with all the political volatility inherent to a free and open society.\nAdmired leadership in our republic calls for certain characteristics: first, a humble awareness of each generation\u2019s responsibility to improve on this experiment in forming a more perfect union; and second, competence. The two citizens on this stage are exemplars of both characteristics. Dr. Rice\u2019s contribution over many years of leadership cannot be summed up in a few words. Suffice that through merit, conviction, and a keen perceptiveness of the world we must live in, she rose to the apex of our government, ultimately splitting eight years of leadership between service as our National Security Advisor and as our 66th Secretary of State. We\u2019re proud to call her boss and coach of the Hoover team.\nSecretary Blinken has also accumulated a lengthy portfolio of foreign affairs experience before becoming our Secretary of State. It wasn\u2019t long after graduation from Harvard and Columbia that he entered government service, ultimately serving as the Deputy National Security Advisor and Deputy Secretary of State following his time on Capitol Hill, where he served as the staff director for the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee.\nIn a recent talk with graduates, he suggested that if they\u2019re going to spend a lot of their lives at work, then they should work at something they love. Our nation is fortunate that both these leaders devote their best efforts to something they love, and that is America. In so doing, their leadership by example reminds each of us that government service in a democracy is both privilege and responsibility. As problem solvers during these tumultuous years, their leadership forged trust while navigating maddeningly complex issues. Holding our values foremost, they have dealt pragmatically with a swiftly changing world filled by the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nThey have done so while listening and maintaining respect for those who disagreed with them, strengthening a necessary attribute for leadership in a democracy. Today\u2019s discussion will focus on the evolution and importance of technology, diplomacy, and national security \u2013 familiar topics here in Silicon Valley and highly relevant across our nation and round the world.\nHoover Institution was established to advance the principles of freedom. We ask bold questions and propose solutions to help guide American policy at home and abroad. In that spirit and consistent with Stanford\u2019s role of promoting the free competition of ideas, let\u2019s get started. First a conversation, then Q&A. Again, please give a hearty welcome to Secretaries Blinken and Rice. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY RICE: Well, thank you very much. But before we get started, I just have to say that that gentleman, Secretary Mattis, served as our Secretary of Defense but also many years of service as a Marine, something also carried by a great patron of this place, George Shultz. And so I\u2019d like you to give Secretary Mattis a hand, please. (Applause.)\nWelcome. Welcome to Stanford. Welcome to Hoover. Welcome to the Silicon Valley.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It\u2019s wonderful to be back. Thank you.\nSECRETARY RICE: And it\u2019s probably nice to be here, right?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: There\u2019s something about occasionally getting out of Washington that isn\u2019t a bad thing. (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah, it\u2019s a good thing. A good thing, right. (Laughter.)\nWell, we\u2019re going to have a conversation and then we will open for a few questions and answers. I\u2019m still a professor; I will call on somebody if nobody raises their hand \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 so get ready with your questions.\nYou\u2019ve just had a pretty momentous week, and I don\u2019t just mean what\u2019s going on in the world, but I mean the release of the National Security Strategy. And for those who don\u2019t fully follow these things, I think the National Security Strategy is an opportunity for the President to really ask his team: What should we be doing now to prepare for a better future? And the National Security Strategy has a number of elements that I\u2019d like you to speak to, and I\u2019m going to start with one that\u2019s kind of near and dear to the heart of every secretary of state probably going back to our long-long-time predecessor Thomas Jefferson. In case you didn\u2019t know it, he was the first secretary of state.\nBut you start with talking about American values but also the competition between autocracy and democracy. Can you expand a little bit on how you think about this moment? The United States has had many competitors across its history, but this particular moment, how do you think about this big issue?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, first let me just say how wonderful it is to be back at Stanford, to be with my friend Dr. Rice. Jim, I\u2019ve been an admirer of yours and your leadership for many, many years, and today you again reaffirmed why you have such a strong, powerful, eloquent voice. It\u2019s great to be with you. Thank you.\nAnd first of all, I\u2019m wondering: Do you have classes? (Laughter.) What \u2013 are you getting credit? (Laughter.)\nOne of the things that I think is almost visceral to us right now is that we\u2019re at an inflection point. And to put it in broad perspective, the post Cold War era is over and there is now an intense competition underway to shape what comes next. That\u2019s the moment we think that we\u2019re living in.\nPart of this is the renewed but also new great power competition, and that\u2019s very much at the heart of the strategy. Part of this is trying to figure out ways, and in ways that we haven \u2018t before, how to solve some really big challenges that are actually having a direct impact on the lives of our people, whether it is global health \u2013 and we\u2019ve been living through COVID \u2013 whether it\u2019s the impact of climate change, whether it\u2019s just the role of all of the emerging technologies, so many of them coming from here, that are shaping our lives. All of that is reflected in the strategy.\nNow, this is \u2013 Dr. Rice and I both worked on a few of these in our time. Rarely have so many labored for so long \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: And you can drop the Dr. Rice if you \u2013 right, right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. But rarely \u2013 I think we would both say rarely have so many in government worked for so long on something read by so few. (Laughter.) But having said that, it is an important document because it does try to give coherence to what we\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s important across the government so that all of the different agencies and departments are kind of working off of the same blueprint, and internationally so that both friend and foe alike have a good idea about what we\u2019re all about, why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing, why we\u2019re saying what we\u2019re saying.\nSECRETARY RICE: You talked about the great power rivalry, and this is something that I don\u2019t think we really ever thought we would see again after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But indeed it has come back and it\u2019s come back with force, and I\u2019d like you to address the two big rivals.\nThe National Security Strategy talks about restraining Russia and outcompeting China, and that\u2019s two very different ways to think about the great powers. So \u2013 and perhaps you want to weave a little bit of Ukraine into the Russia story, but can you start with restraining Russia \u2013 some would say a declining power in the great power competition, but one that is on the front pages now every day?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think declining power is probably a fair assessment, but one that has an enormous capacity if it chooses to use it to do damage, to be a disrupter. And of course, we see that front and center on our front pages every day in Ukraine.\nWhen we started out \u2013 and again, we\u2019ve both been dealing with this for a long time, and Condi knows more \u2013 has in a sense forgotten more about Russia than I\u2019ll know for many years of working these issues. I think many administrations have come in with the hope that we might have a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia precisely because we have so many big things that we want to be working on that go to the betterment of the lives of our people and people around the world.\nHowever, Russia \u2013 especially under President Putin \u2013 is a major disrupter and one that can make tremendous trouble. We see that in Ukraine. But we see it in its basic opposition and Putin\u2019s basic opposition to the order that emerged after two World Wars and then after the Cold War with a basic set of rules and principles that we thought were necessary to try to help keep international peace and security.\nThis is in direct opposition to what President Putin is trying to do in reconstituting \u2013 take your pick \u2013 a Russian empire or a Soviet one. And it\u2019s manifesting itself in the actions he\u2019s taken. We\u2019ve seen this play out over the last almost decade now. But for us \u2013 and I\u2019ll just say this very briefly \u2013 the reason there\u2019s so much focus on Ukraine is twofold. One is Ukraine itself. I think it bothers all of us profoundly when one country tries to lord it over another, when it tries to assert a world in which might makes right, in which it changes borders by force, in which it tries to subjugate another country to its will. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\nBut what\u2019s also going in this: It\u2019s not only an aggression against Ukraine. It is an aggression against the basic principles that are embodied in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a whole series of norms and rules that many generations labored to build. And are they perfect? Far from it. Have we made many mistakes both in designing them and in their application? Yes. But fundamentally they have helped make sure that we didn\u2019t have another global conflict after two world wars. And what Russia is doing, what Putin is doing, is in direct opposition to those.\nSECRETARY RICE: It\u2019s not your job exclusively, but there are Americans who say: Why Ukraine? Why not Peoria or Des Moines? And you just talked about the rules-based order. Can you sharpen it for Americans as to why this conflict is so important? Because this may go on a while, and we may have to sustain American support and therefore democratic support for a long time.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: At least from my perspective, if we and others are not standing up for these basic understandings, these basic rules, the idea that countries\u2019 independence should be respected, its territorial integrity should be respected, not changed by force; if we don\u2019t stand up for that \u2013 and we can do that in a variety of ways, which we can come to \u2013 if we don\u2019t stand up to that where it\u2019s being challenged, then the risk you have is opening a Pandora\u2019s box, where aggressors \u2013 not just in Europe, not just Russia \u2013 will take a lesson and say: I can act with impunity; I can do this. And that\u2019s going to stir up conflicts in many parts of the world.\nAnd the one thing we know from history is that inevitably, one way or another, this pulls us in. And if we can do whatever we can to prevent rather than having to respond and to make sure that some of these rules are upheld \u2013 even as we try to modernize them even as we try to make sure that they reflect the world that we\u2019re living in, not just the world that they were written in, which in many cases was 70 years ago \u2013 I think it\u2019s clearly in our interest to do that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to show in Ukraine.\nSECRETARY RICE: Right. Let\u2019s talk about the other great power. I\u2019ll come to a regional power in a moment, but let\u2019s talk about the great power, China. Big party congress going on. Lots at stake. Xi Jinping is likely to be coronated for his third term. And he\u2019s been a little bit of a different Chinese leader. It used to be said of Chinese leaders, when I was there \u2013 Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin before him \u2013 \u201chide and bide.\u201d Just keep developing China \u2013 the Chinese would always say, \u201cOh, we\u2019re just a developing country; we don\u2019t really do foreign policy.\u201d\nWell, Xi Jinping has a quite different view of China\u2019s role. And 30-plus years of kind of a integrationist narrative about China seems to be coming apart. You\u2019ve called it \u201coutcompeting\u201d China, which I think is an interesting concept. So talk about China and the United States in this regard.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, you\u2019re exactly right. We\u2019ve seen a very different China emerge in recent years under Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership. It is more repressive at home, it\u2019s more aggressive abroad, and in many instances that poses a challenge to our own interests, as well as to our own values. But I also think it\u2019s important not to reduce this to a bumper sticker. This relationship is among the most consequential that we have. It\u2019s among the most challenging we have. It\u2019s among the most complicated that we have. And what we\u2019ve seen in recent years is the emergence of \u2013 or clearly adversarial aspects to the relationship; for sure \u2013 and I\u2019ll come back to it quickly \u2013 competitive aspects; but there also remain cooperative aspects. And we can\u2019t lose sight of those, because some of the really big problems that we have to find ways to solve are a lot harder to solve if the United States and China are not actually engaged in trying to solve them: climate, global health, et cetera.\nBut the competitive aspect is front and center, because this is, as I suggested, at least from our perspective, a competition to shape what comes next after this post-Cold War period. What does it look like? Whose values are going to be reflected in what we do? And from our perspective at least, we have a basic choice, because we find \u2013 and I think this has been evident over the \u2013 especially over the period since the Second World War \u2013 the world doesn\u2019t organize itself. And for the United States, the choice is this: If we\u2019re not playing a part in the organizing, if we\u2019re not taking a leadership role in that, then one of two things \u2013 either someone else is, and it may well be China, and there, again, probably not in a way that fully reflects our interests and values; or maybe just as bad, no one\u2019s doing it, and then you tend to have vaccums that get filled with bad things before they get filled with good things.\nSo we have an interest in engaging, we have an interest in leading, and we have an interest in making sure that, to the extent we\u2019re in competition over what this new thing looks like, we are bringing everything to the table. In my own judgment, China also wants an order, but it\u2019s a profoundly illiberal order. The order that we seek \u2013 again, imperfectly \u2013 is a more liberal one, and that\u2019s what that competition is about.\nSECRETARY RICE: I\u2019m going to come back to how we do this, because you talk a lot about investing in our own strengths \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah.\nSECRETARY RICE: \u2014 but I want to stay for a moment on the relationship with China. You gave a very good speech a few months ago in which you talked about \u2013 I\u2019d call it a rather nuanced approach to China. As you\u2019ve said, that there\u2019s some areas of conflict, some areas of competition, and some areas of cooperation. Pretty quickly, the Chinese came out and said: not gonna happen \u2013 let me put it that way \u2013 because we can\u2019t delink these things. Do you have some hope that there might still be room? Maybe after the party congress is over, maybe after our own version of the party congress, the midterms, are over \u2013 then would there be room, and where would you see those potential areas of cooperation with China?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: The world fundamentally expects this of us, so whether China wants to find ways to cooperate or not on particularly climate, global health, maybe counternarcotics, even if they don\u2019t want to, there\u2019s a huge demand signal from the world. They expect us to try to find ways to advance these issues, and if we can, together, because it\u2019s affecting them as well as us.\nWe know we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with climate as we should if China is not part of the picture. It\u2019s going to have to decide; we can\u2019t decide for it. It has to decide whether it\u2019s in its interests, but it\u2019s also getting pressure from others around the world to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.\nSame thing on global health. And this is not about pointing fingers for the pandemic \u2013 it\u2019s about figuring out how do we build a more secure global health system so that this doesn\u2019t happen again. China needs to be part of that answer. But it\u2019s going to have to judge for itself whether, in its relationship with us, it finds ways to pursue cooperation, whether it just has to be responsive to demand signals that it\u2019s getting from countries around the world to be a positive actor, not a negative actor, on issues that concern them \u2013 not just China, not just the United States.\nSECRETARY RICE: We had reasonable cooperation at one time on another troublesome part of the world, North Korea. Obviously, it\u2019s been in the news again recently. Any thoughts on whether or not that scenario \u2013 it\u2019s really nonproliferation. Do you really want nuclear weapons in the hands of, shall we say, troublesome regimes like the North Koreans?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: This has been a challenge going back every administration I think we were each involved in, in one way or another, and one that has manifestly not gotten better over the years. I think from the leadership\u2019s perspective in North Korea, part of what we\u2019re seeing is it doesn\u2019t like to be ignored.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And so when the world is focused elsewhere, this is a reminder that: We\u2019re still here. We\u2019re still a problem. You have to deal with it.\nBut there\u2019s something else going on as well. Over the last months, going back about a year, we have significantly increased our own work with our allies and partners in the region \u2013 South Korea, Japan \u2013 both on a bilateral basis where we\u2019ve, for example, renewed exercises that we\u2019d had for years that were put in abeyance a few years ago \u2013 we brought them back, military exercises, to make sure that we could defend and hopefully deter any kind of North Korean aggression \u2013 as well as work that\u2019s being done now in ways that it hadn\u2019t been in recent years among the United States, Japan, Korea together, which has lots of benefits, including bringing Korea and Japan closer together. I think that Kim Jong-un saw that and didn\u2019t like it, and it\u2019s a response to that.\nWe\u2019ve taken a variety of actions, including at the United Nations, including strengthening even more our defense and deterrence, but it is an ongoing problem. And it does go, Condi, to exactly what you\u2019re talking about, which are concerns about broader proliferation. At the end of the day, one of the most important and powerful things about trying to continue to advance nonproliferation, preventing the spread of weapons, as well as arms control ourselves and being responsible actors under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, is making sure that we don\u2019t have a world where a whole variety of countries conclude that they\u2019re going to be better off if they acquire nuclear weapons that they don\u2019t have. And we know that that\u2019s a world that\u2019s going to be even more fraught. So we have to find ways to reinforce these norms, these rules, these standards that we\u2019ve signed on to and that need our engagement.\nSECRETARY RICE: I\u2019m going to come to technology in just a moment, I promise you, but I will get lots of messages that say you didn\u2019t ask him about Iran. Do you want to say just a word about that situation? It\u2019s extraordinary moments these days.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What we\u2019re seeing is \u2013 really is remarkable. And it starts with the incredible courage of very young people, especially women and girls, who are standing up for their most basic rights, their most fundamental freedoms, at extraordinary personal risk. And of course, we saw the prominent deaths of young women that led to this.\nBut what\u2019s powerful about it is that this is \u2013 this is grassroots, this is bottom up. This is a reflection of huge frustration and huge anger that so many in Iranian society have toward the direction of their country and toward their leadership, and they\u2019re demanding change. This is not made in the U.S.A.; it\u2019s not made anywhere else. To the extent that leaders in Iran try to point the fingers and somehow blame us, they are profoundly misreading and misunderstanding their own people and their own country, and that\u2019s going to be to their detriment.\nWhat can we do? First, we can stand and speak in solidarity with those who are simply trying to stand up for their own rights. Second, we can look at the different actors in Iran who are denying those rights and do what we can to penalize them for their actions. So we, for example, had sanctions that we put forward on the so-called morality police. And then maybe most important, and this goes directly in many ways to this community, we want to make sure that we are doing nothing that gets in the way of making sure that Iranians have the ability to the greatest extent possible of communicating with each other and connecting to the outside world, and that comes with technology. So we\u2019ve issued some licenses to make sure that we\u2019re not doing that, that people don\u2019t feel that our sanctions prohibit them from getting the technology that Iranians need to communicate with each other and with the world to the Iranian people.\nSECRETARY RICE: A little bit more activist this time than in 2012?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Each period\u2019s a little bit different.\nSECRETARY RICE: A little different, yeah. Right?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And I think \u2013 I think our voice has been very clear \u2013 not just our voice, our actions. And not just ours, countries around the world. But fundamentally, this is about the Iranian people. It\u2019s about their country. It\u2019s about their future. They will decide it. But we want to demonstrate in both practical as well as rhetorical ways our solidarity with them in this moment.\nSECRETARY RICE: So you\u2019re sitting at Stanford University in the middle of Silicon Valley. A long, long history between this place and the valley. And you are seeing and talking to the people who are really leading the technology revolutions. It goes back a long way here.\nSo in 2007 when I was secretary, I invited the then-Foreign Minister of Australia Alexander Downer here, and we have a little trip. And I got to \u2013 got to drive an experimental car called a Tesla. (Laughter.) Alexander wouldn\u2019t get in it. He wasn\u2019t sure that he wanted \u2013 well, I think it was probably the Australian secret service that didn\u2019t want him in an experimental car. But in any case, that\u2019s now a household name, maybe giving us answers to how to think about electric vehicles and climate change and the like.\nBut it says something very important about another part of the National Security Strategy, which it\u2019s \u2013 which says investing in our strengths. Very often, we get into what I call authoritarian envy. They build great airports. Democracy is so messy. But we forget that innovation has been from a place, the United States of America, that is the freest and most open. And so talk about investing in those strengths, protecting those strengths, and how that plays into the diplomacy that we must do but also the national security that we must achieve.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It\u2019s quite simply foundational, and let me say a couple of things about this. First, we go back to this proposition that we\u2019re in a moment of intense competition to shape what comes next. Technology, innovation, entrepreneurship \u2013 they are at the heart of that. This is how we are going to retool economies for the future. This is how we\u2019re going to modernize militaries as necessary. This is, through technology, how we are quite literally reshaping people\u2019s lives.\nAnd so it goes fundamentally to our national strength, but it also goes to a positive vision for the future that can be incredibly attractive for the United States around the world. Because as the technologies that are developed here \u2013 and I was just at the SLAC this morning, which is extraordinary, even for someone who probably understood about 1 percent of what I was hearing \u2013 this really does go to America\u2019s most positive role in the world.\nAs we\u2019re inventing; as you\u2019re inventing new technologies that are going to make sure that we can overcome disease and that we can actually strengthen global health and make sure that we don\u2019t have a repeat of COVID-19; as you\u2019re finding ways to make sure that we have sustainable, healthy food supplies for people around the world who so desperately need it and we\u2019re living in a moment of intense food insecurity; as you\u2019re looking at ways to make sure that we actually develop the technology to ensure an energy future that\u2019s not dependent on fossil fuels; as you\u2019re looking at ways to make sure we have secure supply chains for technology going forward and good jobs for the future; if we continue to get that right, if we continue to lead on that, if we continue to be seen as a beacon for the world, that goes directly to our standing around the world, our strength around the world in ways that I can\u2019t even begin to adequately describe.\nSo for us it starts with investing in ourselves. If you look at the so-called American Century, the second part of the 20th century, we were making these investments in ourselves in the \u201850s, the \u201860s and \u201870s in education, in research and development, in basic science, in our infrastructure. And we moved away from that. And it is not to say at all that government should be the one making all of these investments. We\u2019re never going to compete with, for example, a Chinese model that dedicates all of its state resources to a particular part of the economy, to a particular part of the world. But what we can do and do more effectively is making sure we\u2019re making these basic investments and then help catalyze, help facilitate, and ultimately help get out of the way for the private sector to really carry things forward.\nWe\u2019ve had two, at least from where I sit, enormous successes in the last few months, starting with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, a product of extraordinary work over several years by Republicans and Democrats alike to make sure that we were renewing these investments in ourselves. A lot of the focus on chips has rightly gone to renewing our ability to manufacture chips, semiconductors here in the United States, having subcontracted that out many years ago. But there are huge investments in basic science, basic research and development that are contained in the CHIPS and Science Act and the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which has the biggest commitment to dealing effectively with climate change in the history of our country, more than $350 billion. And again, a lot of that\u2019s going to investments in our own innovative capacity.\nSo I think, Condi, that is at the foundation of our strength, and it shows why the connection between what happens here and what happens around the world is stronger than it\u2019s ever been. Since we did CHIPS and since we did the IRA, I found the conversations that I\u2019m having with counterparts around the world have changed. There\u2019s now this view that, wait a minute, maybe America is getting its act together and this is something that we want to be part of.\nSECRETARY RICE: That\u2019s the positive side of it, of course, that we invest in ourselves. But there\u2019s also a question that\u2019s constantly on the table about how much we\u2019ve let out of the barn, so to speak, vis-\u00e0-vis the Chinese. They started down this road of indigenous development \u2013 in some ways hasn\u2019t gone all that well. We keep reading about problems in their own high-end chip development and the like.\nSo how do you see the balance between investing in what we do here and making sure that it doesn\u2019t escape to there? And it\u2019s particularly actually hard for a secretary of state, because one of the things that you don\u2019t want to do is make people declare loyalties. That\u2019s the quickest way to lose friends, to say you either choose China or us. That doesn\u2019t work very well diplomatically.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We both know that very well.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yes, right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: And what we\u2019ve been saying is this: We\u2019re not asking people to choose; we want to give you a choice. And that means we have to have something to put on the table. A big part of what we\u2019re trying to do besides the investment in ourselves, the other \u2013 the flip side of that is trying to get greater alignment with allies, with partners, with a whole variety of countries who might not even neatly fit into the ally or partner category but who have an interest in making sure that there\u2019s a basic understanding about the rules and that everyone plays by them. So we spent a lot of time trying to re-energize and revitalize \u2013 re-engage our alliances, our partnerships.\nWe\u2019ve also been inventing or energizing some new ones \u2013 new collections of countries that may be fit for purpose on specific issues; for example, making sure we have resilient supply chains, making sure that we\u2019re on semiconductors investing together because so much of this work has to be collaborative as well, but also protecting. And in the case of the highest end semiconductors \u2013 as you know very well, there\u2019s only a small number of countries that either are manufacturing the highest end semiconductors or making the tools to manufacture the highest end semiconductors. We want to make sure that we keep those where they need to be. So this alignment with other countries trying to all move in the same direction, trying to work together on shaping some of the norms, the standards, the rules by which technology is used, that\u2019s also profoundly part of our national interest and our strength around the world.\nSECRETARY RICE: This is a question that could solicit a rather boring answer, but this is a university, so it\u2019s all right. We\u2019re accustomed to boring answers. (Laughter.) So you talked about standards. And maybe what\u2019s not fully understood is there are international efforts, international organizations where the standards are actually written \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: That\u2019s right.\nSECRETARY RICE: \u2014 for things like the internet, for questions about ships and supply chains. And the United States has always had a reputation of being fully uninterested \u2013 completely uninterested in sending people to these conferences at the assistant secretary level to spend two years, three years writing standards.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: That\u2019s right.\nSECRETARY RICE: Are you interested in this?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: I have to admit: I wasn\u2019t. All right. So now. (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Condi, I have walked out on standards in the biggest way, and we are flooding the zone for exactly that reason. Somewhere in the world on virtually any piece of technology that may be invented here, a group of people is sitting around a table in a windowless conference room writing the rules about how these are going to be used. And whoever writes the rules is going to have a powerful impact on the use of technology going forward.\nTo state the obvious, technology isn\u2019t inherently good or bad; the rules by which it\u2019s used might be. And we want to make sure that, for example, when it comes to protecting privacy, when it comes to upholding human rights, when it comes to advancing our own security, but also enhancing our competitiveness, the rules reflect that. And as the saying goes, if you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu. We want to make sure that we\u2019re at the table doing that. So, yeah, this is \u2013 sometimes it seems mind-numbing.\nWe spent a lot of time making sure \u2013 for example, there are competition for jobs in the international system, the folks who actually turn up at these meetings. Their elections, or their appointments, including in the entire United Nations system \u2013 we\u2019re spending a lot of time making sure that people that reflect our views and values are competing and winning those jobs. It really does make a difference. It does seem mind-numbing, but it\u2019s incredible how at the end of the day that\u2019s going to shape the world as well.\nSECRETARY RICE: I should probably go back and apologize to my under secretary for economics who used to try to get me to pay attention. All right. So you\u2019ve convinced me, because after all, this really is \u2013 when we talk about the competition and going back to autocracy versus democracy, if these are used in a certain way, they will be used in different ways by autocracies. So you take something like facial recognition, which might simply make it possible for you to get through an airport more quickly if you\u2019re in the United States, and China has a very different way. So I applaud your interest in this mind-numbing part of it.\nHow\u2019s it coming with others? You mentioned that we now are in the game, but when you think about particularly relations with the Europeans, we\u2019ve not always had the greatest alignment with what you think should be our closest allies on things like privacy and the like. So can you talk a little bit about relations with the Europeans? Has it been affected by the extraordinary cooperation that we\u2019re getting around Ukraine at this point? Someone said that Vladimir Putin had within a matter of months ended German pacifism and Swedish neutrality, which I think is probably true. But is it \u2013 is it having an effect?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: It is remarkable the extent to which Putin has precipitated virtually everything he says he wants to prevent, particularly in terms of the so-called Western world sticking together and actually strengthening its cooperation across a whole variety of issues. I think we are making progress on this, because you\u2019re right, we have to find ways to make sure that on technology we are more aligned with other countries, starting in many cases with close partners in Europe as well as in Asia and then broadening out.\nWe have all of these different constellations, groupings, partnerships; one of them is something called the Technology and Trade Council with the European Union. And to put it in the simplest terms, this is a way of trying to make sure we\u2019re actually all rowing in the same direction when it comes to these norms, these rules, these standards, but also a whole variety of other things. If we have export controls on the highest end technology that we think should not wind up in the hands of some of our competitors, including China, if we\u2019re the only ones doing it and others are not abiding by them, then it\u2019s not going to work. So we have to try to get alignment there, and we are.\nIf we want to make sure that when we have concerns about some of the investment that\u2019s coming into our own countries that may be going to critical industries, critical companies, ones that are \u2013 that affect our security, we want to make sure that countries have the tools to look at those investments and decide whether this is something they want to go forward or not. We\u2019re working on those together with the European Union. We\u2019re thinking about critical supply chains and particularly for semiconductors. We\u2019ve seen what happened when these get disrupted. We\u2019re designing together an early warning system so that if we see a disruption anywhere in a supply chain for a critical component \u2013 first of all going to semiconductors but broadening out to other technologies \u2013 a flashing red light goes off and we can act on it together. All of these things are bringing us into closer alignment.\nNow, having said that, we have differences of view, differences of perspective \u2013 just as we have within our own country, because obviously we don\u2019t have a unified technology policy in our own country \u2013 that are always going to be there. We also have competition with some of our closest friends. We have \u2013 we\u2019re competing with Europeans, but we both fundamentally have the same interest in a system where people who play by the basic rules; where privacy is respected, even if we have different perspectives on the best way to do that; where our security is upheld, where human rights are respected, and where we can enhance our competitiveness. So the question is can we find ways to design those together, come into agreement. And then finally this: Competition when it\u2019s fair, when it\u2019s on a level playing field, when it\u2019s a race to the top, is good. That\u2019s what our own system is all about.\nSo for us it\u2019s not saying, oh, we have to avoid competition with friends and partners and allies; it\u2019s, on the contrary, making sure that together that competition is fair, it\u2019s transparent, it has the rights of workers in mind, it has the environment in mind, it has protection of intellectual property in mind. And if we do that, then countries that don\u2019t abide by the same way of doing things will have to decide are they going to get into the race to the top with us and raise their own standards, raise their own game \u2013 that\u2019s good for the world \u2013 or not.\nSECRETARY RICE: So let\u2019s go now from out there to Foggy Bottom, to the place that you work, the State Department, and talk a little bit about how all of this is affecting the State Department. Let me just say that when I left the State Department, the \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a smartphone for all intents and purposes, and I think we still \u2013 when I got there \u2013 still had Wang computers, believe it or not.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I remember those.\nSECRETARY RICE: You\u2019re all too young to even know what a Wang computer was, so it just gives you a sense. How in the world is a place that some 20 years ago still had Wang computers going to play in this world of technology? What does it mean for diplomacy and what does it mean for the State Department?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We have to be, and we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can be, to really be fit for the purpose of this moment and the moments to come. And we both worked on this and looked at this \u2013 anyone comes into these jobs and they\u2019re looking at their own department or agency and trying to figure out what do I need to change, what makes sense. And we spent some time doing that. And I think we came to a couple of conclusions that are reflected in what we\u2019re doing.\nFirst is you\u2019re only \u2013 you\u2019re in these jobs for a finite period of time. You\u2019re not going to \u2013 you\u2019re not going to change everything and probably you shouldn\u2019t, so you\u2019ve got to pick a handful of things that maybe you can make a difference on, get a start on, hopefully it continues when you\u2019re no longer there. That\u2019s one.\nSecond, one of the biggest challenges we face is that the things that are really having an impact on the lives of everyone in this room and all of our fellow citizens are not necessarily the issues that the State Department has been front and center on or has the expertise on. And again, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s health, whether it\u2019s food insecurity, whether it\u2019s energy, whether it\u2019s economics, and whether it is cyberspace and digital policy, this has not been our bread and butter. And our bread and butter remains issues of war and peace, preventing conflict, making \u2013 helping to end conflict where we can, making sure that the American people are secure through diplomacy. But each of these issues is directly tied to that.\nSo what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019re engaged in modernizing the department to make sure that we\u2019re organized in a way and attract the talent in a way that allows us to play a leadership role on these issues. So, for example \u2013 and you\u2019ll \u2013 Condi, you\u2019ll appreciate this \u2013 I think land record speed, we established a new bureau for cyber and digital policy in about six months\u2019 time. And in fact, the ambassador running that, Nate Fick, who is actually a technologist (inaudible), is with us today. This is how we make sure that we have a place that the expertise can come to in the department and, ultimately, we can grow the expertise so that we can engage effectively on these issues.\nWe\u2019re in the process of doing something similar on global health. One of the most extraordinary achievements in American foreign policy over the last 25 years is something called PEPFAR, something that President Bush and Condi initiated to deal with the HIV/AIDS as well as malaria and tuberculosis crisis. I don\u2019t think there has been a program in the recent history of the United States Government that has saved more lives than PEPFAR. Now we have an opportunity to make sure that coming out of COVID and inspired by what was done with PEPFAR we build an even better platform for dealing with questions of global health, and we want to make sure that the department\u2019s organized to do that, that we attract the talent.\nJohn Kerry is leading extraordinary efforts on climate, but we want to make sure that those are institutionalized so that, again, we are a leader. Because here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and again, you all know this very well \u2013 just as if we\u2019re not leading and we\u2019re not engaged, we\u2019re going to have a problem because someone else will do it or no one will do it; if we\u2019re not finding new ways to cooperate, to collaborate, to work with other countries on these issues, we simply can\u2019t get them done. Climate \u2013 we\u2019re 15 percent or so of global emissions. By definition, even if we did everything right at home, we have to figure out a way to deal with the other 85 percent. That means, among other things, diplomacy to bring others along.\nWhen we\u2019re dealing with global health, when we\u2019re dealing with COVID-19, we know that we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain and that even, again, if we did everything right at home, if there\u2019s still an environment in which a new variant is going to pop up its head somewhere around the world and we\u2019re not able to deal with that, we\u2019re not going to be protecting our people. We have to find ways to collaborate and cooperate on that. And the technologies themselves, we are \u2013 have to be the ones who are helping to shape the way that they\u2019re used.\nAll of that is a function of diplomacy, and that\u2019s why I want to make sure that the department has the tools, has the organization, and has the talent to do it. So I\u2019m here to proselytize a little bit too. (Laughter.) We want you.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: We need you at the department. This is an opportunity to pursue so many of the things that you\u2019ve been studying, working on, and are passionate about, but to do it \u2013 for those of you who are American \u2013 for your country. And for me, at least, I found that \u2013 and I \u2013 Condi, I suspect you feel the same way \u2013 there are so many extraordinary things you can do with your passions and your pursuits, and you can do them in a variety of different ways. And there are different rewards in the different ways that you do them. But at least for me, going to work every day literally and figuratively with the flag \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: \u2014 behind my back, I can\u2019t even put a value on that. So to those of you who have an interest in actually doing public service, even for a short period of time \u2013 and it seems like the State Department, what does that have to do with what I\u2019m interested in \u2013 it has everything to do with it because virtually everything that so many of you are working on here actually has a direct application to what we\u2019re trying to do around the world. And we hope that a few of you will join us.\nSECRETARY RICE: Well, I was going to give you an opportunity for a recruitment pitch. I think we just got it. (Laughter.) But I want to join in. I do think that there is nothing like public service. There\u2019s nothing like getting up in the morning and recognizing that you\u2019re going to work and try to do your very best for this extraordinary country that we inherited, that we continue to try to perfect. And I don\u2019t know about you, but whenever I would get off a plane that said \u201cThe United States of America,\u201d I thought it was a pretty special moment. And so for all of you, particularly those out there who might have some technical skills that might be needed, consider it. There\u2019s nothing quite like public service.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.\nSECRETARY RICE: With that, we\u2019re going to open up for some Q&A, and I know we\u2019ll get plenty, so I\u2019m going to take the first question right here on the front.\nQUESTION: Hello. Thank you so much for your inspiring remarks, Secretary Blinken. I\u2019m curious about what you see as the merits of diplomacy through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations when their efficacy in enforcing treaties and maintaining the international order have proved to be a little bit precarious.\nSECRETARY RICE: And are you a student? Just to \u2014\nQUESTION: Yes. My name\u2019s Mac. I\u2019m a senior majoring in political science.\nSECRETARY RICE: Great, great.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So thank you for the question, and it\u2019s one that we work on every single day. Look, these institutions, starting with the United Nations, are only as good or as bad as the countries that make up their membership. And so, yes, there are certain things that are inherent to the institutions themselves, and their leadership is really important. But fundamentally, the members have to help make them work or not, and you\u2019re absolutely right that we\u2019ve seen in a number of them dysfunctions of one kind or another. The UN Security Council because of this renewed great power competition is often at loggerheads and as a result often paralyzed.\nBut at the same time, incredibly powerful things still happen. Just to give you one recent example, when Russia proceeded with its purported annexation of territory in Ukraine, we went to the United Nations and we tried at the Security Council to get a resolution reflecting that. Of course, it was vetoed by Russia, although we got a strong vote among the permanent and non\u2011permanent members of the council. But then we went to the General Assembly, to the entire body of the United Nations, and an extraordinary thing happened: 143 countries in the world stood up in opposition to the annexation, to the sham referenda that Russia had used as justification for the purported annexations. And that in and of itself is a powerful indicator of where the world actually is now on Russia\u2019s aggression, something that the Russians have to factor into their thinking. So there is \u2013 there are things that you can still do and do effectively.\nThe other thing I\u2019d say is this: Day in, day out, one of the things that gets lost in the UN system is there are different agencies that have their challenges but are doing things that in their absence either we would have to do directly ourselves or no one would do. International peacekeeping has been very troubled, but there are places in the world where the so-called Blue Helmets are. There are roughly I think 100,000 forces that are \u2013 that make up UN peacekeeping. The United States has maybe a small handful. These are folks from other countries who are taking this on. If they weren\u2019t doing it, we might have to, or we\u2019d have to let these crises go in ways that would make them even worse. And on things like health, on the environment, on education, these agencies are really doing important things.\nOur job is to try to make them do it better, more efficiently, more effectively, cut through the bureaucracy, cut through the corruption that\u2019s sometimes there, and work to try to make them a little bit better. But it\u2019s a little bit like our own situation, which is there\u2019s a need to try to forge a more perfect union, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on every day. But here, again, if we\u2019re not actually there in the room, it\u2019s probably not going to happen, which is why showing up, being \u2013 participating in this, even with all the frustrations and even with all the criticism, I think makes a difference.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yes. Going to go to the students here \u2013 right here.\nQUESTION: Hi, Secretary Blinken. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. My name is Divya Ganesan, and I\u2019m an undergraduate student here studying computer science and political science. My question for you is that a lot of students in the room hope to be CEOs, software engineers, et cetera. How has diplomacy changed in a world where technology companies like Google and Facebook have both the network and soft power diplomacy of an actual country? And how should that affect the way that we care about diplomacy?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think the single biggest change that I\u2019ve seen in the 30 or so years that I\u2019ve been doing this is precisely in the technology and information space, because one of the things \u2013 to state the obvious \u2013 that\u2019s happened is that a whole series of new actors have been empowered with technology and the ability in one way or another to control information in ways that were not the case before.\nAnd for those of us in government, this has profound, profound effects. Among other things, it means that if we can\u2019t find a way to align with these different actors who wield so much power, then we know that the best-laid plans will easily be disrupted. So we have a profound stake in trying to make sure that to the best of our ability we\u2019re actually all rowing in the same direction. One of the reasons that not only am I here for a couple of days but we stood up this new bureau is to make sure that we have day-in, day-out connectivity with this entire ecosystem.\nAnd we\u2019re going to disagree, and there are disagreements between the public and the private. That\u2019s not going to go away. But where we can find ways to work through the disagreements and come out in a place where we\u2019re trying to move things in the same direction, that\u2019s going to make our life easier; it\u2019s going to make it easier for the policies that we pursue to actually take root and be implemented. We \u2013 it\u2019s in our self-interest, but it\u2019s also the right thing to do to make sure that on any given problem we have all of the different stakeholders in on the takeoff and not just try and bring them in on the landing because the plane\u2019s going to crash. But it\u2019s challenging work, and sometimes there\u2019s a different interest at stake, and we have to find ways to reconcile those. It\u2019s going to be very imperfect, but what I can tell you is it\u2019s more important than it\u2019s ever been. Otherwise, we\u2019re not going to make progress.\nSo \u2013 but here\u2019s the other thing I\u2019ve heard, and I\u2019ve been coming out here for a long time. My strong sense is that for the multiplicity of motivations that people have for the work that they\u2019re doing, so many people do want to be in one way or another part of something larger than themselves. They do want to be positive actors in solving problems that are afflicting our \u2013 all of our citizens. And this place, maybe more than any on Earth, has been such an incredibly positive actor in doing that.\nNow, there are other things that from some perspectives are less positive. But I can\u2019t think of how we answer this challenge now of renewed competition for how the world is going to look over the next 25, 50, or 100 years if we are not doing it together with what is at the heart of our national strength. And that is what\u2019s coming out of this part of our country.\nSECRETARY RICE: In the blue shirt over here. We\u2019ll take a couple quick \u2013 please keep it brief because I\u2019m going to try to take one more question.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. My name is Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00edz, and I\u2019m an undergraduate student studying political science and economics, and I\u2019m originally from Mexico. I would like to bring our attention to an area of the world that has not been discussed in this conversation, Latin America, my own home region, in which there is a lot going on \u2013 the rise of influence in China in investment in countries like Ecuador and Argentina, not to mention drug violence in my own home country of Mexico. Given how close geographically Latin America is to the United States, I wanted to know what the policy of the United States should be in this region in coming years.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Few countries have a greater impact on each other\u2019s day-in, day-out lives than the United States and Mexico. We know it. We feel it. We see it every single day. As it happens, we just had our senior Mexican counterparts in Washington just last week and where the Attorney General, the Secretary for Homeland Security Ali Mayorkas, myself, were working with them on something that we re-established, which is a security dialogue. How do we work together cooperatively to get a better grip on challenges to security in both of our countries that have been afflicting us for many years \u2013 drugs coming this way, guns going that way, money fueling the whole thing. And if we\u2019re not working on these things collaboratively, we\u2019re not going to succeed.\nAnd I think the collaboration now with Mexico has been quite extraordinary. Migration \u2013 we are living through a period that is \u2013 we throw around the word \u201chistoric.\u201d This is a historic period when it comes to migration. There are more people on the move around the planet, forcibly displaced in one way or another from their homes, than at any time in recorded history since we\u2019ve been keeping statistics on this \u2013 100 million people. We feel that profoundly in our own hemisphere. In the Americas, we have Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans all on the move for one reason or another. We\u2019ve been working very hard to create a shared sense of responsibility for dealing with migration in a safe, orderly, humane way. No single country can deal with this effectively alone. So that\u2019s very much part of our dialogue.\nBut there\u2019s also something that\u2019s very powerful, which is there\u2019s great potential in our own hemisphere to be an economic engine for growth for all of our countries; to have, for example, more integrated supply chains that make sure that we don\u2019t have the disruptions that we\u2019ve experienced on things like computer chips. The lithium that\u2019s going to go into electric vehicle batteries \u2013 well, for example, Mexico has a lot of that lithium. Finding ways to work on it together and then to have a resilient supply chain to get it to the places where the batteries are manufactured, that\u2019s something we\u2019re working on. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity that I think that\u2019s being felt in a more integrated North America \u2013 Mexico, the United States, Canada \u2013 and a more integrated hemisphere.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is this, and it also goes back to the migration challenge that we\u2019re facing. We have to find ways to be making smart investments in communities that people are leaving, because what we see is that the primary driver of migration in our own hemisphere \u2013 there are different ones, but the most fundamental one is a lack of basic opportunity. And if you don\u2019t have that, if you can\u2019t put bread on the table for your family, you\u2019re going to try to figure something else out.\nAnd it\u2019s not that people get up in the morning and say, gee, wouldn\u2019t it be fun today to put my life on the line, to put myself in the hands of a human trafficker, to leave my family behind, to leave my friends behind, to leave my culture and my language behind. It takes something very powerful to drive people to that decision. We have an ability to affect that decision over time in actually creating greater opportunity in different communities in our hemisphere. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on as well.\nBut the bottom line is this. Unless we\u2019re doing it collaboratively, unless we\u2019re working these issues together, it\u2019s not going to happen. So it goes back, Condi, to what you were saying about sitting in these \u2013 in these rooms with norms and standards. We\u2019re sitting in rooms throughout our hemisphere every day, engaged, sleeves rolled up, showing up, because that\u2019s ultimately how you build some trust, how you build some confidence, how you build actual partnership, and maybe start to get things done.\nBottom line is this. I think you\u2019re seeing governments throughout our hemisphere who are all facing the same challenge, which is: Can they deliver the basic things that their people need or aspire to? And if they can\u2019t they\u2019re going to be gone. We just went through a cycle where a lot of governments in the hemisphere that happened to be, for example, from the \u2013 from the right politically are out. We have new governments that are in that are more from the left. But it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s less about ideology and it\u2019s more about delivering for people. What the United States can offer, and it goes back to saying to people we\u2019re not demanding that you choose, it\u2019s we\u2019re offering you a choice, is: Can we have the right kind of partnerships that make sense to them and help them deliver?\nChina, last thing I\u2019ll mention on this. If China has extraordinary resources that it can decide as a government to put into investments in our own hemisphere or around the world, that\u2019s a source of strength. But if those investments are done in a way where they\u2019re piling debt on the countries that take them that it can\u2019t \u2013 that can\u2019t be repaid, where workers are coming in from China instead of using local workers to do the projects, or the rights of the workers themselves on the projects are not being respected, where there\u2019s no consideration for the environment and the impact of a project on the environment, where corruption is part and parcel of what\u2019s being done \u2013 that\u2019s going to alienate a lot of the recipients of Chinese largesse. If we\u2019re offering a different model that, as I said, is more of a race to the top, that\u2019s going to be very attractive.\nBut for us, we have to find ways to actually mobilize and catalyze the private sector. There\u2019s a lot of resource that sits on the sidelines. What government can do is be a catalyst, a guarantor, someone who says, yeah, this is a good place, this is a smart place, this is a reasonable place to make these kinds of investments. And then it becomes more of a win/win proposition for everyone.\nSECRETARY RICE: We\u2019ve come to the hour.\nQUESTION: Can (inaudible) about Taiwan?\nSECRETARY RICE: All right. All right, certainly. You want to say something quick about Taiwan?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Sure.\nSECRETARY RICE: All right.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: What would you like me to say? (Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Hi, Secretary. I\u2019m the MBA first student from GSB. I\u2019m just wondering \u2013 I know you are very time-limited \u2013 maybe say something quick about like what is United States attitude toward Taiwan?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah, sure.\nSECRETARY RICE: Yeah. Or not so quick.\nQUESTION: I mean, like a lot of officials have \u2014\nSECRETARY RICE: Take your time to talk about Taiwan. We don\u2019t want to \u2013 yes \u2013 have an incident twice. Yes. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So one of the things that we\u2019ve worked on together in a variety of ways for years is our approach to Taiwan and the challenge that is inherent in dealing with the differences between Beijing and Taiwan. And a hallmark of the policy, going back decades through Republican and Democratic administrations, has been an insistence that the differences that exist need to be resolved peacefully. And actually, it\u2019s been, up until recently, incredibly successful. I think it\u2019s been managed well, in a way that has avoided conflict, that has also allowed people on Taiwan to really flourish, and benefit not just their own lives, but Taiwan has so much to contribute to the world that it\u2019s doing every single day.\nWhat\u2019s changed is this \u2013 it goes back to something that Condi was saying at the very beginning \u2013 there has been a change in the approach from Beijing toward Taiwan in recent years. And instead of sticking with the status quo that was established in a positive way, a fundamental decision that the status quo was no longer acceptable and that Beijing was determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline. And if peaceful means didn\u2019t work, then it would employ coercive means \u2013 and possibly, if coercive means don\u2019t work, maybe forceful means \u2013 to achieve its objectives. And that is what is profoundly disrupting the status quo and creating tremendous tensions.\nAnd this is a matter of concern not just to the United States because it\u2019s been a central component of managing the relationship with China for so long, but it\u2019s of profound concern to countries around the world. The amount of commercial traffic that goes through the straits every single day and has an impact on economies around the world is enormous. If that were to be disrupted as a result of a crisis, countries around world would suffer.\nThe last group of people I need to tell this is right here in this room. On semiconductors, if Taiwanese production were disrupted as a result of a crisis, you would have an economic crisis around the world. So there\u2019s a profound stake not just for us but for countries around the world in preserving peace and stability when it comes to Taiwan and the straits, and to making sure that the differences that exist are resolved peacefully. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been so engaged on this.\nI hope that Beijing will come back to a place where it actually sees the merits in making sure that differences are peacefully resolved, that it doesn\u2019t try to force things through coercion, and even worse, through force. We are determined to make good on our commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act and supporting their ability to defend themselves. We\u2019re also \u2013 we also remain fundamentally committed to the \u201cone China\u201d policy as well. That hasn\u2019t changed. That won\u2019t change. But at the heart of that was a commitment to resolve these differences peacefully, and if that\u2019s changing, then that does offer, unfortunately, prospects for very challenging situations going forward.\nSECRETARY RICE: Thank you. And with that, we have come to the end of the hour. If you will join me in please thanking Secretary Blinken. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-university-recruitment-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemarks at a University Recruitment Event\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Stanford University Encina Courtyard", "location": "Stanford, California", "date": "October 17, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you so much. First of all, I\u2019m so glad that you were able to get class outside today, and I\u2019m really happy to participate in that. We\u2019re here in part to ask you to think about the possibility of public service and including the possibility of service in the State Department. And I know that that may not be the first thing that comes to mind as you\u2019re thinking about what to do when you\u2019re at Stanford or at some point later in your career, but I\u2019d like to just take a moment (inaudible) suggest why actually this would be an extraordinary time to think about not just (inaudible) some kind of public service but actually coming to the State Department and working on what America is doing around the world.\nWe were talking about this, and some of you may have been there with Condoleezza Rice just a short while ago, and some of your in many cases classmates. This is in many ways an inflection point, an inflection point because the world that existed after the end of the Cold War \u2013 the post-Cold War world \u2013 has really come to an end. And there\u2019s an intense competition that\u2019s underway to shape what actually comes next, and a big part of that competition is going to be driven by technology.\nTechnology is going to be at the heart of retooling our economies for the future. It\u2019s going to be at the heart \u2013 in some cases of reforming our militaries to make them more effective and fit for purpose. It\u2019s at the heart of reshaping lives in our country and around the world. But maybe most important, it\u2019s at the heart of a positive vision that I think is responsive to the needs of people not just in our own country but around the world.\nThe things that so many of you are thinking about, are working on, studying \u2013 how to make sure that we can use technology to cure disease and to have a stronger global health system after COVID-19; how do we think about making sure that people can feed themselves sustainably at a time when we\u2019re dealing with profound food insecurity around the world; how we deal with climate change so that we have a planet that can power itself, but doing it in a way that\u2019s not dependent on fossil fuels; how do we think about supply chains to make sure that the things that people need in their daily lives are not disrupted because of disruptions to the supply chain; how do we think about good jobs for the future \u2013 all of that has technology, innovation, entrepreneurship at the heart of the answer. And all of that is what can \u2013 powerfully resonates around the world. And when we get it right, it directly goes to how the rest of the world sees us. I feel that every single day in the job that I\u2019m doing.\nSo at our own Department of State \u2013 and I want to kind of make in a minute \u2013 a lot of these issues have not necessarily been front and center in what we do or what we\u2019re seen to be doing. People think of the State Department, they think of diplomacy, they think of issues of war and peace and trying to make peace where there\u2019s war, trying to prevent conflict.\nBut we know that the big issues that are really having an impact on people\u2019s lives \u2013 whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s the impact of new technologies \u2013 each of those has to be front and center in what we do as well because there\u2019s not a solution set to any of those problems that does not involve, in some way or another, collaboration, cooperation, coordination with countries around the world, with companies around the world, with innovators around the world. And that\u2019s where the State Department comes in. That\u2019s where diplomacy comes in \u2013 trying to advance, to facilitate that cooperation and that coordination.\nWe were talking about this earlier: we\u2019re trying to solve the climate crisis. Even if we do everything right at home, if we\u2019re 15 percent of global emissions and we\u2019re not dealing with the other 85 percent, we don\u2019t solve the problem. Diplomacy is a big part of that. If we\u2019re dealing with COVID and trying to make sure that we don\u2019t have another pandemic, building a stronger global health system that\u2019s only going to be as strong as the weakest link in the chain \u2013 that\u2019s necessary. And again, even if we got everything right at home, if there\u2019s another outbreak of disease and there\u2019s a variant that undercuts what we\u2019re doing at home, we can\u2019t succeed.\nAnd all of these technologies that many of you are actually studying, working on, helping to develop, how they get used \u2013 the rules, the standards, the norms by which they\u2019re used, which are decided not necessarily in the United States but maybe in some windowless conference room around the world \u2013 that will decide if technology is used for good or for less good, whether privacy, whether security, whether human rights and our values, as well as our competitiveness is actually upheld.\nAnd again, that\u2019s exactly what diplomats are doing. We have a new bureau in our department for cyber and digital policy to make sure that we\u2019re organized in a way that allows us to really engage on these issues. And a big part of making sure that that works, as well as a new office we\u2019re standing up to deal with emerging technologies \u2013 everything from AI to quantum to bioengineering \u2013 that we have a lead role to play in making sure that the United States is well represented around the world.\nAnd that\u2019s where all of you come in. The very things that you\u2019re interested in, that you\u2019re passionate about, that you\u2019re working on, that you\u2019re studying, there\u2019s actually a way to pursue them as part of the State Department, and maybe spending a little bit of time of working in the public sector, in public service, and doing something that I\u2019ve found over 30 years has given tremendous meaning to my own life, and that\u2019s being able to go to work every day with an American flag behind my back either literally or figuratively. And for some of you, that may be an attractive proposition, even if it\u2019s only for a little bit of time.\nWe\u2019re finding new ways to bring those who are steeped on STEM into our department, and we can talk a little bit about that. But I really just wanted to encourage you to actually consider that, to think about that as an opportunity, whether it\u2019s in a few years; whether it\u2019s in 10 or 15 years. But we need you: we need the talent, we need the insight, and we especially need a new generation of people to look at these problems that are incredibly daunting, but that have solutions, and increasingly they\u2019ll have the solutions that you\u2019re finding and developing.\nSo with that, Nate, do you want to say a few words about what we\u2019re doing?\nAMBASSADOR FICK: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And thanks, everybody, for being here. It is \u2013 it\u2019s real treat for me to be back in Silicon Valley. As the dean mentioned, I built a business here and was an operating partner in a venture capital firm here for 10 years. I spent a lot of mornings running around The Dish, worried about raising money, and whether a (inaudible) feature would work, losing a customer, hiring a key person. And so it is terrific to be back here.\nI have now had a few weeks of experience building this new bureau at the State Department, and I\u2019ll tell you, there\u2019s one big point of commonality between what I\u2019m doing now and what I was doing before, building a tech business. Both the bureau and our company were what I called elevator assets organizations. At the end of the day, we had some computers, we had some chairs, but basically, all of our assets went down the elevator at night and went home. That\u2019s all we had. Human capital, people, it\u2019s all we had.\nAnd so the fundamental challenge in building either of these organizations, any organization, is finding the right people to come join the team. The Secretary mentioned getting in his conference rooms, right, and setting standards, kind of the unsexy work of moving the ball down the field. My first week on the job was doing exactly that. I got sworn in on a Thursday to get a passport on a Friday to go to Romania on a Saturday in order to spend the better part of a week meeting with delegations from countries around the world to persuade them to vote for an American candidate to be secretary general of the International Telecommunications Union, a standard-setting body that\u2019s been around since 1865. It was set up to make sure that European telegraphs could talk to American telegraphs, could talk to Asian telegraphs. And this stuff really matters. We may not think about it every day, but it really matters.\nAnd I got on the phone with my wife at the end of the first day and she said, \u201cSo how is it?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, the people are tremendous. The people are just incredible, and the sense of purpose is incredible.\u201d So I think that the \u2013 we need American companies building and scaling technology around the world in accordance with our values. And we need American diplomatic leadership on topics like setting the standards and the norms for tech also in accordance with our values.\nSo I think our invitation to you is something like the following: if you \u2013 as products of at least a few years in this place, if you really believe that the innovation economy is a wellspring of our attractiveness and economic health and national security as a nation, if you believe that; and if you believe in the intrinsic value of diplomacy, if you believe that talking about our differences is the most effective way to bridge them or resolve them; and if you believe that tech is the next frontier in diplomacy, just as it\u2019s the next frontier in every aspect of our lives \u2013 if you would believe those things, then we have a place for you. And I can say that with conviction because there was a place for me.\nI did not see myself five or seven or 10 years ago at the State Department. But I\u2019ll tell you, now, having spent a little bit of time in this great organization, it reminds me of a recruiting slogan the Marines used in the \u201990s when I graduated from college and joined the Marines. They said, \u201cWe never promised you a rose garden.\u201d The same is true at the State Department. There are things you can do coming out of Stanford where you\u2019re going to make more money and maybe you\u2019ll work easier hours. But I would challenge you to find something that will give you the same sense of purpose.\nThe Secretary has talked about the, I stand a little taller walking behind my desk with the American flag there, and I come through the turnstile every morning with a big grin on my face. And so whether it\u2019s four years of your career or 40 years of your career, please consider giving a portion of your time and your energy to public service because we need you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-slac-national-accelerator-laboratory/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemarks at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

(applause); and of course, our Secretary of State Antony Blinken (applause).\u00a0 I am Lee Satterfield, the assistant secretary of state for Educational and Cultural Affairs.\u00a0 Tonight\u2019s ceremony signifies much more than a signing ceremony.\u00a0 Tonight we celebrate the priority that Secretary Blinken places on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.\nThe State Department is elevating the Biden administration\u2019s engagement with the Hispanic community by signing this important MOU with HACU, the first time it\u2019s been signed by a secretary of state in two decades.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYesterday, Secretary Blinken said that President Biden\u2019s National Security Strategy lays out a vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous world, and a comprehensive plan to realize it.\u00a0 This MOU is an important step in that plan.\u00a0 The Biden administration want more members of the Hispanic community to be a part of America\u2019s diplomatic and development work.\u00a0 We want more opportunities for Hispanic students and scholars to study and research abroad.\u00a0 And we want more international students and scholars studying and researching at our Hispanic-serving institutions, because inclusion of every community strengthens our global competitiveness, security, and shared prosperity.\nNow please join me in welcoming Josue Barrera.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR BARRERA:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas noches.\u00a0\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0Buenas noches.\nMR BARRERA:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s my favorite part of any Hispanic event.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 My name is Josue Manuel Barrera, if you can try saying that, too.\u00a0 My HACU story started 16 years ago. \u00a0I was a second-year graduate student and teaching assistant studying public policy at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, an overwhelmingly Hispanic-serving institution recognized now for its positive impact in social mobility. \u00a0I helped coordinate the visit of a HACU representative to the university, and by the end of the visit, I added my name to the list of students interested in gaining experience at the federal level.\nSeveral months passed and I didn\u2019t give it much thought, and then a phone call. \u00a0The HACU representative on the other end of the line asked if I was interested in spending a semester in D.C. \u00a0If so, I had two days to decide and two weeks to prepare.\u00a0 So I sold my very cool 1988 Nissan Pathfinder, bought some horribly ill-fitting suits, and hopped on a plane to D.C. \u00a0When I called my mother know, I landed and everything was okay, and the first thing she asked us:\u00a0Cuando regresas \u2013\u00a0when are you coming back?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 To this day, I call, and the first thing she asks is: when are you coming back?\nThe phone call \u2013 back to the story \u2013 opened the doors for me to enter public service at the State Department and the opportunity to contribute to our nation in unique and meaningful ways.\u00a0 In the Bureau of Public Affairs \u2013 I see my first supervisor here \u2013 Western Hemisphere Affairs, Educational and Cultural Affairs (cheers) \u2013 wow, cool \u2013 and now Global Talent Management (cheers).\nIn 2019 just before the pandemic hit and the national dialogue on race escalated, my team began the effort to institutionalize what\u2019s now the Secretary\u2019s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.\u00a0 And I just returned to the department a few weeks ago after spending a year studying national security strategy with senior military officials.\u00a0\u00a0 My current focus is another of the Secretary\u2019s priorities: working to develop the department\u2019s first-ever strategic plan for retention.\nI will forever be grateful for that HACU phone call and the path is has led to.\u00a0 It\u2019s a call that I hope HACU can continue making for many students in the years to come.\nNow, he may not have been the person who made the call, but I know it was the work of the individual whom I\u2019m about to introduce that made it possible.\u00a0 Since 1996, he has been the driving force in building HACU and, to clarion call, effectively serving our nation\u2019s Hispanic-serving institutions, and positively affecting the education, careers, and lives of millions of Hispanic students throughout the United States.\nDr. Flores is a master architect and team builder within HACU, throughout the HSI community, across government, business and industry, and throughout U.S. society.\u00a0 I for one can most pleased that the department is continuing its collaboration with HACU.\u00a0 It\u2019s my pleasure to introduce to you President and CEO of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, Dr. Antonio Flores.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR FLORES:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0\nMR FLORES:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0 Thank you for those very kind words, Josue, and of course we\u2019re very proud of your career.\u00a0 He is obviously one of more than 15,000 placements that HACU has been able to over the years have with federal agencies of top-notch talent from our institutions.\u00a0 But\u00a0buenas tardes\u00a0and good evening.\nBefore I go on to my brief remarks, I want to acknowledge my colleagues who are here tonight because it\u2019s them who make everything happen in HACU.\u00a0 I just stay out of the way and they make it happen.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Dr. Lena Rodriguez, who is our senior VP for policy and government relations here in D.C., is here with us.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Ben Melano, senior executive director of the national internship program that we have at HACU.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We have a good friend, colleague, and president of Glendale Community College in Arizona, Dr. Terry Leyba Ruiz (applause) and Norma Jean Garcia, who is our executive director of communications in San Antonio.\u00a0 Thank you all for helping us.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSecretary Blinken, Assistant Secretary Satterfield (laughter), distinguished guests and friends, as we approach the end of Hispanic Heritage Month this weekend, and of course of the playoffs later in the month (laughter), it is only fitting that we do it with a homerun.\u00a0 And of course we are doing it in this magnificent venue, the Benjamin Franklin Room, under the seal of the United States of America, with the motto, \u201cE pluribus unum.\u201d\u00a0 And then that basically means, \u201cOut of many, one.\u201d\u00a0 And we gather to celebrate the historic signing of a comprehensive memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of State and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, HACU.\nHACU represents the 559 Hispanic-serving institutions, or HSIs, across the nation, and collectively these institutions serve 5.3 million college students from all walks of life, including 67 percent of the 3.8 million Hispanics in college today.\u00a0 HSIs are the backbone of Hispanic higher education and a major pillar of America\u2019s workforce development.\nThe MOU that we are about to sign will facilitate new opportunities for HSI students and graduates in the Foreign Service, in the civilian labor force of the State Department, as well as in study abroad programs and internships.\nMr. Secretary, on behalf of HACU and its nearly 600 member colleges and institutions across the country and its affiliated universities in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Spain, I thank you most sincerely for your foresight in signing this MOU, but also for your tireless leadership to promote America\u2019s values and democratic principles.\u00a0 I also would like to thank Assistant Secretary Satterfield for her invaluable support and guidance in the framing of the MOU, and Deputy Assistant Secretary Rosenzweig for his steadfast assistance to our HACU team under the leadership of Dr. Lena Rodriguez to bring us to this point.\nMr. Secretary, I am deeply honored and humbled by the opportunity to cosign this MOU with someone who personifies America\u2019s vision of a more peaceful and just world on behalf of President Biden.\u00a0 And I thank each and every one of you in the audience for joining us to celebrate the signing of this transformational MOU between the U.S. Department and \u2013 Department of State and HACU.\nThank you.\u00a0\u00a0Muchas gracias.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS GUZMAN:\u00a0\u00a0Buenas a todos.\u00a0 It is an absolute honor to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with all of you who care deeply about equal opportunity and work hard to support the Hispanic community.\u00a0 I am Susana Guzman.\u00a0 I am especially proud to stand here today as a first-generation American with a mother from Barranquilla, Colombia, and a father from Oriente, Cuba, who migrated to Miami, Florida in the \u201890s, and as a graduate of two Hispanic-serving institutions, Florida International University and Miami-Dade College.\u00a0 I know firsthand the life-changing opportunities that HSIs provide to their students.\nAs a beneficiary of Pell Grant scholarships and a scholarship that allowed me to study abroad, much like the State Department\u2019s Gilman scholarship which offers students like me international experiences, my experience informs the work that I do today as a program officer at the U.S. Department of State in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the Western Hemisphere Bureau to focus on inclusive education.\u00a0 I understand the importance of opportunities and of mentorship.\u00a0 In fact, it was during my internship in ECA in 2015 that I first aspired to be a civil servant after a day of shadowing our former assistant secretary, Evan Ryan, whom the Secretary knows very well.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We all have that in common, those of us that have spoken today, so we are honored to be here.\nSecretary Blinken was sworn in on January 2021, and since then he has worked to carry out President Biden\u2019s foreign policy agenda in a complex world.\u00a0 While doing so, Secretary Blinken has created and enacted policies that reflect his and the administration\u2019s belief in the paramount importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, integrating DEIA into all that we do, from our foreign policy to our exchange programming to our workplace.\u00a0 That makes me so proud to work here at the State Department.\u00a0\u00a0Muchas gracias, Mr. Secretary.\nCon mucho orgullo, with much pride, let\u2019s welcome our 71st Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good evening, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Buenas tardes.\u00a0 Welcome, welcome, welcome to the State Department.\u00a0 Welcome to the Benjamin Franklin Room.\u00a0 He\u2019s gazing at us right now.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I like to remind people that Benjamin Franklin was our first diplomat.\u00a0 He signed our first treaty.\u00a0 He charted the Gulf Stream.\u00a0 He helped pioneer electricity.\u00a0 He gave us our ethos of self-government.\u00a0 And virtually none of this did he do while sober, so \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what the lesson is, but I share it anyway.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSusana, thank you for the wonderful introduction, but thank you especially for your service here at the State Department.\u00a0 We are so proud and pleased to have you among us.\u00a0 You did a wonderful job.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd Dr. Flores, my thanks to you for your partnership and for your leadership of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\u00a0 I want to recognize also those at the State Department who have helped support and grow this partnership, including members of our employee affinity group, the Hispanic Employee Council of Foreign Affairs Agencies.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI am delighted to sign in a few moments this new memorandum of understanding during Hispanic Heritage Month, when we honor generations of Hispanic and Latino people who have served in every part of this department \u2013 from diplomats strengthening our alliances and partnerships, to development experts administering aid and expanding economic opportunity, to locally employed staff who are the lifeblood of every single embassy we have around the world and notably in our hemisphere, which I just spent some time last week in Colombia, in Chile and Peru, and saw the remarkable people that we have working with us in our embassies from those countries.\nBut it\u2019s also an opportunity to look ahead, to look ahead to the future of the department and how we can make it as diverse and inclusive as possible, because Susana is right: this has been at the heart of my mission since I\u2019ve been on this job.\nThis is not only a matter of doing the right thing, it\u2019s also doing the smart thing.\u00a0 And I know this every single day.\u00a0 We\u2019re operating in an extraordinarily diverse world.\u00a0 The greatest strength that we bring to the table is our own diversity.\u00a0 Our diversity makes us stronger.\u00a0 It makes us smarter.\u00a0 It makes is more creative.\u00a0 It brings different perspectives, different viewpoints, different experiences to every single problem we have before us.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t take advantage of that, we are quite simply tying our own hands behind our back.\u00a0 It makes no sense, and we are determined to make sure that we have a Department of State that truly reflects the country that it represents.\nToday, we\u2019re taking an important step in actually advancing this mission by reaffirming what has been a two-decades-long partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\u00a0 The institutions that make up HACU embody one of the best parts of our open, democratic society: the pursuit of knowledge, of education, of scholarship.\u00a0 Hispanic colleges and universities are home to researchers working to solve some of the most pressing challenges of our time that are going to affect the lives of millions of people, like developing innovative methods for removing carbon dioxide from atmosphere, finding new treatments for cancer.\u00a0 The institutions are training tomorrow\u2019s microbiologists, their labor economists, science teachers, psychologists, and yes, diplomats, among many other fields that are enriching our communities and also enriching our lives.\u00a0 And they foster a vibrant exchange of ideas not only among us but also across borders; for example, sponsoring students studying international business in Japan, sending students and faculty to learn about renewable energy in Costa Rica.\nThe MOU that we\u2019re signing this evening affirms a continued collaboration for the next five years.\u00a0 What does that mean?\u00a0 Well, it means that we\u2019ll keep working together to recruit students, to recruit faculty, to recruit staff from HACU colleges and universities to participate in our exchange programs around the world, like the Fulbright Program or the Benjamin Gilman International Scholarship.\u00a0 We will continue strengthening the pipeline from HACU institutions to careers in diplomacy, including through internship programs like the one, as we just heard, first brought Josue to the State Department.\u00a0 And by the way, my mom says the same thing to me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTo reach these goals, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with exchange program alumni, we\u2019ll promote participation in symposia and conferences, we will visit Hispanic-serving institutions.\nIf you look at it, there is real progress to show for our efforts over the last 20 years both within this department and beyond it.\u00a0 Since HACU and the department signed the first MOU together 20 years ago, the number of Hispanic and Latino employees at State has grown from 4 percent in 2001 to 8 percent of employees today.\u00a0 And broadly, between 2000 and 2019, the number of Hispanic and Latino students from the United States who\u2019ve studied abroad has nearly doubled.\nSo these are positive trends.\u00a0 They\u2019re good, but not good enough.\u00a0 We have work to do to make sure that this department and our programs look more like the country that we serve and that Hispanic and Latino students have the same access, the same opportunity, as their peers, whether in their studies, whether in academia, or for that matter anywhere in the world.\nAnd the truth is in neither of these categories does the representation of Hispanic and Latinos fully reflect their share of America\u2019s population.\u00a0 So that tells us that we have work to do and we are working to change that, led in part by Ambassador Bernicat who is here, who directs our work for us, recruitment and retention efforts, and Ambassador Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley.\u00a0 Gina, are you here tonight?\u00a0 Not sure if you are, but Gina is doing remarkable work.\u00a0 She is our first chief diversity and inclusion officer.\u00a0 I had the privilege of naming her to a job that we instituted, and she is helping to build a department that attracts but also retains a team that reflects our nation.\nOne of the things that we\u2019ve found over the years is even when we\u2019ve had some success in bringing under-represented parts of our country into the State Department, we don\u2019t always do such a good job in retaining them.\u00a0 And one of the things we\u2019re working on is making sure that we do, that we better understand why different groups may choose to leave and abandon an investment they had made early, and how we can continue to change and evolve our culture to make sure that it is the most welcoming place for everyone.\nOur collaboration with HACU will also continue to foster ties beyond the United States with students, with scholars, with communities across our hemisphere through our 100,000 Strong in the Americas Initiative.\u00a0 Some of you may be familiar with this.\u00a0 With this initiative, the State Department is working to expand study abroad opportunities for students across the Americas so that we can build stronger ties between our nations and spur inclusive economic growth for the entire region, from the bottom up and the middle out.\u00a0 One way we\u2019re doing this is by offering grants to universities to help them develop their own exchange programs.\nHACU institutions have been some of our biggest partners in this effort.\u00a0 If you go back to 2014, one-third of the grants that the State Department\u2019s 100,000 Strong in the Americas Innovation Fund has awarded have gone to teams that include at least one HACU institution.\u00a0 With these grants, Hispanic-serving institutions have forged strategic partnerships and relationships with partners across the Americas, hosted students from across the Western Hemisphere here in the United States.\nFor the participants, the ties that are formed with our nation through individual friendships, through areas of research, cultural and community connections, what we\u2019ve seen is they often last a lifetime.\u00a0 And in many ways, nothing better benefits our foreign policy and our place in the world than these relationships.\u00a0 These lasting connections, the affinities that they create, the understanding that they help to deepen \u2013 these matter.\nAnd one thing that\u2019s always fascinated me, and Assistant Secretary Satterfield who is leading our efforts knows this very well, if you go back and look at the history of our exchange programs in bringing students, young scholars, other young people from abroad to the United States, including from the Americas, what we\u2019ve found is this: we have a pretty good track record in identifying people who are going to go on and play incredibly meaningful roles in their own countries and in their societies.\nThrough the history of our exchange programs, we\u2019ve had more than 52 people who went on to win Nobel Prizes, 400 or so who became the presidents or prime ministers of their countries, thousands who became leaders in academia, research, the sciences, culture.\u00a0 And when you\u2019re building relationships with an extraordinary group of people at a young age, and they develop a real connection with the United States, there are few things that matter more in actually building very positive partnerships for people who are going to be leaders in their countries.\nSo this really matters to our foreign policy.\u00a0 It matters to our place in the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo simply put, it\u2019s my pleasure, Dr. Flores, to be here tonight, because we\u2019re grateful.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to HACU as a partner, and now we look forward to continuing our work together for many more years to come.\nWith that, we actually get down to the real business of the evening \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and that is signing the MOU.\u00a0 So Dr. Flores, please, join me.\nMR FLORES:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be effectively witnessed.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR FLORES:\u00a0\u00a0Very nice pen.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n(The MOU was signed.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It is now official.\u00a0 (Cheers and applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY SATTERFIELD:\u00a0 Thank you so much, and this concludes our program.\u00a0 Please enjoy your time this evening in the historic Diplomatic Reception Rooms where so much history, including tonight, has taken place.\u00a0 Thank you so much and have a good evening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-a-joint-press-availability/"}, {"url":

"Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Loy Henderson Auditorium", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "October 13, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Welcome.\u00a0 Welcome to the State Department.\u00a0\u00a0Bienvenido, a todos y todas.\u00a0 Thank you so much for being here today.\nA year ago, we came together in Mexico City to launch the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities, and we set three primary goals together: to protect our people, to prevent transborder crime, and to pursue criminal networks.\u00a0 And what\u2019s so critical is we defined these goals together.\u00a0 They reflect a shared responsibility and a shared interest in working together to address challenges that neither one of our nations can adequately address alone.\nToday, we have an opportunity to assess the progress that we\u2019ve made on these interconnected goals, and to identify what more we can do to meet them.\nThe high-level group represented here \u2013 including the attorney general, including the Secretary of Homeland Security, including the administrator of USAID, Ambassador Salazar, other leading U.S. Government officials focused on anti-corruption, on drug policy, on public health \u2013 all of us together reflect the comprehensive approach that the United States is bringing to bear on this set of issues.\u00a0 And we can visibly see a similar commitment on the part of our Mexican counterparts.\nThat commitment is also evident in the unprecedented investments, the new legislation, the deepened coordination that we\u2019ve demonstrated in our first year of implementation.\nLast November, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes\u00a0$1.9 billion for six new construction and modernization projects on\u00a0the U.S. southern border that include enhanced security features.\nIn June, the President signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.\u00a0 This is the United States\u2019 first major gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years, and it makes straw purchases and the trafficking of firearms a federal crime, and that we\u2019ve been using to hold traffickers accountable.\nWe\u2019ve made considerable new investments in substance use prevention, treatment, recovery \u2013 both to reduce the ravages wrought by illicit drugs, and to reduce demand.\u00a0 This year, our Drug\u2011Free Communities Program has worked with 745 community coalitions in all 50 of our states to prevent youth substance use.\nHaving said that, we still have a lot of work to do.\nWe need to enhance our efforts to disrupt illicit fentanyl production and trafficking, and synthetic opioids more broadly.\u00a0 Last year, approximately 108,000 people died in the United States of overdoses, most from synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\u00a0 Synthetic opioids are taking a rising toll in Mexico, too \u2013 something we\u2019ve talked about in recent months.\nWe need to enhance our efforts to disrupt illicit weapons trafficking.\u00a0 Last year, more than 33,000 people in Mexico were killed in intentional homicides; more than two-thirds of those came from firearms.\nSo across these and so many security issues, the same truth holds: our ability to protect our people depends on working effectively together.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do today, from treating substance use as a public health concern, to dismantling the financial networks of transnational criminal organizations, to addressing the root causes that drive people to organized crime, including a lack of economic opportunity.\nMarcelo, I just want to say to you and to all of our colleagues here we are so grateful for the spirit of openness and cooperation that all of you continue to bring to this effort \u2013 in the days leading up to today, today, indeed every day.\u00a0 And that\u2019s happening not just among those at this table, but critically, throughout the working levels of our governments.\u00a0 We deeply, deeply value it; we deeply appreciate it, and we look forward to a frank, open, productive discussion today as we\u2019ve had in recent months.\nWith that, let me turn it over to the attorney general.\u00a0 Merrick.\nATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND:\u00a0 Thank you, Secretary Blinken, Tony; Secretary Mayorkas, Ali; and to our esteemed friends from Mexico, Ale.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to see all of you again and to have this opportunity to reaffirm the central importance of the law enforcement partnership between our two countries.\nThe first framework goal that we will address today, protecting our people, is a thread that runs through everything we do.\u00a0 It is why we do this work.\u00a0 On behalf of the Department of Justice, our prosecutors, and each of our law enforcement components, including the DEA, ATF, FBI, and the United States Marshals Service, I want to thank the Government of Mexico for your continued partnership in our shared efforts to protect the people of both of our countries.\u00a0 I look forward to all of our discussions today and our continued work together.\nAli.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Ali?\nSECRETARY MAYORKAS:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken and Attorney General Garland, for your remarks.\u00a0 Secretary Ebrard, Secretary Rodriguez, Attorney General Gertz, and all colleagues, I am glad we\u2019re able to come together in this 20th \u2013 this 200th year of our country\u2019s friendship to celebrate the successes in our implementation of the historic bicentennial framework that was adopted last year.\u00a0 We are, of course, regularly reminded of how intertwined our nations are.\u00a0 Not only do we have a network of communities across our shared border that demonstrates every day how much we have in common, how connected our peoples are, but we also share so much of our respective cultures, we have common democratic principles, we have interconnected economies, and of course, we face similar challenges.\nIt is both a privilege and a pleasure to work together with all of you in strengthening our bonds which have grown so remarkably over the past several years to tackle the challenges that we both confront with really a united purpose and a shared foundational principle.\u00a0 I am very optimistic about the future because of all of you around this room and the teams whom you represent.\u00a0 I look forward to our dialogue today and to our continued work and friendship together in the days and years to come.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Antony.\u00a0\u00a0Muy buen d\u00eda.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to turn to Spanish.\n(Via interpreter)\u00a0 Thank you very much, assistant secretary.\u00a0 Thank you, Attorney General, Secretary Mayorkas, and all the rest of the officials that are here.\u00a0 I just want to say that for Mexico, this bicentennial framework is a high priority to us.\u00a0 It\u2019s strategic, and today we\u2019re going to review the accomplishments of this year of joint efforts.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to determine what we\u2019re going to do in 2023 to establish goals for that year. \u00a0President L\u00f3pez Obrador started a new security initiative.\u00a0 He launched it as he came in and to get to the root causes of insecurity and deal with young people in the rural sector.\u00a0 We have more than a half a million people \u2013 2.2 youths are out of work, I\u2019m saying.\u00a0 There\u2019s a high number of people out of work so \u2013 especially young people, and they\u2019re in a program that\u2019s created by the \u2013 we created a national guard.\u00a0 For the first time, we\u2019re going to have dominion over the entire territory from the law enforcement (inaudible).\u00a0 Before, we had 400 police forces.\nAnother key point is our \u2013 is this framework with the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it\u2019s a framework, because we have common security issues.\u00a0 And so I can tell you, and I\u2019d like to thank and underscore our gratitude to Secretary Blinken for his efforts, and Attorney General Garland who we have met on many, many occasions, and Secretary Mayorkas who we\u2019ve spoken with a lot because they\u2019ve become personally involved in all these efforts.\u00a0 What has been achieved over this year?\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 There\u2019s 32,000 weapons have been seized.\u00a0 How do we view this in Mexico?\u00a0 We \u2013 for the first time, we have a reduction of the murder rate of 9.2 percent approximately it was reduced.\u00a0 Of these 32,000 weapons had been in Mexico, if we hadn\u2019t worked together, we wouldn\u2019t have a 9.2 percent reduction of homicide rate.\u00a0 This means 17,000 cartridges, and each cartridge can kill someone in Mexico, and so it\u2019s something that\u2019s of the upmost important.\u00a0 This is not just statistics.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about saving lives.\nAnd we can\u2019t just do it without working together, and so that\u2019s why we view it as very important.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to see soon \u2013 we\u2019re going to take a look very soon at \u2013 that there\u2019s been an achievement of arrests of 5,000 chemical precursors and fentanyl as well.\u00a0 It\u2019s so much it could poison thousands of people if they had gotten to where they were going \u2013 150,000 tons of methamphetamine.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost \u2013 if \u2013 it\u2019s if we give a dose of methamphetamine, that would allow to give to every person in Mexico who\u2019s over 50 years of age, that would be enough methamphetamine.\u00a0 Ninety-four tons of cocaine were seized as well with a special interception at sea \u2013 interdiction at sea.\u00a0 It\u2019s been \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get in more detail \u2013 of these details.\u00a0 I just want to say with these results what we should do is next year we should make it higher figures to reduce violence and avoid drugs from getting to people in Mexico and the United States.\nNow that I\u2019ve said this and with our gratitude, I give the floor right now to Rosa Icela Rodriguez, the Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection.\nSECURITY SECRETARY RODRIGUEZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good morning to everything.\u00a0 I\u2019m very happy to be here with you all.\u00a0 Greetings, and I thank our hosts for their hospitality.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Secretary Mayorkas and Attorney General Garland and everyone present and the Ambassador Ken Salazar.\u00a0 I thank and say hello to the members of the cabinet of the Government of Mexico.\nAnd yes, I want to underscore that security is a priority \u2013 a topic or issue for our governments and must \u2013 this binational vision should remain in place, government to government, the government of Lopez Obrador and the current government of the United States, and at all times there be a \u2013 there prevail sovereignty and respect.\nThis is a major decision by this country.\u00a0 The bicentennial framework has enabled us to work in coordinated fashion and agree upon this collaboration without conditioning \u2013 without any conditions, so we underscore that this instrument is part of peace, peacekeeping, or peace efforts in both of our countries.\u00a0 And our nations are obligated to work together jointly because we have a shared responsibility to combat organized \u2013 transnational organized crime, which on this side in the United States leads to overdose deaths, and Mexico has violent homicides because of the transfer of these drugs.\nSo after \u2013 by working together and putting into practice, as we have done thus far, the capacities of our states to diminish the crime and to hamstring these criminal groups and bring about peace in the Americas, and therefore, Mexico and the United States, we are united by peace.\u00a0 Because we have a bilateral relationship of brotherhood; because we\u2019re neighbors, partners; in many regions, we\u2019re family members of each other.\u00a0 That\u2019s all.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Secretary.\u00a0 Before I give the floor to Dr. Alejandro Betz (ph), the attorney general \u2013 or Gertz \u2013 of Mexico, I want to highlight the presence, and it\u2019s very important in this framework of the national defense \u2013 Cresencio Sandoval, the presence of our defense minister, and Admiral Rafael Ojeda, who is the secretary of the navy of our country.\u00a0 Thank you very much for joining us here.\nYou have the floor, Mr. Attorney General.\nATTORNEY GENERAL GERTZ:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, thank you so much for inviting us.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to be with you all.\u00a0 Thank each and every one of you, ambassador as well.\nI believe that it\u2019s very important to point out that the work that we have been engaged in over time has been \u2013 has become even stronger as the result of the presence of Ambassador Salazar in Mexico.\nThe first thing we should mention is \u2013 and we should take this into account \u2013 crime has no borders.\u00a0 Crime is a structure that precisely takes advantage of the sovereignty of states and circumstances that are so clear about what our legal authorities, our own competencies are, to use them against the citizenry of both countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s why when we work together with full respect of each one of the governments, we can achieve something that otherwise would be absolutely impossible.\nThe first thing that I mentioned with Ambassador Salazar were three things that we were deeply concerned about because of the harm that was being caused in Mexico and the United States as a result.\u00a0 For example, what\u2019s happening with fentanyl is a phenomenon that we should attach a very high, substantive importance to.\u00a0 We are living this problem of drugs since the \u201970s and \u201980s.\u00a0 We did make some progress, but now what we\u2019re facing is one of the most horrid phenomena that\u2019s destroying the lives of young people, children in Mexico and the United States.\u00a0 This for us should be our highest priority, and I believe that whatever we do is very little as compared to what lives mean to families and new generations of Mexico and the United States.\nWe also saw something that was so important to avoid, what\u2019s being done with \u2013 to migrants.\u00a0 Migrants are victims, and those who manipulate them are heartless criminals.\u00a0 So if we don\u2019t have the ability to get to the heads of those organizations, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 won\u2019t be able to do anything.\u00a0 We cannot solve this problem.\u00a0 The problem, it comes to Mexico from all of Central America and all over the world.\u00a0 It comes to Mexico.\u00a0 We have to understand that this phenomenon is a very complicated phenomenon.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because immigrants are not criminals.\u00a0 The criminal is the one that uses them and exploits migrants in an absolutely inhuman way.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t go after the heads of these groups and these people, we\u2019re not going to be able to solve the issue.\nAnd that we\u2019re doing, what is absolutely essential to do \u2013 drug trafficking is to us a problem that dates back many, many years \u2013 we have to find a way to prevent purchase of weapons illegally in the United States and for them to flood into Mexico.\u00a0 And they cause all these confrontations, which has cost thousands and thousands of lives.\u00a0 It\u2019s absolutely essentially to understand this phenomenon, and we\u2019re very clear about this.\nAnd let me tell you one thing that I believe is of the utmost importance.\u00a0 These are data that have been upheld by the National Geographic and Statistics Institute.\u00a0 I believe that these are well known statistics by you.\u00a0 The phenomena of crime that had grown in a huge way has been stemmed.\u00a0 We don\u2019t recognize the means, but if \u2013 in reality, if you take a look at the statistics, the figures of how the mortality rates in Mexico have been evolving, and based on under this government \u2013 and remember, prevention is not my bailiwick.\u00a0 That\u2019s not my area.\u00a0 But containing these crimes, containing a criminal phenomenon for those who we know \u2013 we know what it involves and the effort that has to be made, and what\u2019s been done by the armed forces has been just exemplary.\u00a0 And this is something that we should take very much into account.\nIf you look at the statistics of how we\u2019ve stemmed common crimes, especially homicides \u2013 and let me say that when it comes to federal crimes, what we\u2019re concerned with \u2013 and this has been recognized \u2013 federal crimes have been reduced over these four years by 32 percent.\u00a0 This had never happened in the past.\u00a0 The media talk a lot about the bad stuff, but not about the good stuff.\u00a0 And so they talk more about the scandalous stuff, but we are firmly convinced that what\u2019s being done and should be recognized because that \u2013 the President of the United States is represented by the ambassador, and the ambassador has done an exemplary job.\u00a0 We\u2019re always in close contact with Secretary Mayorkas, with the Attorney General, with each and every one of you, because we believe that if we do it together, we can live up to what we have to do.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t, forget it.\u00a0 This won\u2019t work.\nAnd so a meeting like this deserves the highest respect and it deserves for us having that deep belief that we\u2019re all working on behalf of our people, our countries, but in the end we\u2019re also working \u2013 you are working for us and we\u2019re working for you as well.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to give our colleagues a minute to leave the room.\n\n"}, {"url":

Arroyo, and Mr. Secretary of the United States Antony Blinken.\u00a0 Following, the words of the ministry of foreign affairs of Peru, Dr. C\u00e9sar Landa Arroyo.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good afternoon, journalists and Mr. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 It is a great honor for us to receive you here in this House of Government within the framework of the bilateral meeting we\u2019ve had with the president of the republic to reaffirm the links which we have with the USA on which we strengthen our relationships from the foundation of our republics.\u00a0 In particular, your presence is very important for us and we want to thank you for the contribution we received from your country for our struggle against the pandemic, as well as in our challenge \u2013 our struggle against drug trafficking.\u00a0 We hope to strengthen the trade and investment links to have the necessary resources to fill the gaps we have within our society economy-wise.\nIn that sense, I would like also to say that the governability in democracy is a shared value, and the Peruvian people through elections and through the separation of powers, and in particular in the protection of human rights and the independence of the judiciary \u2013 this characterizes our democracy after we rebuilt it with the collaboration of the OAS and the Government of the United States, among others.\nFinally, I would like to stress that the commitment of the government together with the cooperation of the USA allow us to face the crisis after the pandemic as well as that which is produced by the effects of the conflict between the USSR[i]\u00a0and the Ukraine, but that we have to overcome this in coordination and with alliances, together with our vulnerable peoples in Peru, which are indigenous peoples, people with problems.\nWe have a commitment with values we share together in this bilateral meeting.\u00a0 We begin strengthening our political ties, our commercial and trade ties with the USA.\u00a0 In that sense, I really thank you for your participation within the assembly of the OAS, which has as a purpose the model Peru proposal: all together struggling against the inequality and discrimination.\u00a0 And thus we have proposals to celebrate the Lima Declaration, which reaffirms the struggle against inequality in any kind, as well as declaration to reaffirm the need to have a public health policy which warranties precisely health care for the most vulnerable people against future pandemics or natural resources; and also to reaffirm the right \u2013 the need for education, the right of people to education, which is the way in which people will acquire the basic conditions of technical and value formation to form citizens for the future.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Now we have the words of the Secretary of State of the USA Mr. Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Muchas gracias.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, C\u00e9sar, it\u2019s wonderful to be with you and wonderful to get a lot of good work done today.\u00a0 I think that work reinforces the way that we can draw on the longstanding partnership between Peru and the United States bilaterally but also together with fellow democracies across our hemisphere to make tangible progress on the issues that actually have an impact on the lives of our citizens.\u00a0 And I think you can see that in all that we actually covered today and accomplished today.\nThe foreign minister and I convened fellow ministers for a meeting of the \u2013 it\u2019s a long name \u2013 the Summit Implementation Review Group.\u00a0 What this is, is a group to follow up on the commitments that we made at the ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles a few months ago.\u00a0 There, our leaders made commitments to strengthen public health systems, to advance a regionwide digital transformation, to accelerate the clean energy transition, to invest in climate resilience and adaptation, and to promote and protect democratic governance.\nToday, we agreed to a work plan to start achieving those goals.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve already gotten to work on this since the Summit of the Americas, and we discussed some of the progress that we\u2019ve made even over the last four months toward realizing our commitments, such as partnering with the Pan American Health Organization to train half a million health care workers for our hemisphere over the next five years; implementing our partnership with Caribbean nations to develop solutions on climate, on energy, on food security through PACC 2030; and investing in Latin American and Caribbean Network for Democracy to support deepened engagement with civil society.\nC\u00e9sar and I also convened another ministerial meeting of the 21 signatories of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.\u00a0 That affirms for the first time our shared responsibility in this hemisphere in working to create the conditions for safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration \u2013 an issue where Peru is leading by example.\u00a0 At the meeting, we launched a collective implementation process with countries stepping up to lead across important lines of effort, from finding ways to better integrate migrants and support their host communities to combating xenophobia.\u00a0 Today, I announced on the part of the United States that we\u2019ll provide more than $240 million in new humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of refugees and migrants in our hemisphere as well as the host communities that welcome them.\u00a0 Just since last month, the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development announced nearly $817 million in new assistance supporting our efforts under the Los Angeles Declaration.\nAnd of course, as C\u00e9sar said, we took part in the first in-person General Assembly of the Organization of American States since 2019.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for Peru\u2019s leadership in hosting what was, I think, a constructive and consequential meeting of the OAS.\nIf you think about it, just in the time since the last OAS General Assembly in person, in 2019, we have faced as a region, as a hemisphere, no shortage of challenges, including COVID-19 and also its lasting human and economic consequences; and more recently rising food, fertilizer, and energy costs, all of which have been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 The impact of \u2013 on food supplies and fertilizer in particular has been felt profoundly here in Peru.\u00a0 And President Castillo and I discussed steps that we can take to respond to that challenge, and we committed to working on this together in the months ahead.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in Peru, in the United States, across our hemisphere, these headwinds are hitting underserved and marginalized communities the hardest \u2013 those who can least afford it.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the Lima Declaration that we and the OAS member states will adopt tomorrow to work together to advance equity and inclusion across our hemisphere is so important.\u00a0 Being together again gave us the opportunity also to recommit to the region\u2019s shared democratic values and to the proposition that we can deliver more for one another and for our people when we actually work together in common cause.\nIt\u2019s especially meaningful to make that commitment here in Lima, where our nations came together to adopt the Inter-American Democratic Charter a little over two decades ago, a step that was inspired by the grassroots mobilization of citizens across Peru at the time to defend their democracy and their right to choose their own path.\nAcross all of the issues where we\u2019re working regionally to deliver results for our people, Peru and the United States are also working together bilaterally, grounded in our shared interests and values, as we have across many administrations over many years.\nThat shared commitment was crystal-clear when the foreign minister and I met with President Castillo today.\u00a0 And we\u2019re fortunate, I must say, to have in place a terrific ambassador, Ambassador Kenna, who has been a longtime friend of mine, who is driving our bilateral cooperation across the board.\nWe discussed our shared work on migration.\u00a0 I had the chance to commend the president and the foreign minister for hosting more than 1.3 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants, and offering them a pathway to secure a more regular status.\nNearly half a million Venezuelans have already gone through this process, allowing them to work, to go to school, to access health care, and many other public services that allow them to provide for their loved ones, to build better lives, to contribute to their host communities.\nOur countries are close partners on environmental challenges as well.\u00a0 Earlier this year we came together to respond to the ecological devastation that was caused by the oil spill just north of here.\u00a0 Over the last three years, USAID has partnered with the Peruvian people and their governments and provided $60 million to improve mining practices, to fight deforestation, to promote sustainable economic development, including in indigenous communities.\nWe continue to work with Peru to address collective threats like transnational crime and drug trafficking, both of which are exacerbated by the scourge of corruption.\u00a0 Our funding, our training, our partnerships have helped Peru make important progress.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to work together in the years ahead.\nTomorrow I\u2019ll have a chance to visit the Chorrillos fish market to highlight our partnership to combat illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, which is inflicting significant harm on Peru\u2019s marine economy and environment.\u00a0 It\u2019s going directly to the livelihoods of Peruvians who are in the fishing business.\nWe also committed to protecting Peru\u2019s awe-inspiring culture and heritage.\u00a0 For the last 25 years, we\u2019ve worked together to return more than seven \u2013 excuse me, 2,000 Peruvian cultural artifacts that were once illegally trafficked in the United States.\nFinally, let me say this:\u00a0 For all the ties that bind our countries, none run as deep as the ties between our people.\u00a0 There are more than half a million Peruvian Americans living in the United States.\u00a0 For generations, they\u2019ve enriched the fabric of our country and our communities, including individuals like the legendary Peruvian American singer Yma Sumac, who is the subject of a mural commissioned at the United States embassy here in Lima to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of her birth \u2013 a mural I\u2019m very much looking forward to getting a chance to see tomorrow.\nSo I apologize for going on so long, but I think that\u2019s just evidence that we\u2019ve had a very productive day \u2013 both with our OAS colleagues, and bilaterally between the United States and Peru.\nWe and our partners continue to demonstrate real progress on the challenges that matter most in the lives of our people, and we\u2019re going to build on that progress in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Following, we have a round of questions with the media.\u00a0 Mr. Juan Carlos Portilla from Latina.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Foreign Minister Landa, here from Latina \u2013 here to your right.\u00a0 Well, Minister, you already have mentioned some aspects of the conversation you\u2019ve had with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 However, I would like to ask you if there are some specific aspects or if there will be a possibility of assigning some kind of agreement or trade agreement within the following months within the framework of these conversations.\nAnd if you allow me to thank you in advance, the Peruvian congress has denied the permit \u2013 the permission to President Castillo to travel abroad.\u00a0 I understand that there was a very important agenda with several people from the European Union.\u00a0 How much impact has this \u2013 does this have on the Government of Peru?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Well, Peru\u2019s foreign policy is based on multilaterality on one hand, and on the other hand, in accordance with our constitution, the president is the director of international relationships.\u00a0 And thus, that is why we have a presidential diplomacy which has taken the president to the General Assembly of the OAS, to Los Angeles, among other trips he has been doing.\nIn that sense, the determination of congress today is a great surprise for our ministry, and also for our partners and friend countries.\u00a0 Because His Holiness Pope Francis expected the president the following Monday, 17th, in an audience, but also he was going to have a visit in this month of October because most of \u2013 October is a very important month for religious topics because for Peru it is a \u2013 there is a great devotion during this month to\u00a0el Se\u00f1or de Los Milagros, and apart from the agendas foreseen for our meeting with the world food fund, or the food program of the UN, to strengthen the struggle against food insecurity is frustrated, and also the meeting with the leaders of the European Union to strengthen those bonds for common cooperation.\u00a0 So I would ask the representatives of congress to review this decision, because it compromises not the president himself, but the external policy in particular, and humanitarian policy also.\nAnd in particular with the United States, we have a treaty \u2013 free trade agreement which is an ongoing perfectioning, and we\u2019ve increased exports mostly from the production of SMEs with an added value.\u00a0 And the investments that are being carried out and within the international scenario, which might be complicated because of the effects of the crisis, we maintain the trust as in the meeting in the \u2013 in New York City with the American news society, with 40 entrepreneurs, where we reaffirmed juridical stability, legal stability, the respect for the agreements.\u00a0 And this also has to do with our respect for labor laws and payment for taxes.\nSo we will continue strengthening our links not only commercially, but also the struggle against \u2013 in the struggle against drug trafficking and trying to close the gaps, social gaps of extreme poverty and protect the most vulnerable peoples of Peru.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Well, what are the \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister.\nMr. Secretary, following the OPEC+ decision to cut production targets, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said it\u2019s time for a wholesale re-evaluation of the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 My questions are:\u00a0 Is there any thinking within the administration for such a re-evaluation?\u00a0 How worried are you that Gulf partners are inching towards Russia?\u00a0 And given that inching, should the United States continue to provide weapons to Saudi Arabia?\nOn Ukraine, very briefly, President Biden earlier today was asked if he will meet President Putin during G20, and he said it remains to be seen.\u00a0 He did not rule it out.\u00a0 You\u2019ve said in the past that Russians aren\u2019t prepared for meaningful diplomacy; that\u2019s why you\u2019re not engaging.\u00a0 But right now, there are increasing concerns over the possibility of a nuclear attack.\u00a0 Don\u2019t you think it is the responsibility of the United States to initiate diplomacy with Russia at a time like this?\nAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, since the start of President Castillo\u2019s term, there has been intense turmoil surrounding his government.\u00a0 He had to reshuffle his cabinet several times and has been grappling with corruption charges.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t that endanger Peru\u2019s democracy, economy, and the stability of its policies?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you, Humeyra.\u00a0 First, on the OPEC decision, I think as you\u2019ve heard clearly from my colleagues in the White House and the administration, we see the decision as both disappointing and short-sighted, especially as we have a global economy that is dealing with the implications of recovering from COVID, as well as the aggression from Russia in Ukraine, the consequences that\u2019s having.\nWe\u2019ve said all along that supply needs to meet demand, and we\u2019ve been clear about that and we\u2019ve been working on that.\u00a0 And as you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps over the last months to try to ensure that that\u2019s the case, including releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, increasing significantly our production \u2013 oil production is up in the United States by about 500,000 barrels a day \u2013 and looking at other steps that we can take to ensure that there is adequate supply to meet \u2013 to meet global demand.\nThe National Economic Council Advisor, our National Security Advisor yesterday laid out some of the additional steps, tools, authorities that we\u2019re looking at, again, to make sure that we have adequate supply of energy on the market to meet demand.\nAs to the relationship going forward, we\u2019re reviewing a number of response options.\u00a0 We\u2019re consulting closely with Congress.\u00a0 We will not do anything that would infringe on our interests \u2013 that\u2019s first and foremost what will guide us \u2013 and we will keep all of those interests in mind and consult closely with all of the relevant stakeholders as we decide on any steps going forward.\nWith regard to Ukraine, I think what you\u2019ve seen in recent weeks is a doubling and tripling down by President Putin on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine \u2013 the mobilization of reserves, the purported annexation of Ukrainian territory, and of course some of the loose talk that we\u2019ve heard about nuclear weapons.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also seen of course the very significant gains by Ukrainians to regain the land that was seized from them by Russian forces, both in the northeast and in the south.\nBut the fact is that President Putin and Russia have shown absolutely no interest in any kind of meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 And unless and until they do, it\u2019s very hard to pursue it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve said all along, President Zelenskyy has said all along that this will ultimately be resolved through diplomacy.\u00a0 And if and when Russia shows that it has any seriousness of purpose about engaging in such diplomacy, we\u2019ll be ready, we\u2019ll be there.\u00a0 But every sign in this moment unfortunately points in the opposite direction.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Mr. Harold Chavez from Exitosa.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Good afternoon, Foreign Minister.\u00a0 Good afternoon, Secretary.\u00a0 Harold Chavez from Exitosa.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, we would like to know which agreements you wish to get to agree upon in the OAS assembly.\u00a0 And if you allow me to speak about the impeachment facing the speech of Pedro Castillo.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Yeah, thank you very much.\u00a0 The General Assembly of the OAS, which has as purpose the crisis which is produced in our national reality and globally to \u2013 which has generated perverse consequences towards the most vulnerable peoples \u2013 that is why the focus of struggle against inequality and discrimination is not finished in \u2013 with a food topic, which is necessary, of course, satisfaction of basic social needs, but also, as it is mentioned, of struggle against corruption because it is an evil which affects and impacts on the public budget, or bad management, and also on \u2013 impacts on the piece of services by which the most vulnerable people must receive.\u00a0 And there is an agreement of struggle against corruption, but also because of the Peruvian experience of the last decades where the clause of integrity is present in many agreements or treaties that Peru has been signing or renewing.\nIn that sense, it is part, of course, of the deliberations of the internal assembly of the OAS, and in particular in food security, which is a human right for the populations.\u00a0 The most affected or vulnerable must have the possibility of have a minimum of nutritional health \u2013 girls and boys and people from the fields, from the \u2013 inside the country who do not have their main needs, basic needs covered.\u00a0 That is why in the scope of international political arena or on the strengthening of the public system in terms of health and also nutrition and food, we need to increase the public budgets to strengthen and give resources and programs to those areas.\u00a0 And this should not be made only locally \u2013 locally but all together with other countries, learning from experiences from other countries in topics of health and nutrition, as Mr. Secretary has mentioned, of strengthening this \u2013 in these topics with international cooperation both bilaterally and multilaterally will allow us to have success in solving these problems.\nThe impeachment which has been formed facing the speech of the president of the republic facing the \u2013 in the assembly of the OAS, on one hand it\u2019s the acknowledgment that the president is the director of the external policy with regard to our constitution, and of this presidential diplomacy he expresses in forums regionally or globally, as in the United Nations, the guidelines of the external policy, which is not from this government but from the state during the last years.\u00a0 And that is why we\u2019ve signed the principles of the UN, which are peace and security and the acknowledgment of the struggle of peoples, which in decolonization progresses under the UN have been having progress.\nAnd with this, the impeachment will have to be answered to with \u2013 in accordance to the summons of the \u2013 of parliament.\u00a0 In a more precise manner, when I went there to the audience two weeks ago in accordance to the new questions they asked, we will have to clarify.\u00a0 It is an external policy independent and within the framework of international values of respect to the state of democracy, not only in Peru but in the whole world.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Vivian Salama,\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Minister Landa,\u00a0gracias por alojarnos.\u00a0 Una pregunta en ingl\u00e9s, por favor.\u00a0 Gracias.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo are you \u2013 okay.\u00a0 I wanted to ask you about the impact of the Ukraine war on Peru and the region in the coming months, in particular Peru\u2019s efforts to secure fertilizers.\u00a0 What measures is Peru and its allies in the region taking to try to ease prices from climbing even further?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMr. Secretary, thank you so much for having us along with you on this trip.\u00a0 First, my question on Venezuela.\u00a0 Some recent events, including last week\u2019s successful prisoner swap by the administration, also today\u2019s vote on whether Juan Guaid\u00f3 should be allowed to be represented at OAS, are being viewed by the Venezuelan opposition as a blow, particularly one that buys Maduro some time.\u00a0 Is the U.S. ultimately losing faith in the prospect that Guaid\u00f3 might be its primary partner in Venezuela?\u00a0 And when his term ends at the end of this year, is there a prospect that the U.S. deals with neither Guaid\u00f3 or Maduro?\nAnd secondly a quick question on the UK, the global economy.\u00a0 As the global economy faces a slowdown, Britain has some unique challenges.\u00a0 Liz Truss, your former counterpart, has struggled since becoming Britain\u2019s new prime minister.\u00a0 Are you confident that the UK will be able to manage \u2013 maintain its focus on some of the mutual global priorities like the war in Ukraine and the global energy crisis given the ongoing political and economic turmoil?\nThank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) The foreign policy of Peru (inaudible) in these principles of multilateralism has diplomatic relationships with hundreds of countries in the world.\u00a0 And due to Russia\u2019s aggression on Ukraine, Peru made a declaration within the framework of the UN condemning Russia because they broke the basic principles of the UN constitution of solving problems with dialogue and negotiation, which is what Peru continues to defend with regard to this conflict, which of course has impacted on Peru and in the whole world because it has broken the supply chain of urea and grain.\u00a0 And Peru has had to find elsewhere, and we\u2019ve been talking to Mr. Antony Blinken to strengthen the cooperation of supply of fertilizers and urea which are demanded by the great extensions in agriculture in Peru, mostly survival farming that we have here in Peru.\nAnd in the assembly of the OAS, we \u2013 we have heard President Zelenskyy asking for support in his conflict, and within this framework of Peru\u2019s external policy, we again give him his support and we wish to find a solution in \u2013 because the civil society is the most affected in every war.\nAnd within this logic, Peru also has a commitment apart from the international circumstances to have an agricultural policy which protects the small farmers, mostly the rural families, so as to establish some kind of bonds \u2013 bonuses for the acquirement of urea, and establish bonds to have this supply.\u00a0 And it is very complex now because of the conflicts, but with the cooperation of the \u2013 our friend countries from the region and other latitudes too, we are seeking to satisfy this demand.\u00a0 And with \u2013 along this logic, the second agrarian reform as stated by the government wants \u2013 wishes to be translated with \u2013 by a better supply of these resources which the agrarian population needs.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Let me, if I can comment briefly on the question that you posed to the foreign minister before getting into the questions you directed at me.\u00a0 With the Russian aggression against Ukraine, we saw what was already a very difficult situation around the world when it came to food insecurity get even worse.\u00a0 Already with climate change, with COVID, we\u2019d seen significant impacts on the supply of food, including grain, including fertilizer, as well as price.\u00a0 But the Russian aggression exacerbated that dramatically, and we\u2019re now in a situation where we have more than 200 million people around the world who are severely food-insecure.\nFrom day one, we have worked to counteract that crisis and that situation.\u00a0 Back in March, shortly after the Russian aggression, President Biden dedicated a half a billion dollars to food fertilizer production in the United States to try to get more fertilizer on the market and to try to keep prices in check.\u00a0 In addition, we\u2019ve been leading the effort internationally to deal with the food insecurity prices more broadly.\u00a0 At the United Nations back in May, as you may remember, we brought dozens of countries together and we put forward a call to action, a roadmap for how to deal with food insecurity.\u00a0 More than a hundred countries now have signed onto that roadmap, and it includes specific steps that we\u2019re taking together both to deal with the immediate emergency situation that countries find themselves in but also with the mid-term and the long-term to ensure that countries have and develop the durable productive capacity that they need to produce food for themselves for the long term.\nWe also have one of the most significant programs in our government called Feed the Future that will dedicate $11 billion over five years to helping build long-term food security in countries that need assistance.\nToday we talked with President Castillo about work that our two countries can do together to address the fertilizer challenge here in Peru, and we\u2019re committed to doing that in the weeks ahead.\nOn Venezuela, there is no change in our policy or on our approach.\u00a0 There\u2019s no change to our sanctions policy.\u00a0 That can only follow constructive steps by the Maduro regime to move toward free and fair elections, to engage in negotiations with the Unitary Platform, and for there to be genuine progress in those negotiations.\nWe\u2019ve also said very clearly that we\u2019ll review our policies, including our sanctions policies, in response to constructive steps by the Maduro regime to restore democracy in Venezuela as well as to alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people, who are the number one victims of the policies of the regime.\u00a0 And at the same time, we will also review and, if necessary, recalibrate our approach if there\u2019s even more repression by the regime.\u00a0 So that\u2019s where we are.\u00a0 And as I said, there\u2019s no change.\nWhen it comes to Prime Minister Truss, I\u2019m obviously not going to comment on internal politics in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 What I can comment on is the prime minister herself, her character.\u00a0 She\u2019s someone that I had the fortune to get to know very well when she was foreign minister, and we worked very closely together over more than a year, particularly on the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\nNo one took a stronger, more principled stand against the Russian aggression; no one was more determined to make sure that we were doing everything possible to support Ukraine, to put pressure on Russia, as well as to strengthen our alliance, our defensive alliance, NATO, in case aggression extended beyond Ukraine, than then-foreign secretary and now Prime Minister Truss.\u00a0 And I have zero doubt that that will continue in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Ladies and gentlemen, the presentation before the press is (inaudible).\u00a0 Thank you to the media.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-before-the-meeting-with-cuban-venezuelan-and-nicaraguan-human-rights-defenders/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony

you.\u00a0\u00a0Buenos dias,\u00a0bom dia,\u00a0bonjour, good afternoon to everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with all of our colleagues here today.\nAnd I\u2019m especially grateful that we\u2019ve been able to hold the OAS General Assembly in person for the first time since 2019, and I want to start by again thanking our hosts here in Peru for the wonderful hospitality, the wonderful organization.\nSince the last time we met in person, I think it\u2019s fair to say that our hemisphere has faced no shortage of challenges.\u00a0 No region in the world has been harder hit by the pandemic or its economic consequences.\nAnd then just as we were beginning to recover, we ran into new headwinds \u2013 rising food and energy costs, which have been worsened by President Putin\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.\nWhat we\u2019ve also experienced is that the consequences have fallen disproportionately on communities that have historically been marginalized or underserved.\u00a0 People of African descent, and other racial and ethnic minorities.\u00a0 Indigenous communities.\u00a0 Women and girls.\u00a0 People with disabilities.\u00a0 LGBTQI+ people.\nThe recent headwinds have been compounded by longstanding, pre-existing challenges across the region: a chronic lack of economic opportunity; an accelerating climate crisis; endemic corruption, all of which are driving people to leave their homes in unprecedented numbers, despite knowing the serious risks of the journey.\nCitizens across our hemisphere are looking to their governments \u2013 to us\u00a0\u2013 to help address these problems, to create the conditions, and give them the tools they need, to actually improve their lives.\u00a0 So it\u2019s one of the greatest tests that our nations face \u2013 indeed have faced since we came together in Lima to adopt the Inter-American Democratic Charter on that indelible September 11 day in 2001.\nWe believe strongly that we can meet this test if \u2013 if we come together to close two gaps between what our democracies promise and what they deliver.\nFirst, we can address enduring inequities in access to opportunity, which have for too long prevented communities from reaching their full potential.\nThis social compact has been at the heart of the OAS since its conception.\u00a0 Under President Biden\u2019s leadership, we are committed to partnering with countries across the region to deliver solutions to challenges affecting all of our people \u2013 challenges that no country can solve alone.\nIn the Caribbean, where today, two-thirds of the people are experiencing food insecurity, we\u2019re partnering with CARICOM to combat hunger and malnutrition, but also giving farmers the tools they need to boost productivity and adapt to the growing effects of climate change, so that communities can actually feed their own people as well as others.\nTogether with partners, we\u2019re working to meet the commitment we made at the Summit of Americas in June to train and equip half a million local health care workers across the hemisphere, so that more people can get the quality care that they need in their own communities.\u00a0 This initiative in and of itself can help revolutionize access to health care and the quality of health care.\nThrough the efforts of Vice President Harris, we have raised $3.2 billion in investment commitments from more than 40 companies to promote broad-based economic opportunity in El Salvador and Guatemala and Honduras \u2013 from expanding access to rural broadband to helping create good-paying jobs in manufacturing to providing small, minority and women-owned businesses with access to credit.\nAcross these efforts and others, we focused on empowering communities that have experienced systematic marginalization over the years because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u00a0 Because when all communities have equal access to development, all of society benefits.\u00a0 And because more equal democracies tend to be more stable and secure partners.\u00a0 That\u2019s the spirit of the Lima Declaration \u2013 \u201cTogether Against Inequality and Discrimination\u201d \u2013 that we will collectively adopt tomorrow.\nA few days ago in Colombia, I had the honor of formally committing the United States to be the first international accompanier of the Ethnic Chapter of the country\u2019s 2016 peace agreement.\nThis is a visionary document because it recognizes that a lasting peace cannot be achieved without making strides toward greater equity, justice, and inclusion for the country\u2019s Afro\u2011Colombian and Indigenous communities who suffered disproportionately during the country\u2019s conflict.\nAdvancing equity is also crucial to building durable democracy \u2013 not just in Colombia, but across our hemisphere.\u00a0 Including the United States, where we have our own deep history of discrimination, which is still felt in our society.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden has made the fight for equity and racial justice a priority for our administration \u2013 at home as well as around the world.\nI have to tell you it\u2019s been one of my highest priorities at the State Department, because we know that the incredible diversity of our country is one of our greatest strengths, including in our foreign policy.\u00a0 It makes us stronger.\u00a0 It makes us smarter.\u00a0 It makes us more creative.\u00a0 It gives us the plurality of voices and views and visions that are vital to our own democratic experiment and to being a better partner to fellow democracies across the hemisphere.\u00a0 I appointed the Department\u2019s first chief diversity and inclusion officer to help drive progress toward a more diverse institution that actually looks like the country it represents and, as well, our first Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice, Desiree Cormier Smith, who is part of our delegation to the General Assembly to help us promote these efforts around the world.\nSo that\u2019s one big piece.\u00a0 The second is this:\u00a0 We believe that we have to recommit to delivering on the core principles of our OAS and Inter\u2011American Democratic Charters.\u00a0 There are so many ways member states can help make real the commitments embodied in those charters.\nWe can unequivocally condemn the authoritarian regimes in our region and take collective steps to hold them accountable.\nIn Nicaragua, the Ortega-Murillo regime is shamelessly flouting virtually every principle of the OAS and Democratic Charters \u2013 arbitrarily locking up its political opponents, brutally cracking down on protestors, committing flagrant election fraud, attacking and imprisoning journalists and human rights defenders.\nThe Cuban regime continues to imprison hundreds of people unjustly detained in the July 11th, 2021 protests for the supposed crime of coming out into the streets to peacefully call on their government to meet their basic needs, and for demanding human rights.\u00a0 Some of those incarcerated are minors; others were sentenced to decades in prison just for speaking their minds.\nMeanwhile, in Venezuela, the Maduro regime has repeatedly denied the Venezuelan people\u2019s right to pick their own leaders, caused a humanitarian catastrophe that\u2019s displaced more than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants toward whom Venezuela\u2019s neighbors have shown extraordinary generosity.\u00a0 All OAS member states should be able to come together to support a negotiated solution that leads to free and fair elections in Venezuela in 2024.\nWe can further reaffirm our commitment to the OAS and Democratic Charters by defending their principles around the world, as our member states did when the OAS became one of the first multilateral bodies to condemn President Putin\u2019s brutal war on Ukraine and then subsequently suspended Russia\u2019s membership as a Permanent OAS Observer.\nIt\u2019s crucial that we stay united by condemning Russia\u2019s sham referenda as a violation of international law, and unequivocally rejecting any attempts to illegally annex Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 And I think the statement that member states signed on to today led by Guatemala demonstrates that.\u00a0 And we hope that countries will similarly support the UN General Assembly resolution that is expected to come up in the next week or so.\nWe can help our fellow democracies that are struggling most to meet their citizens\u2019 basic needs.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we co-sponsored the resolution before this General Assembly on Haiti, which supports solutions driven by Haiti\u2019s government, political parties, civil society, diaspora, and private sector to address the country\u2019s deteriorating security situation, to restore its democratic institutions, to foster conditions so the Haitian people can finally realize their full potential.\nFinally, we can speak up when democratically\u2011elected leaders in our region borrow from the playbook of autocrats to try to stay in power and erode checks and balances, like passing legislation that grants the government overly broad powers to crack down on the media and civil society, extending term limits; harassing, persecuting, or firing independent government officials like prosecutors and judges for doing their job.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing more leaders taking these anti\u2011democratic steps \u2013 often under the false justification that they enjoy popular support.\nWe will work to bring more partners into this effort: civil society organizations, the private sector, youth groups, and other parts of our governments, which is why the United States is pleased new text \u2013 is pleased to present, excuse me, new text, for this assembly calling for more robust inter\u2011parliamentary engagement on issues of common concern.\nBut I want to be very clear that this is not about picking sides between left and right or between liberal and conservative.\u00a0 It\u2019s about putting our shared commitment to democracy above loyalty to ideology or to party.\u00a0 It\u2019s about defending the rights and aspirations of people across our hemisphere.\u00a0 It\u2019s about standing up and giving meaning to the words that we all signed on to in the charters and indeed in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nUltimately, I\u2019m confident that we will be able to meet this moment because while citizens may not be satisfied with the way their democracies are working, most still think it\u2019s the best way to tackle the everyday problems they face and actually improve their lives in tangible ways.\nCitizens still believe.\u00a0 And if they believe and are willing to engage to be our partners across this hemisphere in improving democracies from within, then there is no challenge that we cannot overcome if we do it together.\u00a0 That\u2019s the spirit that the United States brings to our common enterprise and to this hemisphere that we share.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Lima Convention Center", "location": "Lima, Peru", "date": "October 6, 2022", "content": "\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDA: (Via interpreter) Good morning, everyone. Mr. Secretary of State of the United States of America Antony Blinken, ladies and gentlemen, ministers of foreign affairs, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Peruvian Government, I would like to warmly welcome you to this meeting called by the U.S. to follow up on the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.\nOur countries are \u2013 currently send, receive migrants. We are centers of transit for migrants. There are multidirectional migrant flows that lead to complex situations, and we firmly believe that we must work on these in a welcoming way, integrating migrants into our societies. Migration has been especially relevant in the Americas, and it has been a part of our migration policies throughout time. Migrants then have adapted or have provided to the development in our countries and contributed to cultures and identities.\nToday, migrant flows present interesting challenges, and we must continue to observe our principles, seeing migrants as people who are entitled to rights. That is why we are here in order to talk and develop joint solutions as actors in different areas of migration, because our goal is to create a migration agenda that is common for the Americas for our times. Our countries then have been managing migration at the domestic level as well as via international mechanisms in order to satisfy the needs of migrants. They have diverse circumstances and, therefore, may be more vulnerable in different stages of mobility. That is why our national offices and international agencies must defend the human rights of migrants, must promote their social and economic integration, and provide for regularization. Working with migrants, asylum systems for refugees, must be dealt with in order to combat human trafficking as well as the illegal trafficking of migrants, discrimination, and xenophobia.\nLadies and gentlemen, our response has been broad and generous, and in many cases our capacity to receive migrants has been overcome. Therefore, we require international cooperation. The challenges of migration have led to national responses that have opened roads for proper management of migration. Peru\u2019s work in migration has worked specifically at the Interagency Working Group for Migration Management, the goal of which is to share knowledge on migration, expertise, good practices, and initiatives regarding the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Humane Migration.\nThe work of this working group has been included in the UN documents on good practices, and it is considered an efficient platform to work together, coordinate among agencies in a multidimensional fashion in Peru. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to continue to strengthen our joint work in different spaces so that we provide a comprehensive, hemispheric solution to the phenomenon of migration.\nFinally, I would like to highlight what is stated in the L.A. Declaration \u2013 the fundamental work that we continue to do in the regional framework for protection and finding solutions, the Regional Conference on Migration and the South American Conference on Migration are key actors that may facilitate the implementation of this declaration.\nFinally, the Los Angeles Declaration proposes a plan to manage different areas and proposes 11 working groups based on four pillars of the declaration: stability and assistance; legal pathways protection; humane management of migration; and a coordinated approach in emergency cases.\nLadies and gentlemen, I trust that this meeting will be productive and will benefit our migrants. Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR: We will hear now from the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, thank you very much. And Foreign Minister Landa, C\u00e9sar, thank you for the remarkable hospitality that Peru is showing all of us here. Thank you also for your remarkable generosity in hosting more than 1.2 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants \u2013 relevant to what we\u2019re about to discuss.\nIn June, our countries met at the Summit of the Americas to adopt the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. The declaration, now endorsed by 21 countries, affirms our shared interest in handling this challenge in a way that enhances stability, increases opportunities for safe and orderly migration, while holding criminals and human traffickers accountable.\nIndeed, countries have already taken important steps on their own to deliver on the commitment that we made in Los Angeles.\nBelize launched a program in August to help register asylum seekers, refugees, and other vulnerable migrants who\u2019ve been living without official documentation. More than 5,000 migrants have already applied for the program with more expected in the coming days.\nEcuador opened a registration process in September for Venezuelan migrants to apply for legal protection. In the first month alone, more than 100,000 registered for the program. In total, more than 500,000 Venezuelan migrants are expected to apply and ultimately receive legal status in Ecuador.\nAnd Colombia, which in 2021 launched a historic initiative offering 10-year Temporary Protective Status to the more than 2.4 million Venezuelans living in the country, continued to implement its program with remarkable efficiency. More than 1.4 million Venezuelans have received already TPS cards which grant them access to public services and allow them to build new lives.\nThe United States is pleased to help support nine Migrant Integration Centers in cities across Colombia, where migrants can receive TPS cards and also get connected to services like job training, school, health care.\nJust this Tuesday, I had the opportunity to visit one of these centers in Bogot\u00e1, where I met a family of three \u2013 a mother, a father, and their nine-month-old son who fled Venezuela six months ago. Thanks to Colombia\u2019s generosity, the son can now attend publicly provided daycare and his parents were able to get loans, training, and equipment to start a small business. The father has now started his own business making blue jeans while the mother runs her own bakery. Their enterprises benefit everyone, from the workers that they employ, to the customers who buy their goods, to the community that benefits from extra economic activity.\nIntegrating migrants through efforts like these will not only improve their lives but also strengthen the communities they live in. It will make it easier for them to work, to pick up new skills, to start a small business, through which they\u2019ll pay taxes and spur local commerce \u2013 all activities that drive economic growth. And these efforts will contribute to the richness of their host countries, which will benefit from their many cultural and social contributions as well.\nIn addition to teaming up with many of the countries here today, the United States has also taken steps on our own to deliver on the Los Angeles Declaration. Earlier this summer, we resumed the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, which creates a more efficient pathway for Cubans in the United States to apply for reunification with their loved ones. The United States also launched a new system to make it easier and faster to process asylum claims. Once fully implemented, most asylum cases will be resolved in months \u2013 not years, as is the current norm.\nWe continue to rebuild and revitalize our Refugee Resettlement Program. This year we\u2019re on track to resettle the most refugees from the Western Hemisphere since 2015.\nAnd we have expanded legal labor pathways. This fiscal year, the United States nearly doubled the number of Temporary Worker Visas to northern Central American nationals, from approximately 9,800 to more than 19,000, to help U.S. employers meet the demand for seasonal workers at a time of serious labor shortage. These visas come with significant protections and offer a safe, lawful way for temporary workers to work in jobs that are not filled by Americans.\nToday, we are announcing two additional steps that we\u2019re taking to support our shared work on migration. First, the United States is providing more than $240 million in new humanitarian and bilateral and regional assistance to help meet the needs of refugees and migrants throughout our hemisphere, including through providing health services, shelter, education, and legal assistance. The support will help host communities better integrate migrant populations, including by funding programs that support migrants in applying for official status. And it will provide international law enforcement and border security assistance to help partner governments find criminals and human traffickers who prey on vulnerable people.\nSecond, in keeping with the Los Angeles Declaration, we\u2019re launching a collective implementation process so that we can turn our shared commitments into reality. Last week, we hosted many colleagues at the White House to kick off our work along several crucial lines of effort, from finding ways to better integrate migrants and support host communities, to combating xenophobia, to countering human trafficking and smuggling.\nMost countries agreed to either lead or contribute to this work, and I encourage those countries that have not yet joined a line of effort to consider doing so today.\nIn our meeting today and in the months ahead, we\u2019ll need to continue to drive progress across our commitments under the declaration throughout the region. This includes continuing to work together to address the root causes of migration, including a lack of economic opportunity, chronic insecurity, climate change, endemic corruption, which \u2013 if unaddressed \u2013 will only deepen the migration challenge that we face.\nWe need to tap into the breadth of experience of every country around this table, some of which have been at the forefront of providing humane protection to migrants for decades. We\u2019ll also need to call upon the depth of expertise of city officials, civil society leaders, businesses, humanitarian workers, who are on the front lines of supporting migrants and host communities.\nUltimately, that is how we will make real, lasting progress toward a regional approach that respects the dignity of each migrant as well supporting the host communities in countries that host them. We know \u2013 all of us \u2013 that we are facing what is genuinely a historic challenge. We have more people on the move around the world displaced from their homes than at any time in record history, more than 100 million, and our own hemisphere is experiencing that in deep, profound, and new ways.\nLos Angeles represents a recognition, an understanding, that this is a shared responsibility. Not one of us can meet this challenge alone, but we can \u2013 we can \u2013 if we work together. That\u2019s the spirit of Los Angeles. That\u2019s the spirit that we\u2019re continuing today, and we very much look forward to hearing ideas on how we can do that and do it effectively. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-organization-of-the-american-states-secretary-general-luis-almagro-at-the-ministerial-meeting-of-the-summit-implementation-review-group-sirg/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Lima Convention Center", "location": "Lima, Peru", "date": "October 6, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to see so many colleagues here this morning.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone, for attending.\u00a0 And Secretary General, wonderful to be with you.\u00a0 We have a very busy day ahead, but I\u2019m very grateful that everyone has agreed to start with this session this morning.\u00a0 I have a few words to say at the outset before turning it over to the secretary general, and then starting our session.\nSo I want to welcome everyone, first and foremost, to the Summit Implementation Review Group Ministerial.\u00a0 And I\u2019d very much like to thank our vice chair, Foreign Minister Landa for his partnership, and of course Secretary General Almagro for his leadership.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to the representatives here of the Joint Summit Working Group for their efforts to actually turn our commitments into action.\nIn June, we met in Los Angeles for the Ninth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 There we adopted five core commitments to address big challenges facing our people \u2013 challenges that none of our countries can effectively address alone.\u00a0 We arrived at these commitments following months of consultation between our governments, as well as engagement with civil society, with youth leaders, with the private sector.\nFirst, we pledged to strengthen public health systems across the Americas, working alongside partners like civil society representatives, researchers, business leaders.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on expanding access to quality, equitable health services, strengthening systems so that we can address challenges we face today and better detect and prevent future health emergencies.\nSecond, we committed to the first regional agenda for digital transformation \u2013 improving access to the internet and other digital tools, especially for historically marginalized communities.\u00a0 That includes promoting digital literacy, privacy, and cyber security, and also accelerating the digital transformation of government services and using technology to make government more transparent.\nThird, we committed to accelerate the clean energy transition by cutting emissions and expanding renewable energy.\u00a0 We also pledged to help develop a responsible mining sector and strengthen the regional supply \u2013 mineral supply chains that are vital to powering clean energy technologies.\nFourth, we resolved to invest more in climate resilience, to help our committees adapt to the growing effects of climate change, from climate smart agriculture to sustainable fishing, and to improve disaster preparedness and response.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also help communities recover from droughts, from floods and storms.\nFinally, we endorse the Inter-American Action Plan on Democratic Governance, committing to promote and protect human rights, the rule of law, and greater social inclusion.\u00a0 We agreed to bolster transparent and accountable governance and combat threats to democracy from corruption and disinformation.\nThe point of this morning\u2019s gathering is for us to report on the progress we\u2019ve made toward realizing these five core commitments, to see where we can do more together, and to make actual plans for doing so.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we hold ourselves accountable and actually turn our pledges into action.\nIn a moment, I\u2019ll suggest a calendar and working procedures for the coming year.\u00a0 The calendar sets out a schedule for developing action plans, convening subject matter experts, and reporting on our progress over the next year.\u00a0 The working procedures address logistics and outline the different roles and responsibilities for this group so that we can collaborate efficiently and effectively.\nBut first, let me quickly share some of what the United States has done since we last met.\u00a0 For example, we\u2019re working toward a pledge we made in support of the first commitment \u2013 strengthening health systems in the region.\u00a0 In June, we announced that we\u2019d joined the Pan American Health Organization to train 500,000 public health professionals in the region over the next five years.\u00a0 That will dramatically increase access to health care for millions who don\u2019t have it, and raise the quality of care for those who do.\u00a0 Last week, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, hosted a meeting with his counterparts from across the region to develop an implementation plan so that we can help meet the needs of countries throughout our hemisphere.\nWe\u2019re also making progress toward the third and fourth commitments \u2013 expanding clean energy, and adapting to climate change.\u00a0 In the last few months, we began to implement PACC 2030, the U.S.-Caribbean partnership to address the climate crisis, by teaming up with Caribbean partners and technical experts to create action plans on energy security, climate-smart technology, and global food security.\u00a0 Last month, Vice President Harris met with Carribean leaders in Washington to review our progress.\nAnd we\u2019re working toward our fifth commitment, strengthening democracy, by investing in civil society.\u00a0 So far we\u2019ve provided almost $2 million to REDLAD, the Latin American and Caribbean Network for Democracy, to support civic engagement, including by helping civil society monitor countries\u2019 implementation of their summit commitments.\nEvery one of these efforts is collaborative.\u00a0 Every one is reaching across borders and across sectors.\u00a0 Because the challenges we face are too big for any of our countries, governments, or people to solve alone.\nSo it\u2019s critical that we continue to strengthen and expand these partnerships, and not just with federal governments, but also with mayors, with community leaders, with NGOs, with the private sector, with regional organizations.\nThat\u2019s why the United States is hosting the first ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver next April.\u00a0 We\u2019ll bring together people from across the hemisphere, municipal and community leaders, entrepreneurs and academics, and indigenous and underrepresented groups, and we\u2019ll find ways to build on our summit commitments at the local level to make progress on the issues that matter most in our communities.\nAs we move forward, we\u2019ll also lay the groundwork for the Tenth Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Alvarez has recently informed us of the offer by the Dominican Republic to host that summit.\u00a0 The United States fully supports this offer.\nThese are early days for our common efforts, but we\u2019ve already made concrete progress to implement the ambitious commitments that our leaders agreed to in Los Angeles.\u00a0 Now we just need to keep up the momentum.\nI very much look forward to hearing from colleagues about the areas where we\u2019re making progress today, as well as in our future meetings.\u00a0 And I look forward to discussing where we need to do more to build a strong, stable, prosperous, and resilient hemisphere for all of our people.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Secretary General Almagro.\u00a0 Luis.\nSECRETARY GENERAL ALMAGRO:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) On behalf of the General Secretariat of the OAS and technical secretariat and institutional memory of the summit process, the JSWG offers or welcomes you to this meeting to look at the implementation of the summit as we celebrate the second General Assembly of the OAS.\nMr. Chairman, delegates, colleagues, three months ago we met in Los Angeles on the occasion of the ninth summit, in which we spoke of a host of urgent challenges faced by the hemisphere.\u00a0 And we took actions accordingly \u2013 five different political commitments set by heads of state and government that were adopted.\u00a0 Now, today, on the occasion of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, under the model of together against discrimination and inequality, we thank the U.S. for its leadership in carrying out a \u2013 or heading up a productive dialogue that led to the successful carrying out of the summit.\u00a0 Despite the different perspectives that exist throughout the region, the ninth summit was an opportunity for leaders of the hemisphere to reach a shared commitment.\nIt is key within this context we continue progressing along those guidelines in a constructive way so that citizens of the \u2013 or that citizens of the hemisphere expect the political commitments and mandates adopted give us a framework, of course, to address the most pressing issues in the hemisphere and to adopt of host of public policies.\u00a0 These commitments include the need to strengthen the health care systems, to establish a regional digital transformation agenda, climate change matters, and to address the needs of energy transition, and to protect our ecosystems, and to respond to growing threats to democracy, with special emphasis on the most vulnerable populations that have been historically sidelined.\nGiven its importance for all the countries in the region, we also underscore the initiatives announced by the chair during the ninth summit, such as the LA Declaration on immigration and protection and the alliance or partnership for prosperity of the Americas and the partnership of the U.S. and the Caribbean to 2030 for the climate change response.\nNow, this all calls for political will and decision on the part of each government to work on building a focus that addresses deep social chasms that have only broadened during the pandemic.\u00a0 At the OAS, based on our four pillars \u2013 democracy, human rights, sustainable development, multidimensional security \u2013 it falls to us to foster cooperation between the countries of the hemisphere with special focus on reducing vulnerabilities, capacity building, reducing the latent inequity that marks our hemisphere.\nAnd the five different areas that we\u2019ve negotiated led to action plans that we agreed to for digital transformation, democratic governance.\u00a0 And the OAS has acknowledged (inaudible) wherewithal to do this and to offer support and coordination in the implementation phase.\u00a0 To achieve these goals will call for much determination by the countries and transform their public policies.\u00a0 To this effect, the full cooperation of the international community is very important, especially to bring to bear financial wherewithal for us to do so.\nWe celebrate the reconvening of the Joint Summits Working Group on the ninth summit and to tackle together these challenges that through coordination and collaboration ever strengthen \u2013 first, to contribute to sustainable, resilient, and equitable future.\u00a0 This is an opportunity for us to seek out a greater convergence of our agendas, enabling us to address the multiple needs in the region.\u00a0 As we will see during this general assembly and as we saw at the last summit, the region needs to redouble its efforts to move toward greater inclusion, equity, and more rights.\u00a0 The path ahead should lead to concrete actions by states.\u00a0 And my invitation is for us to continue working towards these goals.\nWe reiterate the summit secretariat\u2019s commitment to undertake the substantive matters that are necessary to this end and to follow through on the implementation of the ninth summit and to continue strengthening participation, coordination of the JSWG and civil society and social actors in the inter-American ministerial processes, as an integral part of this process.\u00a0 I wish for this meeting much success.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary General.\u00a0 I would now ask our colleagues from the media to depart.\u00a0 We\u2019ll give you a moment to do so.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Secretary,\u00a0bienvenido a Confiteria Torres.\u00a0 I am thrilled to introduce you to four, really inspiring and amazing alumni, Chilean alumni of the YLAI program, the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative.\u00a0 I have had the opportunity to spend a couple of minutes with them, learning from them about their projects, their communities, the impact that the program has had on them, and I really cannot wait for you to hear all of the great work that they are doing and the ideas that they have.\u00a0 So, I\u2019d like to invite you to say a few words to kick us off, and then we\u2019ll get started with the conversation.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Thank you, Ambassador.\u00a0 Thank you all for being here.\u00a0 One of the things that most inspires me are the exchange programs that we\u2019ve had, and we\u2019ve built over the years.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve seen these powerful connections that are made between people participating in the programs and my country, and they tend to be lasting connections.\u00a0 And so, I\u2019m hugely trying to find a way to connect with the people who have taken part, to learn about what the experience was like, what you got out of it, but also, critically, what you\u2019re doing now and how your participation in the program may have had some impact on that.\nBut what I was particularly looking forward to today is talking to the four of you because entrepreneurs, which each of you is, are truly engines of growth in both of our countries.\u00a0 And you\u2019re focused on trying to solve problems (inaudible), but you\u2019re also social entrepreneurs, which means that you\u2019re also trying to make a difference in your communities, and that\u2019s a very powerful thing.\u00a0 If we can marry these two things together, it creates opportunity, it creates growth, and it creates positive change, and I know that each of you is doing that in different ways.\u00a0 So, I was particularly anxious to hear, and as the ambassador said, we\u2019re \u2013 so much of this is about learning from you, learning from your experience, learning what\u2019s worked, what hasn\u2019t \u2013 and also, going forward, how our governments can help or maybe get out of the way and not help, as the case may be.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut I think it was striking to me as well because I had a chance to spend some time with President Boric today and other colleagues in the government.\u00a0 And so many of the things that we\u2019re trying to do, both the United States and Chile, when it comes to building more equitable societies, inclusive growth, this is very much also what you\u2019re doing (inaudible).\nSo, I\u2019m much more interested in listening than talking.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s great to have all of you here.\u00a0 Thank you.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0Great.\u00a0 So, Mr. Secretary, I\u2019d like to invite each of the fellows to briefly introduce themselves, share a little bit about the impact that YLAI has had on them and their work.\u00a0 And we will start with Camila Roa.\u00a0\u00a0Por favor.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Meehan, we\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0So, it\u2019s such an honor for all of us to be here with you today and share the meaningful experiences we have with YLAI.\u00a0 My name is Camila Roa.\u00a0 I\u2019m a teacher of English.\u00a0 And I participated in YLAI in 2017, together with Paulina.\u00a0 And I participated with a project that is called\u00a0Desde Fuera del Centro, which is an educational and cultural project that aims to decentralize contemporary music through workshops and concerts in (inaudible) school for children.\nNowadays, I\u2019m the president of Becarius for Impact, which is one of the two alumni associations that we have.\u00a0 And with them, I\u2019m working on a new project that is called\u00a0Wilegeau,\u00a0which means \u201ccreating a future\u201d in Mapudungun.\u00a0 Mapudungun is the native language of Mapuche community, and we are carrying out our project with workshops about Mapuche culture through English so that teenagers can have a greater appreciation for their own culture, like feel proud of their culture, and also learn a language that will allow them to share the culture with anyone in the world, and of course improve the \u2013 our job and career opportunities.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s wonderful.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting too, because English is about connectivity.\u00a0 We have digital connectivity, but we also have personal connectivity.\u00a0 For this moment in our collective history, English is one way we connect, do it\u2019s very powerful that you\u2019re doing that at the same time.\nI\u2019m curious about \u2013 (inaudible).\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Tell us a little bit about how the access to music program works.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Well, we started in a local school.\u00a0 My husband is a composer, and he composes contemporary music, which is a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s non-traditional so it can be difficult to have access to it, because you have to live in a main city where you can have a like, a concert hall, you can \u2013 you need the money to pay for the tickets.\u00a0 So, we realize that it\u2019s something that you can only find here or at universities where they have music programs.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s (inaudible), you see.\u00a0 So, we don\u2019t want that \u2013 I mean, for some people, music is just something they can, like, buy \u2013 like a product. \u00a0But for us, music and art is something that children have the right to have access to.\nSo, we take musicians to schools, and \u2013 and composers \u2013 and they compose music.\u00a0 The first time it was for toy instruments, so it can be closer for kids.\u00a0 I have the pictures here.\u00a0 So, these are the ears of all these students that participated.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Oh, that\u2019s wonderful.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Because one of the soft skills that we taught was listening \u2013 not only music, but each other.\u00a0 It\u2019s so important. So, there we have the composer with the toy instruments.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s wonderful.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0And all the kids.\u00a0 It was wonderful.\u00a0 And we had concerts only for them.\u00a0 They were the audience.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Is this program continuing or \u2014\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Not anymore, sadly.\u00a0 Yes, that\u2019s an issue, continuity.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0Something to discuss, yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Something to take a look at and also \u2013 but also inspiring to me, too, because the way \u2013 there\u2019s more we can do (inaudible) back in the United States to create better access.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0And the Secretary is a huge music lover himself.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, I am.\u00a0 I\u2019m particularly intrigued with that.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0So, thank you, Camila.\nMS ROA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nAMBASSADOR MEEHAN:\u00a0\u00a0And I\u2019d like to thank the Chilean and U.S. press for sharing these stories and look forward to seeing you at any future events.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks everyone.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-chilean-foreign-minister-antonia-urrejola-at-a-joint-press-availability", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

and let me first say what a pleasure it is to be back in Santiago.\u00a0 And to Foreign Minister Urrejola, Antonia, thank you so much for this morning, for the very good conversations that we had.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to President Boric for his time, for the quality of the exchange that we had.\u00a0 And just so thankful for the warm welcome that we\u2019ve received from our friends and partners here in Chile.\nI also want to acknowledge Ambassador Meehan.\u00a0 You have no idea how pleased I am to be able to say \u201cAmbassador\u201d Meehan.\u00a0 But it is really thrilling to see you here in this new role.\u00a0 And as the president knows, as the foreign minister knows, there is no stronger partner than Ambassador Meehan.\nWe have a relationship that has been bound together fundamentally by shared interests and shared values, and next year, indeed, we\u2019ll celebrate 200 years of partnership.\u00a0 That partnership spans things that matter most to our people \u2013 from economic and security issues, where we have longstanding ties, to new areas of cooperation on climate, on energy, on health, even outer space.\nAnd as I said, this relationship is based first and foremost on deeply shared values \u2013 a commitment to standing up for democracy and humans rights in our own countries, in this region, and indeed around the world.\nWe see the strength and vibrancy of Chile\u2019s democracy in the peaceful, inclusive process the country\u2019s engaged in, with regard to charting a new constitution.\u00a0 We see it in Chile\u2019s leadership in regional organizations dedicated to promoting democracy and advancing human rights, such as co-chairing the OAS working group on Nicaragua and the recent presidency of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\u00a0 We see it in the position that this government has taken on holding countries \u2013 left, right, liberal, conservative \u2013 to the same standards on human rights and democracy.\u00a0 There should be no ideological blocs when it comes to defending the principles that we\u2019ve all agreed to in the UN and its charter, at the OAS, in the Inter-American Democratic Charter.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we call them universal rights, and we have to stand up wherever they\u2019re being threatened.\nWe\u2019re also grateful for Chile\u2019s clear voice in regional and multilateral organizations like the OAS, where we\u2019ll be going tomorrow, and the United Nations, where \u2013 among other things \u2013 it has consistently condemned Russia\u2019s unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine.\nWe\u2019re growing our economic ties.\u00a0 Since Chile and the United States signed our Free Trade Agreement in 2003, trade between our countries has more than quadrupled, reaching more than $38 billion last year, supporting tens of thousands of jobs in both of our countries.\u00a0 The United States is Chile\u2019s top source of foreign direct investment, investing more than $25 billion in high growth areas, like Chile\u2019s renewable energy sector.\u00a0 And we intend to build on those ties, something we talked about today.\nJust to cite an example, the United States has invested $760 million and provided technical assistance across five solar power projects in Chile, several of which are already powering homes and business across the country.\u00a0 Chile\u2019s renewable energy sector already provides 45 percent of the country\u2019s electricity supply and is helping further Chile\u2019s ambitious clean energy goals, including carbon neutrality by 2050 \u2013 something else that we talked about today especially as we head to COP 27 together, in a little over a month\u2019s time.\nAlthough Chile\u2019s economy has grown over the years, so, too has inequity \u2013 here in Chile, but also more broadly across our own hemisphere.\u00a0 That was worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, rising energy and food costs, which has been exacerbated again by the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\nBut what we see across the board \u2013 in all of these areas, is that those hardest hit are ones who can least afford it.\u00a0 Under President Biden, the United States has committed to partnering with Chile and other countries in the region to deliver solutions to the challenges that are directly impacting the lives of our people.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fundamental part of demonstrating that democracies like ours can deliver concrete results for our people: address their needs and advance their aspirations.\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons that we launched the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.\u00a0 We did this at the Summit of the Americas a few months ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s focused on laying the foundation for economic growth from the bottom up and the middle out by expanding digital connectivity, making our supply chains more resilient, including here in the hemisphere; creating clean energy jobs as we decarbonize; and getting regional economic institutions to mobilize more investment and credit, including in middle-income countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking forward to working with Chile on this initiative.\nWe\u2019re also expanding support for those across the region who don\u2019t have access to essential services like health, like education.\u00a0 That\u2019s the idea behind our commitment to work with partners to train and equip 500,000 local health care workers, across the hemisphere, in five years.\u00a0 This initiative, if fully realized, will make a profound practical difference in the lives of millions of people across our hemisphere.\nWe discussed, as well, our growing collaboration on migration, and I expressed my appreciation for Chile\u2019s leadership on this issue, including by hosting roughly half a million Venezuelan migrants and refugees and 180,000 Haitians.\nAt the Summit of the Americas in June, Chile joined 21 other countries in the hemisphere in supporting the Los Angeles Declaration.\u00a0 This declaration is an important moment because it recognizes our shared responsibility in meeting the migration challenge; and goes about it in a way that increases stability, creates opportunities for safe and orderly migration, and supports communities that host migrants, while holding criminals and human traffickers accountable.\nBut for all the ties between our nations that we discussed today \u2013 and we covered many of them, and indeed we probably ran out of time; we could have discussed another dozen topics.\u00a0 For all of the ties that we talked about today, perhaps none are as deep as the ties between our people.\nA little bit later today, I\u2019ll meet with alumni of the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative.\u00a0 That\u2019s an exchange program that has brought together over a thousand young entrepreneurs and business and social leaders across our hemisphere.\nUltimately, it\u2019s ties like these, especially ties that bind the rising generation of Chileans and Americans that give me the most hope for the future of our relationship and our democracies.\u00a0 And they\u2019re yet another reason we\u2019re committed to continuing to strengthen the partnership between our governments.\nSo again, Antonia, Foreign Minister, thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to be here today with all of you.\nThank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Via interpreter) First question \u2013 Michael Crowley, New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, Madam Foreign Minister.\u00a0 I was not expecting to go first, so I apologize my questions are not focused as much on the region as some that will follow, but thank you for your understanding.\nSecretary Blinken, as you must know, OPEC has just agreed to an oil production cut of 2 million barrels a day.\u00a0 You joined President Biden on what was a somewhat controversial trip to Saudi Arabia recently that the President justified in part on the grounds of working with the Saudis to control oil costs.\u00a0 What is your reaction to this decision, and are you specifically disappointed in the Saudis?\nAlso, Russia has set an October 25th appeal hearing for Brittney Griner.\u00a0 Could this change the status of negotiations over Griner and Paul Whelan?\nAnd Madam Minister, President Biden\u2019s policy towards Venezuela has essentially left unchanged Trump administration policies toward the Maduro regime, including very severe economic sanctions.\u00a0 Do you think this is the correct approach for the United States to Venezuela?\u00a0 Thank you both.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Michael, thank you very much.\u00a0 With regard to energy, first, what we\u2019ve been clear about is the need for energy supply to meet demand.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working on across the board, and we\u2019ve done our part.\u00a0 United States oil production is up by more than 500,000 barrels a day.\u00a0 As you know, we have tapped into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as well to make sure that energy is on the market and, also, as a way to stabilize prices. Indeed, energy prices have come down as a result of the efforts that we\u2019ve made.\nAnd when it comes to OPEC, we\u2019ve made clear our views to OPEC members.\u00a0 We have a multiplicity of interests with regard to Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 And I think the President laid those out during his trip, and they include everything from regional relationships, including improving relations between Arab countries and Israel; Yemen, where we\u2019re working very closely with Saudi Arabia to try to continue the truce; and a number of other issues, and those were all reflected in the visit.\u00a0 But we are working every single day to make sure to the best of our ability that, again, energy supply from wherever is actually meeting demand in order to ensure that energy is on the market and that prices are kept low.\nWhen it comes to Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, I can\u2019t speculate on what various court dates may or may not mean.\u00a0 What I can tell you is this:\u00a0 This has my full attention.\u00a0 And as I said before, number one on my list of priorities, around the world, is doing everything we can to bring home any American anywhere who\u2019s being arbitrarily or unjustly detained.\u00a0 And that certainly applies in the case of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\u00a0 We, as you know, have been having an ongoing discussion with Russian authorities about this.\u00a0 We put a substantial proposal on the table some months ago, and we urge Moscow to accept that proposal so that we can resolve at least this issue.\u00a0 But our imperative is securing their release. \u00a0And I don\u2019t want to weigh in on the particulars of where we are.\u00a0 All I can tell you is we\u2019re focused on it every single day.\nFOREIGN MINISTER URREJOLA:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll answer in Spanish if you\u2019re okay with that.\n(Via interpreter) When it comes to Venezuela, this was an issue we discussed with Secretary Blinken at our meeting.\u00a0 Our position is that we hope that the initial contact group, which is in Mexico \u2013 we hope that dialogue will start up again with Maduro\u2019s government as well as with the Venezuelan opposition, what we want as a country.\u00a0\u00a0 And we are, again \u2013 agreement with the U.S. and other countries in the region, as well as other European countries, that dialogue should start up again so that in Venezuela in 2024, there may be free democratic elections.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) And then for the Chilean press, Francisco Valenzuela, Channel 13.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good morning, Secretary of State, Madam Minister.\u00a0 For both of you, I would like to thank you both for being here because there were some issues that were discussed during the \u2013 your initial introduction, your remarks, so thanks again for your understanding.\nI would like you to talk in greater detail about the meeting that Secretary Blinken had with President Boric.\u00a0 What issues did you discuss?\u00a0 Did you talk about the U.S. vote for Chile as far as its candidacy for the Human Rights Council, and Chile\u2019s role?\u00a0 As you were mentioning, you talked about negotiations over Venezuela and what the U.S. vision is when it comes to leftist governments whose governments have been historically critical of the U.S., and the relationship that your country has, Secretary Blinken, with Latin America.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to put any words in President Boric\u2019s mouth.\u00a0 That would not be appropriate.\u00a0 But let me just say generally two things.\u00a0 I think the foreign minister covered most of the issues that we discussed, but we also had a conversation about our shared approach and shared priorities that are reflected in what President Biden is working to do at home in the United States, as well as more broadly, and that I believe President Boric is working to do here in Chile.\nAnd that goes to building more equitable and inclusive economies. \u00a0It goes to dealing with the issues that are front and center in the lives of our people, whether it is \u2013 whether it\u2019s security or whether it\u2019s combating the effects of climate change, dealing with health issues, including COVID, and working in ways that meet the needs and aspirations of our people.\u00a0 And I think we agreed that there\u2019s tremendous commonality in the goals that we share and, indeed, many of the approaches that we\u2019re bringing to bear.\nWhen it comes to these questions of left, right, and center, here\u2019s what I think is important:\u00a0 The political context in each country is different throughout our hemisphere, but there is a collective task to see that, as we were saying, our democracies actually deliver for our people, that we produce concrete results.\u00a0 And my own sense is that what motivates electorates in all of our countries is the desire to see their governments actually address their concerns, and produce concrete results.\u00a0 And if governments don\u2019t, then chances are they\u2019ll be voted out, someone else will be voted in.\nWe have a \u2013 I think a shared responsibility, but also an opportunity, working closely together, to do exactly that, to deliver results for our people.\u00a0 And one of the things that I shared with President Boric \u2013 something that I think he and President Biden had also talked about when they met at the Summit of the Americas \u2013 is the conviction of the United States that for virtually all of the challenges that our people face, we simply cannot be effective in addressing them alone.\u00a0 We need partnerships. \u00a0We need cooperation.\u00a0 We need collaboration.\u00a0 And that starts with the closest of our partners like Chile.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way we see the world.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way we\u2019re trying to make progress for our own people, but also for people throughout the hemisphere, and I think that\u2019s something that was very much reflected in the conversation that I was very, very pleased and appreciative of having with President Boric today.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Human Rights Council?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That did not \u2013 it did not come up.\nFOREIGN MINISTER URREJOLA:\u00a0 No.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Leon Bruneau from Agence France-Presse.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hola.\u00a0 Thanks for having this press conference.\u00a0 I wanted to ask the question \u2013 well, to both of you, actually, but on this \u2013 as I understand it, Chile has a special exemption on visas, the U.S. Visa Waiver; and I think Chile is the only country in South America that has that, and that seems to be in jeopardy from what I understand, or is fragile.\u00a0 And so, I\u2019d like to ask\u00a0la ministra\u00a0if this was discussed and if you have given to the United States and Secretary any guarantees on that.\nAnd Mr. Secretary, so following up on that, I wonder if that is a concern of yours and that you may cancel this exemption visa \u2013 of U.S. Visa Waiver Program.\u00a0 And then I\u2019d like to ask a more general question.\u00a0 You mentioned a lot \u2013 ideological blocks and what have you, but meeting in Colombia, in Chile, on Cuba specifically.\u00a0 Constantly, the U.S. has been told that you have to change your policy and what have you.\u00a0 Are you listening to the leaders in Latin America that are telling you the policy right now is not going anywhere?\nAnd if I may \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s the news of the day \u2013 ask you a question on North Korea.\u00a0 Obviously, the \u2013 North Korea fired a IRBM missile; it went over Japan.\u00a0 The U.S. and South Korea responded by firing missiles during an exercise, a joint exercise.\u00a0 Do you think that\u2019s escalating or it has a risk of escalating the process against North Korea?\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER URREJOLA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) When it comes to the Visa Waiver Program, we did not discuss this issue, during my meeting with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 When it comes to that topic, I\u2019d like to say that there is a plan that has been agreed upon with the U.S. to assess Visa Waiver Programs.\u00a0 This is something that the U.S. does on an ongoing basis, not just with Chile but with other countries with whom it has this program.\u00a0 We\u2019re working in a very coordinated fashion.\u00a0 Actually, the consular team has been in the U.S. talking to Homeland Security to talk about related issues.\u00a0 We\u2019re on the right path, but I\u2019d like to say again that the assessment of the Visa Waiver Program is not something done only for Chile, but it\u2019s done for all countries that have visa waivers.\u00a0 It\u2019s very well on its way, and we didn\u2019t talk about it when we met, but \u2013 because this is under the purview of Homeland Security and there\u2019s a team in the U.S. talking about this issue right now.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 The minister is exactly right, and we\u2019re working very closely together on this.\u00a0 Chile is the only country in Latin America that is part of the Visa Waiver Program; and we very much want to sustain that, and our teams are working to do that and I\u2019m confident that we will succeed in doing that.\nOn the other questions related to the hemisphere, look, one of the things I emphasize and want to make clear \u2013 and this is something that, again, without ascribing views to President Boric, this is also my understanding from listening so carefully to him over these months.\u00a0 We do not judge countries based on their political orientation, again, whether it\u2019s left, right, center, but simply put, on their commitment to democracy, to human rights, to other shared values.\u00a0 And it\u2019s important for us in working with countries around the world to uphold those basic values and those basic principles, again irrespective of where a country or a government may fall on the political spectrum; and, for that matter, irrespective of our actual relationship with them.\nNow we may approach this question differently depending on an individual country, but the basic principle is the same.\u00a0 And when it comes to Cuba, I think you know the longstanding views of the United States, including this administration.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken steps recently, including on remittances, on travel, on visas, to try to further help the Cuban people and empower them.\u00a0 At the same time, we saw as, again, the Cuban people tried to speak up for their rights a year ago, that these protests \u2013 peaceful protests \u2013 were not only violently put down, but people were thrown in jail, including minors, with usually excessive prison terms\u00a0\u2013 15, 20, 30 years \u2013 just for speaking their minds.\nAnd so, we have to hold the Cuban Government to account, just as we would any other government, for denying the Cuban people those rights.\u00a0 Again, we may have different approaches on the best way to do that. \u00a0And that\u2019s a very important conversation that we\u2019re always having because we all make our judgments, and certainly no one\u2019s infallible when it comes to that, including us.\u00a0 And we try to\u00a0\u2013 we listen hard and learn from our partners and friends, but the underlying principle is the same.\nShifting gears as you did to North Korea, to the Korean Peninsula, because you\u2019ve heard very clearly from us over the last 24 hours, we strongly condemn the DPRK\u2019s dangerous and reckless launch of a long-range missile that flew over Northern Japan, endangering Japanese citizens.\u00a0 I spoke almost immediately to my Japanese and Korean counterparts; and I think you\u2019ve seen that we are working very closely together, both on a bilateral basis but also on a trilateral basis\u00a0\u2013 the United States, Korea, and Japan\u00a0\u2013 to demonstrate and strengthen our defensive and deterrent capabilities in light of the threat from North Korea.\nWe\u2019ve called on the DPRK to refrain from further provocations and engage in a sustained and substantive dialogue.\u00a0 This is something that we have proposed going back many months.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the DPRK\u2019s response has been to launch more missiles.\u00a0 But we are taking appropriate defense and deterrent steps with allies and partners.\u00a0 We\u2019ve called for a UN Security Council meeting, and we\u2019re consulting with our partners on next steps.\nBut I also want to make very clear that our commitment to the defense of our allies and partners, Korea and Japan, is ironclad.\u00a0 We believe that North Korea would be much better served by not only refraining from these actions but actually engaging in dialogue.\u00a0 I think what we\u2019re seeing is that if they continue down this road, it will only increase the condemnation, increase the isolation, increase the steps that are taken in response to their actions.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Last question from a Chilean agency, Francisco Valenzuela.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (In Spanish.) Can you hear me, Secretary?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I can hear you.\u00a0 I\u2019m just not hearing the translation.\nSTAFF:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, the interpreter is waiting to receive audio.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I might be a little bit rusty, but I can try to do it like this.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Our second question is pertaining to investment.\u00a0 How does your country observe the constitutional process going on here in Chile, and if in your judgment does it get\u00a0\u2013 does it give some certainty for the American presence in business in our country under role of Chile and\u00a0\u2013 are you hearing me?\u00a0 Okay. Good.\u00a0 Now I will switch back to Spanish because some words I just can\u2019t translate.\n(Via interpreter) The role of Chile\u00a0\u2013 you can ask me if you need me to repeat the question, Mr.\u00a0Secretary, or I can continue\u00a0\u2013 the role of Chile in multilateral treaties such as with the European Union or the treaty for the transpacific association known as TPP-11 and Chile were not members but\u00a0\u2013 not as members but observers.\u00a0 How do you see Chile in multilateral treaties at the global level?\nAnd I will repeat the first part:\u00a0 If \u2013 how do you see investment when it comes to the constitutional process in Chile, as well as lithium in the energy sector?\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 And I appreciate the switching to English.\u00a0 I apologize that my Spanish is not good enough to do this in Spanish; I wish it were.\u00a0 But thank you.\nFirst, I\u2019m not going to say anything about the substance of the constitutional process.\u00a0 We admire in fact the process itself and the way that Chileans are engaging this in a peaceful and constructive manner.\u00a0 But as to the\u00a0substance, this is obviously up to the Chilean people.\u00a0 It\u2019s not an issue for the United States, but here\u2019s what I can say.\nFirst, as I noted earlier, we\u2019ve already seen over the last couple of decades, since our free trade agreement was signed, a substantial increase in trade between us.\u00a0 It\u2019s now about 32, almost 33\u00a0billion dollars a year.\u00a0 And the United States is the leading supplier of foreign direct investment in Chile.\u00a0 So, the relationship is already strong, both on the trade side and on the investment side.\nBut we are convinced that it can grow stronger still and that our two countries are natural partners when it comes to this, and our hemisphere should be even more of natural partners together.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019ll see this play out in a number of ways that we discussed today and that I alluded to.\nFirst, through the partnership that we put forward at the Summit of the Americas for prosperity in the hemisphere, there are a number of areas where, working together, we can I think significantly increase trade and investment, including in Chile.\u00a0 For example, the partnership that we\u2019re designing together focuses on things like building strong supply chains in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 We all saw what happened when we had challenges with our supply chains during COVID.\u00a0 We need to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again.\u00a0 But there\u2019s also tremendous opportunity there for business, for investment.\nSimilarly, because of Chile\u2019s leadership on climate, we see a future together where we\u2019re working together and investing together, including here in Chile, on clean technology and on green economy jobs.\u00a0 These are the jobs of the future, and Chile is very, very well placed, I think, to produce many of those jobs.\u00a0 And we talked about that today, and I think we\u2019re looking at ways to generate more American investment.\u00a0 We\u2019re already done a lot on solar, as we\u2019ve discussed.\u00a0 But there\u2019s a lot more to be done.\nAt the same time, re-energizing and refocusing the international financial institutions, including the multilateral development banks here in our own hemisphere, in ways that actually address the needs of people and put investment and put loans and put money into projects that will actually make a difference in their lives \u2013 that, too, is something that we\u2019re focused on together and that I think can create even more opportunity here in Chile.\nSo, I think across the board we have a strong foundation, but there is much more that we can do.\u00a0 And we bring to it the same perspective, which is the need to do it in a way that is inclusive and that really tries to create growth for everyone \u2013 not just some, but for everyone.\u00a0 That\u2019s a shared focus of both of our governments and it animates what we\u2019re going to be doing together in the years ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER URREJOLA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) On the first issue, I\u2019d like to go back to the last thing that Secretary Blinken said about how we are working with the United States on different topics related to investment, but especially from the perspective of the fight against climate change and the importance of renewable energy.\u00a0 This is something on our agenda with the United States, as well as with European countries and other countries \u2013 at the global level, at the UN.\u00a0 This is a consistent issue.\u00a0 The president\u2019s bilateral agenda, I\u2019ve discussed it with many foreign ministers.\u00a0 There is an interest in many countries in investing in renewable energy, and as Secretary Blinken said, supply chains, lithium, are important topics for us as well.\u00a0 We share the viewpoint that we must review and refocus the work on multilateral banks.\nI would also like to remind you of the president\u2019s visit to Canada when he met with the minister of the economy, Canadian businesses, and they talked specifically about Canadian investments.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very important partner for Chile.\u00a0 And as you mentioned, I believe, there was a very important conversation in that regard, and we\u2019re working hand-in-hand with Canadian companies.\u00a0 Same thing with the United States in the framework of the Summit of the Americas.\u00a0 The minister and the president met with U.S. businesses as well.\u00a0 The same thing happened at the UN with Mario Marcel, the Council of the Americas.\nSo, we are working very closely with different businesses.\u00a0 I was in Spain, met with Spanish businesses.\u00a0 There\u2019s an open agenda when it comes to investment.\u00a0 I think that we are well on the right path.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to say, as well, that we have negotiating teams, this\u00a0\u2013 looking at the modernization agreement with the EU this week.\u00a0 As the president has said, the idea is to be able to bring those to a close by the end of the year.\u00a0 We\u2019re on the right path.\u00a0 And so, everything I\u2019m saying, as well as what Secretary Blinken has said, shows that we are working very strongly on these issues.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) We would like to thank you for coming to this press conference.\u00a0 We request that the national press allow our U.S. colleagues to leave because they must join the Secretary\u2019s delegation.\u00a0 Thanks very much.\n\n"}, {"url":

Well, thank you so much, Madam Mayor.\u00a0 This is the third time that we\u2019ve met.\u00a0 I have such admiration for the mayor\u2019s extraordinary leadership on so many issues.\u00a0 We first met talking about climate and the incredible work that Bogot\u00e1 has done on climate change.\u00a0 We\u2019re here today to talk about migration and the challenges that we face together.\u00a0 And in so many of these areas, COVID as well, the mayor and the city have done extraordinary work.\nIf you step back for a minute \u2013 and we\u2019ve talked about this before \u2013 we are living through a period in the world where we have more people on the move, displaced from their homes, than at any time in recorded history, more than 100 million people around the world.\u00a0 And here in our own hemisphere, in the Americas, we feel this strongly every day.\u00a0 Guatemalans, Hondurans, El Salvadorans, Haitians, Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans \u2013 so many people on the move, and it creates a tremendous challenge for all of us.\u00a0 What\u2019s changing now is that countries are coming together to take shared responsibility for meeting this challenge, and also, we hope, turning it into a real opportunity.\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a place where that\u2019s more the case than here in Colombia, where in I think an example both extraordinary generosity but also farsightedness, Colombia has welcomed now almost 2.5 million Venezuelans and is offering temporary protected status for ten years to people from Venezuela.\u00a0 To date about 1.5 million of the Venezuelans who are here have temporary protected status and that means that they\u2019re able to work, they\u2019re able to send their kids to school, they\u2019re able to be productive, contributing members of the community, of society, and we\u2019re not going to have a lost generation of Venezuelans with their kids not able to go to school and parents not able to go to work and put food on the table.\u00a0 So this is quite remarkable.\nHere in this place, what we saw today is what really could be a model for many other places, where all in one place people coming to their temporary protected status cards, get services, get connected to schools, get connected to jobs, get connected to support, social services, all here in this beautiful place, but it\u2019s part of the municipality of Bogot\u00e1.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a place that works for Colombians and works for Venezuelans, and it \u2013 in fact, it works for the citizens now of Bogot\u00e1.\u00a0 So it\u2019s a remarkable model.\nThe United States has been very honored and proud to help in this process.\u00a0 Throughout the crisis in Venezuela, over many years now, we\u2019ve provided nearly $3 billion in assistance, assistance that\u2019s come here to Colombia as well as to other countries: Ecuador, Peru, and so forth.\u00a0 The President announced an additional $350 million in assistance during the UN General Assembly.\u00a0 And some of \u2013 most of this is done through the U.S. Agency for International Development which does remarkable work on the ground in some many countries.\nAnd we\u2019re doing it in very practical ways.\u00a0 For example, here, we\u2019ve been able to provide financing for Colombian banks to be able to offer loans to small businesses started by Venezuelans.\u00a0 This is something that benefits them, but it powerfully benefits the community as well, because small businesses are drivers of growth, drivers of progress in all of our communities.\u00a0 So that\u2019s just one example of the practical ways that we\u2019re working in partnership.\nBut I have to say, Madam Mayor, this is just incredibly impressive.\u00a0 And I have to say it fills me with more hope that we\u2019re able not only to manage this challenge but to do it in a way that\u2019s beneficial to everyone.\u00a0 So thank you for sharing this today.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS LOPEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 I want to express once again our gratitude on behalf of Bogot\u00e1 but also as Colombia.\u00a0 Thank you so much for the support \u2013 your support and the support of the U.S. Government, to our President Gustavo Petro in our common purpose of (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-colombian-vice-president-francia-marquez-at-a-signing-ceremony-to-support-the-comprehensive-implementation-of-the-ethnic-chapter-of-the-2016-peace-accord/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

tardes.\u00a0 Gracias.\u00a0 Gracias a todos.\u00a0\u00a0I looked for this because I was almost rendered entirely speechless, quite literally.\nTo all of you here, this is a special place, and even in the few minutes that I\u2019ve been here, I can feel that.\u00a0 It\u2019s very, very powerful.\nVice President Marquez, thank you for your leadership and also for your partnership, and I\u2019ll have more to say about that in a few minutes.\nAmbassador Murillo, so many others here from the Colombian Government, from multilateral organizations, from civil society, from other institutions working toward the full implementation of the Peace Accord \u2013 thank you, thank you for your commitment to this effort.\nAnd I very much want to recognize the service of Mr. Wouriyu Valbuena and all of the Afro-Colombian, Indigenous, and other civil society leaders who are here today for their brave and sustained efforts on the part of their communities.\nLet me also acknowledge Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n S\u00e1ez for hosting us in this remarkable museum.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful for that.\nIt\u2019s quite simply moving \u2013 moving to be here and to bear witness to the harrowing consequences of more than 50 years of conflict that are depicted all around us.\u00a0 From the paintings that reflect the agony of forced disappearances for victim\u2019s families, to the floors beneath our feet, crafted from melted guns, hammered into tile with the participation of victims of sexual violence.\nEvery part of this space shows the cost of conflict.\u00a0 Every part makes an urgent case for peace, for justice.\u00a0 And every part also shows profoundly our common humanity, as translated through art, an ability to connect so powerfully one human being to another.\nThe United States has been proud to be a partner to Colombia and its people throughout the peace process.\u00a0 Today, we\u2019re taking another step in support of securing a lasting peace, by becoming the first international accompanier to the Ethnic Chapter of the Peace Accord.\nThe chapter recognizes that there can be no lasting peace without justice and equality for the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous people, who have been disproportionately harmed by this conflict.\nOver five decades, 38 percent of Afro-Colombians, 27 percent of Indigenous people registered as victims of the conflict.\u00a0 By 2017, nearly a million had been forcibly displaced.\u00a0 Countless others suffered atrocities and human rights abuses \u2013 massacres, torture, disappearances, killings, sexual violence.\u00a0 Too often, those crimes went unpunished.\nThese injustices were rooted in centuries of racism \u2013 a living legacy of slavery and colonization.\nMany persist to this day.\u00a0 According to the United Nations, of the more than 400 human rights defenders killed between 2016 and 2020, 16 percent were Indigenous, though Indigenous people make up less than 5 percent of the population.\nAnd as so many of you in this audience know very, very well, Afro-Colombian and Indigenous people continue to experience systemic marginalization and inequality.\u00a0 To give just a few examples, even when they have the same qualifications, Afro-Colombians tend to earn less than their peers.\u00a0 And on average, Indigenous people receive two years less education than other Colombians.\nThe Ethnic Chapter sets out a vision for an inclusive peace that addresses this history of inequity and ensures the rights of Afro-Colombians and Indigenous people going forward.\nIt\u2019s a vision that the United States shares and that we\u2019ve long worked to try to help make a reality.\nSince supporting the negotiation process, we\u2019ve supported Colombia\u2019s efforts to help protect vulnerable communities, dismantle criminal organizations, support investigations and prosecutions of perpetrators of violence and human rights abuses.\u00a0 In all, we\u2019ve contributed more than $1 billion to support Colombian-led efforts to implement the Peace Accord.\nWe\u2019ve also worked to expand opportunities for marginalized communities.\u00a0 The United States Congress \u2013 thanks in large part to the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Chairman Meeks in particular \u2013 has helped provide significant economic development aid for Afro-Colombian and Indigenous people for the last nine years.\nAnd last year, the U.S. Agency for International Development launched a five-year, $60 million program to support economic, political, and social inclusion in Colombia \u2013 the largest program of its kind in the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re partnering with nine Afro-Colombian and Indigenous organizations to create and implement peacebuilding and sustainable development initiatives, with a special focus on empowering women, young people, LGBTQI+ people, people with disabilities, people who are affected by violence.\nWorking toward greater equality will not only strengthen the foundations of peace in Colombia, but also the country\u2019s democracy.\u00a0 Because when every community has equal access to opportunity, to justice, to development, and security, all of society benefits.\nThat\u2019s true in Colombia.\u00a0 It\u2019s also true in the United States, with our own deep history of discrimination, which is still felt in our institutions, policies, and society.\u00a0 That\u2019s why President Biden has made the fight for equity and racial justice a priority for our administration, at home as well as around the world.\nNow, you know better than anyone that this work can be challenging.\u00a0 But our willingness to confront the painful parts of our history \u2013 as well as our present \u2013 and do it out in the open, that is one of democracy\u2019s greatest strengths, and it\u2019s one that the United States and Colombia share.\nThe work that we\u2019re here to support \u2013 like the Ethnic Chapter itself \u2013 is only possible because of incredibly courageous Colombians who have risked everything in the fight for equal rights.\nPeople like the vice president, who has spent her entire life defending Colombia\u2019s underserved communities, their lands, their rights \u2013 \u201clos nadies,\u201d as she says.\u00a0 As a teenager, when the vice president helped protect a river in her community from exploitation; later, when she helped lead a march of women for more than 300 miles to protest illegal mining; and throughout the peace process, when she made sure that the voices of Afro-Colombians and black women were heard.\u00a0 Work she did despite harassment, despite death threats, work she continues to this day, not only as vice president but also as her government\u2019s first minister of equality.\nHer persistence, and that of so many indigenous and Afro-Colombian leaders like her \u2013 including some of you gathered here today \u2013 you\u2019ve brought the nation to this moment, and you will continue to carry it forward.\nAs the vice president said, now is the time \u2013 now is the time \u2013 to work toward peace \u2013 \u201cdecisively, without fear, with love and with joy.\u201d\u00a0 I can think of no more powerful and no more fitting words for this moment.\nAnd I can conclude simply by saying the United States is proud, proud to be your partner in this endeavor.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Gracias a todos.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter)\u00a0Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 Now it is my honor and pleasure to welcome the vice president of Colombia, Francia Marquez, for her remarks.\u00a0 Madam Vice President.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nVICE PRESIDENT MARQUEZ:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Everyone who is here today in this space, I would like to extend my special greetings to Mr. Antony Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States, and of course to your entire team of colleagues who are with you as a part of this special delegation.\u00a0 I would also like to extend my greetings to the representatives of the United Nations for human rights, Juliette de Rivero.\u00a0 Thank you for being here and for always being so willing to stand by our side and our arduous fight to protect life.\nI would like to greet Luis Gilberto Murillo, our ambassador, who has been a part of this historic fight that we have waged as peoples.\u00a0 I would like to extend my greetings to the director of the victims unit, Patricia Yagari, who is here with us.\u00a0 I would like to greet the secretary of the high-level instance for ethnic peoples, Mr. Armando Valbuena.\u00a0 My greetings to all leaders who are here as well, social organizations, members of the media, and my greetings to the community in general.\nThe first thing I have to say is that we are very pleased to receive this visit from the Secretary of State of the United States.\u00a0 We receive you and are happy to do so as a government, as an administration, because accompanying the Ethnic Chapter for peace is to take on the commitment for total peace, complete peace.\u00a0 These floors upon which we have walked are wrinkled; they are made of weapons, weapons that were used to murder and hurt millions of Colombians, but especially Colombians who were Indigenous and Afro descendants,\u00a0raizales\u00a0and\u00a0palenqueros.\u00a0 As the Colombian state recognized and as was recognized by the FARC at the time, there was a disproportionate effect on these people, and that continues to be so in the framework of the armed conflict.\nI can\u2019t be here as a black woman, as a victim, without reaffirming our commitment to peace to tell you, Mr. Secretary, that we have still not silenced every bullet.\u00a0 There are many weapons here that we were able to place here, but there are still many weapons out there, out there murdering, taking life, denying possibilities, hopes and dreams for our people.\u00a0 And I would like to especially talk about youth, about black and Indigenous youth, youth who today do not see any roads that are open to them, who see that the future is murky.\u00a0 They don\u2019t see that it\u2019s possible for them to achieve their dreams.\u00a0 Young people who on the Pacific coast of Colombia are committing suicide because they do not see a road ahead for themselves, young people, children, women who continue to be victims of forced displacement, who are expelled from their land, who are still undergoing a terrible humanitarian crisis.\nAnd this armed conflict is not uncoupled from structural racism.\u00a0 My presence today as vice president is just one step; it is not the end.\u00a0 The end is to find dignity for our people, black people,\u00a0raizal\u00a0and\u00a0palenquero\u00a0people, our Indigenous peoples, for peasant workers, for women, for young people, and for all of Colombia.\u00a0 That is why, as we discussed during our meeting with the president, it is necessary that we solve the drug problem, the drug trafficking problem, the problem of death economies, towards an economy that allows for peace for us all.\u00a0 We must plant happiness, hope, and love on our land, because unfortunately and sadly, our land has been planted with pain, sadness, and blood.\nWith that hope, Gustavo \u2013 President Gustavo Petro came into office, as did I, in order to be a part of the state in order to change those realities.\u00a0 We celebrate the fact, then, that the U.S. Government today is taking on being a partner in this exercise of ensuring rights for the victims of this country, and especially for victims, of ethnic peoples, in order to find a decent life for them and to make strides in seeking total peace.\u00a0 I will repeat: this is a huge stride to the end.\u00a0 This is a demonstration of the fact that we are on the right path, that hope continues to grow, so that we may overcome our fear \u2013 a fear that still takes hold of our people, that still takes hold of our leaders.\nThat is why, then, I would like to thank you on behalf of our national government, on behalf of my people, on behalf of our leaders, on behalf of those who are no longer here because they gave their lives for this moment so that we could reach this place.\u00a0 But we would like to reaffirm our commitment to total peace, to justice, to social justice, to human dignity.\u00a0 We would like to reaffirm our commitment to tackle, in a radical way, structural racism which has not allowed us to be as people and as communities.\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much for being here.\u00a0 I would like to thank the media, and a message of hope, of happiness, of love, and of brotherhood is what I would like to extend to the Government of the United States.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Madam Vice President of the Republic of Colombia, Francia Marquez.\u00a0 And now we will move to this very important moment, a moment that Indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants have waited for for so long and that we have worked on together with the United States Government.\u00a0 We will move to the signing ceremony.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Benjamin Franklin Room", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "September 30, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0\u00a0Bonjour, tout le monde.\nForeign Minister Joly, M\u00e9lanie, as always, I\u2019m delighted to welcome you back to the State Department, to the United States, and it is a great pleasure to continue our ongoing collaboration on so many issues that join our countries together.\nAs is fitting for such a close friend and ally, the discussion we had today touched on an incredibly wide range of critically important issues that are having a real impact on the lives of our citizens, Canadians and Americans alike, as well as people across the globe.\nWe, of course, discussed our united response to President Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, including his latest shameless effort to legitimize his attempted land grab in Ukraine.\u00a0 No one is fooled by what Moscow has done.\u00a0 The world saw the way Russia conducted these so-called referenda, with Russian occupation forces going door to door and forcing Ukrainian citizens to cast their ballots at gunpoint.\u00a0 The entire process around these sham referenda was a complete farce.\nThe United States does not, and will never, recognize any of the Kremlin\u2019s claims to sovereignty over parts of Ukraine that it\u2019s seized by force and now purports to incorporate into Russia.\u00a0 As I said last week at the United Nations Security Council, this territory is and will remain Ukrainian, and Ukraine has every right to defend its land, to defend its people, and to take back the territory that Russia has seized from it.\nCanada and the United States, like so many nations around the world, see eye to eye on this: these are just the latest in a long line of actions by Russia since it launched its war of aggression against Ukraine that violate international law, that flout the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity which underpin the entire international order so necessary to keeping peace and security around the world.\u00a0 And all of this shows the Kremlin\u2019s utter contempt for the rights and the will of the Ukrainian people.\nI also made clear that when Russia made this move, the United States and our allies and partners would impose swift and severe costs on individuals and entities \u2013 inside and outside of Russia \u2013 that provide political or economic support to illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 Today we have done just that, in coordination with the European Union, and Canada is taking similar steps as well.\nWe\u2019re also issuing a clear warning, supported by G7 leaders:\u00a0 We will hold to account any individual, entity, or country that provides political or economic support for President Putin\u2019s illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 In support of this commitment, the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce are releasing new guidance on heightened sanctions and export control risks for entities and individuals inside and outside of Russia that support in any way the Kremlin\u2019s sham referenda, purported annexation, and occupation of parts of Ukraine.\nWe\u2019re also taking action today at the United Nations Security Council to hold Russia accountable for the sham referenda and the purported annexations.\u00a0 If Russia blocks the Security Council from carrying out its responsibilities, we\u2019ll ask the UN General Assembly, where every country has a vote, to make clear that it\u2019s unacceptable to redraw borders by force.\u00a0 Every country has a stake in condemning these steps.\nAs UN Secretary-General Guterres said this week, and I quote, \u201cThe [United Nations] Charter is clear.\u00a0 Any annexation of a State\u2019s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the [United Nations] Charter and international law.\u201d\nThe United States, Canada, and our other allies and partners will continue to assist Ukraine in the fight to defend its territory against Russian aggression.\u00a0 With new security assistance that we announced just this week, the United States has now committed approximately $16.9 billion in security assistance to Ukraine going back to January 2021.\nIn our meeting, the foreign minister and I discussed ways to continue supporting Ukraine and our European allies as they prepare for a difficult winter ahead.\u00a0 Our commitment to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, its independence, its territorial integrity is steadfast.\nThe United States and Canada will also continue to work together at the G7 to help the populations hardest hit by President Putin\u2019s war of choice, including by getting life-saving aid to the people most affected by the unprecedented global food crisis.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to make crystal clear that we and our NATO Allies are prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory.\nThe United States and Canada are also standing together in responding to virtually every major global challenge that is having an effect on our people, just as we have for 150 years.\nCanada is a deeply valued ally and partner across the Arctic region in the Arctic Council, where we\u2019re working together to promote sustainable economic growth while also combating the climate crisis.\u00a0 In the coming weeks the United States will release our Arctic Strategy to further these goals, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with Canada to make them a reality.\nLike the United States, Canada is both an Atlantic and Pacific nation, and we saw that last week at the General Assembly, where Canada joined both the Partners in Blue Pacific and the Strengthening Atlantic Cooperation ministerial meetings that we held.\u00a0 These initiatives will further our shared goals of a prosperous, resilient, and secure ocean region in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.\nWe\u2019re working together to end the HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis epidemics.\u00a0 Here, too, we saw Canada\u2019s leadership on display at the General Assembly, with the prime minister\u2019s exceedingly generous contribution of more than $900 million to the Global Fund in its seventh replenishment.\nCanada, Mexico, and the United States are partners in the USMCA, through which we\u2019re strengthening supply chains, supporting strong labor rights protections, and accelerating the clean energy transition across an increasingly integrated North America.\nSince December, our countries have partnered to mobilize more than $294 million in international commitments for Haiti.\u00a0 We deeply appreciate Canada\u2019s leadership in launching the UN Basket Fund to improve citizen security and strengthen law enforcement in Haiti \u2013 an effort the United States is proud to support.\u00a0 In these extremely difficult times for the Haitian people, we\u2019re urging more partner nations to contribute to this vital cause.\nWe also applaud Canada\u2019s leadership in launching the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention in State-to-State Relations.\u00a0 This is bringing nations together to send the clearest possible message that the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals is unacceptable, and governments that engage in this practice will face consequences.\nWe discussed ways to deepen what is an already remarkably vibrant commercial and trade relationship, to boost our collective competitiveness, to create good-paying jobs for people on both sides of our border.\u00a0 The United States and Canada are of course already each other\u2019s largest trading partners, with over ten \u2013 $2 billion, excuse me, in goods and services that pass between us every single day.\u00a0 But we know we can do even more together, to the benefit of our people.\nOne way to do that is through the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides more than $368 billion for clean energy technologies like electric vehicles and battery components that are manufactured in North America.\u00a0 It\u2019s the biggest, most ambitious climate investment in the history of our country; it offers a chance for us to deepen our economic integration and expand inclusive economic opportunity for our people.\nAnother way is through the CHIPS and Science Act, which will provide funds to develop resilient semiconductor supply chains in North America, which are crucial for so many of the goods that we rely on, from smartphones to dishwashers to cars.\u00a0 Our semiconductor supply chains are already deeply interconnected, with U.S.-based companies like IBM and Skyworks conducting research, development, design, and packaging in Canada.\nIt is hard to think of two countries that work together as closely, and across as many areas, as Canada and the United States.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not only because our fates and interests are so closely intertwined, but it\u2019s because we approach these challenges and opportunities from a place of shared values.\u00a0 More than ever, we are in this together.\nSo, M\u00e9lanie, as always, thank you for the visit \u2013 but, most important, thank you for your partnership, thank you for your friendship on a professional level, on a personal level.\u00a0 We\u2019re the closest of collaborators.\u00a0 It\u2019s something I deeply value and am grateful for every day.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to have you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Tony.\u00a0\u00a0Merci, Tony.\u00a0 It\u2019s really a pleasure for me to be here for my second visit to the State Department.\u00a0 But before we start, I would like also to say a few words as Canadians are observing the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.\n(Via interpreter) On this day, we honor the children who never returned home, the survivors, their families, and their communities.\n(In English) The path of reconciliation is long and painful.\u00a0 It is one we must choose to walk with indigenous people every day.\n(Via interpreter) Dear Tony, as I say every time I come here with you, it\u2019s wonderful to \u2013 I would like to host you in Canada soon, I hope.\n(In English) Canada and the United States, and Secretary Blinken mentioned, share a special, unique relationship.\u00a0 Of course, our two countries are bound by geography and history.\u00a0 We are friends, allies, trading partners because we know we are stronger together when, obviously, we\u2019re standing together.\u00a0 We invest in each other\u2019s successes.\u00a0 We have fought side by side on numerous battlefields because our way of life, our democratic values, were threatened.\nVladimir Putin will stop at nothing to consolidate his power and assert his dominance.\u00a0 The vote to integrate Ukraine\u2019s territories into the Russian Federation is a crude attempt to formalize President Putin\u2019s conquest through political theater.\u00a0 As Canada and NATO Allies have said, the pre-orchestrated outcomes of these referenda have no legitimacy and will never be recognized.\u00a0 Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia will remain Ukrainian territory.\nCanada has imposed sanctions today on 43 new oligarchs, the so-called governing body in Kherson, and 35 Russian-backed officials in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.\n(Via interpreter) So today, Canada will impose new sanctions to 43 oligarchs, to the so-called leaders of Kherson, 35 senior officials of Russia in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.\n(In English) Courageous women across Iran are currently in the streets protesting the tragic killing of Mahsa Amini.\u00a0 Canada salutes them and we want to say to everybody that we stand with them in saying that women\u2019s rights are human rights.\n(Via interpreter) The Iranian regime has a long record of systematic violations of the rights of the population, and they continue to persecute the people.\n(In English) This regime has also shown a blatant disregard for human life with Flight PS752.\u00a0 Canada will sanction the so-called morality police and its leadership, and Canada will hold Iran accountable for its crime.\nAs we fight for human rights, Secretary Blinken and I also discussed our effort to strengthen international peace and security, including through deepened engagement in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We share a vision of a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 We both believe in strengthening our diplomatic and economic ties with the region and the resiliency of our global supply chains.\u00a0 And the Secretary just mentioned about particularly the CHIPS legislation here and the initiative, and obviously we want to make sure that as the United States go forward, we also provide our great expertise and \u2013 in terms of critical minerals, in terms of extraction but also manufacturing.\nCanada is pleased to continue the work as a full member of the partnership of the Blue Pacific.\u00a0 Alongside Secretary Blinken, we were together at the UN General Assembly, on the margins of the UN General Assembly, to talk about this very new initiative.\nNow, several weeks ago, President Biden spoke to Americans at the Independence Hall in Philadelphia, saying that democracy and equality are under assault, and that Americans are in a battle for their soul \u2013 for the soul of their nation.\u00a0 I know these words resonate deeply with Canadians.\u00a0 Canada is not immune to the same threats to our democracy, to rampant disinformation on social media, to feelings of distress towards our institutions.\u00a0 However, our resolve in the face of these challenges has never been stronger.\u00a0 We will remain resolute in our defense of democracy, and we will remain united \u2013 united in our vision for a more free and democratic world, united in our pursuit of a more just and equal society, and united in our determination to preserve our institutions for future generations.\n(Via interpreter) Because by remaining united, there is no limit to what our two nations could accomplish together.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take our first question from Shaun Tandon with the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Hi there.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Hi, Shaun.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you. To begin with, Mr. Secretary, just on behalf of the press corps, condolences on the loss of your father. I wanted to share that with you \u2013 wanted to offer condolences on behalf of the State Department Correspondents Association.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Could I follow up on a couple of items today on Ukraine and Russia?\u00a0 To both of you:\u00a0 President Putin, he mentioned today, he said that the West was to blame for what happened on Nord Stream.\u00a0 I know the United States has already rejected that.\u00a0 Do you have any assessment of what actually happened?\u00a0 Could this be a violation of a \u2013 could this invoke Article 5 for NATO?\u00a0 And what does this say about security of the Baltics?\u00a0 Is there a need to up the security there?\nAnd President Zelenskyy, in response to \u2013 in response to what happened today, called for fast-track membership into NATO.\u00a0 Do you have any opinion on that?\u00a0 Do you think that all countries should be \u2013 in NATO should be on board with that?\nAnd if I could just follow up on one thing the foreign minister mentioned.\u00a0 You mentioned democracy.\u00a0 Brazil has elections coming on Sunday.\u00a0 I wonder if the two of you had any conversations about how to approach that, when to recognize the results, if there are any concerns about preserving the stability of democracy in the Western Hemisphere\u2019s second-most-populous country.\u00a0 Thanks very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (In French.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 (In French.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Shaun, thank you.\u00a0 First, on the pipelines, we\u2019ve been in very close contact with our partners in Europe \u2013 notably with Denmark and Sweden.\u00a0 We are supporting the investigation into these attacks on the pipelines and working to be able to determine who is responsible.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t want to get ahead of those investigations; that work is ongoing.\u00a0 I think everyone by now is well aware of something that M\u00e9lanie alluded to more broadly, but specific to Russia, which is the outrageous misinformation and disinformation campaigns that it engages in.\u00a0 So I really have nothing to say to the absurd allegation from President Putin that we or other partners or allies are somehow responsible for this, but we will get to the bottom of what happened, and we\u2019ll share that information as soon as we\u2019re \u2013 as soon as we have it.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the investigation that\u2019s ongoing.\nWith regard to NATO and Ukraine, our position is and remains clear, and the same as it\u2019s been.\u00a0 We strongly support NATO\u2019s open door.\u00a0 We strongly support bringing into NATO countries that seek to join and that can add to NATO\u2019s capabilities.\u00a0 There\u2019s a process for doing that, and countries will continue to follow that process.\nAnd then when it comes to Brazil and the elections, we\u2019re obviously not going to get into another country\u2019s elections.\u00a0 I can just say generally speaking that Brazil has very strong democratic institutions, including very strong electoral institutions that they\u2019ve demonstrated time and time again, and we expect that that will be the case in the upcoming election this weekend.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0To add to that, obviously we support NATO\u2019s and the EU\u2019s declaration regarding the sabotage of the pipelines.\u00a0 We think that it is a very important European infrastructure.\u00a0 That is why I also had the opportunity to talk to my Danish and Swedish counterpart and obviously we spoke about it as well.\nRegarding the referenda themselves, well, you heard what I said regarding this being Putin\u2019s political theater, but quite frankly, no one is buying it.\u00a0 So we\u2019re reaching out with many countries of the world to make sure, as the UN secretary-general mentioned, that it is clear that this is against international law and that we stand strong against that violation.\nRegarding NATO \u2013 so the Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO \u2013 our position has not changed.\u00a0 It has been the same, which is essentially we believe in NATO\u2019s \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy, and we\u2019ve always been in favor of Ukraine acceding to NATO.\nAnd finally regarding Brazil, obviously my comments are the same as the Secretary in the sense that we will not meddle into Brazil\u2019s elections, but what I can say, though, is Tony and I will be heading to the OAS next week.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be in Peru and therefore we look forward to engaging with \u2013 we hope \u2013 our future counterparts, if that\u2019s the case.\u00a0 And we will obviously be having strong discussions regarding the future of democracy within our hemisphere.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Next, let\u2019s go to James McCarten with the Canadian Press.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you both for doing this today.\u00a0 On the subject of Nord Stream, Secretary and Minister, regardless of responsibility, obviously the energy supply situation in Europe is bad and only going to get worse as a result of this.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if the two of you spoke at all today about what your two countries can do either independently or collectively to help to ease some of that pressure.\u00a0 And is there a heightened sense of danger in light of that if we\u2019re talking about providing supplies \u2013 shipping supplies across the ocean, is it as simple as that or is it more complicated now as a result of these attacks?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think first it\u2019s important to make clear that these pipelines \u2013 that is, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 \u2013 were not pumping gas into Europe at this time.\u00a0 Nord Stream 2 never became operational, as is well known.\u00a0 Nord Stream 1 has been shut down for weeks because of Russia\u2019s weaponization of energy.\nWhat we\u2019ve been doing \u2013 and we\u2019ve also been working on this together for many, many weeks as we saw the Russian aggression in Ukraine and as we saw the ongoing weaponization of energy by Russia \u2013 is to work very closely with European partners as well as countries around the world to make sure that there is enough energy on world markets.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ve significantly increased our production as well as making available to Europe liquefied natural gas.\u00a0 And we\u2019re now the leading supplier of LNG to Europe to help compensate for any gas or oil that it\u2019s losing as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nWe\u2019ve worked to release oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to make sure as well that there is oil on the markets and to help keep prices down.\u00a0 We\u2019ve engaged with the European Union and established months ago a task force to work directly with Europe on ways to decrease demand to help get through the winter, as well as to pursue additional supply and to find ways to speed up the transition to renewables even as we\u2019re getting through this challenging period.\u00a0 So all of that work is ongoing.\nMy own sense \u2013 and I mentioned this the other day \u2013 is, look, there\u2019s a lot of hard work to do to make sure that countries and partners get through the winter.\u00a0 Europe itself has taken very significant steps to both decrease demand but also look at ways to pursue the transition to renewables at the same time.\u00a0 And ultimately this is also a tremendous opportunity.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy and thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing his imperial designs.\u00a0 That\u2019s very significant and that offers tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come, but meanwhile, we\u2019re determined to do everything we possibly can to make sure that the consequences of all of this are not borne by citizens in our countries or, for that matter, around the world.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0So to add to that, indeed, we have increased our production, and, therefore, by increasing our production, we have exported to the U.S. for it to be eventually sent to Europe.\u00a0 Jonathan Wilkinson, minister of natural resources, have been in close contact also with his counterpart on this.\nLooking forward, also, where Canada can really make a difference is through our new Kitimat LNG facility, which will be able to provide LNG starting 2025 and therefore increasing production, lowering prices.\u00a0 This will be also helpful for our European friends.\u00a0 And, as mentioned when Chancellor Scholz was in Canada recently with also his vice chancellor, we are also working with the Germans and many other European allies to find solutions for the next years when it comes to renewables, and the very important, significant investment in a hydrogen facility in Stephenville, Newfoundland is part also of that plan.\nSo we want to be there short term with the existing context we know.\u00a0 We want to be there in the middle term and we want to be there in the long term.\u00a0 We\u2019re obviously very seized of the energy security situation in Europe, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re in solution mode.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Joel Gehrke, Washington Examiner.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi, thank you both for doing this.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to begin with a question on Iran and then turn to Ukraine.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, Amnesty International says that collective action \u2013 it\u2019s the quote \u2013 \u201ccollective action by the international community [that goes] beyond\u2026statements of condemnation,\u201d end quote, is needed to halt the violent suppression of protests in Iran.\u00a0 And now an American citizen has been killed in Iraq, as the State Department has confirmed, and the IRGC has used ballistic missiles and other ordnance in a series of strikes in Iraq.\u00a0 Does the U.S. has a response to that beyond statements of condemnation?\nOn Ukraine, we saw this week a senior Ukrainian intelligence official said there\u2019s a very high risk of \u2013 that Russia will use a tactical nuclear weapon in some fashion.\u00a0 His recommendation in light of that was to call for anti-rocket systems from the U.S.\u00a0 Do you think that there is \u2013 are there weapons the U.S. can provide to mitigate the threat of a tactical nuclear strike?\u00a0 Do you think that the prudent response to such a nuclear threat is to attempt to deter by upgrading Ukrainian armaments or to keep U.S. military aid below some threshold that might be provocative?\nAnd then, of course, Canada and the United States both participated in the Copenhagen conference last month, which was focused on how to provide long-term support to the Ukrainians.\u00a0 We are apparently settling in for a longer \u2013 much longer conflict than maybe anybody expected.\u00a0 As you consider the options for long-term support, do you think that the West needs to help Ukraine transition to training on more advanced NATO systems, be those tanks or fighter jets or anything else?\u00a0 Or should the focus be more on financial support, perhaps, for increasing defense capacity \u2013 defense industrial production in the Czech Republic and other places that can produce Russian-style legacy equipment that they\u2019re more familiar with?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot there.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 That\u2019s more \u2013 one \u2013 than one question, actually.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Boy.\u00a0 Let me take a stab at it first \u2014\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 M\u00e9lanie, and then turn to you.\u00a0 First, on Iran, starting with the protests, the simple truth is this:\u00a0 Mahsa Amini should be alive right now, and her death in and of itself is a profound affront to human rights in Iran and, for that matter, everywhere.\u00a0 When we see the Iranian Government firing on peaceful protesters, then cutting off people\u2019s access to the global internet, we\u2019re not only watching this.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking action in response.\u00a0 You saw some of the actions that we\u2019ve taken already.\u00a0 We designated the so-called morality police, the institution responsible for her death, as well as seven other Iranian security officials involved in human rights abuses.\nAt the same time \u2013 and we talked about this earlier in the week \u2013 the Treasury Department issued new licenses that will facilitate the provision of communications equipment, software and hardware, to Iranians to allow them to better communicate amongst themselves and also with the rest of the world.\u00a0 And all of this is ongoing.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to look for ways to support those who are engaging in expressing themselves peacefully in Iran as well as taking actions against those who are responsible for the most repressive human rights violations that one can imagine.\u00a0 There\u2019s also a growing chorus of condemnation around the world, including in international institutions, something that the foreign minister and I discussed today.\nWith regard to the rocket attacks that took place, first and foremost, this was an assault on Iraqi sovereignty, which we\u2019ve seen again and again coming from Iran.\u00a0 We\u2019re supporting our Iraqi and our Kurdish partners in the face of this aggression.\u00a0 You\u2019ve of course seen international condemnation of Iran\u2019s actions, including from the Iraqi Government itself, and we\u2019ve always been clear that Iran cannot and will not act with impunity.\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated that we are willing to use a wide array of tools at our disposal to counter Iran\u2019s malign and destabilizing activities in the region.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in the past and, as necessary, we\u2019ll continue to do that in the future.\u00a0 This includes sanctions.\u00a0 It includes other financial measures.\u00a0 It includes diplomatic pressure.\u00a0 We\u2019ve used every tool in our arsenal as necessary, and when it comes to it, President Biden has not hesitated to act to protect our citizens as well as our service members from attack.\u00a0 So we\u2019re monitoring the situation very closely and, of course, we\u2019re coordinating with our partners, especially in the region.\nWhen it comes to the rhetoric we\u2019ve heard from President Putin on nuclear weapons, you heard us speak to this very directly at the United Nations this week. \u00a0This kind of loose talk about nuclear weapons is the height of irresponsibility and it\u2019s something that we take very seriously.\u00a0 We are looking very carefully to see if Russia is actually doing anything that suggests that they are contemplating the use of nuclear weapons.\u00a0 To date we\u2019ve not seen them take these actions, but we also know that Russia\u2019s engaged in horrific \u2013 a horrific brutalization of Ukraine.\u00a0 And so the threats that they make, we take very seriously.\u00a0 As to President Putin\u2019s intent, I\u2019m not going to speculate on what\u2019s in his mind.\u00a0 I can just tell you that we plan against every possible scenario, including this one.\nAs to the long-term support for Ukraine, this is a very important question, and a couple of things are, I think, worth underscoring.\u00a0 One is at every step along the way in the Russian aggression against Ukraine, we have worked to make sure that we are getting to the Ukrainians what they need to effectively defend themselves against the aggression.\u00a0 That started before the aggression, as you know, as we saw it possibly coming.\u00a0 Even as we were trying to do everything we could to stop it, to prevent it, we were working to help prepare the Ukrainians for the aggression and working with allies and partners to do that.\nGoing back a year ago \u2013 Labor Day of a year ago \u2013 the President did his first drawdown of defense equipment to Ukraine.\u00a0 We did another significant one just before Christmas \u2013 again, well before the Russian aggression.\u00a0 That put into Ukrainian hands the very things that they needed and used so effectively \u2013 Stingers, Javelins to repel the aggression directed at Kyiv in the attempt to take over the whole country.\u00a0 That failed in large part because of the courage of the Ukrainian people, but also because we helped them get ready.\nNow since then, what we\u2019ve been doing is making sure that we adapt and adjust as the nature of the aggression changes to make sure that they have what they need \u2013 but not only have what they need, that they can use it effectively and maintain it.\u00a0 Increasingly, you\u2019re seeing NATO standard systems going to Ukraine to deal with the ongoing Russian aggression.\u00a0 Part of that is training, and there\u2019s training that\u2019s happening right now outside of Ukraine to make sure that, as we provide these systems to them, they are able to effectively use them.\u00a0 And I think going forward, what Ukraine wants and needs is a strong defensive and deterrence system that makes it less likely in the future that Russia will act aggressively toward Ukraine, and that if it does nonetheless do that, that Ukraine is very well prepared.\nSo even as we\u2019re working in the moment to make sure that they have what they need right now, we\u2019re also working with them on the medium and the long term to make sure that they have what they need to have effective defense and effective deterrence against Russia.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to get into the details of what that involves, but it is a very important question that we\u2019re acting on right now.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0\u00a0So commands a long answer, I guess.\u00a0 So on Iran, of course, Canada is standing up with these strong woman of Iran that are peacefully protesting in the streets of Tehran and across the territory.\u00a0 That is why also I mentioned our steadfast support to them when I was at the UN General Assembly and I gave the national address for Canada.\u00a0 That is why also we are sanctioning the so-called morality police like the U.S. is doing \u2013 and key leaders of that morality police.\u00a0 But I must say that lots of things are on the table.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve done a lot, but we need to do more and will do more.\u00a0 Also, Canada has been spearheading the \u2013 a UN resolution before the General Assembly making sure that we condemn Iran\u2019s human rights violations in general.\u00a0 And so that is why we\u2019ll continue to offer and present that leadership before the UN alongside many nations, obviously with the U.S.\nOn the question of Ukraine in general, of course \u2013 and particularly the question of nuclear threats, you\u2019ve heard the Secretary, you\u2019ve heard Jens Stoltenberg, head of NATO, and many of us say nobody wins when it comes to nuclear.\u00a0 So obviously this is unthinkable, but we have to be ready and we are having conversations particularly within the G7 on this very issue.\nOn also the question of whether this \u2013 the referendas and this so-called annexation by Russia of territories, obviously we do not recognize it.\u00a0 We do not want to give any form of legitimacy to it, and therefore, this won\u2019t change our military strategy.\u00a0 And so that is why we\u2019ll continue to send weaponry, and I would say, mainly where Canada\u2019s expertise is, is training of Ukrainian officers. We have done that since 2014.\u00a0 Before the war, we had trained already 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers. And so we are partnering with the UK on this and we are training out of the UK many of the Ukrainian officers.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0\u00a0Final question, Alex Panetta, CBC News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on two of the things that came up earlier in this news conference.\u00a0 And (via interpreter) could you answer partly in French?\u00a0 That would be very much appreciated.\n(In English) The first involves NATO and the accession process.\u00a0 It \u2013 when Sweden and Finland applied earlier this year, it proceeded with lightning speed.\u00a0 Would you anticipate that Ukraine would move that quicky through this process?\u00a0 Or, given the level of complexity and risk involved, are we talking years rather than months in this particular case?\nAnd a second is on eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 The weapons systems that NATO countries are providing to Ukraine, we can infer from your earlier answer that nothing will change in the way the war proceeds in eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 But could I ask you whether there are any instructions, any different instructions about whether or not Western weapons systems can be used on eastern Ukrainian territory?\nThank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci pour cette question.\n(Via interpreter) I can only repeat that NATO\u2019s door will remain open, including for Ukraine.\u00a0 There is a well-known process for countries that seek to join NATO, a process that Ukraine, amongst other, continue to pursue if they wish so, Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.\n(In English) When it comes to Finland, and Sweden \u2013 as you know, these countries were both very long-time NATO partners that, in many ways, have been de facto allies for a long, long time, working in very close coordination with NATO, having very advanced militaries that are fully interoperable already with NATO, with equipment that is also fully compatible with what NATO countries have, and of course, strong democracies that have been partners as part of the European Union and with us for many, many, many years.\u00a0 So I think that explains the rapidity with which this process has moved forward.\nWhen it comes to the aggression in eastern Ukraine and southern Ukraine, and \u2013 but particularly now, the purported annexation of territory \u2013 we have been very clear about this.\u00a0 And as you\u2019ve just heard M\u00e9lanie repeat, it has no validity, no legitimacy, no legal standing.\u00a0 This territory remains Ukraine\u2019s.\u00a0 It will always be a part of Ukraine.\u00a0 We will never recognize the purported annexation of this territory.\u00a0 And as I said, Ukraine has every right to defend all of its territory, to defend the people who are there, and to take back territory that was illegally seized from it in the first place.\u00a0 And our support to Ukraine will continue, and that support can be used as Ukraine sees fit throughout the country to defend its territory and, as necessary, to take it back.\nFOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:\u00a0 So regarding Sweden and Finland, obviously we value the fact that they joined NATO.\u00a0 We were the first country in the world to ratify the accession.\u00a0 Because they are also Arctic countries, it was in Canada\u2019s interest to speed up ratification.\nAnd as I mentioned before, we believe that Ukraine should be part of NATO.\u00a0 It has been our position for now more than a decade, and we believe in the \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy.\n(Via interpreter) In French.\u00a0 It is evident that, as far as we\u2019re concerned, it\u2019s important that Sweden and Finland should join NATO.\u00a0 Why so?\u00a0 Because these are also countries which are part of those countries of the Arctic.\u00a0 So necessarily, it was in Canada\u2019s interest to ensure that they would join NATO quickly.\u00a0 In fact, we were the first country in the world to ratify their accession.\u00a0 Now, with respect to Ukraine as such, we have always had an \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy.\u00a0 Our position has always been that NATO[1]\u00a0should become a member of NATO.\n(In English) This will change our military strategy.\u00a0 How will we react?\u00a0 I have answered that question.\u00a0 Clearly, like the Secretary \u2013 like Tony mentioned, we do not recognize Putin\u2019s words.\u00a0 He is spreading lies again.\u00a0 This is part of political theater.\u00a0 Nobody is buying it.\u00a0 And so that is why we will not change the course of our actions, and that is why we will continue to work with the U.S. on this, and all our European counterparts.\u00a0 And definitely, we need to continue to do more.\n(Via interpreter) As I said in English and as I had responded previously, we will not recognize the legitimacy of the referenda and, of course, the annexation by Putin.\u00a0 To us, this is political theater, a staging by President Putin, who continues truly to lie to his population and to the world.\u00a0 There is absolutely no legitimacy as to what he did.\u00a0 Therefore, we will not change the course of things.\u00a0 We will not change our actions.\u00a0 Quite the contrary, we will redouble efforts for the Ukrainian people because we believe we are in that period currently where, more than ever, we must be alongside our Ukrainian brothers.\nMR

And colleagues, it is wonderful to see you all around this table. Thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the State Department. Welcome to the Benjamin Franklin Room. You can see to my left Franklin looking out over us. He was America\u2019s first diplomat. He signed our first treaty. He did a few other things too: he charted the Gulf Stream; he helped pioneer electricity; he development \u2013 he developed our ethos of self-government. And virtually none of this did he do while sober. (Laughter.) So I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be a problem for us this afternoon, but nonetheless I wanted to welcome you in his presence.\nAnd I am truly delighted to be able to kick off the first-ever U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit.\nThis summit reflects our deep and enduring partnership with the Pacific Islands, one that\u2019s underpinned by a shared history, values, and enduring people-to-people ties. Together we\u2019ll discuss the challenges that we face, exchange ideas and perspectives, and chart a way forward to deliver on the issues that matter most to our people.\nI am very grateful today to be joined by Peace Corps Acting Director Carol Spahn[1], Millennium Challenge Corporation CEO Alice Albright \u2013 two essential partners in doing the work of teaming up with the peoples of the Pacific Islands to advance development across the region, which is what we\u2019re here today to discuss.\nAnd I\u2019d very much like to thank Suzy for her leadership not just today in helping to moderate the discussion, but exceptional leadership of the East-West Center, which really brings us together day in, day out. We\u2019re grateful for that. Suzy, you\u2019ve dedicated most of your life to strengthening ties between the United States and our Pacific partners, and I just want to congratulate you on becoming both the first Native Hawaiian and the first woman to lead the East-West Center.\nThis summit is the latest effort on the part of this administration to hear directly from you about your priorities, your ideas, your hopes for the future of the region and the world, and especially how we can work together to try to achieve them.\nMany of us were together at the Partners of the Blue Pacific Ministerial meeting that we hosted last week in New York on the margins of the UN General Assembly. We brought together countries around the vision that you and others set out in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\nToday\u2019s discussion also builds on the Pacific Leaders Summit that our gracious hosts in Fiji convened in February \u2013 grateful for that; Vice President Harris\u2019s engagement with the Pacific Islands Forum in July; Deputy Secretary of State Sherman\u2019s meetings with many of you during the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders.\nWhat I hope that you take away from these engagements is that the United States shares your vision, and we are committed to help realize it.\nIt\u2019s a vision that recognizes that only by working together can we actually tackle the biggest challenges of our time that confront all of our citizens, from combating the climate crisis and health emergencies, to promoting economic opportunity, to preserving a free and open Indo\u2011Pacific where every nation \u2013 no matter how big, no matter how small \u2013 has the right to choose its own path.\nYou can count on the United States partnering with you to rally other countries around this vision across major international gatherings \u2013 from the UN General Assembly, to COP, to the Summit for Democracy.\nWe also have the same vision for individuals. Like you, we want every person to be able to choose their path, no matter who they are or where they\u2019re born, and have a chance to reach their full potential. That\u2019s what people-centered development is all about.\nDelivering on that goal demands that we find pathways for people to build knowledge and to share ideas across communities, across borders, and that\u2019s going to be a key focus of the discussion today: deepening our people-to-people ties and our educational exchanges.\nWe\u2019re doing that through a number of programs, including ones like TechGirls, which brings high school-age girls from across the world to the United States for a summer exchange to build the knowledge, the skills, the networks that will help them pursue higher education and careers in STEM \u2013 in the sciences and technology.\nToday, we\u2019ll also discuss ways to build greater resilience across the region.\nOne of the messages that we\u2019ve heard loud and clear from Pacific Island leaders is that building resilience is about more than equipping communities to adapt to the effects of the climate crisis, which for many of you is an existential threat; it\u2019s also about preparing communities to weather a wide range of interrelated shocks that we know have caused cascading effects.\nThat reflects the world that we live in, where the changing climate is accelerating the spread of deadly viruses, where transnational criminal organizations not only threaten our security, through corruption and human trafficking, but also biodiversity, through smuggling irreplaceable wildlife and timber.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with you to deepen resilience across the board \u2013 from bolstering health security through better early warning and response systems to diseases like Dengue, to launching a program called Resilient Blue Economies, which will strengthen marine livelihoods by supporting sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, tourism. Today, I am very pleased to announce that the United States will contribute $4.8 million to this new effort.\nI have to tell you, though, that I\u2019m especially pleased as we start our conversations, as we start these two days with President Biden joining us tomorrow, that we have also come together around a declaration of partnership between the U.S. and the Pacific, one that shows that we have a shared vision for the future and a determination to build that future together.\nSo I\u2019m very pleased that we have this today, that we\u2019ve agreed on it, and it will give us a roadmap for the work that we\u2019re doing in the future.\nMost important, I\u2019m really looking forward to this conversation, to listening, to hearing from each and every one of you so that we can be a better, stronger, more effective partner in the future that we\u2019re working to build together.\nSuzy, with that, back to you.\n\nChief Executive Officer Carol Spahn \u2191\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-millennium-challenge-corporation-mou-signing-with-malawian-president-lazarus-chakwera-malawian-finance-and-economic-affairs-minister-sosten-gwengwe-and-mcc-ceo-ali/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Thank you all so much for joining us today to celebrate a remarkable moment in the longstanding partnership between the United States and the Republic of Malawi.\nMy name is Alice, and I am the CEO of the Millennium Challenge Corporation.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to thank you so much, Secretary Blinken, for convening us and hosting us today in the wonderful State Department.\u00a0 I\u2019d also like to thank you, President Chakwera, and your finance minister, Minister Gwengwe, for being with us.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor to have you with us.\u00a0 Mr. President, thank you for your leadership and your commitment to building a prosperous future for all of the people of Malawi.\nIt\u2019s a great honor to lead the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an agency that has invested $15 billion in grant financing towards programs that boost economic growth and reduce poverty.\u00a0 In Africa alone, we\u2019ve invested more than $9 billion across 25 countries on the continent in programs that are expected to benefit almost 90 million people.\n2022, this year, has been a particularly big year for the agency.\u00a0 All told, we expect to sign investments worth $1.8 billion that will directly benefit more than 13 million people, 75 percent of whom live on the continent.\u00a0 These investments will help deliver clean water, improve sanitation to help fight disease, make transportation more efficient through the construction of roads, boost agricultural yields by bringing irrigation to farmers, and increase access to reliable \u2013 to electricity so that households and businesses can thrive.\nMCC\u2019s partnership with Malawi dates back nearly two decades.\u00a0 In 2004, MCC\u2019s board of directors selected Malawi as eligible for a $21 million threshold program.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we got started.\u00a0 And together, with that threshold program, we tackled key policy areas to help improve public financial management.\u00a0 Then between 2013 and 2018, MCC and the Government of Malawi partnered to undertake a $350 million compact which was designed to overhaul the country\u2019s power sector by constructing and refurbishing 26 sub-stations and 400 kilometers of transmission and distribution lines, delivering an additional 12 megawatts of clean energy and boosting the country\u2019s hydropower generation capability.\u00a0 Those transformative investments in the country\u2019s power sector are expected to benefit over 7 million Malawians, including people like Valison Fira, who\u2019s a butcher who lives in Lilongwe and whose business needs reliable, affordable electricity to thrive.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBuilding on this success and Malawi\u2019s strong commitment to democratic governance, MCC\u2019s board then selected Malawi for a second compact in 2018.\u00a0 And today we are signing that.\u00a0 So it\u2019s a great moment.\nAnd since then, MCC has developed this new compact, again in close partnership with your country, Excellency, and everyone on your team, and also with close consultation with the private sector and civil society.\nAnd so today, Mr. President, Mr. Secretary of State, we are so proud to continue our longstanding partnership by investing another $350 million to reduce transport costs and strengthen land administration in the country.\u00a0 MCC\u2019s $350 million grant is further complemented by a $26 million contribution in-kind from the Government of Malawi.\u00a0 And again, a strong signal of your government\u2019s commitment to the success of the compact.\nThis compact which you will sign today is called the Malawi Transport and Land Compact, and it will reduce transportation costs and improve the ability of farmers to get their products to market by upgrading more than 300 kilometers of roads.\u00a0 This will be a help to farmers like Agnes Kapuka, who told my team that a new road would save her enormous amounts of time and money to help getting her products to market.\nThis program also prioritizes road safety and provides technical assistance to the Malawi Roads Authority to improve maintenance and planning.\u00a0 And further, the compact will support the Government of Malawi in addressing competition policy to help ensure that transport costs over time decrease while promoting sustainable management of the transport sector, including at the local level.\nArable land is one of Malawi\u2019s greatest resources, and this compact will also support reforms to help expand national land-based revenues and key institutional changes needed to increase productivity.\nAfter all the work is completed, MCC and Malawi will have worked together on more than $747 million worth of transformative projects, benefiting a total of 12 million people \u2013 more than half the country\u2019s population.\nI\u2019d like to thank everybody involved who has worked so hard to advance these important investments.\u00a0 I especially want to commend the tireless work of the MCC team \u2013 many of which are there; there\u2019s Joel.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And when we work closely with a team, we also work very closely with people in the countries with whom we work, and I also would like to recognize Dye Mawindo, who has worked tirelessly.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo that\u2019s the team over there that\u2019s done all the hard work to make this a reality.\u00a0 So again, huge thank you.\u00a0 There\u2019s lots to go, though, but huge thank you.\nI\u2019d also like to recognize Ambassador Young \u2013 where\u2019s David?\u00a0 There\u2019s David.\u00a0 Hi, Ambassador Young \u2013 for his tireless support to bring this to fruition.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We also have a lot of work ahead of us, so we\u2019re going to call you a lot, as well as Malawi\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Justice Esmie Chombo.\u00a0 Thank you so much, Madam Ambassador.\nAlso I know that there are two teams in Washington and Malawi that have contributed huge amounts of their technical expertise to making this compact a reality.\u00a0 I can\u2019t name everybody here, but they\u2019ve all done an excellent job, and one of the secrets to Malawi \u2013 to MCC\u2019s success in working with countries, Malawi being a strong example, is how closely our teams work together on technical matters.\u00a0 So you have my huge gratitude, everybody involved to make today a reality, and we very much look forward to making \u2013 to signing and getting on with really the deep, hard work to get on with the success of the compact.\nSo today\u2019s celebration is only a beginning.\u00a0 Much of the challenging work lies ahead.\u00a0 I look forward to working with all of you to ensure that the Malawi Transport and Land Compact delivers and helps give the people of Malawi the tools they need to build a more prosperous future.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019m now going to call a number of our distinguished guests to come and share their remarks.\u00a0 So with that, I would like to first introduce our next speaker, the Malawian minister of finance and economic affairs, Sosten Alfred Gwengwe.\u00a0 He has been absolutely instrumental in getting this compact organized.\u00a0 He\u2019s also a member of parliament in Malawi and has served in cabinet in various positions, including the minister of transport and industry and trade.\u00a0 He was appointed by the minister of finance and economic affairs in January 2022, and we are so pleased to have you with us today, Honorable Minister.\u00a0 Please, Minister, the podium is yours.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMINISTER GWENGWE:\u00a0 The president of the Republic of Malawi, His Excellency Dr. Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera; Secretary of State of the United States of America, His Excellency Antony Blinken; the MCC CEO, Ms. Alice Albright; Ambassador Chombo; Ambassador David; the MCC vice president for the compact operations, Ms. Kim \u2013 think I\u2019ve seen you right there; secretary to the president, Madam Zamba; all protocols observed.\u00a0 Your Excellencies, today is a very special day for Malawi, because this day marks the conclusion of several years of very hard work on the part of our two teams, the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Malawi Millennium Development Trust.\nIf we\u2019re overjoyed therefore, please do understand it is because we can now breathe a huge sigh of relief on the completion of the compact development work.\u00a0 My\u00a0congratulations\u00a0\u2013 (applause) \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 My\u00a0congratulations\u00a0go to all who have contributed in various ways in making today a reality.\nYour Excellencies, I can report that throughout the multiyear compact development process, the MCC and the MMD engaged in regular and inclusive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders.\u00a0 These consultations sought to identify the binding constraints to our economic growth, assess underlying root causes driving these binding constraints, identify potential project opportunities, and make informed design decisions for the various interventions.\u00a0 These consultations included relevant government ministries and departments, local communities likely to be impacted by the program, and related local officials, representatives from the local and international civil societies, and nongovernment organizations, private sector leaders, and also development partners.\nAnd the proposed interventions under this compact include two main projects; firstly, the construction of four corridor roads in the three regions of Malawi, and this proposed activity seeks to reduce travel time and costs for smallholder farmers throughout \u2013 through the improvement of targeted roads in selected transport sector.\u00a0 This will improve road conditions and thereby facilitate greater flow of agricultural products from farm gates to urban, regional, and export markets.\nAnd secondly, the land project that will improve land administration services in our main land institutions \u2013 this is a policy and institutional reform activity that seeks to improve Malawi\u2019s land governance institutions, especially with respect to the revenues that these organizations rely on to operate efficiently and effectively.\u00a0 We are convinced that increased funding at national and city levels and expenditure system improvements will translate into improved land services to our people.\nYour Excellencies, I am aware that the signing of the second compact will mark the beginning of a fresh set of tasks that need to be undertaken before the compact can enter into force.\u00a0 And so, whereas the compact development exercise has been concluded, our two teams cannot afford to lower their guard.\u00a0 We have a long list of conditions that have to be fulfilled and administrative actions that are required to be undertaken.\u00a0 I am advised that the average lapsed time between compact signing and entry into force can range between 12 months or so.\u00a0 We in Malawi are determined to keep this period to the barest minimum.\u00a0 I can promise you, Your Excellencies, that we will leave no stone unturned to do our part.\u00a0 And I call upon all the stakeholders to work together to ensure that this waiting period is kept to the shortest period as \u2013 to as short a period as possible.\nI end my remarks this morning by underscoring our profound gratitude to the American Government for this and other equally life-changing interventions to the people of Malawi.\u00a0 I am also indebted to the compact development team, the MMD, the Malawi side, led by Dye Mawindo, and Joel Wiegert, leading the MCC team on our side.\u00a0 They have worked very long hours.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They have worked very long hours to develop the various activities that now comprise the interventions under the second compact.\nOn that note, it is now my similar honor to invite His Excellency the President of the Republic of Malawi Dr. Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera to address us.\u00a0 Your Excellency, sir.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS ALBRIGHT:\u00a0 Thank you, Honorable Minister.\u00a0 I look forward to working with you to make this compact a success, and you have my full assurance that I and my team will work very quickly, as much as we can, to move things along.\nIt is now my distinct honor to introduce our next speaker, the United States Secretary of State, Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken began his career in public service at the State Department and over the subsequent three decades has served in three presidential administrations and has helped shape U.S. foreign policy to assure that it protects U.S. interests and delivers results for the American people.\u00a0 He\u2019s also been kind enough to host us today.\u00a0 So please join me in welcoming the Secretary of State to the podium.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It is wonderful to see you here, to see you at the State Department, on a very happy and positive occasion.\nMr. President, Mr. Minister, thank you for your partnership, but thank you especially for your leadership.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll have more to say about that in a few minutes, but it\u2019s been remarkable and deeply, deeply appreciated.\nAlice, thank you for your leadership of the Millennium Challenge Corporation.\u00a0 It is always a good day at the State Department when an Albright is here in this building.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I just want to say to you and to your MCC colleagues: extraordinary work on this, but also around the world.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure if we need to think about changing what MCC stands for.\u00a0 Maybe \u201cMaking Change Concrete.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 \u201cMaking Change Cool.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But both of those are true, and it\u2019s incredibly powerful, and I\u2019m really so pleased to be able to join all of you in celebrating Malawi\u2019s second Millennium Challenge Corporation compact.\nThis agreement opens a new chapter in the partnership between the United States and Malawi \u2013 one that builds on our close collaboration over decades, as we\u2019ve heard, our shared democratic values, and a joint vision for a prosperous, stable, resilient Malawi.\nAs we\u2019ve heard, this compact will contribute up to $350 million to reduce poverty and support inclusive economic growth in Malawi.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll do this by strengthening two critical building blocks: roads and land administration.\u00a0 You heard Alice talk about this, but this really is in a sense where the rubber meets the road.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredibly powerful.\nFirst, upgrading major roads will make urban markets more accessible, so that people in rural areas can travel quickly and cheaply, and more swiftly bring their products to market.\u00a0 In the doing, we\u2019ll also help combat gender-based violence along these roads and markets, so that women can safely transport and sell their goods.\nSecond, improving government administration will help Malawi make the most of one of its core economic resources, and that\u2019s land.\u00a0 Helping strengthen record keeping, for example, will make it easier for families and marginalized people to prove that they own their land \u2013 and protect themselves from exploitation.\u00a0 For companies, these records will mean that they can invest with confidence, they can grow their businesses, they can create more jobs for Malawian citizens.\nWhat\u2019s so critical and what\u2019s so important about the way the MCC does its work is that we\u2019ve developed these priorities together \u2013 identifying the barriers to economic opportunity, devising ways to solve them.\u00a0 Malawi will take the lead in putting these plans into action.\nLike all MCC endeavors, these projects will be transparent, they\u2019ll be collaborative, and built to meet the highest standards of quality.\u00a0 They\u2019ll provide grants to Malawi, not debt.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And they\u2019ll support Malawi\u2019s development and its efforts to strengthen good governance, accountability, democracy \u2013 the hallmarks of the president\u2019s administration.\nWith these new projects, the United States and Malawi will build upon the progress we\u2019ve made through the MCC \u2013 and through many other partnerships that we have.\nFor decades, we\u2019ve worked with Malawi\u2019s government, with NGOs, with civil society, with the private sector on a broad range of issues, including combatting HIV/AIDS.\u00a0 The United States has contributed $1 billion to this effort over the last two decades, and in the last dozen years alone, we\u2019ve reduced the number of HIV and AIDS-related deaths by 80 percent.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 These partnerships are quite literally changing lives.\nDuring COVID, the United States has been able to donate more than 2.3 million safe, effective vaccine doses through COVAX \u2013 free of charge, with more to come as needed \u2013 to help protect Malawians from death and severe illness.\nWe\u2019ve expanded access to public universities in Malawi, offering scholarships, distance learning programs that have benefitted more than 1,500 students who otherwise might not have been able to attend.\nAnd for years, we\u2019ve collaborated to strengthen Malawi\u2019s food security \u2013 improving nutrition, increasing food production, connecting more farmers to markets.\u00a0 Now, President Putin\u2019s war of choice on Ukraine has contributed to driving up the price of food, the price of fuel, fertilizers, as well as their availability, including in Malawi \u2013 rolling back some of the hard-earned development gains and driving more people back into poverty.\nWe are determined to act effectively against this, to help lift people up to help create their own capacity to produce in a sustainable way the food that not only Malawi needs, but that other countries in Africa and even beyond need.\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced that there is a remarkably positive opportunity to build durable agricultural capacity and production in Malawi so even as we respond to the immediate, we will work together on the long term.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd Mr. President, I want to acknowledge again your leadership, your deep commitment to democratic and economic reform.\u00a0 And to you, to the finance minister, you\u2019ve been stalwart partners, and I know that this is an incredibly challenging time.\u00a0 Malawi\u2019s been on the receiving end of an \u2013 almost a perfect storm of challenges.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had climate change, we\u2019ve had COVID, we\u2019ve had conflict \u2013 that are all having consequences for the Malawian people.\u00a0 And I can just tell you that the United States is committed to working with you, not only to get through the stormy period, but to get to a brighter, enduring day, and this day is one of them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nOne critical component to this is the extended credit facility with the IMF, something the United States strongly supports.\u00a0 We are stepping up to try to help those who are in greatest immediate need.\u00a0 One way we\u2019re doing that is through the President\u2019s decision to significantly expand the Feed the Future program.\u00a0 This is the flagship program that the United States has to end global hunger, to combat malnutrition.\u00a0 We\u2019ve extended it to eight new countries, including Malawi.\nSo what does that mean?\u00a0 Over the next five years, we are working with Congress to invest over $11 billion around the world toward, again, not only responding to the immediate crisis, but \u2013 critically \u2013 building resilience that will better prepare communities worldwide not only to withstand future shocks, but again, to have enduring agricultural productive capacity.\nA few months ago, I was at the United Nations.\u00a0 We convened countries around the food and security crisis that we\u2019re facing.\u00a0 And one of the things that was most striking to me was \u2013 even as we met with a large group of foreign ministers, we seized the Security Council \u2013 I spent some time with 10 colleagues from Africa, and the thing that resonated loudly and clearly with me was the desire and need not only for emergency assistance to combat the current crisis, but even more for helping together, as partners, build sustainable, durable production in Africa by Africans.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn these areas and more, the United States is dedicated to finding solutions to the biggest challenges of our time with Malawi and its people, not for Malawi.\u00a0 That\u2019s the guiding principle.\u00a0 That\u2019s the guiding principle of this administration\u2019s partnership with Malawi; it\u2019s the guiding principle of our strategy for sub-Saharan Africa, which I had a chance to lay out recently in South Africa.\nAnd fundamentally, it\u2019s the only way that any of us can achieve our shared goals, whether it\u2019s creating economic opportunity, ending public health crises, fighting hunger, building a better future of opportunity for all our people.\nWe know that when we work together, we can accomplish real change for our people.\u00a0 That\u2019s what today is about.\u00a0 It is accomplishing real change for the people of Malawi.\nAnd again, we don\u2019t have to look any further than the MCC and the impact that it\u2019s already had.\nWe\u2019ve mentioned a couple of real people, individuals, who will benefit.\u00a0 I want to mention another one, a woman by the name of Judith, who participated in Malawi\u2019s first MCC compact.\u00a0 She used to do small-scale farming, selling peanuts and selling peas.\u00a0 Through the MCC, she learned how to raise and sell tree seedlings \u2013 with her profits, she was able to cover school tuition for her child.\u00a0 One of her business partners was able to build a better house.\u00a0 Their new venture also slowed soil erosion \u2013 which helped protect a nearby river and decrease interruptions to the hydropower it generated.\nSo we can see an incredibly virtuous cycle that this produces, and it starts with a compact and it ripples outward in incredibly powerful ways.\nSo I look forward to continuing this work together and to seeing the new opportunities, the concrete opportunities, the concrete change that this compact will bring.\u00a0 It will open \u2013 help open an even brighter future for the people of Malawi and for the partnership between our countries.\u00a0 So to all of you, Mr. President, Alice, thank you so much for today, and we\u2019re looking forward to many days ahead.\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Applause.)\nMS ALBRIGHT:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken, for those remarks.\u00a0 We thank you, again, for your leadership as our relationship with Malawi continues to thrive and advance.\nI\u2019m now pleased to introduce our final speaker for today, the President of the Republic of Malawi President Chakwera.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to have you with us.\u00a0 President Chakwera has also served as a member of parliament in Malawi, served as the chairman of the South African Development Community between August 2021 and August 2022.\u00a0 We are so, so excited to have you here today.\u00a0 President Chakwera, let me respectfully ask you to come join us at the podium.\nThank you.\n(Applause.)\nPRESIDENT CHAKWERA:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Good morning.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\nPRESIDENT CHAKWERA:\u00a0\u00a0Honorable Mr. Secretary, Ms. Albright, ambassadors, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, this is an historic occasion.\u00a0 The signing of this second MCC Compact for Malawi is no ordinary event.\u00a0 This is very, very important program for Malawi and a test, not only to the longstanding cordial relations between Malawi and the United States, but also to the progress that Malawi has made in recent months to meet the exacting standards of MCC\u2019s scorecard, the policies we have implemented for the advancement of governance, economic freedom, democracy, people-centered investments, and the fight against corruption.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019m aware that after Malawi\u2019s selection for its first MCC compact in the energy sector before I came into office, progress had stalled for years in securing this second compact for the transport sector because of issues of corruption.\u00a0 But in the past two years, my administration has taken a zero-tolerance stance against corruption, shielding no one from investigation and prosecution, as well as removing and suspending from office those with a case to answer before our independence and credible courts of justice.\nOur desire in doing so is to ensure that everyone understands that on our list of obstacles of Malawi\u2019s development, corruption ranks number one.\u00a0 And so we consider it our biggest enemy.\u00a0 We will therefore continue to fight it and stand against it no matter how long it takes until it is defeated.\u00a0 The fight against corruption ensures that investments like the MCC compact fulfill their intended purpose and yield their intended benefits.\nFrom the first MCC compact, we saw the construction of over 400 kilometers of transmission and distribution lines.\u00a0 We saw the refurbishment of 26 substations, resulting in both extended access to reliable power throughout the country.\u00a0 We saw the upgrading of Nkhula A Hydroelectric power plant through which its generation capacity was increased by 33 percent.\u00a0 We saw progress towards the trading the of power with Mozambique and the SADC region through the Southern African Power Pool. \u00a0We saw creation of an enabling environment for independent private sector power producers to enter the market.\u00a0 And with this second compact, we will see the construction of roads across the country.\nThe MCC second compact for Malawi comes at a very opportune time, as it will augment my government\u2019s effort to create a conducive environment for private sector growth, especially to benefit smallholder farmers in rural areas in Mzimba, Lilongwe, Mangochi.\nAnd so I thank MCC for their unwavering support given to my government to secure this compact development process.\u00a0 May I also take this opportunity to thank all those who participated in constraints analysis process from MCC, government, local government authorities, private sector, and nonstate actors who provided information and technical advice to the compact development team.\nMany names have been mentioned already, and on this note, allow me to refer to an earlier conversation that I had with MCC\u2019s CEO when I was last here in March.\u00a0 I would like to reiterate the point that I made then.\u00a0 During that conversation, I had asked MCC to consider complementing the investment that is to be made through this second compact with one in the three countries of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia by way of a regional compact.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs the immediate past chair of SADC, I believe that enhancing regional integration with our neighbors through foundational infrastructure, such as rail and roads, will have phenomenal economic benefits as safe and reliable rail and road transport investments will certainly help reduce barriers to growth and create opportunities for all of our people.\u00a0 In our case, as a land-linked country, securing a reliable and inexpensive link to the sea would de-risk our economy.\u00a0 This is as request that I\u2019d like to leave with MCC to continue to mull over \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as we think ahead.\nBut I am most grateful once again to the American people and the U.S. Government for their partnership in developing Malawi.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re making strides for everyone\u2019s good.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS ALBRIGHT:\u00a0\u00a0Your Excellency, thank you.\u00a0 Wonderful remarks.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 Your leadership will be absolutely essential to ensuring this compact is a success.\nI\u2019d like to now invite the Secretary of State as well as the minister of finance up to the podium and we will actually sign.\u00a0 Thank you.\n(The memorandum was signed.)\n(Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-tajikistan-foreign-minister-sirojiddin-muhriddin-before-their-meeting-2/",

morning, everyone.\u00a0 Mr. Minister, my friend, welcome back to Washington.\u00a0 It is always a pleasure to meet Minister Jaishankar, whether it\u2019s here, in New York, in Delhi, Melbourne, Bali, or anywhere else.\nAnd I think our own conversations \u2013 deep, extended conversations that have taken place in fact over many years, because we were counterparts when I was last at the State Department as deputy secretary \u2013 I think it reflects the fact that the partnership between our countries, between India and the United States, is simply one of the most consequential in the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s vital to addressing virtually every global challenge that our people face, whether it\u2019s health security, climate change, food security, upholding the free and open international order, to name just a few.\nOver the past years, we have made real progress in elevating that partnership \u2013 bilaterally, that is directly between us, through institutions like the Quad and the G20, and in international organizations, including at the United Nations.\u00a0 Today, we talked about how we can further advance our shared security, economic, and geopolitical goals.\nLast week in New York, we were both witness to genuine unity among the vast majority of UN member-states \u2013 developing and developed, big and small, north and south \u2013 on the need to work together to address the shared challenges that all of our people face, as well as to uphold the United Nations Charter and its core principles, including sovereignty, territorial integrity, and human rights.\nWe\u2019re grateful for the minister\u2019s partnership and leadership on these fronts.\u00a0 That includes in the Security Council, where, as we were together, he underscored the message that Prime Minister Modi delivered recently in Uzbekistan that, and I quote, \u201ctoday\u2019s era is not of war.\u201d\u00a0 And then in the General Assembly, where the prime minister said of India, and I quote, \u201cWe are on the side that respects the UN Charter and its founding principles,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 So is the United States.\nWe recognize that to meet the challenges we face, members of the UN must not only uphold the charter, but also modernize the institution, including by making the Security Council more inclusive.\nThat\u2019s why, in his address to the General Assembly, President Biden expressed his support for increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the Security Council, a long-standing goal of India.\u00a0 This includes permanent seats for those nations we\u2019ve long supported, and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean.\nIn his own General Assembly address, the minister also highlighted the food, fuel, and fertilizer crises that have hit countries as they struggle to rebuild from the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 And indeed, if you look at how we spent most of our week last week at the United Nations, it was focusing on these very challenges.\nWe\u2019ve been working to rally allies and partners not only to help people around the world most affected by these crises, but also to make sure that we are part of the solution to creating durable ways of dealing with these challenges.\u00a0 For example, on food security, not only responding to the emergency need but also helping countries develop durable agricultural productive capacity.\nWe know as well that each of these crises has been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.\u00a0 And it\u2019s why we continue to marshal international pressure on President Putin to end his war of choice.\nWe also held a Quad ministerial on the margins of the UN, with the minister and I continuing to work with our Australian and Japanese counterparts to realize what is a shared vision of a free, open Indo-Pacific that\u2019s connected, that\u2019s prosperous, that\u2019s secure, and that is resilient.\nAnd here it\u2019s worth emphasizing that we\u2019re bringing complementary strengths to bear on problems none of us can address effectively alone.\u00a0 A few examples \u2013 cyber crime.\u00a0 You saw in the joint commitment that we issued in New York last week our agreement to deny safe haven to ransomware operations emanating from within our respective countries \u2013 because a foothold anywhere can be used to stage attacks everywhere \u2013 and to assist one another in the face of cyber attacks against critical infrastructure.\nOne of the clearest ways that Quad partners can continue to deliver for people across the region is by being there in their times of their greatest need.\u00a0 In New York, we also took a step that will increase our capacity to do that.\u00a0 We signed a set of guidelines to deepen our coordination among the four countries on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nIn today\u2019s meeting, and as well at dinner last night, we also talked about ways to further strengthen our strategic partnership and advance shared objectives.\nThis includes helping one another prevent a climate catastrophe and adapt to the changes to come, because the future of our people, and people everywhere, depends in no small part on hitting the ambitious targets that we\u2019ve both set.\u00a0 That includes India\u2019s goal of installing 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, which would mean more than 60 percent of India\u2019s electricity comes from non-polluting energy sources.\nWe\u2019re helping do that through the U.S.-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership, which is helping to foster joint research and development, mobilizing finance from the private sector and multilateral institutions, and finding ways to scale up innovative clean energy technologies.\nAs the world\u2019s two biggest democracies, we\u2019re also committed to an enduring project \u2013 as our founders put it \u2013 of striving to form a more perfect union.\u00a0 This is a project for both of us.\u00a0 We have to work together to show that our democracies can meet our people\u2019s needs, and we must continue to hold ourselves \u2013 both of us, as well as our fellow democracies \u2013 to our core values, including respect for universal human rights like freedom of religion and belief and freedom of expression, which makes our democracies stronger.\nWe explored ways to keep building our dynamic economic partnership.\u00a0 The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which we launched in May, is one way we\u2019ll do this.\u00a0 Just a few weeks ago, India affirmed its intention to participate in three of the framework\u2019s pillars \u2013 on supply chains, clean economy, and fair economy.\nThe U.S. is India\u2019s largest trading partner, with $157 billion last year in bilateral trade.\u00a0 We\u2019re India\u2019s largest source of foreign direct investment, with a diverse range of U.S. companies investing $45 billion in India \u2013 Google, Microsoft, Whirlpool, Boeing, GE, and I could go on.\nBut we see more room to grow, and to do it in a way that creates jobs for workers in both of our countries.\u00a0 The U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue, the U.S.-India CEO Forum will give us more opportunities to do that in the months ahead.\nSo these are just some of the ways \u2013 multilaterally, regionally, bilaterally \u2013 that we\u2019re bringing this close relationship between India and the United States even closer together.\u00a0 And with India holding the presidency of the Security Council in December, and taking over the presidency of the G20 next year, we\u2019ll be able to drive more concerted global cooperation and action together.\nAt an event this weekend, you called, Mr. Minister, the shift in U.S.-India relations the single biggest change that you\u2019ve observed in decades of service as a diplomat.\u00a0 The minister said, and I quote, \u201cIt did not change only because of government policies; the relationship changed because of Indian Americans.\u201d\u00a0 And I could not agree more.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to have an Indian American community that does so much to deepen ties between our countries, as well as to shape the fabric of this country.\u00a0 And I\u2019d add that we\u2019re also grateful to communities in India, including of American origin, that are doing their part to strengthen the relationship for the good of both of our countries and both of our peoples.\nWith that, Jai, over to you.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 It is really a great pleasure to join Secretary Blinken at this media event at the conclusion of what I can honestly say is a very productive morning of discussions.\nI was last here in April, and obviously a lot of things in the world have changed since then.\u00a0 While we have spent quite some time this morning, I thank the Secretary and his wife for hosting us yesterday at the working dinner.\u00a0 This was really a very gracious gesture, and I think an occasion that both of us put to good use.\nObviously, a large part of our deliberations today were devoted to the strengthening of our bilateral relationship.\u00a0 Most of you would readily understand that it has grown very significantly in scope and depth over the last few years.\u00a0 We engage each other across pretty much every domain, and the quality of our cooperation \u2013 as indeed of our conversations \u2013 have steadily improved.\nIn today\u2019s meeting, we discussed our political coordination, working together in plurilateral and multilateral formats, and exchanging assessments and \u2013 on collaborating on important regional issues and global challenges.\u00a0 I would specifically mention the Ukraine conflict and the Indo-Pacific situation in that regard.\nI share with \u2013 I shared with Secretary Blinken my experience of interactions during the UN General Assembly about the deep anxieties in the Global South on fuel, on food, on fertilizers.\u00a0 The increasing salience of green growth, digital development, and affordable health is today very, very evident.\u00a0 We must not let current developments jeopardize Agenda 2030 on SDGs or to deflect us from climate action and climate justice commitments.\nOur cooperation in different bilateral domains is progressing vigorously.\u00a0 Naturally, Secretary Blinken and I did a comprehensive stock taking.\u00a0 But separately, I met Defense Secretary Austin and Commerce Secretary Raimondo to review their particular areas.\u00a0 I participated in a particularly interesting roundtable organized by the National Science Foundation.\nI will be meeting business leaders over the next two days.\u00a0 And given the bipartisan support that we have long enjoyed in the U.S. Congress, I look forward to interacting with some of its prominent members.\u00a0 There will also be an occasion for me engage think tanks and policy analysts so that there is a better understanding of India\u2019s concerns and interests.\nHaving said that, there are particular issues in the current global context that shape the evolution of our cooperation, and therefore merit your attention as well.\u00a0 Prominent among them is a commitment to address the global volatility which has arisen from the COVID, from conflicts, and from climate events.\u00a0 India and the U.S. have a strong interest in encouraging more resilient and reliable supply chains.\u00a0 This requires policy decisions as well as practical measures involving the business community.\u00a0 We are focused on those goals.\nFurthermore, the digital world mandates a greater emphasis on trust and transparency.\u00a0 This too has been the subject of detailed conversations and follow-up action.\u00a0 When it comes to critical and emerging technologies, we both see the value of expanding trusted research.\u00a0 Our national security, our economic security, our technology security, are all enhanced by closer collaboration.\u00a0 It is also in our mutual interest to facilitate the development and mobility of talent.\u00a0 We agreed that impediments in this regard should be addressed.\nThere is a keen interest in India\u2019s national education policy, and we will explore how that can best serve to expand our partnership.\nOn mobility, specifically visas, this is particularly crucial given its centrality to education, business, technology, and family reunions.\u00a0 There have been some challenges of late, and I flagged it to Secretary Blinken and his team and I have every confidence that they will look at some of these problems seriously and positively.\nAll these issues and more were evaluated not just in our bilateral context but also from the perspective of the Quad and the I2U2.\u00a0 We are keen to move forward on the Indo\u2011Pacific Economic Framework.\u00a0 I saw some creative thinking on how to repurpose established mechanisms for more contemporary collaboration.\nOur two countries have contributed \u2013 are committed to contributing to the betterment of the global commons.\u00a0 True to our traditions, we rise above narrow national interest to serve the needs of the larger international community.\u00a0 We do so on the basis of our belief in a rules-based order, in our respect for international law, and in our adherence to the UN Charter.\nIndia\u2011U.S. cooperation is today visible across the length and breadth of the Indo\u2011Pacific and perhaps even beyond.\u00a0 It has many facets and expresses itself in different ways.\u00a0 We particularly value closer coordination in the Indian subcontinent, where we perceive that our convergences are very strong.\u00a0 It is essential that democracy, pluralism, progress, development, and prosperity are nurtured.\u00a0 Conversely, we must counter radicalization, extremism, and fundamentalism.\u00a0 India is widening its international footprint, and there are many more regions where we will be intersecting with American interests.\u00a0 It is to our mutual benefit that this be a complementary process.\nComing out of the UNGA, or UNGA, the reform of the UN is a particularly topical subject.\u00a0 We appreciate the positive approach of the U.S. to this issue reflected in the position articulated by President Biden himself.\u00a0 We look forward to working with the U.S. to take this further.\u00a0 I also expressed appreciation at the strong cooperation that we have got from the U.S. on the question of tackling international terrorism.\u00a0 In particular, I refer to the listing of well-known and wanted terrorists by the UN sanction process.\u00a0 In many other formats too, our two countries collaborate to keep the world safer and more secure.\nWe spoke over the last two days of our commitment to practicing and furthering democracy, human rights, and good governance.\u00a0 Each country approaches the set of issues from their history, tradition, and societal context.\u00a0 Our yardstick for judgement are the integrity of the democratic processes, the respect and credibility that they command with the people, and the nondiscriminatory delivery of public goods and services.\u00a0 India does not believe that the efficacy or indeed the quality of democracy should be decided by word banks.\u00a0 This is an area where we look forward to a healthy exchange of views.\u00a0 There will be convergences and best practices that we can both profit by and perhaps even share with third countries.\nIndia will be taking over the presidency of the G20 at the end of this year.\u00a0 I appreciate the expression of support by Secretary Blinken towards making our chairship successful.\nOnce again, I thank the Secretary for his warm welcome, for the open and comfortable conversations we have had, and for his commitment to further what we both believe is the critical relationship of (inaudible).\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Iain Marlow of Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, we\u2019ve seen several reported leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline system that Germany has said could be an act of sabotage.\u00a0 What\u2019s the U.S. assessment of what we\u2019re seeing there, particularly given Russian \u2013 previous Russian moves to curtail gas supplies?\u00a0 And can you speak a little bit more broadly to the pressure that Europe is coming on \u2013 coming under as winter and a potential energy crisis looms?\nAnd External Affairs Minister Jaishankar, thanks for taking our questions.\u00a0 First, I\u2019m wondering if you could offer India\u2019s perspective on U.S. efforts to implement a global price cap on Russian energy.\u00a0 Would India consider joining that kind of price cap mechanism, and do you see it as potentially a way for India as well as other countries in the Global South to get more leverage and negotiate even cheaper prices for fuel?\nAnd just a second question, if I may.\u00a0 Can you talk a little bit about India\u2019s plans going forward for military hardware and equipment given the sanctions that the U.S. and others are putting on Russian industry and given India\u2019s historic reliance on Russian technology?\u00a0 How is India trying to head off challenges related to Russia being potentially unable to service that equipment going forward as a result of sanctions?\u00a0 Can Russia still fulfill all of India\u2019s requirements?\u00a0 And will India look at perhaps more purchases of, say, American or Israeli military equipment?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Iain, thanks very much.\u00a0 On the question on energy security and Nord Stream in particular, a few things.\u00a0 The leaks are under investigation.\u00a0 There are initial reports indicating that this may be the result of an attack or some kind of sabotage, but these are initial reports and we haven\u2019t confirmed that yet.\u00a0 But if it is confirmed, that\u2019s clearly in no one\u2019s interest.\u00a0 Now, my understanding is the leaks will not have a significant impact on Europe\u2019s energy resilience, and what\u2019s critical is that we are working day in, day out both on a short-term basis and a long-term basis to address energy security for Europe and, for that matter, around the world.\nShort term \u2013 just to cite a few examples \u2013 we are working on implementing the oil price cap to keep Russian oil flowing, but at a steep discount.\u00a0 That of course will deny Russia excess revenues that it would use to prosecute its aggression against Ukraine and, at the same time, as I said, keep oil flowing on world markets.\u00a0 We\u2019re working to continue to surge LNG supplies to Europe in cooperation with global partners, including in the Indo-Pacific.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that our own oil production is up by more than 500,000 barrels per day this year.\u00a0 Our LNG exports are up more than 20 percent since last year.\u00a0 In fact, we became the largest LNG supplier to the European Union and the UK this year, and we\u2019ve become the largest overall LNG exporter this year.\u00a0 And of course, as you know, we\u2019ve been tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at unprecedented levels.\u00a0 Others are doing the same.\u00a0 This is having an impact both on supply and on price.\nLong term, we\u2019re supporting efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, including LNG, over the long term, including through a task force that we established with the European Union some months ago on energy security that\u2019s working very actively, looking at ways both to reduce demand, to pursue renewables, to make the transition.\u00a0 And then we\u2019re working with global partners to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewables beyond Europe.\nIt\u2019s a long way of saying that there are clear challenges in the months ahead that we\u2019re addressing, but there is also a very significant opportunity to do two things.\u00a0 One, to finally end the dependence of Europe on Russian energy and thus the position that Europe is in of being on the receiving end of the weaponization of energy by Russia, and also to accelerate the transition to renewables and to make sure that we\u2019re addressing the climate challenge that we face.\nSo we can and we are working to do all of this in a way that provides energy security for Europeans and not only gets us through the next months, but leaves us in a better, stronger position for the years ahead.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 On the price cap, we had a brief discussion on it this morning.\u00a0 More technical people are engaged between the two systems on this particular subject.\u00a0 It is of course a G7 initiative.\u00a0 Now, you have to understand that in the last few months, the energy markets are already under very great stress.\u00a0 Countries in the Global South have found it difficult to compete for limited energy, not just in terms of pricing, escalating pricing, but often in terms of availability.\u00a0 There are tenders \u2013 countries have had tenders for which they don\u2019t even get a reply from suppliers.\nSo our concern right now is that energy markets already under stress must soften up.\u00a0 We would judge any situation, frankly, by how it affects us and other countries of the Global South because, as I communicated to the Secretary, there is a very, very deep concern in \u2013 among developing countries about how their energy security needs are addressed or not.\nOn the military equipment, to the best of my knowledge, I don\u2019t think in recent months we have faced any particular problems in terms of servicing and spare parts supply of equipment that we have got in the past from Russia.\u00a0 Whether we \u2013 where we get our military equipment and platforms from, that\u2019s not an issue, honestly, which is a new issue or an issue which has particularly changed because of geopolitical tensions.\u00a0 I think we look at possibilities across the world.\u00a0 We look at the quality of technology, the quality of capability, the terms on which that particular equipment is offered, and we exercise a choice which we believe is in our national interest.\nNow, in \u2013 if you were to look at the last 15 years, for example, you can see that we have actually procured a lot from the United States.\u00a0 If you maybe consider, for example, aircraft \u2013 the C-17, the C-130, the P-8, or the Apache helicopter or the Chinooks or the Howitzers, the M777 Howitzers \u2013 we have done so from France when we bought recently their Rafale aircraft.\u00a0 We have done so from Israel.\nSo, we have a tradition of multi-sourcing and for us, how to get the optimal deal from a competitive situation is really what this is all about.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll next turn to Lalit Jha, Trust of India.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks, Ned.\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. Minister.\u00a0 You have been associated with this India (inaudible) for decades and dealt with \u2013 for you, yeah.\u00a0 You have been dealing with this issue since \u2013 for decades and dealt multiple leadership, multiple administrations.\u00a0 What is your overall sense of the trajectory of the relationship?\nAnd Mr. Secretary, I would like to pick a few points from your opening remarks.\u00a0 First, you said there are weekly \u2013 you discussed \u2013 to strengthen the strategic partnership, and this includes helping each other.\u00a0 The recent decision of the U.S. to provide 450 million FMF sales on F-16 maintenance package certainly is not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t help India\u2019s strategic national interest.\u00a0 Everyone knows where F-16 has been used in the past and where it\u2019ll be used.\u00a0 Certainly it\u2019s not being used for counterterrorism operation.\u00a0 If you can help us understand that.\nOn India\u2019s role in Ukraine, can you give us a sense what India role \u2013 India\u2019s can play role in Ukraine peace process given that prime minister\u2019s \u2013 Modi\u2019s recent remarks to President Putin and Mexico\u2019s proposal of a three-member committee including Prime Minister Modi, His Holiness Pope, and the UN secretary-general to help resolve peace \u2013 real peace in Ukraine?\nAnd finally, on your comments on Indian Americans, you know Indian Americans have played a big role in this relationship and they are big supporters of Democratic Party, but there\u2019s frustration brewing up among this community as well because of the 700 days of visa waiting period.\u00a0 Among Indian Americans, when they ask their friends and families and pals to come from India, all the embassies and consulates are giving them next \u2013 first appointment they\u2019re getting of 2024.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Those were six questions bundled in one.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 It was very impressive, very impressive.\u00a0 I think you topped our colleague Ian, so \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, look, I think the Secretary was good enough to refer to something I said on the weekend to a group of Indian Americans and Indians who live here, which is that the big change that I have seen in my four decades as a diplomat was actually in the transformation of India-U.S. relations.\u00a0 And your question \u2013 how do I see the trajectory \u2013 quite honestly, I see today a United States very international, very much more to engaging \u2013 very much more open to engaging a country like India, which is actually thinking beyond traditional alliances, which has been very effective at finding common ground with potential or actual partners.\nAnd a very good example of all this is actually in the Quad.\u00a0 I mean, the fact was a Quad was something we tried about two decades \u2013 15 years \u2013 ago.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t work, and it is working very well today and is doing \u2013 it\u2019s grown remarkably in the course of the last two years.\u00a0 So I think for us today the relationship with the U.S. opens up a whole range of possibilities, possibilities not just with the United States, though those are important in themselves because I think at this point of time, there\u2019s so much that India \u2013 and I assume the U.S. too \u2013 stands to benefit from working with the United States for \u2013 whether it\u2019s economy, whether it\u2019s technology, whether security.\nThe \u2013 but the other part is also \u2013 I would say it\u2019s been for us a very positive experience, a very encouraging one with a lot of promise, of working with the U.S. to shape the direction of the world.\u00a0 I mean, to me that\u2019s really the big jump which we have made, and I think the more we work together, the more we engage each other, I think many more possibilities will come.\u00a0 So, very frankly, that\u2019s a long way of saying that I\u2019m very bullish about that relationship.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I can only echo, first of all, what Minister Jaishankar said.\u00a0 I think no two countries have a greater ability and, I think, opportunity and responsibility to try to shape the future of this century than the United States and India as the world\u2019s two largest democracies.\u00a0 And what is very gratifying to me is the fact that in all of these meetings, in all of these conversations in this ongoing dialogue we have, we are thinking together and working together in ways that we haven\u2019t before.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have differences.\u00a0 We do, and we will.\u00a0 But it also means that because of the depth and quality of the dialogue we have, we talk about everything and work closely together on how we can advance the agenda that we have in common, which \u2013 as you\u2019ve heard, I think, from both of us \u2013 extends to virtually every issue that is confronting our own citizens and people around the world.\nOn the specific questions you raised, on the F-16s, to be very clear \u2013 and it\u2019s important \u2013 this is a sustainment program for F-16s that Pakistan has long had.\u00a0 These are not new planes, new systems, new weapons.\u00a0 It\u2019s sustaining what they have.\u00a0 We have a responsibility and an obligation to whomever we provide military equipment to make sure that it\u2019s maintained and sustained.\u00a0 That\u2019s our obligation.\u00a0 Pakistan\u2019s program bolsters its capability to deal with terrorist threats emanating from Pakistan or from the region.\u00a0 It\u2019s in no one\u2019s interest that those threats be able to go forward with impunity, and so this capability that Pakistan has had can benefit all of us in dealing with terrorism.\nOn the question of visas, I\u2019m extremely sensitive to this.\u00a0 If it\u2019s any consolation, I can tell you that this is a challenge that we\u2019re facing around the world, and it\u2019s a product, largely, of the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 Our ability to issue visas dropped dramatically during COVID, and without boring you with all of the details, this is the one self-financing (inaudible) part of the of the State Department.\u00a0 That is, around the world, the fees that we get for issuing visas are \u2013 go to our budget and they go to our capacity to put in place the people needed to process the visas.\u00a0 When COVID hit, the demand for visas fell through the floor, visa fees went away, the system as a whole suffered.\u00a0 And then of course, in actually issuing visas, even with much more limited resources, we had constraints from COVID about the number of people we could have in our embassies at any one time, et cetera.\nWe are now building back very determinedly from that, surging resources.\u00a0 We have a plan when it comes to India to address the backlog of visas that\u2019s built up.\u00a0 I think you\u2019ll see that play out in the coming months, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re very focused on.\u00a0 These connections, these people-to-people ties \u2013 whether it\u2019s students, whether it\u2019s business people, whether it\u2019s tourists, whether it\u2019s family \u2013 this is what really links us together.\u00a0 And the last thing we want to do is make that any more difficult.\u00a0 On the contrary, we want to facilitate it.\u00a0 So bear with us.\u00a0 This will play out over the next few months, but we\u2019re very focused on it.\nFinally, India\u2019s role when it comes to Ukraine, a potential peace process.\u00a0 I really want to emphasize what Prime Minister Modi said, because I think he captured, as well as anyone I\u2019ve heard, fundamentally what this moment is about.\u00a0 As he said, this is not an era, this is not a time for war.\u00a0 We could not agree more.\u00a0 We saw the aggression, the threat of the aggression mounting from Russia against Ukraine last year.\u00a0 We warned the world about it, and we tried everything possible to avert it through diplomacy.\u00a0 Unfortunately, tragically, President Putin pursued his aggression nonetheless, and now the Ukrainian people but also the world are reaping the consequences.\nWe see this not only in the suffering of the Ukrainian people, the decimation of their country by Russian forces, but we see it also in the profound threat to the United Nations Charter that binds us together, the basic principles that are so necessary to keep peace and security around the world that came into being after two world wars.\u00a0 Sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence \u2013 they are being challenged.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeing the consequences in everything from rising food insecurity to the energy prices that we\u2019ve talked about.\nSo it\u2019s profoundly in everyone\u2019s interest for Russia to stop its aggression, but it really is incumbent upon Russia and President Putin to decide that this is what it\u2019s going to do.\u00a0 One person has the ability to stop this aggression tomorrow, and that\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 And as I said last week, if Russia stops fighting, the war ends.\u00a0 If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends, because Russia has seized territory through this aggression that makes it challenging for Ukraine to sustain its viability.\nSo this is incumbent upon President Putin.\u00a0 We are very determined that if there is any opportunity for meaningful diplomacy to try to end the war, we will be part of it. But as of this date, speaking to you today, we continue to see no signs from Russia and President Putin that they\u2019re prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy, in a negotiation that would lead to a just resolution of the aggression.\u00a0 It is on Russia, it is on President Putin, and we will see if they finally respond.\nI think it\u2019s very important, though, that voices as consequential as India\u2019s make themselves heard.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why I thought that the prime minister\u2019s comments were so significant, including as well his strong, clear support for the United Nations charter (inaudible).\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Go to Kylie Atwood, CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019ll start with Minister Jaishankar.\u00a0 Two questions for you.\u00a0 As the Secretary was saying, Prime Minister Modi said earlier this month now is not the time for war.\u00a0 Last week when you were at the United Nations, you said India is on the side of peace.\u00a0 Generally speaking, is there anything that India is actively working on, perhaps with the U.S., to push for the war in Ukraine to end?\u00a0\u00a0And then to follow up on your response to my colleague on conversations about price cap oil, you said that was briefly discussed during your meeting with the Secretary today. \u00a0But it seems that you still have concerns and right now, India is not in favor of a cap on Russian oil.\u00a0 So is that accurate, and what would change that position?\nAnd Secretary Blinken, one question on Iran and one question on Ukraine.\u00a0 With the new Treasury general licenses last week, there are still technical hurdles when it comes to getting internet to Iranians.\u00a0 So I\u2019m wondering what more the United States could do and if the United States would work with private companies, if they were to try and physically get hardware into Iran, to make sure that they could facilitate the distribution of internet to the country.\nAnd then the second question on Russia:\u00a0 What cost will the United States impose on Russia if it annexes these Ukrainian territories that are holding these so-called referendums?\u00a0 And will the U.S. still allow Ukrainian troops to use U.S. weaponry to defend against Russians in those territories, no matter what the outcome of these referendums and this \u2013 these possible annexations?\u00a0 Thank you.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0\u00a0May I?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Please.\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0\u00a0Sure.\u00a0\u00a0Well, we have taken the position privately, publicly, confidentially, consistently from February 24th that this conflict is not in anybody\u2019s interest.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve always advocated that the best way forward is to return to dialogue and diplomacy.\u00a0 Your question, are we actively working on something?\u00a0 In the past, whenever we have been able to contribute something, we have been open to it, and I remain in very active talks with a lot of my colleagues, colleagues in the G20, colleagues in the UN Security Council, some beyond.\u00a0 So just as an example, during the grain shipment discussions in the Black Sea, at that time we had been approached to also weigh in with Russia at a particularly delicate moment of those discussions, which we did.\nRight now, there are some issues.\u00a0 I had a meeting with the prime minister of Ukraine.\u00a0 He did mention some very specific concerns which he thought merited our attention, where he thought we could be of some use.\u00a0 The \u2013 I had, on a different set of issues, a discussion with the UN secretary general.\u00a0 He\u2019s been very active, as you know, on a whole lot of specific concerns pertaining to the conflict, so it\u2019s not necessarily the overarching peace prospect, but even in the current scenario, other issues which we can solve or in some way mitigate or ameliorate.\u00a0 So there was some discussion with the UN secretary general as well.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it would be right for me to kind of go into specifics at this time.\nOn do we have concerns \u2013 this is in respect to your oil question \u2013 look, we have concerns about the price of oil.\u00a0 But we are $2,000 per capita economy.\u00a0 I mean, the price of oil is breaking our back.\u00a0 I mean, that is our big concern.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Kylie, first on Iran \u2013 first things first:\u00a0 Mahsa should be alive today.\u00a0 The only reason she\u2019s not is because a brutal regime took her life and took her life because of decisions she should be making about what she would wear or not wear.\u00a0 Women in Iran have the right to wear what they want; they have the right to be free from violence; they have the right to be free from harassment.\u00a0 That\u2019s true in Iran.\u00a0 It\u2019s true \u2013 should be true everywhere.\u00a0 So for starters, Iran needs to end its use of violence against women for exercising what should be a fundamental freedom.\u00a0 And as a general proposition and in this specific instance, we stand with all of those who are exercising the universal right to peaceful protest.\nAs you noted, we\u2019ve also taken action.\u00a0 And two things I would point to:\u00a0 We designated the so-called morality police and specific individuals for human rights abuses, and that imposes sanctions on them and it would impose, as well, sanctions on anyone who seeks to in any way do business with them.\u00a0 And then more specifically to the point you raised, we announced a general license to facilitate the free flow of information inside Iran.\u00a0 So for example, what this does is it authorities companies to provide things like cloud services, privacy technology, security technology, hardware and software to enable the Iranians to better communicate among themselves and also with the rest of the world.\u00a0 Individual companies can come to us, to OFAC in this case, to determine whether their technology fits under the license, and we will certainly look for ways to facilitate technology services being made accessible to people in Iran.\nOn the question of Russia and the sham referenda and annexations that does seem to be proceeding in Ukraine \u2013 one, we\u2019ve been very clear that we are prepared and we will impose additional severe and swift costs on Russia for proceeding with the annexations.\u00a0 And again, it\u2019s important to remember what\u2019s going on here.\u00a0 Russia invaded Ukraine, seized territory, and is engaged in a diabolical scheme on some of the territory seized, where it has moved the local populous out, often through these filtration centers \u2013 where people may be deported to Russia, elsewhere in Ukraine, or they simply disappear \u2013 then they bus Russians in, they install puppet governments, and then they engage in the referendum and manipulate, in any event, the outcome to then claim that the territory belongs to Russia through annexation.\nWe and many other countries have already been crystal-clear:\u00a0 We will not \u2013 indeed, we will never \u2013 recognize the annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve also been equally clear that Ukraine has the absolute right to defend itself throughout its territory, including to take back the territory that has been illegally seized one way or another by Russia.\u00a0 And the equipment, the weapons that we and many other countries are providing them have been used very effectively to do just that, as we\u2019ve seen in northeast Ukraine and as we see as well in the south.\nAnd again, because there is no change at all in the territory that is being annexed by the Russians as a matter for us or for the Ukrainians, the Ukrainians will continue to do what they need to do to get back the land that has been taken from them.\u00a0 We will continue to support them in that effort.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Reena \u2013 from Reena Bhardwaj \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, Nazira, we don\u2019t have time \u2013 from Reena Bhardwaj, Asian News International.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Minister Jaishankar and Secretary Blinken, thank you for doing this.\u00a0 Minister Jaishankar, you\u2019ve had a very busy week at UNGA, meeting all your counterparts.\u00a0 Now, did they express their worries about Ukraine which you mentioned in your remarks, of course, but also Taiwan?\u00a0 And did you discuss the impact of these developments on the global economy with Secretary Blinken?\u00a0 How are the two countries going to work together to address these concerns?\nAnd my second question to Secretary Blinken is:\u00a0 You talked about F-16 and the obligation that the U.S. has.\u00a0 But can you further clarify what counterterror threats does Pakistan face, and why is there a need for these fighter jets?\nAlso there\u2019s a discussion with your Pakistani counterpart to improve ties with India and to make the region more stable.\u00a0 What was their response?\u00a0 You did give them an advice to maintain peace.\u00a0 What was the advice that you gave them?\nEXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:\u00a0 I had, of course, a lot of meetings in the UN that week.\u00a0 I met I guess roughly about half the delegations who were there.\u00a0 And a common concern among them was the anxiety about global economic volatility, an anxiety about sharply increased energy prices, of food inflation and food availability, of fertilizers which will impact food next year, of disrupted trade, of shipping, of insurance, of air-land movements, of travel.\u00a0 So this was, honestly, not an optimistic global mood which you got from your colleagues.\u00a0 And I think in particular the \u2013 what impact the consequences of the Ukraine conflict has been on many of these issues we \u2013 I spoke about, and also I think the prospect of instability on \u2013 in the Indo-Pacific, because today Asia and the Indo-Pacific is so central to global trade and in \u2013 particularly in some very critical areas.\nSo these were very widely prevalent concerns.\u00a0 We had a good discussion about it yesterday evening, and we do think today \u2013 I mean, I speak for India, but I also speak to some degree for the relationship having an impact on the world \u2013 we think the right thing today is to find ways of stabilizing the global economy, of softening prices, of making sure that global trade and \u2013 is more predictable, that the sources of anxieties and tensions are less.\u00a0 Because at the end of the day, that\u2019s really \u2013 Prime Minister Modi of course said this is not an era of war.\u00a0 But this is an era of \u2013 where we seek development, where we seek prosperity, where we seek progress, and I think India nationally and India through its key partners would like to do more to strengthen those trends.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 On the question of the F-16s, again \u2013 and it\u2019s important to be very clear \u2013 this is, as I said, about sustaining an existing program, not adding a new one, and we have a responsibility to do that wherever we\u2019re engaged in the provision of defense equipment like F\u201116s.\u00a0 And second, as to what these are for, there are clear terrorism threats that continue to emanate from Pakistan itself as well as from neighboring countries.\u00a0 And whether it is TTP that may be targeting Pakistan, whether it\u2019s ISIS-Khorasan, whether it\u2019s al-Qaida, I think the threats are clear, well-known, and we all have an interest in making sure that we have the means to deal with them.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this is about.\nMore broadly, we always encourage our friends to resolve their differences through diplomacy, through dialogue.\u00a0 That hasn\u2019t changed.\u00a0 It won\u2019t change.\u00a0 It would not be appropriate for me to characterize Pakistan\u2019s response, just as I wouldn\u2019t characterize our friend\u2019s response in a similar conversation.\nThank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\n\n"}, {"url":

Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 And it is a pleasure to be here to celebrate.\u00a0 It\u2019s also important to be here in this moment for Pakistan, for our friends, not only to celebrate but to support and to work in partnership.\u00a0 And I want to talk a little bit about that, but Foreign Minister, Bilawal, thank you for being here.\u00a0 I am so delighted to see you once again, to see you here at the State Department.\u00a0 We just had a very good, extensive conversation about so many things that we\u2019re working on together, and I\u2019ll touch on a couple of them.\u00a0 But I\u2019m particularly grateful for your presence today with us.\nAnd Dilawar, I just want to thank you not only for those words but for your extraordinary leadership every single day.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for it and it\u2019s making a difference, making a difference around the world.\u00a0 Our trade, our commercial, our economic policies are all designed to try to deliver for American workers and families, but also at the same time for our partners.\u00a0 And you\u2019re making that work, so thank you.\nAnd to everyone here today, whether you\u2019re here from the business community, the philanthropic community, NGOs, alumni of some of our exchange programs, current participants in those programs, the Pakistani diaspora, welcome, welcome, welcome to the State Department, and welcome to this wonderful institution that\u2019s part of the State Department.\u00a0 The museum has \u2013 continues to grow, as you\u2019ve heard from Susan.\u00a0 I hope you have an opportunity if you haven\u2019t already to take a look upstairs to see some of the exhibits that are already there but more much to come in the years to come.\nSo we are meeting at what is a tremendously difficult moment for Pakistan.\u00a0 And as you\u2019ve heard \u2013 the statistic about the expectant mothers I had not heard.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2013 in and of itself tells you all that you need to know.\u00a0 But the fact is a third of the country remains underwater after the historic and catastrophic storms.\u00a0 About 33 million people are affected.\u00a0 Farmers whose entire harvests have been literally submerged.\u00a0 Families whose homes have been washed away.\u00a0 Children whose schools have been ravaged.\nThat has an immediate impact, but unless we\u2019re able together to deal with the challenges, will have a long-term impact as well.\u00a0 So we have a sense of urgency, but we also have a sense of determination.\u00a0 The United States \u2013 all Americans \u2013 extend our deepest condolences and sympathy to our friends in Pakistan, and we send a simple message:\u00a0 We are here for Pakistan just as we\u2019ve been during past natural disasters, both to meet the immediate needs and, as I said, looking ahead to rebuild.\u00a0 And this is something that we talked about just a short while ago.\nSo far, as you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019ve marshaled over $56 million in immediate humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been able to send about 17 planes full of supplies like food and materials to build shelters, tents, tarps.\u00a0 And today I\u2019m pleased to announce another $10 million in food security assistance, which will provide \u2013 (applause) \u2013 this will provide urgent supplies to help farmers recover, like seeds and fertilizer, assistance repairing critical irrigation infrastructure damaged by the floods.\nThese efforts, though, are bolstered significantly by the extraordinary generosity of the Pakistani American community and the U.S. private sector, which together contributed another 27 million in essential goods and services \u2013 food, water, medicine, health care.\nWe will continue to stand by Pakistan, to stand by its people, today and in the days to come, because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done for each other in both directions through much of our shared history.\u00a0 It is fitting today that we\u2019re meeting here at the National Museum of American Diplomacy in the Harry S Truman Building.\u00a0 In 1947, shortly after Pakistan\u2019s independence, President Truman sent a congratulatory letter to Governor-General Jinnah, a leader that he called the originator of the dream that became Pakistan and launched diplomatic relations between our countries that we celebrate now in their 75th year.\nFor decades, we in the United States have been enriched by the culture of Pakistan, through the poetry of Allama Iqbal, to the songs of the legendary Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and a recent Grammy Award winner, Arooj Aftab.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I have to say that we are profoundly, profoundly better off for the immeasurable contributions of Pakistani Americans as civic leaders in their communities, as U.S. soldiers on the battlefield, and across literally every part of our society.\u00a0 They excel in every walk of professional life from medicine to science to engineering to business to government.\u00a0 Pakistan and the United States have worked together to complete incredibly significant development projects like the Mangla and Tarbela dams, which at one time provided some 70 percent of Pakistan\u2019s power.\nWe\u2019ve been able together to launch top academic institutions like the Lahore University for Management Sciences, which is training the next generation of business leaders.\u00a0 And we have worked together to confront global threats.\nWe continue to work closely on counterterrorism issues.\u00a0 We have a shared stake in Afghanistan\u2019s future after two decades of war.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had our differences; that\u2019s no secret.\u00a0 But we share a common objective: a more stable, a more peaceful, and free future for all of Afghanistan and for those across the broader region.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to work together toward that end as well as support the basic human rights of the Afghan people, especially women and girls.\nIn our discussions today, we talked about the importance of managing a responsible relationship with India, and I also urged our colleagues to engage China on some of the important issues of debt relief and restructure so that Pakistan can more quickly recover from the floods.\u00a0 We spoke, too, about the importance of meeting our commitments as democracies, upholding core values like respect for freedom of religion, belief, freedom of expression.\nWe also, critically, talked about ways that we\u2019re deepening our relationship across a number of critical areas, and I just want to spend a quick minute on those, starting with the economic ties that you heard Dilawar speak about just a few minutes ago.\u00a0 I am convinced, we are convinced, that even with some of the positive numbers you\u2019ve heard \u2013 the fact that we had a $600 million increase despite COVID is significant, but we\u2019re convinced that we can do more, much more.\nOne of the most important ways to spur economic growth and prosperity is, for example, through empowering women and girls and ensuring that they can participate fully in the economy.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way not only to help them reach their full potential but to help the economy in the country reach its.\u00a0 It\u2019s also the right thing to do.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019ve supported that goal for the past decade through something you\u2019ve heard referenced, the U.S.-Pakistan Women\u2019s Council, a platform that, as many of you know from having helped create it, fosters cooperation between corporations, philanthropy, civil society from both countries to advance women\u2019s empowerment in Pakistan.\nThrough one of their projects, the Pakistan Million Women\u2019s Mentor Initiative, companies like S&P Global, Deloitte, Citi, and others have provided skills training and mentorship for more than 10,000 women entrepreneurs over just the past year alone.\u00a0 And that\u2019s remarkable in and of itself; I am convinced that the ripple effects from that next year, in five years, in 10 years, in 20 years, are going to be significant.\nBut I think we also both believe deeply that at the heart of our relationship are our people-to-people ties.\u00a0 They continue to grow; they need to grow even stronger.\u00a0 We continue to run 19 Lincoln Corners throughout Pakistan, where more than 300,000 Pakistanis come every year to learn about the United States; to debate ways to improve our society, to both of our societies; to watch some classic American movies, everything from Zootopia to Wreck-It Ralph \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 sometimes all in the same day.\u00a0 It\u2019s something I\u2019d actually like to be able to do.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Maybe we can find time to break away and catch a movie.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd we have a thriving network of more than 37,000 alumni of our cultural programs, our exchange programs, throughout Pakistan.\u00a0 They\u2019re making exceptional contributions to the sciences and business and through public service.\u00a0 In fact, as I said, we\u2019re fortunate this afternoon to be joined by several current Fulbright scholars and participants in our International Visitors Leadership Program.\u00a0 We had a chance to meet them briefly before.\u00a0 If you\u2019re here, would you just stand up for a minute?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThese friends are the future of the relationship, and I\u2019m convinced that the exchange programs that we have will mean that for years to come, decades to come, generations to come, the relationship will be strong and will grow even stronger.\u00a0 So we\u2019re really grateful for your presence here today, but especially for your participation in these programs.\nThe alumni that we\u2019ve seen in our programs have done and continue to do really remarkable things in giving back to their societies, to their countries: standing up for the needs of Pakistanis with disabilities, increasing women\u2019s involvement in politics and policy making, providing counseling and health services to displaced people across Pakistan, and so much more.\u00a0 And now they\u2019re in the United States to work on things like advocacy strategies to be even more effective \u2013 if that\u2019s possible \u2013 in the work they\u2019re doing, but also to share their knowledge, their experience, their perspectives with American students.\nThis is profoundly a two-way street, and one of the things that I love about the exchange programs is, quite honestly, we get more out of them than anyone else.\u00a0 We are learning through the experiences that are being shared, through the perspectives that are being shared, through the knowledge that\u2019s being shared.\u00a0 So thank you for that as well, because it\u2019s making a difference here in the United States.\nUltimately, it\u2019s connections like these that give me the most hope for the future of this relationship.\u00a0 Our people learn with and from one another so that we can make both of our countries better and deliver even more effectively for our people.\nThis is a resilient relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s capable of overcoming challenges that we\u2019ve had to confront.\u00a0 And I am convinced that an even brighter future lies ahead, one that everyone in this room quite literally will be essential to realizing.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re counting on all of you to do, to continue to do.\u00a0 So thank you for all of the work that you do to further this noble goal and for the work that you\u2019ll continue to do to build upon the friendship between Pakistan and the United States.\nNow it is my great pleasure and an honor to hand the microphone over to my friend, the foreign minister of Pakistan.\u00a0 Bilawal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER BHUTTO ZARDARI:\u00a0 (In Urdu.)\n(In English). It is an absolute honor and a privilege to be here today at the State Department and addressing not only our friends from the U.S. Government but the Pakistani American community.\u00a0 And I\u2019m pleased to report, for all those watching back home and everybody witnessing over here, that it is indeed true, indeed true, that diplomacy is back both here at the State Department \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and in the foreign ministry of Pakistan.\nIt has always been a pleasure speaking to the Secretary of State, engaging with the Secretary of State, but I come here at a different time.\u00a0 And I come here at a time when the ground realities in Pakistan have changed fundamentally.\u00a0 We have experienced a climate catastrophe of biblical, apocalyptic proportions.\u00a0 It rained and rained and rained and rained and rained from mid-June till the end of August.\u00a0 And when the rain finally stopped, a hundred-kilometer lake formed in the middle of my country that\u2019s slowly descending to the sea, to the ocean.\nAs a result, a third of my country under water, more than the land mass of the United Kingdom; 33 million people \u2013 more than the population of Australia, more than the population of New Zealand, more than the population of New York State, or 95 percent of the population of Canada.\u00a0 As Dilawar said, 600,000 women, pregnant women, are waiting to give birth in the open.\u00a0 Of the 33 million people affected, 16 million are children.\u00a0 Of the 1,600 deaths that we\u2019ve had so far, a third of them have been children.\nAnd Mr. Secretary of State, the irony of this is that Pakistan has contributed 0.8 percent to the global carbon output, but we are amongst the 10 most climate-stressed countries on the planet.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we look to you for assistance and support so we can get our people climate justice.\u00a0 I think that your president has shown incredible leadership when it comes to the issue of climate both here domestically and congratulate him and your administration on the historic legislation that has been passed at home, but it\u2019s not only important that you build back better here.\u00a0 The opportunity in this crisis in Pakistan is that we must build back better, greener, more climate-resilient back home as well.\nAnd I believe that working together we can do this, working together not only with the Government of the United States and our friends in the international community.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with the private sector, working with the private sector here in the United States and working with the private sector at home.\u00a0 I am convinced that we can build back.\u00a0 We will build a more climate-resilient Pakistan.\u00a0 We will build a greener Pakistan.\u00a0 We will create green opportunities and green jobs, and opportunities not only for our country and not only for our private sector, but for those across the world that will be willing to invest in Pakistan.\nMr. Secretary of State, when my grandfather was the foreign minster of Pakistan \u2013 the commerce minister of Pakistan, the foreign minister of Pakistan, and then the prime minister of Pakistan \u2013 there was what was called the Green Revolution, and that Mangla Dam and Tarbela Dam that you mentioned \u2013 those massive infrastructure projects \u2013 they\u2019re from the 1960s and the 1970s.\u00a0 It is \u2013 now it is the time for a new Green Revolution, and we hope \u2013 nay, we expect \u2013 the American Government, particularly led by President Biden, to lead the way.\u00a0 I think that despite the devastation, despite the destruction, this is the opportunity \u2013 nay, this is the challenge \u2013 for us to be able to act.\u00a0 And we\u2019re incredibly grateful to the U.S. Government for their initial $1 million, then $33 million, then $55 million and today, after your announcement of the $10 million, we have reached the $60 million mark.\nWe\u2019ve been incredibly engaged ever since I\u2019ve been foreign minister with yourself, with your administration.\u00a0 We\u2019re incredibly grateful to Mr. Dilawar Syed, (inaudible), Samantha Power, the congressional delegation, everybody that has come and visited Pakistan so far, and we look forward to the opportunity of hosting you someday soon.\nI absolutely agree that the Pakistan-U.S. relationship is not only resilient, we have stood the test of time.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve proved throughout history that when we work together, we achieve great things.\u00a0 And I believe that when we don\u2019t work together, then we fumble, then we falter, then things go wrong.\u00a0 And I would like the opportunity to once again not only thank you but thank your incredibly hardworking team that have been working with their counterparts, who are also incredibly hardworking, around the clock and that we\u2019ve managed to make this progress and enhance the cooperation between the United States and America[i].\nAnd the sky is the limit.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been engaging with the private sector, particularly those of the Pakistani American community, and they are patriotic Pakistanis and they are patriotic Americans, and they contribute here to America and they are keen to contribute to Pakistan.\u00a0 This is a challenge for the new generation.\u00a0 I believe our relationship that\u2019s in the past is the legacy of the leadership of the past, and now it is a test for us that how we take this relationship forward.\u00a0 Here\u2019s to another 75 years of Pakistan-U.S. relationships. \u00a0(In Urdu).

Foreign Minister Kwape; and Foreign Minister Momen, thank you for your partnership.\u00a0 To everyone joining us today, thank you for your continued dedication to ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and thank you for working to strengthen our global health systems so we can better prevent, detect, and respond to future health threats.\nSince we launched the Global Action Plan seven months ago, we\u2019ve made significant progress toward our goals.\u00a0 Consider vaccinations:\u00a0 Last September, only 13 percent of the people in lower-middle-income countries were vaccinated against COVID-19.\u00a0 Today, that number has more than quadrupled to 56 percent.\u00a0 For our part, the United States has provided more than 620 million vaccine doses to 116 countries and economies, all with no strings attached.\u00a0 So many of you have helped contribute to the vaccination efforts too, but we still have more work to do to address the equity gap in global vaccinations and protect people at risk of severe illness.\nTo close that gap, this pandemic taught us the importance of expanding access to critical medical supplies.\u00a0 We need to shift COVID-19 care from being offered primarily in emergency facilities.\u00a0 That care should be integrated into routine services.\u00a0 That will make vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics more accessible.\u00a0 Similarly, we have to close gaps in our global health infrastructure.\nToday, I am proud to announce three new initiatives that will help us close that gap and make more \u2013 make care more equitable around the world.\u00a0 First, I am pleased to announce today that USAID with the Global Fund and other partners will launch test-to-treat pilot programs in ten countries.\nThese programs will help people get screened for COVID-19 when they have symptoms and receive antiviral medications if they test positive.\u00a0 These programs will also help people avoid severe illness, reduce hospitalizations, and save lives.\u00a0 USAID will work with governments, public health experts, and civil society to make this happen.\u00a0 As we implement these programs, we will track lessons learned with our foreign partners.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll share these lessons with countries around the world, including our providers in the United States.\nSecond, we\u2019re improving access to medical oxygen.\u00a0 Medical oxygen is critical for treating patients with severe COVID-19, and it will help to prepare for health crises to come.\u00a0 Since the pandemic began, oxygen supplies have been put under strain around the world.\u00a0 And even before the pandemic, only roughly half \u2013 half \u2013 of inpatient facilities in Africa had reliable access to medical oxygen.\nThe United States has committed $50 million to tackle this problem.\u00a0 That includes purchasing oxygen, installing storage tanks, and upgrading the physical infrastructure for delivering oxygen, like the piping that brings it to the patients\u2019 bedsides.\u00a0 We\u2019re also helping lower the cost of oxygen for governments across Africa, where prices can be ten times higher than in the United States.\u00a0 We\u2019re starting with nine governments, supporting their negotiations with the private sector to develop market-based approaches.\u00a0 Increasing access to affordable oxygen will also support other global health programs like those that address child and adult pneumonia, safe birth, safe surgery, and new infectious disease outbreaks.\nThird and finally, we\u2019re establishing an implementation group to improve global health access to medical supplies and services through the global clearinghouse mechanism.\u00a0 Our hope is to make supply chains more resilient, efficient, and equitable.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen throughout this pandemic access to these essential supplies can mean the difference between life and death.\nSo together with our GAP partners, the public sector, and the private sector, we will set up a new platform.\u00a0 This platform will bring together countries, medical supply manufacturers, critical components producers, and large procurement agencies.\u00a0 Our goal will be clear: to match surpluses in supplies with those who need them when they need them.\u00a0 We\u2019re aiming to launch this platform next year, and we\u2019re hoping other countries will join us.\u00a0 These efforts are only the latest ways we\u2019re combating COVID-19 and building more resilient global health systems.\u00a0 So let\u2019s continue to work together and let\u2019s do everything in our power to make the world safer, to make the world healthier, and free from pandemics for all.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-with-australian-foreign-minister-penny-wong-indian-external-affairs-minister-dr-subrahmanyam-jaishankar-and-japanese-foreign-minister-hayashi-yoshimasa-before-their-meet/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Palace Hotel", "location": "New York, New York", "date": "September 22, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Jose, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thanks for bringing us together.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to see everyone here.\u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to come together this afternoon.\nTo each of you, both those from the Mineral Security Partnership countries and those from minerals-producing countries, this is I think one of those sessions where, as we say, it gets real.\u00a0 This makes a difference, a concrete difference, and we\u2019re very anxious to hear especially from all of you today.\nLet me just say a few words at the top about why we\u2019re here.\nIn June, the United\u00a0States,\u00a0along with several key partners,\u00a0many\u00a0of\u00a0whom\u00a0are here today, launched this partnership\u00a0because\u00a0we recognize\u00a0that critical mineral supply chains are simply vital to our shared future.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s an understanding that is getting more and more widespread and deeply rooted in all of our countries.\nAs everyone in this room knows very well, we face a profound climate crisis\u00a0that requires us to\u00a0transition to clean energy technologies, like\u00a0electric vehicles, like solar, like wind power, which offer us an\u00a0effective\u00a0way to\u00a0both\u00a0cut carbon emissions\u00a0and create good-paying jobs.\nCritical minerals are at the heart of this transition.\u00a0 They\u2019re essential components of\u00a0the technologies that will power our clean energy future, like\u00a0electric\u00a0vehicles and batteries, wind turbines, solar panels.\nTo ensure that these technologies can actually be deployed quickly, we know that we have to build\u00a0resilient, diverse, and secure critical mineral supply chains\u00a0by supporting more successful critical mineral\u00a0projects.\u00a0 So this, I think, is a shared understanding and one that we are brought together to work on.\nAnother objective of this partnership, the Minerals Security Partnership, is to support projects that adhere to high environmental, social, and governance standards.\u00a0 We want to make this a race to the top, not a race to the bottom.\nToo often, the relationship between minerals-producing and minerals-purchasing countries has been\u00a0extractive and characterized by abusive working conditions.\u00a0 Often,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0left\u00a0behind environmental degradation and devastated communities.\nWe want to\u00a0break this cycle through meaningful collaboration and consultation with\u00a0local communities near mining sites, and especially with groups that have historically been neglected.\u00a0 And we aim to make sure that\u00a0minerals-rich\u00a0countries benefit from all stages of the value chain, from extraction to processing to recycling.\u00a0 That\u2019s ultimately how we can make sure that\u00a0each project\u00a0actually serves\u00a0your\u00a0communities and uplifts your citizens.\nNow, we\u2019re\u00a0already beginning\u00a0to see new projects that are supporting economic growth on all sides.\u00a0 Just to cite one example, a graphite mine in\u00a0Balama, Mozambique, which employs hundreds of local workers, contributes millions of dollars in community development, and undermines the aims of those who would sow conflict.\u00a0 The graphite from this mine\u00a0will\u00a0soon be\u00a0sent for further processing\u00a0to\u00a0a plant in Louisiana, where it will create more jobs and where it will\u00a0provide\u00a0graphite used for batteries by American electric vehicle companies.\nThe United States\u00a0and our MSP partners\u00a0stand ready\u00a0to\u00a0support you as we make more of these projects a reality.\u00a0 That\u2019s, as I say, where it really gets real, where we\u2019re turning the goals of this partnership into practical projects.\nNow what that support will look like varies, of course, from project to project.\u00a0 For some\u00a0projects, it could mean that the United\u00a0States\u00a0or a partner country helps with reducing the risk of the project,\u00a0including by providing a loan guarantee or\u00a0debt financing.\u00a0 And I know that the chair of Export-Import Bank, Chair Lewis, will have a lot more to say about that in a few minutes.\u00a0 For other\u00a0projects, it could mean connecting companies with our countries\u2019 private sectors or\u00a0supporting them with technical assistance through our embassies.\nWe understand that minerals production and processing\u00a0requires lots of\u00a0investment and\u00a0undertaking lots of risk.\u00a0 Through the MSP, we are committed to helping with both.\nSo mostly what we want to do today is to hear from everyone here how we can work more closely together on our shared goals, what challenges you\u2019re facing as you develop these resources, what opportunities are there that you see that are not being fully realized, and how can the United States and other MSP partners\u00a0help advance your critical minerals industries.\u00a0 Those are the questions I\u2019d like to begin with putting on the table, and mostly I\u2019m eager to hear from all of you.\nSo we look forward\u00a0to\u00a0deepening\u00a0the partnership in the months ahead.\u00a0 This is something that I think can make a profound difference on something that is \u2013 the word \u201ccritical\u201d is attached to critical energy minerals.\u00a0 This really is critical, and we\u2019re grateful for everyone being here today and for the work that we\u2019re doing every day together.\nLet me stop there.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken at the United Nations Security Council Ministerial Meeting on Ukrainian Sovereignty and Russian Accountability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "United Nations Headquarters", "location": "New York, New York", "date": "September 22, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Madam President, for having brought this council together at this very grave moment of the crisis of the war of Russia on Ukraine.\n(In English)\u00a0Mr. Secretary General, thank you for your determination and the moral clarity that you\u2019ve brought to ending this brutal war and defending the UN\u2019s core principles, and also for your personal engagement in securing the vital Black Sea route for grain to flow once again from Ukraine.\nMr. Khan, we\u2019re grateful for the efforts of the Office of the Prosecutor to investigate objectively and professionally the atrocities being committed in Ukraine by Russian forces, and for its support for \u2013 and coordination with \u2013 Ukrainian investigators and prosecutors.\nWe hear a lot about the divisions among countries at the United Nations.\u00a0 But recently, what is striking is the remarkable unity among member-states when it comes to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Leaders from countries developing and developed, big and small, north and south have spoken in the General Assembly about the consequences of this war and the need to end it.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve called on all of us to reaffirm our commitment to the UN Charter and its core principles, including sovereignty, territorial integrity, human rights.\nEven a number of nations that maintain close ties with Moscow have said publicly that they have serious questions and concerns about President Putin\u2019s ongoing invasion.\nRather than change course, however, President Putin has doubled down \u2013 choosing not to end the war but to expand it; not to pull troops back but to call 300,000 additional troops up; not to ease tensions but to escalate them through the threat of nuclear weapons; not to work toward a diplomatic solution but to render such a solution impossible by seeking to annex more Ukrainian territory through sham referenda.\nThat President Putin picked this week, as most of the world gathers at the United Nations, to add fuel to the fire that he started, shows his utter contempt for the UN Charter, for the General Assembly, and for this council.\nThe very international order that we have gathered here to uphold is being shredded before our eyes.\u00a0 We cannot \u2013 we will not \u2013 allow President Putin to get away with it.\nDefending Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity is about much more than standing up for one nation\u2019s right to choose its own path, fundamental as that right is.\u00a0 It\u2019s also about protecting an international order where no nation can redraw the borders of another by force.\nIf we fail to defend this principle when the Kremlin is so flagrantly violating it, we send a message to aggressors everywhere that they can ignore it, too.\u00a0 We put every country at risk.\u00a0 We open the door to a less secure, a less peaceful world.\nWe see what that world looks like in the parts of Ukraine controlled by Russian forces.\u00a0 Wherever the Russian tide recedes, we discover the horror that\u2019s left in its wake.\nI had a window into that horror myself when I traveled to Irpin just a few weeks ago to meet with the Ukrainian investigators who are compiling evidence of war crimes committed there.\u00a0 I saw up close the gaping holes left in residential buildings by Russian shelling \u2013 indiscriminate at best, intentional at worst.\nAs we assemble here, Ukrainian and international investigators continue to exhume bodies outside of Izyum, a city Russian forces controlled for six months before they were driven out by a Ukrainian counteroffensive.\u00a0 One site contains some 440 unmarked graves.\u00a0 A number of the bodies unearthed there so far reportedly show signs of torture, including one victim with broken arms and a rope around his neck.\nSurvivors\u2019 accounts are also emerging, including a man who described being tortured by Russian forces for a dozen days, during which his interrogators repeatedly electrocuted him and, in his words, and I quote, \u201cbeat me to the point where I didn\u2019t feel anything,\u201d end quote.\nThese are not the acts of rogue units.\u00a0 They fit a clear pattern across the territory controlled by Russian forces.\nThis is one of the many reasons that we support a range of national and international efforts to collect and examine the mounting evidence of war crimes in Ukraine.\u00a0 We must hold the perpetrators accountable for these crimes.\nIt\u2019s also one of the reasons why more than 40 nations have come together to help the Ukrainian people defend themselves, a right that is enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.\nThe more setbacks Russian forces endure on the battlefield, the greater the pain they are inflicting on Ukrainian civilians.\u00a0 Russian attacks on dams, on bridges, on power stations, on hospitals, on other civilian infrastructure are increasing, constituting a brazen violation of international humanitarian law.\nThis week, President Putin said that Russia would not hesitate to use, and I quote,\u00a0 \u201call weapons systems available,\u201d end quote, in response to a threat to its territorial integrity, a threat that is all the more menacing given Russia\u2019s intention to annex large swaths of Ukraine in the days ahead.\u00a0 When that\u2019s complete, we can expect President Putin will claim any Ukrainian effort to liberate this land as an attack on so-called \u201cRussian territory.\u201d\nThis from a country that in January of this year, in this place, joined other permanent members of the Security Council in signing a statement affirming that, and I quote, \u201cnuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.\u201d\u00a0 Yet another example of how Russia violates the commitments it\u2019s made before this body, and yet another reason why nobody should take Russia at its word today.\nEvery council member should send a clear message that these reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately.\nRussia\u2019s effort to annex more Ukrainian territory is another dangerous escalation, as well as a repudiation of diplomacy.\nIt is even more alarming when coupled with the filtration operation that Russian forces have been carrying out across parts of Ukraine that they control.\u00a0 Now, this is a diabolical strategy, violently uprooting thousands of Ukrainians, bus in Russians to replace them, call a vote, manipulate the results to show near unanimous support for joining the Russian Federation.\u00a0 This is right out of the Crimea playbook.\nAs with Crimea, it\u2019s imperative that every member of this council, and for that matter, every member of the United Nations reject the sham referenda and unequivocally declare that all Ukrainian territory is and will remain part of Ukraine, and no Russian claim to annex territory can take away Ukraine\u2019s right to defend its own land.\nPutin\u2019s invasion is also distracting this council \u2013 in fact, the entire UN system \u2013 from working on the serious issues that we all want to focus on.\u00a0 Like preventing a climate catastrophe, aiding tens of millions of people on the brink of famine, fulfilling the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, shoring up our interconnected health security \u2013 all issues that make a tangible difference in the lives of the citizens that we are here to represent, and that they are looking to us \u2013 looking to us to deliver on.\nThe overwhelming majority of UN member-states are committed to working together on these issues, and our actions show that.\nYet while more than a hundred countries have signed on to a roadmap to provide food aid to those who need it, and partners across Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe are working together to increase the resilience of global food systems, Russia for months blocked the export of Ukrainian grain to the world, until the United Nations and Turkey secured a deal to let the grain go.\u00a0 And Russia continues to bomb and seize Ukrainian farms and silos, line its wheat fields with landmines, raising the cost of food for people everywhere.\nAnd while governments around the world are teaming up with international organizations, with the private sector, with philanthropies to end this pandemic and make sure that we\u2019re better prepared for the next one, Russia is spreading misinformation and disinformation about WHO-approved vaccines \u2013 fueling vaccine hesitancy that puts people in all our countries at greater risk.\nHere is the reality: None of us chose this war.\u00a0 Not the Ukrainians, who knew the crushing toll it would take.\u00a0 Not the United States, which warned that it was coming and worked to prevent it.\u00a0 Not the vast majority of countries at the United Nations.\nAnd neither did our people, or the people of virtually every UN member-state, who are feeling the war\u2019s consequences in greater food insecurity and higher energy prices.\nNor did the Russian mothers and fathers whose children are being sent off to fight and die in this war, or the Russian citizens who continue to risk their freedom to protest against it, including those who came out into the streets of Moscow after President Putin announced his mobilization to chant, \u201cLet our children live!\u201d\nIndeed, it must be asked:\u00a0 How has this aggression against Ukraine by President Putin improved the lives or prospects of a single Russian citizen?\nOne man chose this war.\u00a0 One man can end it.\nBecause if Russia stops fighting, the war ends.\u00a0 If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.\nThat\u2019s why we will continue to support Ukraine as it defends itself, and strengthen its hand to achieve a diplomatic solution on just terms at a negotiating table.\u00a0 As President Zelenskyy has said repeatedly, diplomacy is the only way to end this war.\u00a0 But diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a settlement that cuts against the UN Charter, or rewards Russia for violating it.\nPresident Putin is making his choice.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s up to all of our countries to make ours.\nTell President Putin to stop the horror that he started.\u00a0 Tell him to stop putting his interests above the interests of the rest of the world, including his own people.\u00a0 Tell him to stop debasing this council and everything it stands for.\n\u201cWe the people[s] of the United Nations determined\u2026\u201d\u00a0 That is how the preamble of the UN Charter starts.\u00a0 Let\u2019s not forget that \u201cwe the peoples\u201d still get to choose the fate of this institution and our world.\u00a0 The stakes are clear.\u00a0 The choice is ours.\u00a0 Let\u2019s make the right choice for the world that we want and that our people so desperately deserve.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

many are already acting on those commitments.\u00a0 Action is crucial because the current crisis is one that no individual country or even group of countries can solve alone.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here together.\u00a0 The work before us is clear.\nFirst, we have to get emergency aid to the people who need it.\u00a0 Since February, the United States has provided more than $6.1 billion in humanitarian assistance and $2.3 billion in development aid to combat hunger and strengthen food security.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019re consistently the largest donor to the World Food Program, providing more than half of all contributions.\u00a0 Some countries with the capacity to do more are among those doing the least.\u00a0 That needs to change.\u00a0 And no matter what countries have done so far, every country is called upon to do more.\u00a0 Tomorrow, the United States will do just that when President Biden announces new assistance from the United States.\nAnother way that we can support immediate relief is by pushing for an extension of the deal that the United Nations and Turkey brokered between Russia and Ukraine, which has allowed for grain and other agricultural products to be exported from Black Sea ports.\u00a0 Now, that agreement should never have been necessary in the first place.\u00a0 The only reason it was is because Russia, having invaded Ukraine, was then blockading its ports and preventing food that had been feeding the world from getting out.\nBut we had to deal with the reality before us, and the deal that was brokered by the United Nations with Turkey\u2019s assistance actually enabled the grain to start moving again.\u00a0 And as you heard from my colleagues, despite some of the misinformation that continues to come from Moscow, that grain and other food products are getting where they need to go: to the countries most in need, predominantly in the Global South.\u00a0 It\u2019s also helped lower food prices around the world.\u00a0 So it needs to keep going; it needs to be renewed.\u00a0 That is urgent.\nSecond, we have to strengthen global food systems and help countries develop the capacity to produce their own food so that we can prevent new crises and build resilience to further shocks.\u00a0 You heard President Sall say it very eloquently:\u00a0 We need durable agricultural production.\u00a0 We have to respond to the emergency, but we also have to set ourselves up for the long term.\nBack in May, when we hosted the food ministerial, many of our African colleagues especially made clear that as much as they needed emergency relief, what they really needed was more investment in agricultural innovation, sustainability, self-sufficiency.\u00a0 I am convinced from the time that I\u2019ve spent recently in a number of countries in Africa the capacity is there, but it needs help, and we need to help.\u00a0 We have heard that call.\nOver the next five years, the United States will work with our Congress to invest over $11 billion worldwide toward this goal of durable agricultural production.\u00a0 Last month, we aided \u2013 we added eight new African partners to Feed the Future.\u00a0 This is our flagship program to broaden social safety nets, to strengthen food systems, to improve nutrition.\u00a0 Many of those countries are represented here today.\u00a0 Investments like these are also critical to adapting to the growing effects of the climate crisis that we\u2019re seeing across the globe, from the droughts in the Horn of Africa to the floods in Pakistan.\nThird, we need to better coordinate our efforts \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard this, again, already this afternoon \u2013 across governments, across regional bodies, across foundations, across NGOs, across multilateral organizations, and others.\u00a0 It\u2019s true there are a multiplicity of initiatives.\u00a0 We need to make sure that they are acting, working together, that all of this is coherent and all of this is coordinated.\nOne way that we can do that is to ensure that sanctions do not impair access to food or medicine in any country beyond just Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 And to that end, the United States intends to work with other Security Council members to ensure that food, medicine, humanitarian assistance are always carved out across UN sanctions regimes.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also expand efforts to ensure such humanitarian authorizations are included across U.S. domestic sanctions programs.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we\u2019re already doing, but we need to do this in a consistent way.\nWe can also make clear that our food security efforts are more transparent.\u00a0 The United States will soon publish a report tracking our progress toward hitting the goals in the roadmap that we put out in May, from boosting assistance levels to launching new programs like the Caribbean Zero Hunger Plan, which was created with CARICOM and the Dominican Republic.\u00a0 And we urge others to publish their own reports so that, again, we can better fill gaps and avoid duplication among us.\nThis unprecedented gathering and the leaders\u2019 declaration that we produced is another way that we\u2019re strengthening our cooperation.\u00a0 I hope that all countries here consider it and endorse it and encourage others to do so as well.\nBut maybe most important, beyond what we say, is, of course, what we do \u2013 not only for the good of the people around the world bearing the brunt of this crisis, but also because the health, the stability, the wellbeing of our people depends on the food security that we build together.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the microphone over to our colleague, President Petro of Colombia.\u00a0 Mr. President, the floor is yours.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-usaid-democracy-delivers-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Transparency, anticorruption, rule of law, all of these \u2013 you know this \u2013 create a more level playing field for businesses to compete.\u00a0 And countries that respect human rights and labor rights tend to be more stable and more reliable partners \u2013 especially in a crisis, as we\u2019ve experienced through COVID-19.\nThe private sector, in turn, has extraordinary expertise in many of the areas where emerging democracies need the most support.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll hear about some of these today, like Vodafone\u2019s efforts to improve maternal health in Tanzania.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure that others in this room, around this table, will have ideas of where to pitch in.\u00a0 We\u2019re eager to hear them.\u00a0 We\u2019re also eager, where we can, to help you act on them.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve seen this time and time again, and it\u2019s also incredibly inspiring.\u00a0 We see the practical results when we can build public-private partnerships in actually making progress, in actually making a difference in people\u2019s lives.\nNow one way that we\u2019re able to do that in the government is through the Development Finance Corporation, which partners with the private sector to lower the risk of investment in developing countries, including all the democracies represented here today.\u00a0 And Scott, thank you so much for being with us today, but thank you for what you\u2019re doing every single day.\u00a0 I have to say, from my perspective, one of the most important tools that we have in the United States Government on this agenda is the DFC, and I\u2019m very proud that we\u2019re working together so closely.\nToday, though, is more than just providing support.\u00a0 We\u2019re also here to learn.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to learn from everyone around this table.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to adapt.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to try to share and spread best practices, because another thing that I\u2019ve learned in many years of doing this is that no one has a monopoly on ideas, never mind good ideas.\u00a0 No one has a monopoly on best practices.\u00a0 Somewhere, someplace around the world, for just about any problem that we\u2019re confronting, someone\u2019s probably figured it out.\nBut if we don\u2019t share that information, if we don\u2019t share those best practices, then we\u2019re constantly reinventing the wheel.\u00a0 And the power of bringing so many people together who are focused on different aspects of this challenge is that I will bet that, for just about anything we have to deal with, someone has found a good idea or a good solution.\u00a0 So we want to be sharing them today.\nUltimately, the challenges that many are facing are simply not that different from the ones facing democracies all over the world.\u00a0 Let me just quickly cite one that I know is at the top of just about everyone\u2019s agenda: corruption.\u00a0 That is estimated now to cost up to 5 percent of global GDP.\u00a0 And we all know this, but corruption discourages investment.\u00a0 It stifles competition, it deepens inequities, and maybe most damaging for democracies, it erodes public trust in government, in institutions.\u00a0 And that, that is the most corrosive thing of all.\u00a0 It also greases the wheels of foreign interference, disinformation, transnational repression, and other actions authoritarian governments take to try to weaken democracy.\nEvery country here today is taking meaningful steps to address this scourge.\u00a0 The Dominican Republic passed new legislation that allows the government to seize assets gained through illicit activities and invest them in the Dominican people.\u00a0 Ecuador created the country\u2019s first-ever specialized court tackling corruption and organized crime.\u00a0 Armenia\u2019s Corruption Prevention Commission conducted integrity checks on 261 candidates for judges and prosecutors in the first half of 2022, looking for conflicts of interest and other issues that could actually undermine their independence.\u00a0 These are real, practical ways of dealing with the challenge of corruption.\nNow, much of this democratic renewal is actually being driven from the bottom up \u2013 in Zambia, where last year more youth, women, first-time voters turned out than at any time in that country\u2019s history and brought new leaders to office who are already making positive change, from expanding human rights protections to reducing the country\u2019s crushing debt.\nAnd Moldova, where massive voter turnout to power reform a government that ran on a platform of transparency, anticorruption, and judicial independence brought that government to office.\nAnd I have to say my own admiration for you, Madam President, and all of your colleagues is boundless.\u00a0 You have an extraordinary challenge under the most difficult circumstances, but know that the United States is and will remain strongly your partner in everything that you\u2019re doing.\nOf all the reasons to be optimistic about this progress, the enthusiasm of citizens may be the most inspiring and, ultimately, the most consequential, because when people in other parts of the world, including in closed societies, see citizens holding their leaders to account, when they see government actually working to solve problems that people are confronting in their daily lives, then they too begin yearning for a more free, a more open, a more accountable government in their own countries.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the kind of virus that we\u2019d like to see spread.\u00a0 It\u2019s a good one, a powerful one, one that can make a huge difference.\nThe bottom line is this:\u00a0 I think, more than ever before, the fate of our democracies are intertwined, interconnected.\u00a0 The more vibrant, resilient democracies that we can foster by our side, the more we will be able to do what we\u2019re all here to do, which is to deliver for our people, for our fellow citizens.\u00a0 That\u2019s the mission; that\u2019s the objective.\u00a0 And we are grateful to be able to work with so many who are trying to do just that.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken At the Ministerial Meeting of the Alliance for Development in Democracy\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "The Palace Hotel", "location": "New York, New York ", "date": "September 20, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks for bringing us together this morning, and thanks to each of my friends and other colleagues for being here today.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to see you all and it\u2019s wonderful to see you in this particular setting.\nSome of us met in March, and since then the partnership between the Alliance for Development in Democracy and the United States has only grown stronger.\nAnd I\u2019m particularly delighted that our colleagues from Ecuador have now joined the ADD just earlier this summer, and with their signing of the supply chain MOU I think just a few moments ago, we\u2019ll begin discussions about strengthening our collective supply chains, something that is, I think, of importance to all of us and something that our citizens actually feel strongly in their daily lives.\nWe are coming together to tackle critically important questions in the five focus areas that we\u2019ve agreed on, like how can we collectively strengthen our democracies and other democracies throughout the hemisphere; how can we deal with the root causes of migration, while providing humanitarian assistance to migrants; how can we spur genuinely inclusive economic growth in our countries, especially as we all rebound from COVID.\nWe\u2019re following through on the memorandum of understanding that we signed in July to strengthen our supply chains.\u00a0 And I want to emphasize \u2013 I think we talked about this back in March \u2013 the follow-through on everything that we do and say is maybe even more important than the meetings we have when we get together.\u00a0 It\u2019s actually making sure that we\u2019re making good on the commitments that we make.\nWe\u2019re also growing our economic ties.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0recently\u00a0launched a survey of American CEOs\u00a0to try to get a good picture of companies\u2019 priorities and existing supply chains, so that they could\u00a0find\u00a0business opportunities across the Americas, including in ADD countries.\u00a0 Based on the findings of that survey, the State Department, the Commerce Department,\u00a0the private sector will begin\u00a0working\u00a0together to explore\u00a0a trade mission to ADD countries.\u00a0 So I think this is going to be an interesting initiative that I hope produces concrete results.\nAnd we\u2019re working together on issues that are actually far beyond the hemisphere that we share.\u00a0 All of us\u00a0believe in\u00a0the principles of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 We\u2019re all committed to modernizing the UN so that it\u2019s actually capable of addressing the complex challenges that we face, while staying true to the principles that are at its core.\u00a0 This is a very good week for us in particular to be affirming those principles and those objectives.\nThis group is just one way that we\u2019re bringing together new regional groupings of like-minded allies and partners, and we\u2019re doing that here this week in New York.\u00a0 I think you\u2019ll see that reflected, too,\u00a0in our\u00a0meetings with both the Blue Pacific and Atlantic Basin countries\u00a0this week. \u00a0In fact, I just came from a meeting of many of the Atlantic Basin countries.\nAcross these efforts, we\u00a0are united by\u00a0a\u00a0core\u00a0belief that democracy\u00a0is\u00a0the best way to\u00a0actually deliver\u00a0concrete results for\u00a0our\u00a0people:\nTo uphold\u00a0people\u2019s\u00a0civil and political rights\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including\u00a0through\u00a0holding\u00a0fair and free elections, protecting free speech and assembly.\nTo\u00a0advance\u00a0their\u00a0economic and social rights\u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0by strengthening labor standards, expanding access to education and health, providing more inclusive opportunities.\nTo deliver security and stability\u00a0\u2013\u00a0like\u00a0by\u00a0countering corruption,\u00a0upholding the rule of law,\u00a0and addressing the root causes of\u00a0illicit activity.\nIt is\u00a0no surprise\u00a0that when President Biden first announced the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity \u2013 which we did at the Summit of the Americas \u2013 to drive our hemisphere\u2019s\u00a0inclusive\u00a0economic growth,\u00a0the countries around this table were among the first to\u00a0express strong support.\nAs\u00a0this\u00a0partnership\u00a0is further developed,\u00a0the most important thing is this:\u00a0 We are looking for, we need, we want your ideas to\u00a0make sure\u00a0that we\u2019re actually seizing opportunities\u00a0for our shared\u00a0future.\u00a0\u00a0The power of all of this is in the collective, the different experiences that we have, the different ideas that we\u2019ve been able to test in different ways, and then, in many ways, trying to draw on the best practices that come from each of us.\nThere\u2019s one opportunity I just wanted to highlight in closing, and this comes through something called the CHIPS Act, which some of you will have seen passed our Congress just a few weeks ago.\u00a0 This, among other things, will provide funds to develop resilient semiconductor supply chains right here in\u00a0the\u00a0Americas.\u00a0 It\u00a0allows us to invest in\u00a0building the components that we need for the 21st century in our own hemisphere\u00a0\u2013 including\u00a0in\u00a0Latin American\u00a0and\u00a0Caribbean countries\u00a0\u2013 and, critically, it will\u00a0create good-paying jobs\u00a0while doing so.\nADD countries\u00a0\u2013 which together represent\u00a0our third-largest trading partner in the region, even before the addition of Ecuador\u00a0\u2013 are\u00a0very well-poised to seize these opportunities that come from some of the resources we now have available through the CHIPS Act.\u00a0 So we\u2019re very eager to work with you on that.\nLet me just conclude by saying this:\u00a0 As successful as we believe the first year of the ADD\u00a0has been, I\u2019m\u00a0actually confident that, year two, we will take even bigger strides together and do it in a way that really focuses on how can we together work to improve the lives of the citizens we represent.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is all about, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts and ideas for how we can actually get that done.\nSo thanks to everyone for being here.\u00a0 It\u2019s really good to see you.\n\n"}, {"url":

Two-thirds of the world\u2019s renewable energy is generated in the Atlantic. \u00a0And the Gulf Stream, of course, dictates the Earth\u2019s climate.\nWe see the Atlantic\u2019s influence right here in New York City. \u00a0If you walk just a few blocks from here, you run into the East River. \u00a0Its storied Brooklyn Navy Yard was created by President John Adams in 1801 to protect the Atlantic trade of our nascent nation. \u00a0Fifty years later, a U.S. ship built in that navy yard teamed up with a British ship to lay an undersea telegraph cable, through which Queen Victoria transmitted the very first transatlantic Morse Code message. \u00a0Over a century later, in his first visit to the United States as president, Nelson Mandela announced a new trade office in New York to expand economic ties between our nations and our peoples.\nToday, the Port Authority is working to combat the climate crisis with more aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets and a new generation of fuel-efficient container ships. \u00a0And New Yorkers are working to restore the oyster reefs that once lined the harbor and to bring back the woodlands, salt marsh, and wetlands that once dominated this coastline.\nThe commercial, communications, and conservation challenges and opportunities you see right here in this city are shared by the community of Atlantic nations. \u00a0We know we can\u2019t take for granted the free and open maritime trade that employs so many of our citizens, the undersea cables that connect us, the fish stocks and wildlife that sustain us. \u00a0Only together can we address rising challenges and threats to our Atlantic future.\nPiracy; illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing; transnational organized crime; climate change; pollution; environmental degradation \u2013 these are just some of the challenges that we have to face together.\nConsider just for a minute illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\u00a0 According to the FAO, one of \u2013 one in five fish on the market come from illicit fishing \u2013 one in five fish on the market.\u00a0 That translates to losses of between $10 and $23 billion a year to lawful fishing industries in the region.\u00a0 That harms coastal communities that rely on sustainable fish stocks for their income, for food.\u00a0 It fuels corruption.\u00a0 It threatens the health and biodiversity of our oceans.\nThe joint statement that we\u2019re adopting today affirms our shared responsibility to try to foster a peaceful, prosperous, open, and cooperative Atlantic and protect its richness for future generations. \u00a0We\u2019re also committing to build shared capacity to achieve these goals, drawing on the innovative technologies and best practices developed by Atlantic nations, for the benefit of all Atlantic nations.\nFollowing the ministerial today, we plan to launch a consultative process to develop together a framework for regular cooperation among Atlantic countries through which our countries can carry out a shared approach to advancing our joint development, economic, environmental, scientific, and maritime governance goals.\nWe\u2019re not pre-judging the results of these consultations. \u00a0We want to hear from everyone about your priorities, about your vision for enhancing cooperation, and not only from big countries but also small island nations whose voices need to be heard.\u00a0\u00a0And we hope you\u2019ll join us in encouraging more Atlantic nations to take part.\nThe United States currently spends over $400 million each year on maritime initiatives in the Atlantic. \u00a0Working with the United States Congress, we hope to invest an additional $100 million in the next year in support of shared priorities that we\u2019re discussing today: Atlantic maritime governance, inclusive economic growth, innovative adaptations to the growing impact of climate change.\nLast year, we joined the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy. \u00a0This July, we joined the European Union and six nations from the Western Hemisphere and Africa in the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance Declaration to promote scientific cooperation for the health and sustainable development of the Atlantic. \u00a0And in the coming months, we hope to come together with many of you to conclude years of negotiations on protections of the high sea areas and sharing of the benefits of maritime genetic resources that are collected there.\nWe recognize the importance of expanding support for, and working with, existing Atlantic initiatives \u2013 Portugal\u2019s leadership in creating the Atlantic Center in the Azores, Brazil\u2019s vision of a zone of peace and cooperation in the South Atlantic, the Friends of the Gulf of Guinea \u2013 efforts that continue to make significant \u2013 to have a significant impact.\u00a0 Still, as challenges mount and our innovations and opportunities expand, we believe our partnerships need to grow to meet those challenges.\nSo I\u2019m really grateful to everyone around this table for being here today and for the work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 And I look forward to all that we can actually accomplish together in the months and years to come.\nThanks to everyone for being here.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinken-at-the-launch-of-the-alliance-for-afghan-womens-economic-resilience/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Blinken At the Launch of the Alliance for Afghan Women\u2019s Economic Resilience\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

in fact, I\u2019m tempted to just drop the microphone and say \u201cwhat she said\u201d \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but for your leadership every day around the world, as well as in Afghanistan.\nAnd I also just want to recognize a few really exceptional colleagues who are joining us today, starting with Don Lu, our Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs.\u00a0 Next to him, Tom West, our Special Representative for Afghanistan, and someone I think known to many of you, Rina Amiri, our Special Envoy for Afghan Women, Girls, and Human Rights.\nThe three of them together, along with Kat, and along with so many other colleagues, are making sure every single day that Afghanistan writ large and women and girls in particular remain at the heart of our focus and our determination.\u00a0 And I really want to thank Rina in particular for incredibly dedicated advocacy for the people of Afghanistan.\u00a0 We\u2019re really lucky to have you on our team.\u00a0 You are working tirelessly to stand up for Afghan women and girls, their rights, and all at-risk Afghans.\u00a0 Thank you, Rina.\nAnd I\u2019m really grateful to our partners from civil society and the private sector, including our very exceptional panelists.\u00a0 I had a chance to speak to them briefly a few minutes ago.\nWe\u2019re all here for a particular purpose today, and that is to launch a new initiative:\u00a0 The Alliance for Afghan Women\u2019s Economic Resilience.\u00a0 More to say about that in just a few minutes.\nBut Your Highness, I\u2019m also grateful to you for taking part today, for leading this discussion.\u00a0 Thank you for your engagement not just today, but again, every day.\u00a0 It\u2019s greatly appreciated.\nSo as you heard Kat describe, we are meeting at a deeply challenging time for Afghan women and girls.\u00a0 That is no secret to anyone in this room.\u00a0 Since taking power, the Taliban have severely restricted women\u2019s rights in Afghanistan, turning back two decades of progress that Afghan women themselves built with the support of the international community.\nThe Taliban have denied women freedom of movement.\u00a0 They\u2019ve banned girls from secondary school classrooms.\u00a0 They\u2019ve prohibited women in the workplace, women who last year \u2013 again, as Kat said \u2013 were managing businesses, running schools, serving in government.\u00a0 Many women have had to flee for safety; they face extraordinary challenges in rebuilding their lives in new countries.\nWomen, no matter where they live, should have equal rights in every facet of their lives.\u00a0 Equal opportunities to study, to work; equal access to financial resources; and they should enjoy the same freedoms as everyone else to travel, to express themselves, to choose their own paths.\nThis should be, in the year 2022, self-evident to everyone on this planet.\u00a0 But of course, it\u2019s not, and we have to fight for it.\u00a0 We have to struggle for it every single day.\nBut particularly here this week at the United Nations, where the world comes together at High-Level Week, these rights were enshrined in the preamble of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 This is the founding document of international relations.\u00a0 It\u2019s the founding document that describes not Western-created rights, not something invented here or in any particular country, but universal rights to which everyone is subscribing, or is at least supposed to subscribe.\u00a0 The charter affirms the faith of all peoples of the United Nations, \u201cin fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women.\u201d\u00a0 And that is a direct quote from the charter.\nSo no more better time than today, than this week, to reaffirm those rights, to reaffirm a common understanding and a common commitment to those rights, and no more important a place to do it than with regard to Afghanistan.\nIt\u2019s also, I think, incredibly important to understand that the repression of these rights in Afghanistan is not only setting back women, but all Afghans, the country as a whole, including Afghanistan\u2019s economy.\u00a0 So it\u2019s simply not in the basic self-interest of anyone in Afghanistan, including the Taliban.\u00a0 When women are cut out of the workforce, society loses talent.\u00a0 It loses productivity from half of its population.\nToday, women could contribute $1 billion to Afghanistan\u2019s economy if they were simply allowed to.\u00a0 They could provide lifelines for families facing poverty; they could help create more stable, more resilient communities at a time when those are desperately needed in Afghanistan.\nIn short, equality and economic opportunity actually go hand in hand.\u00a0 And there are prerequisites for sustainable peace and sustainable security.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one reason the United States will continue supporting equality and opportunity for Afghan women and girls.\nSo one way we\u2019re doing this is by providing direct assistance to at-risk Afghans.\u00a0 Just over the last year, we\u2019ve contributed more than $770 million to humanitarian organizations.\u00a0 In addition, USAID recently announced another $30 million in development assistance for Afghan women and girls.\nWe\u2019ve also partnered with Switzerland and Afghan economic experts to launch the Afghan Fund, something you\u2019ve seen and probably read about in recent days.\u00a0 This is going to help protect and make targeted disbursements of $3.5 billion in Afghan Central Bank reserves to support the country\u2019s economic stability.\nFor all that we\u2019re doing with the humanitarian assistance, as desperately needed as that is \u2013 it\u2019s necessary, but it\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 And helping to create basic economic stability is actually vital to making sure that Afghans do not suffer even more in the very difficult circumstances that they\u2019re living.\nWe\u2019re also supporting Afghan women and girls through our diplomacy.\u00a0 We\u2019re organizing with our allies and partners, including in the Muslim world, to present a united front and urge the Taliban to respect women\u2019s rights.\u00a0 And we\u2019re amplifying Afghan women\u2019s voices in international institutions \u2013 including here at the United Nations.\nToday, in partnership with Boston University, we are announcing our newest initiative: the Alliance for Afghan Women\u2019s Economic Resilience.\u00a0 Let me just say a few words about that before turning it over to our panel.\nThis is a public-private partnership that will help improve access to education and training, expand job opportunity, support women entrepreneurs in Afghanistan as well as in other countries.\u00a0 Now, I don\u2019t want to sugarcoat it:\u00a0 This is going to be hard, given the severe restraints imposed by the Taliban, but we are determined to safely deliver this support to women in Afghanistan.\nThe alliance builds on proven models, something we\u2019ve had experience with in other places, and it reflects the resources, the innovation, the speed and expertise that we can harness when we bring together private enterprise, academic institutions, NGOs, and governments.\nSo for example, in partnership with Pod \u2013 this is an American technology company \u2013 the alliance will launch the Million Women Mentors Initiative for Afghan Women and Girls.\u00a0 Mentors from Deloitte will help Pod offer remote career guidance to the first 2,000 of these million Afghan women.\u00a0 I have seen this work in other places, and it is remarkable what you can achieve even doing things at a distance.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to get off to a start with this.\nBoston University\u2019s Pardee School of Global Studies will host the alliance.\u00a0 It will provide staffing, research, technical assistance, and programmatic support to help the alliance run and help it thrive.\nBoston University, Deloitte, Pod, thank you for being part of this crucial effort.\nTo others who see a way to contribute to this alliance, whether it\u2019s from the public sector, the private sector, two words: Join us.\u00a0 We\u2019re eager to work with you on behalf of Afghan women.\nSo there\u2019s a lot more that could be said.\u00a0 I really want to leave it now to some remarkable people who offer their experience, their expertise, and an opportunity to share it with you.\u00a0 But let me simply conclude by saying thank you to everyone in this room who remains invested in the future of Afghanistan and the future of its women and girls.\u00a0 The United States remains invested, and we will continue to work this every single day.\nThank you so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-turkish-foreign-minister-mevlut-cavusoglu-before-their-meeting-4/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Pyatt, Assistant SecretaryBureau of Energy Resources", "audience": "Yale Club", "location": "New York City", "date": "September 19, 2022", "content": "\n\nThank you. Good evening. Thank you very much Ambassador Hoagland for that introduction and to Ambassador Cekuta and Dr. Nifti, ministers and guests. It\u2019s just a huge honor for me to be with you here today to discuss energy resources and infrastructure in the Caspian region. And certainly, this discussion on the margins of the UNGA could not be more timely. As Ambassador Hoagland noted, I was sworn in this morning after having been confirmed on Thursday by the Senate, and I\u2019m just a few hours into my new job. So, this is one of the very first events that I\u2019m doing. But Caspian energy issues were central to my work when I was the PDAS in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs and worked closely, I should note, with Ambassador Hoagland. But also more recently, when I was ambassador to Greece, I worked very closely with my Azeri counterpart, as we worked to support the regulatory approval and construction of the TAP pipeline. And indeed, the whole Southern Gas Corridor looks even more important, in retrospect, as European energy security and the clean energy transition have emerged as two of today\u2019s most pressing economic and geopolitical issues.\nMeanwhile, President Putin\u2019s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine continues to generate extraordinary costs; in the thousands of civilians killed and wounded, in the 13 million Ukrainian citizens forced to leave their homes, and in rising global food and energy prices, and supply demand imbalances, making it harder for people around the world to meet their basic needs. Much of the discussion at this year\u2019s UNGA will be about how we can work together to address these pressing humanitarian and economic challenges, but as the pressures of the war continue, we also need to make sure that we work together to meet global energy demand, while simultaneously addressing the devastating effects and the costs of climate change and the imperative of the clean energy transition.\nThe Biden Administration has consistently demonstrated its commitment to prioritizing the climate crisis. This includes passing the most significant legislation in US history to tackle climate change and strengthen energy security, as well as working with counterparts to encourage everyone to do more to meet climate goals. These are serious challenges, but they also offer opportunities to strengthen our partnerships and reap the economic benefits of new technologies and new markets. Energy diversification, as a central component of the clean energy transition, supports both economic and energy security goals. Part of managing this transition effectively is ensuring people have access to reliable energy to keep the lights on and businesses operating. What this means in terms of the mix of technologies and fuels will be different for every country. Some countries will require continued and diminishing use of unabated oil and natural gas as zero emission and abatement technologies continue to be commercialized.\nCaspian natural gas is already playing a critical role in ensuring European energy security. And the more that resources in one region can be shared with another, the more all will benefit. For this reason, the United States believes that expanding natural gas, as well as electricity interconnections, will bring significant benefits to the Caspian region. The United States is engaged in ongoing dialogue with countries that could increase exports to determine the best ways Caspian states can contribute to broader energy security and diversification goals. The Southern Gas Corridor is a powerful example of what can be achieved with political will, coordinated investment, regional cooperation and technological innovation. In this regard, I\u2019ll always remember my 2017 visit to the TAP pipeline, when it was under construction in Northern Greece, and the fantastic combination of capital, technology, and vision that project represented. Since it came online in 2020, the Southern Gas Corridor has already helped Turkey, Italy, Greece, and now Bulgaria to massively reduce their dependence on a single energy supplier. Its strategic and economic importance will only grow as Europe explores expanding the Southern Gas Corridor\u2019s capacity to further diversify suppliers and routes. This Southern Gas Corridor has literally redrawn the energy map of Southeastern Europe. And at least in Greece, Azeri gas has played an important role in the government\u2019s progress towards reducing reliance on dirty lignite coal power plants, thereby advancing our shared climate goals.\nGreater regional interconnection also means greater stability for electrical grids, the essential infrastructure of modern homes and economies. To further regional energy security, it will also be important to increase energy efficiency. This is one of the easiest and most effective ways to reduce consumer energy costs, lower emissions and improve competitiveness. It can also help Caspian countries to meet their domestic needs and free up additional resources for export. Energy efficiency in buildings and power plant operations and reducing methane venting, flaring, and leaking are all important. And of course, it\u2019s possible to capture more gas for sale just by reducing the amount that is vented and flared. This benefits both the economy and the environment in line with the goals of the Global Methane Pledge announced last year at COP 26. Participants in the Pledge agreed to contribute to a collective effort to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% of 2020 levels by 2030. And I\u2019m delighted that four states in the region are signatories to this pledge.\nOur shared commitment to combating climate change presents opportunity for innovation as well. Developing and deploying renewable energy and battery storage will help bolster sustainability, resilience, and energy security. It also creates good, well-paying jobs.\nMany states in the Caspian region have the potential to expand their use of renewable energy, taking advantage of their abundant resources to provide electricity and meet the needs of their populations. I vividly remember making the drive from Almaty to Bishkek, early in my tenure as PDAS, and being struck by how much the landscape looked like our high plains in Colorado. In the decade since I took that trip, Colorado has more than tripled its renewable energy generation, with four fifths of that now coming from wind power. There is no reason why many Caspian states couldn\u2019t do the same in a way that would deliver multiple benefits. The private sector is and will continue to be an important partner in meeting these complimentary goals of energy security and energy transition. Continuing to provide reliable energy within the Caspian region and Europe, while transitioning to cleaner energy sources for the future, will require significant capital, but also presents fantastic new business opportunities. As I begin my role as Assistant Secretary of State for Energy resources, I am eager to find opportunities to increase cooperation in the fields of clean and renewable energy, and methane mitigation. So please keep in touch and be assured the United States will continue to support initiatives across the region to meet climate goals.\nFinally, I will close by highlighting that the United States takes these relationships seriously and I am eager to again join the team, working to advance our agenda across this fascinating region. We are celebrating 30 years of U.S. relations with the states of the Caspian region, and we want to continue to work together to prioritize regional and international energy goals. Thank you once again for your welcome and I very much look forward to this evening\u2019s discussion.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinken-and-egyptian-foreign-minister-sameh-shoukry-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Blinken And Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry Before Their Meeting\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

Good afternoon, everyone. And look at this turnout \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful to see all of you here. It\u2019s wonderful to be part of an incredibly powerful and growing coalition, as evidenced just by my three colleagues and friends who have spoken.\nTo my friends from the Netherlands and Argentina, Wopke, Santiago: Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your engagement. And let me say as well \u2013 I think we just heard the powerful words from the prime minister \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful to see you, wonderful to be with you in this effort.\nTo all the other partners present, we\u2019re grateful for the sustained work to champion LGBTQI+ rights.\nWe\u2019re meeting at a time when the movement for equality is showing some encouraging momentum. A few examples: this summer, St. Kitts and Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda became the latest governments to decriminalize homosexual acts; a month ago, the Government of Vietnam announced that homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgender identity cannot be considered illnesses, and that LGBTQI+ people cannot be subjected to so-called \u201cconversion therapy.\u201d\nAt the same time, for that progress, which is real and which is worth underscoring, we know that people worldwide continue to experience alarming levels of violence, discrimination, isolation. Risks are the highest for people with disabilities, people of color, refugees, and LGBTQI+ women. Transgender people are often denied access to legal identity documents that reflect their names and gender markers. Intersex people, including minors, continue to be subjected to unnecessary surgeries without their consent.\nAll countries, including those of us in the Core Group, have work to do to ensure that LGBTQI+ people have the same rights, the same protections as all other people.\nDefending these rights is central to the health of our democracies. Any system where some groups are treated as \u201cless than\u201d simply because of who they are is fundamentally flawed.\nStanding up for LGBTQI+ people is a top priority for our administration.\nA month after taking office, President Biden took action to promote LGBTQI+ rights in our diplomacy.\nLast September, he appointed an extraordinary person, Jessica Stern, as our new special envoy to advance the human rights of LGBQI+ persons. Anyone who\u2019s worked with Jessica knows you don\u2019t want to be on the other side of an issue. (Laughter.) Big mistake.\nThis summer, the President issued an executive order to advance equality for LGBTQI+ people \u2013 including by combating so-called \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d supporting LGBTQI+ children and families, protecting health care and programs to prevent youth suicide.\nEverything we\u2019re doing builds on the work of literally generations of advocates who have \u2013 and still are \u2013 risking so much to put LGBTQI+ people and their rights on the map. And I have to say, as I read the history, learn the history, hear of experiences, I\u2019m quite in awe of generations of advocates who have done so much to put us where we are today. The work we\u2019re doing is only possible because of the work they did \u2013 but not only the work they did, the courage that they showed.\nThere\u2019s so many people that one could point to, but I want to just single out a couple of people, and I think they\u2019re here today. People like Liberty Matthyse, who is here from South Africa \u2013 are you here? Right \u2013 right there. Thank you. (Applause.) A champion for the rights of trans and gender diverse people. Thank you for being with us.\nAnd people like the individuals who decided to stand up to the routine and \u2013 harassment and discrimination they endured at the hands of police, at a gay bar not very far from where we meet today \u2013 the 1969 protest at the Stonewall Inn marked a turning point in our nation\u2019s struggle for LGBTQI+ rights and helped galvanize the global movement. This is something that is seared into the memories, seared into the consciousness of so many of us. And particularly for me as a native New Yorker, it\u2019s something that I have seen and been inspired by for many, many years.\nStonewall is also a stark reminder of all the places worldwide where people are still subject to abuse simply for being themselves.\nThat\u2019s why this group\u2019s work is as important as ever \u2013 maybe more important than ever. It\u2019s why we are so proud and determined to be your partners every single step along the way.\nThanks, all of you, for everything that you\u2019re doing, that we\u2019re doing together. Thank you.\n(Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-freedom-of-expression-roundtable/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Before we begin, let me just take a moment to again welcome the safe return of Mark Frerichs, an American Navy veteran who spent more than two and a half years in captivity in Afghanistan. His return is the culmination of many, many months of tireless and effective work by so many colleagues in our government. I especially want to extend thanks to our Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, who\u2019s actually with Mark as we speak, and to our Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West.\nMany national security professionals across the government gave their all to this effort to get Mark out of captivity and ultimately to bring him home, and I want to thank all the people who\u2019ve worked on this over these many months. We care about Mark and we\u2019re profoundly grateful to them. The support that we received from our Qatari partners as well was key in securing his release.\nMark is soon going to be reunited with his family. The President had an opportunity to speak to them a few hours ago. I want the families of Americans who are being arbitrarily detained or held hostage anywhere in the world to know that our commitment to them in bringing their loved ones home is resolute and we will relentlessly continue to focus on doing just that. We bring the same determination and focus to those efforts as we brought to the effort to bring Mark Frerichs out of captivity and home to his loved ones.\nFor the United States, for me personally, there is no higher priority than bringing Americans who are being arbitrarily and unjustly detained, held hostage, back home to freedom, to their families. We\u2019ll continue to work this relentlessly and secure the release of all Americans who are being unjustly held wherever that\u2019s the case. We mean what we say: Mark\u2019s family had my word; every other family has my word as well.\nWith that, I also want to say how pleased we are to be with some extraordinary colleagues today. And it\u2019s fitting that we\u2019re opening the High-Level Week here at the United Nations with an event, a conversation, focused on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. It\u2019s also particularly fitting that we\u2019re doing it at the Foreign Press Center, which actually embodies both of those principles. Our commitment, the United States commitment to freedom of expression, freedom of the press, is unwavering, and it\u2019s unwavering because it\u2019s the bedrock of a healthy democracy.\nIncreasingly, though, we see these freedoms as under threat \u2013 under threat from censorship, from surveillance, from restrictive laws, from propaganda, the use of detention and prosecution, of violence, and we see this quite literally around the world. Even as we condemn the efforts to restrict freedom of expression and freedom of the press, we\u2019re determined to do everything we can to uphold them, including with a number of important U.S. programs that we\u2019ll have an opportunity to discuss today with our colleagues that do just that.\nBut let me conclude by saying \u2013 by saying this: Virtually everything that we\u2019re doing here this week at the United Nations, the issues that we\u2019re putting a spotlight on, from food insecurity to climate to global health, we couldn\u2019t do this without the information, the illumination that freedom of expression and freedom of the press bring to these and every other challenging issue around the globe. The work of the United Nations, the work of our own foreign policy and diplomacy, would be dramatically undermined in a world where freedom of expression and freedom of the press are under threat, under challenge, in decline.\nSo we have a real stake in upholding these principles, in making real defending them against those who seek to dilute them, diminish them, eliminate them. Mostly I\u2019m anxious to hear from all of our colleagues who have in various ways shown extraordinary courage in upholding these principles around the world. I\u2019m anxious to hear from them their experiences and their ideas for what more we can do to support, defend, protect freedom of expression and free press.\nWith that, I thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-yemeni-chairman-of-the-presidential-leadership-council-rashad-al-alimi-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

we\u2019ve done the most important thing, so I\u2019m really delighted, Ayman, to have you back in Washington.\u00a0 The team, our team, have done a lot of good work.\u00a0 But before we get to why we\u2019re actually here today, let me on behalf of the American people extend our deepest condolences to the people of Jordan for the tragic building collapse that you experienced this week in Amman.\u00a0 Our hearts go out to the families of those lost and we wish the injured a swift recovery.\u00a0 To the first responders, to the doctors, we join people around the world in expressing our appreciation and admiration for the work that you\u2019ve done.\nSo this memorandum of understanding that we\u2019ve just signed is a testament to the strength of the relationship between Jordan and the United States.\u00a0 It reflects a shared interest in a more stable, safe, and prosperous Middle East, and our commitment to deepen the partnership between our governments and between our peoples to help achieve that goal.\nThis is now the fourth memorandum of understanding that our nations have adopted, going back to 2010, to deepen our strategic partnership.\u00a0 It will not only cover the longest period, but will also provide more assistance than any prior MOU.\u00a0 The MOU will support key reforms conceived of and led by King Abdullah\u2019s government, focusing on improving the lives of Jordanians in tangible ways \u2013 reforms like improving essential public services; tackling the water crisis, which is being exacerbated by climate change; expanding economic opportunities so that everyone in Jordan, including women, underserved groups, can reach their full potential.\nAmbitious reforms like these take time.\u00a0 They also take courage.\u00a0 With the agreement we signed today, which intends to provide well over a billion dollars in assistance each year for seven years, our Jordanian partners can count on the United States to support them and to help make these goals real.\nThe MOU is also an investment in Jordan\u2019s exceptional leadership on regional and global challenges.\u00a0 Jordan has long offered a refuge to people displaced by regional conflicts and other crises, something that we\u2019ve seen most recently in the extraordinary compassion that the Jordanian Government and its people have shown to Syrians.\u00a0 In addition to humanitarian support and access to health care, Syrian refugees in Jordan also have opportunities to work and to study, which is vital for them to live with dignity and purpose and also vital to help ensure that there is not another lost generation of Syrians.\nHosting such a large number of refugees has demanded a lot from Jordan, particularly as the country emerges from COVID-19.\u00a0 But Jordan\u2019s government and people have not turned their backs on refugees from Syria; they have embraced them.\nAs they continue providing this vital support, so will the United States as reflected in our announcement earlier this week of an additional $756 million in humanitarian assistance for Syrians in need, including those in Jordan.\nAnd Jordan continues to play a key role in promoting regional security and stability.\u00a0 This includes Jordan\u2019s ongoing commitment to continue working for a just, lasting, comprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians on the basis of a two-state solution along the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps.\u00a0 Jordan\u2019s armed forces have long been a key ally in the fight against violent extremist ideology and terrorism, including as a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, or Daesh.\u00a0 And its military is stepping up to counter new threats like combating narcotics trafficking across the country\u2019s northern border.\u00a0 The unprecedented level of foreign military financing reflected in the MOU will support the modernization of Jordan\u2019s military, which is essential to these and other efforts.\nWe can make investments like these with confidence because we\u2019re building on more than six decades of close cooperation between our governments, between our peoples, and between our diplomats.\u00a0 An MOU of this breadth takes a lot of work, considerable effort, even among partners.\u00a0 So to our experts and negotiators whose hard work made today\u2019s signing possible, we say thank you \u2013\u00a0sukran\u00a0\u2013 for what you\u2019ve done together, for all the ways that it will benefit Jordanians, benefit Americans, benefit the region as a whole.\nAyman, the floor is yours.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary \u2013 dear Tony \u2013 thank you so much. \u00a0Thank you for your kind words and thank you for the excellent discussion we had today, but most of all thank you for true friendship.\nAs you said, the MOU we just signed is unprecedented in terms of its duration and the size of financial assistance it entails.\u00a0 It does reflect the strength of our relationship, but we are grateful for the unwavering support that you have continued to provide Jordan.\u00a0 This support, as you said, sir, is key to our efforts to mitigate the heavy impact of regional crises\u2014refugees, border security, drug trafficking, pressure on our scarce resources \u2013 and without your help, we will not have been able to do what we did in terms of providing the dignified lives that refugees deserve.\u00a0 They have been victims of conflict; they cannot be a victim of us not doing our bit to help them, so thank you so, so much for all of that.\nAnd the MOU and the EU support is also central to our economic development process as we embark on thorough, wide-ranging reforms that will strengthen the resilience of our economy, improve our \u2013 its competitiveness, create jobs, meet our needs for water and energy, and ensure the better future that our people deserve.\u00a0 So we\u2019re really truly thankful, and we truly value the support.\u00a0 And together as friends and partners, we\u2019ll continue to work to realize our joint objective of resolving regional conflicts, ensuring security, stability, peace, cooperation, and prosperity in our region.\nAnd Mr. Secretary whether in our work to restart the Middle East peace process and put it back on track towards achieving comprehensive, just, and lasting peace on the basis of the two-state solution, the only solution that we believe people will accept and embrace or in our efforts to find political solution to tragic crises in Syria, Yemen, Libya, or ensuring the enduring defeat of terrorism, the leading role of the United States is essential.\u00a0 It is simply irreplaceable.\u00a0 These are difficult challenges, and we know we cannot overcome them unless we work together.\u00a0 Jordan will continue to do its part and work with you in full partnership not only to overcome those challenges but also to harness the many opportunities that peace and cooperation in the region promise.\nAnd dear Tony, as His Majesty and King Abdullah just reaffirmed in their meeting in Jeddah, our partnership is strong, it is enduring, it is strategic.\u00a0 It is a partnership that continues to do a lot of good not only for our two countries but also for the region and for global peace.\u00a0 And today is definitely a day to remember in this historic, deep friendship that our countries have enjoyed.\u00a0 And again, as you said, it took a lot of work to achieve, and a big shout out to all our colleagues who have worked so hard to ensure that we get to this great day and to this great moment \u2013 and a relationship that continues to be key for us, a relationship that His Majesty views as one of the most key and the most strategic partnership that we have.\u00a0 So a big thank you for this and thank you for, again, your new friendship and for your partnership.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Elizabeth Hagedorn of Al-Monitor.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, Ukraine has discovered a new mass grave that likely includes hundreds of civilians in a city recaptured from Russian forces in the country\u2019s northeast.\u00a0 The Ukrainians say once again this proves Russia should be labeled a state sponsor of terrorism.\u00a0 Why does the administration oppose that designation despite the kind of war crime discovered this week?\nAnd Foreign Minister Safadi, do you see any hope for a Palestinian state?\u00a0 And how does Jordan view the current escalation and Israel\u2019s actions in the West Bank?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Elizabeth.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen now the reports of this mass grave.\u00a0 And of course, this is part, horrifically, of the continuing and ongoing story.\u00a0 Whenever we see the Russian tide recede from the parts of Ukraine that it\u2019s occupied, we see what\u2019s left in its wake.\u00a0 And this latest discovery of apparently 440 mass graves in Izyum is a reminder of that.\nI was just in Irpin when I was in Ukraine last week, and one of the things that I saw firsthand there \u2013 this is a city just a few miles from Kyiv itself \u2013 buildings bombed out, shelled, mortared, grenaded, shot at, destroyed \u2013 entirely civilian area.\u00a0 And there can be no reason for what occurred there.\u00a0 At best it was indiscriminate; at worst it was intentional.\nSo two things.\u00a0 One, it\u2019s usually important that even as the Ukrainians do everything they can to take back the land that\u2019s been seized from them by Russia in this aggression that at the same time we\u2019re all working to build the evidence and document the atrocities that have been committed.\u00a0 And in many instances, these will amount to war crimes, which I think is the appropriate frame through which to look at this.\u00a0 That work is going on.\u00a0 There needs to be accountability.\u00a0 And whether it\u2019s through the Ukrainian process itself, whether it\u2019s through mechanisms at the OSCE, the United Nations, the International Criminal Court \u2013 all of these things coming together I think will be very important to making sure that those who\u2019ve committed atrocities and those who ordered them are held accountable.\nSo that I think is the way to move forward, and that\u2019s happening.\u00a0 I talked to people on the ground in Ukraine who are working on documenting the evidence and building the cases for war crimes and the atrocities that have been committed.\nI think you know our position on the state sponsorship of terrorism designation.\u00a0 I\u2019d simply say two things.\u00a0 One, all \u2013 virtually all of the penalties, sanctions, and pressure that could be exerted through that designation, we\u2019re already doing.\u00a0 So as a practical matter in terms of what it can accomplish, we\u2019re already doing it and it\u2019s having \u2013 what we\u2019re doing through sanctions, through export controls, is having a profound effect on Russia, one that\u2019s growing every single day.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to get to be a heavier and heavier burden.\nThere are problems in the \u2013 using this particular vehicle, state sponsorship of terrorism designation, that may have unintended consequences that are not only not helpful, they may even be harmful.\u00a0 We\u2019ve talked about that and spelled it out.\u00a0 But what we are doing is working with Congress right now to see if there is another way forward that achieves what could be achieved through the use of the SST designation without any of the unintended consequences that would make it more counterproductive than productive.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0\u00a0Not only will we continue to hope, but we\u2019ll continue to work for the establishment of a sovereign, independent Palestinian state on June 4, 1967 lines to live in peace and security with Israel because if we don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re not going to have the peace that we\u2019ve worked so hard for.\u00a0 The two-state solution remains the only viable option to solve the conflict.\u00a0 We are determined to continue to work again with the U.S., whose leading role is essential, along with other partners to create political horizon and get the parties back to the table so that we can restart meaningful negotiations and achieve the peace that we\u2019ve all worked so hard to achieve.\nThere are unilateral measures that are undermining the viability of the two-state solution, and our position is very clear.\u00a0 We urge Israel to stop all unilateral measures that undermine the two-state solution in terms of settlements, confiscation of land, or encroachment on al-Aqsa, and it is in the interest of all of us to be able to do that because we want to preserve the chances for peace.\u00a0 And nobody is doing anybody a favor by opting for peace.\u00a0 Peace is right for all peoples of the region \u2013 Palestinians, Israelis, Jordanians, and everybody else.\nSo we recognize how difficult the situation is right now, but we cannot throw in the white towel.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to keep working at it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to continue to work for horizon and again, in partnership with our friends in the United States and our brethrens and other partners of the world, we continue to work for that and we\u2019ll hope for better times when Israelis and Palestinians come together in peace and start a new era of cooperation in the region.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Tareq Alass, Mamlakeh TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to ask my question in Arabic, please.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 One second.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, of course.\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, you talked about the firmness of the relationships between Jordan and the United States.\u00a0 What are the horizons of the bilateral cooperation in the future between the two countries, and what are the fields that you work to reinforce bilaterally with Jordan and also regionally?\nAnd also Mr. Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi, what are Jordan\u2019s and United States\u2019 priorities in the region?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 A few things.\u00a0 First, I think it\u2019s very important to remember that this is a friendship that\u2019s endured for more than six decades, and throughout that time we\u2019ve built ties, connections, binds between our governments, but also and especially between our people.\u00a0 And that\u2019s an incredibly strong foundation.\nThe MOU today only strengthens that foundation and will allow us to do even more together.\u00a0 The MOU and the different areas of focus really go to a number of things where I see us working together even more closely in the years ahead.\u00a0 Some of this, of course, is the work that the United States and Jordan have been doing for years regionally to try to advance peace, to try to advance stability, to try to advance prosperity.\u00a0 And there couldn\u2019t be two closer partners in that effort.\nBut also \u2013 and the MOU sets this out and so does \u2013 so do discussions we have on a regular basis \u2013 we\u2019re working on many of the issues that have the biggest impact on the lives of our people in trying to improve those lives: trying to create greater economic opportunity, jobs throughout the entire society; making sure that when it comes to vital resources that people need, including water, energy, that all of these things we\u2019re working to build access to together.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be working on everything from dealing with the effects of climate change to global health.\u00a0 So the agenda is in many ways global, but the impact, we hope, in the work that we\u2019re doing together is going to be profoundly felt in Jordan, the United States, and in the region as a whole.\nThere are a whole series of other regional challenges where we\u2019re working together, but I think a lot of the focus is on making sure that together we\u2019re looking at ways to concretely improve the lives of people in our countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s our fundamental responsibility, and there\u2019s much that we can do, we are doing, and we\u2019ll do even more of as a result of the MOU to do just that.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0 If I may answer \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Please.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0 \u2014 in Arabic.\n(Via interpreter) As His Excellency the Secretary said, our friendship with United States is a historical one.\u00a0 Our partnership is firm, it\u2019s fruitful, and continuous.\u00a0 And signing this MOU today, an MOU that is the longest and largest since we started signing MOUs, is an indicator, a clear and practical indicator of the firmness of this relationship and this friendship.\u00a0 And we highly appreciate the support of the United States continues to offer the kingdom and which will greatly help us expand the economic and administrative reform programs that you know of, and it will also help us to deal with the ramifications of the economic conditions that affect our resources.\nSo our priority is clear.\u00a0 We work together bilaterally on pushing development.\u00a0 And as His Excellency said, there is great American support for our development projects in the fields of water, energy, finding employment opportunities, providing the economic environment to have a better future that our people deserve.\u00a0 And the support that this MOU contains is approximately $1.5 billion for every year for seven years, and that happens at a time when we take serious reforms, and they\u2019ll have a great role to play in this.\nOur regional priority, which we both commit to, is to bring peace, security, and stability in our region.\u00a0 Our region has more than its share of crises, and we work together to bring back peace and the political process to its proper path and achieve a comprehensive solution on the basis of the two countries to solve the crisis in Syria, Yemen, Libya, and achieve the development that gives us the ability to respond to the needs of our peoples in an honorable, dignified life, productive life.\nAnd again, His Majesty the King and President Biden more than once affirmed the important centrality of this relationship, and we commit to work with our friends in the United States, and we thank our friends in the United States for all the support that they offer us.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Shannon Crawford, ABC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, two questions.\u00a0 Recently we\u2019ve seen the leaders of China and India express their concern about the war in Ukraine directly to Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 Do you see this as a significant shift for Russia on the international stage?\nAnd second, family members of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner are meeting at the White House.\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s been more than 50 days since you put forward that substantial proposal for their freedom, but so far it hasn\u2019t been a successful proposal.\u00a0 Now, has Russia given you a serious counteroffer?\u00a0 And given your priorities at this department, when will you do more or will you do more than urge Russia to take the deal that\u2019s already on the table?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 With regard to the first part of your question, I think what you\u2019re hearing from China, from India, is reflective of concerns around the world about the effects of Russia\u2019s aggression on Ukraine \u2013 not just on the people of Ukraine, devastating as that\u2019s been, but on countries and people across the entire planet.\u00a0 It\u2019s an aggression not just against Ukraine and its people, it\u2019s an aggression against the very principles of international relations that help keep peace and security.\nThe United Nations Charter \u2013 we\u2019re about to head off to the United Nations for High-Level Week; the charter should be front and center.\u00a0 The number one violator of the charter right now is Russia.\u00a0 So there are real concerns that, I think, are being heard from countries around the world about that, and, of course, all of the impacts that this is having, including, for example, on food insecurity.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent a lot of time and a lot of focus in recent months in trying to address the challenges to food security that have been exacerbated dramatically by Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 We already had COVID, we already had climate change that were having profound effects on food insecurity.\u00a0 Add to that conflict, we now have well over 200 million people who are severely food insecure.\nThis is something that leaders in countries around the world are feeling, because their people are feeling it.\u00a0 And so I think what you\u2019re seeing is just a manifestation of the fact that this aggression has been an aggression against the interests of people across the planet, and I think it increases the pressure on Russia to end the aggression.\nWhen it comes to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, a few things.\u00a0 First, we \u2013 the President, the State Department, this institution, myself, other parts of our government \u2013 are working every single day to try to bring Americans who are being arbitrarily detained or unjustly held anywhere in the world, to bring them home, to bring them to freedom.\u00a0 That applies to Brittney and Paul certainly as well.\u00a0 Securing their release, securing the release of any American who\u2019s being arbitrarily detained is at the very top of my priority list.\u00a0 And as you said, we have put forward a substantial proposal to Russia.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to get into the details or the back and forth in public; I don\u2019t think that serves the interests of getting to an agreement.\nBut suffice to say we are working on it every day, and just because we don\u2019t say something or you don\u2019t see something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\u00a0 So we are working on it, and as you noted, the President has the opportunity to see both families today.\nLet me add, too, that any country that is engaging in wrongful detention is a threat to the safety of everyone traveling, working, and living abroad.\u00a0 And I think, among other things, it\u2019s going to have a profoundly chilling effect on people anywhere being interested or willing to travel to those countries.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that they need to take account of.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve also discussed before \u2013 and more to follow \u2013 we are looking at additional steps to take to make it clear that countries that engage in these practices will pay a real price.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Final question goes to Hussain al-Adwan, Jordan Radio and Television.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Blinken, I need ask in Arabic.\n(Via interpreter)\u00a0 Mr. Blinken, at the time that we face regional crises, most of which is refugeeism, is there bilateral cooperation to confront this challenge?\nYour Excellency, DPM Safadi, is the support that the United States is offering \u2013 giving to Jordan sufficient to face the refugeeism \u2013 refugees crisis?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Inaudible), would you mind repeating the part \u2013 because I didn\u2019t quite hear the \u2013 the beginning of it.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter)\u00a0 At the time that we face regional crises in the region, Jordan and the United States are two solid partners.\u00a0 Is their cooperation between two sides to deal with the refugees crisis in the region?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much; thank you for repeating it.\u00a0 In short, yes, absolutely.\u00a0 First, I want to come back to something I said.\u00a0 Jordan has demonstrated remarkable generosity and remarkable leadership by welcoming so many refugees, hundreds of thousands, since the start of the war in Syria.\u00a0 But not just welcoming them; also offering them the possibility of going to school, going to work, earning a livelihood, and this is quite extraordinary and remarkable.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen it firsthand on visits to Jordan, and I think countries around the world should be inspired by Jordan\u2019s example.\u00a0 Because, just to take a step back for one minute, we now have more people on the move around the world displaced from their homes \u2013 more than 100 million \u2013 than at any time in recorded history.\u00a0 And among them, of course, are many refugees.\nSo this is a responsibility.\u00a0 It\u2019s a global challenge; it\u2019s a global responsibility.\u00a0 Jordan has stepped up in a very significant way to that responsibility.\u00a0 And yes, we\u2019re proud to be a partner in that effort.\u00a0 Since the war in Syria started, we the United States have provided about 15 and a half billion dollars in humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people, including refugees.\u00a0 More than 2 billion of that has gone to Jordan to assist Jordan in the work that it\u2019s doing to support these refugees.\u00a0 This year alone we announced more than $1.5 billion, including more than $750 million this week, to help Syrians, including those who are in Jordan.\nLike Jordan, we\u2019re also committed to finding an end to the conflict.\u00a0 We want to make sure that work is being done to try to advance a political settlement in Syria that\u2019s consistent with Security Council Resolution 2254.\u00a0 At the same time, we\u2019re working more broadly to try to expand humanitarian access in Syria so that people who are there can be helped.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019re working to keep the pressure on ISIS, on Daesh to sustain some of the local ceasefires that have taken shape, even as we remain committed to ensuring that there\u2019s accountability and respect for international law, given the grievous violations of international law and atrocities that have been committed over so many years in Syria.\u00a0 But all of these things together go to the work that we\u2019re doing in partnership to help Jordan as it helps so many people.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 The short answer is that the United States has gone above and beyond in terms of helping us cope with the challenge of refugees.\u00a0 As the Secretary just said, a tremendous amount of money was sent to help us meet the needs of refugees not just in Jordan, but wherever they are in the region and beyond.\u00a0 But meeting the needs of refugees cannot be the responsibility of the U.S. and Jordan alone.\u00a0 This is a global responsibility; it\u2019s a global challenge.\u00a0 All of us need to come together to ensure that refugees get the dignified lives that that they deserve.\u00a0 The U.S. is doing its part; we in Jordan are doing our part.\u00a0 A lot of our partners are contributing, but I must say that this is a time where we see dwindling amount of support for refugees.\u00a0 And I think all of us need to come together to make sure that refugees and host countries get the resources they need to offer refugees education, health services, and a hope for the future.\nI was just telling my dear friend here that 50 percent of Syrians, of the 1.3 million Syrians in Jordan, are under the age of 15.\u00a0 They need schools, they need universities, they need jobs.\u00a0 And that problem is still there, and we must do everything we can to provide those refugees with the lives they deserve, because the fact is if we provide refugees with hope, with education, with jobs, with a shot at decent lives, they\u2019ll be a \u2013 positive members of the societies in which they are now, and they\u2019ll be the force that will be able to build their countries in the future.\u00a0 But if we abandon them to hate and despair and ignorance, then we\u2019re all looking at a very gloomy future for them and for the region.\u00a0 So that support needs to continue to come in.\nAnd as the Secretary said, we also have to work on a political solution to this crisis.\u00a0 It\u2019s gone on for far too long, caused too much suffering, too much pain, and 2254 is a benchmark against which we all need to work towards realizing an end to this crisis and find a solution that will allow people to go back to their country voluntarily and resume the building of (inaudible).\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0That concludes the press conference.\u00a0 Thank you, Your excellencies.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Purdue University", "location": "West Lafayette, Indiana", "date": "September 13, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 This is an amazing turnout.\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe there wasn\u2019t something better to do.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Is there an extra credit or something?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThank you.\u00a0 Great to be with you.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a wonderful day here at Purdue.\u00a0 I was here with my colleague and friend from the administration Gina Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce, and we spent the morning with President Daniels, with Senator Young and Governor Holcomb, and in part we were here to celebrate and spotlight the passage of some really important legislation, the CHIPS and Science Act, which is going to help ensure that the United States remains the leader in semiconductors and chip technology.\nBut what I had a chance to see here today firsthand is what an extraordinary institution Purdue is. And the thing that came most to mind to me was that it\u2019s got to be one of the leading, if not the leading, human fabs for the next generation of people who are going to lead us, lead this country, into the technological future, into the scientific future, into the innovative future. And that\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing and it\u2019s \u2013 makes a big difference just being here in person, getting a feel for it, and getting to meet so many of you.\nBut there\u2019s a particular reason that I wanted to come to this classroom today, and that\u2019s I\u2019ve got a devious purpose in mind.\u00a0 We want you.\u00a0 We want you to consider coming into government at some point in your careers, doing something in public service, and maybe even something at the State Department.\u00a0 And I want us to talk about that just a little bit because it may not seem like the most obvious connection in the world.\u00a0 Why is someone from the State Department, dealing with America\u2019s foreign policy and our role in the world to coming here, talking to incredible people that were focused in STEM?\u00a0 And it\u2019s pretty simple, and this is what I wanted to share with you, and then I\u2019m really eager to have a conversation.\nI\u2019ve been doing this for nearly 30 years, and as I was moving along and working on all of these different foreign policy challenges that we get, it became more and more apparent to me that so much of what we were working on, so many of the problems that we were trying to solve, actually had a profound connection to science, technology, innovation.\u00a0 And often the answer, or at least part of the answer, had science and tech somewhere as part of it.\nBut here\u2019s the problem.\u00a0 Many of us who are working in government on foreign policy don\u2019t come up through this lens of science.\u00a0 We tend to be humanities majors; too many of us have law degrees \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 don\u2019t need too many more of those.\u00a0 And it really got to the point where I said to myself that we need scientists and technologists around the table just to tell us whether we need scientists and technologists around the table, because we need people to help identify not just the problems but a different angle on the solutions that some of us were used to bringing to the table.\nAnd so we started to do things \u2013 this is back during the Obama administration, when I last served \u2013 to try to do just that, to actually bring more people from STEM disciplines into government, through internships, through fellowships, through new programs.\u00a0 And now that I\u2019m back doing this, we\u2019re in \u2013 even more than we were just six or seven years ago \u2013 I think in an entirely different place in a few ways.\nFirst, virtually all of the technology that is going to be already but will continue in even more profound ways to shape our lives, to shape the way we live, the way we work, the way we interact, the way we compete \u2013 each and every one of those, whether it is quantum, whether it\u2019s AI, whether it\u2019s biotech, whether it\u2019s the chip itself, there is a profound connection between what we do here at home and what we\u2019re doing around the world.\u00a0 Here at home, we\u2019re making the right investments, but around the world we have to find ways to bring others along, because the way this technology gets used \u2013 the rules, the norms, the standards that people agree on that govern their use \u2013 is going to have a profound impact in and of itself on the way that we live and the way that we work.\u00a0 And is it going to happen in a way that reflects, we hope, our basic values of openness and tolerance and respect for privacy, or is it going to happen in a different way?\u00a0 So we need to be at the table when we\u2019re \u2013 all of these things are getting decided, and we need to have people at the table who actually know what they\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one thing.\nThe other thing is so many of the problems we\u2019re trying to solve, as I said, have a clear technology, innovation, science aspect to their solution.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to figure out how to do a better job overcoming profound crises in food security around the world.\u00a0 There\u2019s going to be part of that where the answer is grounded in science, in technology, in agro science.\u00a0 If we\u2019re trying to figure out how to prevent the next pandemic, we know there\u2019s going to be an answer that\u2019s grounded in science and technology as well as in the policies that we pursue to advance it.\nWe\u2019re trying to think about how we protect our economy, particularly dealing with climate change, and how we make an energy transition that makes sense, that keeps faith with keeping people employed but also keeps faith with trying to protect the planet.\u00a0 That\u2019s probably going to have an answer that\u2019s also grounded in science and technology.\nIt\u2019s a long way of saying so many of the things that we\u2019re actually doing day in, day out at the State Department are all about many of the things that many of you are interested in, working on, and becoming expert in.\u00a0 And I\u2019m here to tell you that the State Department is one place where you can actually pursue that passion, pursue that interest, and do it in a couple of novel and interesting ways.\nOne, doing it working for your country.\u00a0 That has its own value that\u2019s hard to really quantify.\u00a0 And two, getting to do it around the world in really interesting ways and engaging with incredibly interesting people.\u00a0 So I really hope this is something that some of you will at least consider as you\u2019re thinking about where you want to go, where your careers will take you.\nI\u2019ve had the experience, as you\u2019ve heard, in working in government, working in the private sector, working in different pursuits.\u00a0 And at least for me, there\u2019s been something unique about getting to go to work every day and either literally or figuratively having a flag behind your back.\u00a0 There\u2019s something particularly special about that, hard to quantify.\u00a0 And yeah, the benefits may be better elsewhere \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but there\u2019s something particularly special about that.\u00a0 So I hope as you\u2019re thinking about it, whether it\u2019s now, in five years, 10 years, 20 years down the road, think about giving some time to public service.\nI said this a little bit earlier today.\u00a0 I know there\u2019s a lot of cynicism about it and sometimes for every understandable reasons, but I can tell you from my own experience that virtually all the people that I get to work with every day, whether it\u2019s in the administration, whether it\u2019s in Congress, Republicans, Democrats, Independents \u2013 they\u2019re all there because they\u2019re trying to do what they think is the right thing to do to make the country just a little bit better, a little bit safer, a little bit healthier, a little bit wealthier, create opportunities for people.\u00a0 We have disagreements about the best way to do that, and that\u2019s fine.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u00a0 But most people are really motivated to try to do the right thing, and if you can find a group of likeminded people, you can actually get a few things done.\nSo that\u2019s really what I wanted to share at the outset.\u00a0 I\u2019m eager to have some questions.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s particularly interesting and important \u2013 I would like to have a colleague join us who has \u2013 I think can speak better than I can to how (inaudible) grounded in STEM and in the sciences actually can make a career in the State Department.\u00a0 So Mahlet Mesfin,\u00a0who is one of my science and tech advisers, let you say a few words and maybe share your own experience.\nMS MESFIN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s truly an honor to be here today with you and all the students at Purdue.\u00a0 A little bit of background about me.\u00a0 I have degrees in chemical engineering, a masters and PhD in bioengineering.\u00a0 I became an engineer because I was interested in solving problems and I wanted to make the world a better place, and I liked science and I liked math.\u00a0 But through my grad degree I realized that I could do that in many different ways.\u00a0 And so I did one of the fellowship programs the Secretary mentioned, came down to D.C., and 10 years later, a few different career moves, here I am at the State Department as a senior advisor speaking next to the Secretary of State of the United States of America.\u00a0 And I can truly say that that is never a path that I ever imagined would come.\nI just want to talk a little bit about different career options \u2013 is it not on?\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 A few different career sort of tracks if you\u2019re interested in policy careers at the State Department.\u00a0 So STEM experts can come to the State Department and actually work in the areas in which you were trained, and that\u2019s what you do day to day.\u00a0 So people I work with on the teams that are out there around the world, sort of helping to address outbreaks of diseases, whether it\u2019s Ebola or COVID or monkeypox or others.\u00a0 There are teams there that are in the middle of negotiating with countries around the world about how we are going to protect our oceans and our biodiversity.\u00a0 There\u2019s people who are thinking through with international partners and domestic agencies as well how are we defining the principles that will dictate how technologies are developed and used.\u00a0 So those are usually civil servants and they\u2019re scattered throughout the department, and that\u2019s one option.\nYou also have people who have STEM backgrounds who can come and not necessarily do anything that they\u2019ve been trained to do, so they\u2019re more generalists.\u00a0 I\u2019m one of those people.\u00a0 On a day-to-day basis some things I think about are semiconductors or biotechnology or water security or internet freedom or kind of anything in between.\u00a0 And so civil servants can be generalists, but we also have a Foreign Service track at the State Department, which is a generalist of a different kind.\u00a0 And it\u2019s exciting because you get to live all over the world; you get to be in embassies, and you get to change jobs, change countries every two or three years.\u00a0 But you can have sort of an environment, science, technology, health portfolio, and we need more of those people around the world as well.\nSo whether it\u2019s a subject matter expert or a generalist or anything in between, I think, as the Secretary mentioned, technology issues will continue to grow and to be so important, and we need people like you in the table \u2013 or at the table, in the room, really helping to shape and drive U.S. policy and diplomacy.\u00a0 And it is a unique experience that you can get really nowhere else.\nAnd so the last thing I\u2019ll just say is I think that sometimes I feel like my career is kind of like a dream that I never knew that I had.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And so I think that it\u2019s really exciting that all of you guys are here, here learning about these opportunities and kind of the realm of the possibilities.\u00a0 And I hope that one day one of those possibilities will bring you to work for the department.\u00a0 So thank you very much, and I turn it back over to you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

This is, I think, the most exciting human fab that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0 And building the next generation of leaders in technology \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly powerful.\u00a0 So I couldn\u2019t agree more, and I\u2019m really, Mitch, just grateful to you, grateful to our colleagues for bringing us here and making sure that we could experience this firsthand.\nSo why am I here, since my portfolio does not usually extend to things domestic?\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty simple.\u00a0 What we do here at home goes directly to our standing and our ability to lead around the world.\u00a0 And when other countries see us coming together in the way we\u2019ve been able to come together with the CHIPS Act, not just across parties, but across academia, industry, government, at the state level, the federal level, that sends a very powerful message.\u00a0 And it says that we\u2019re going to be making the investments that we need to remain the world\u2019s leader in the most critical technology that\u2019s defining our future.\u00a0 And that becomes a really powerful source of attraction. Other countries want to work with us; they want to partner with us; they want to stand with us.\u00a0 So for me, the investments that we\u2019re making at home, they go directly to my ability to help effectively represent the country around the world.\nFinally, I\u2019d say this, Mitch, to your question as well:\u00a0 Look, we are also dealing with other countries around the world that are making massive investments in the industries and technologies of the future.\u00a0 I think one of the things that separates us is when government comes in, what it can do most effectively is to really be a catalyst for the private sector and other stakeholders in our country to move forward.\u00a0 So this is not about government doing and paying for everything.\u00a0 It\u2019s government, hopefully, bringing people together in a smart way, acting as a catalyst, and inspiring the kind of investment we need to carry us forward.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Senator?\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0 Well, I want to thank Purdue for putting on such a great presentation today.\u00a0 And I say that directly to the postdocs we heard from, many of the rank-and-file students, and of course the professors.\u00a0 It really is impressive, and I think it\u2019s indicative of the fact that Indiana is ready to go as it relates to implementing this effort.\nThis effort, from the beginning, it\u2019s been focused on enhancing our economic security and our national security at once.\u00a0 Anyone that \u2013 who needs evidence that our economic security has been undermined by our inability to source especially high-end chips here in the United States, but even some of the commodity chips, need look no further than Fort Wayne, Indiana, where you\u2019ve seen an idling of a GM plant twice this year already.\u00a0 Visit some of our farmers who are unable to get their combines fixed because the essential computer chips that go into those machinery cannot be sourced.\u00a0 Basically anything with an on/off switch these days requires microprocessors, and so our country is going to have to have at least some measure of independence with respect to these to prepare for the next interruption.\u00a0 It could be a global pandemic or it could be a geopolitical rival that, with great intentionality, decides to interrupt sourcing of these computer chips from other countries.\nNow, how do we get them here in the United States?\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty clear what other countries are doing.\u00a0 They were offering some measure of incentives.\u00a0 It\u2019s analogous to a governor offering incentives to get an employer into their state.\nThe happy coincidence that we will reference from time to time is what benefits our economic security also benefits the industrial Midwest, where for generations we\u2019ve prided ourself on making things.\u00a0 These are higher-end things, so we include funding to prepare people to research, to design, and ultimately to manufacture these computer chips here in the industrial Midwest.\nAnd there\u2019s a national security component to this which also cannot go unmentioned.\u00a0 Our missile systems, basically all of our high-end weapon platforms require very sophisticated computer chips, and we need to make those here and ensure that they\u2019re made in a trusted fashion, not tampered with, and so we have the resident capability \u2013 I\u2019m looking at representatives from Crane.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been experts at \u2013 in this area of microchip production and inspection for a generation now, and we\u2019re going to be able to saddle them up and get them more into the game.\nSo it\u2019s at once mentioned \u2013 this is an economic security and a national security play, and one that will have the spillover effect of significantly benefiting people here in this room but really all across the industrial Midwest.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Well, thanks.\u00a0 The \u2013 Madam Secretary, most of the money and most of the attention so far on the CHIPS Act has focused on the manufacturing end and the fact that we have fallen as far as we have in terms of our share of world production, but you\u2019ve made I think the excellent point that the R&D investments, if properly directed and successful, might be just as important over time.\u00a0 Would \u2013 can you elaborate on that a little?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Yes, thank you.\u00a0 So the CHIPS Act is a $50 billion investment, and all of the excitement and coverage frequently focuses on the 39 billion that will be incentives for companies to build fabs in America, which we desperately need.\u00a0 But there\u2019s 11 billion for research and development.\nAmerica has always been and will always be a country of inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs.\u00a0 That\u2019s what makes us great.\u00a0 It\u2019s at core to our strength.\u00a0 And as I said before, we\u2019ve fallen behind.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t been investing enough in basic research.\u00a0 We heard it today.\u00a0 We heard it today on the tour how much of what is happening here began with a federal grant, whether it\u2019s from NIST or the Department of Defense, some collaboration between the federal government and universities.\nSo this 11 billion will be for the National Semiconductor and Technology Center, and it is \u2013 we talked today about going from lab to fab.\u00a0 We talked about how if you want to compete, you have to go fast, you have to reduce the time between lab and fab.\u00a0 That\u2019s what this is for.\u00a0 So what we\u2019re envisioning is exactly what you\u2019re doing here, quite frankly, which is bringing together universities with companies, with the federal government, to solve problems \u2013 interdisciplinary hubs of research and development to solve problems.\u00a0 Very applied.\nThink of Bell Labs, right?\u00a0 A lot of you are smiling.\u00a0 The young people are like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 There\u2019s a great book about it.\u00a0 Go google Bell Labs.\u00a0 The loss \u2013 the diminishing of Bell Labs was a real loss for this country.\u00a0 It was a beehive of activity, a place where inventors and innovators could come together to solve problems and produce an enormous amount of research and great products.\nSo I \u2013 yeah, I\u2019m excited about it.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just building stuff.\u00a0 We talked today about packaging, design.\u00a0 It\u2019s all of that.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this will be for.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Did you want to lead the witness with a question about workforce?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0 So a few times today, the Secretary has said this is a human fab, a talent fab, which is true.\u00a0 And every company you talk to, literally every one including the ones in booths, will tell you the thing they\u2019re most worried about is talent.\u00a0 The rate limiting factor to growth is talent.\u00a0 And by the way, it\u2019s at every level.\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 Process engineers, technicians, to the PhD physicists and the like.\u00a0 Your governor has done a lot here around talent and developing workforce development, so maybe you could talk a little bit, Governor, about what\u2019s working here and how we scale it to meet \u2013 to meet the needs.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 A lot\u2019s going on.\u00a0 Let me first say that I share our Hoosier guests\u2019 excitement and enthusiasm about what we saw here today at Purdue.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spent most of my life in this state, and every time I come back to the campus I, too, am blown away because they\u2019re working on current issues and vexing, lingering problems that the nation faces and certainly we do as a state.\u00a0 But I\u2019m reminded as a student of history surrounded by engineers that might \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as a student of history I\u2019m reminded of a famous quote from Colonel George Rogers Clark before our nation was even founded, and I\u2019ll paraphrase.\u00a0 And he said: Great things can be accomplished by men \u2013 and women \u2013 well conducted.\u00a0 And so while this was bipartisan, it was also, as Secretary Blinken noted, a multifaceted, multi-government-level effort.\u00a0 And harnessing not just that purpose but the passion that we all bring to bear has been equally exciting.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And by the way, well-conducted may be the perfect term for this.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0Choosing my quotes carefully.\u00a0 But that leads us to challenges throughout history, certainly Colonel Clark, but also President Kennedy when he laid out a challenge.\u00a0 And to be in this very hall is a reminder of that.\u00a0 And then the objectives, Secretary Raimondo, that you put forward with the CHIPS and Science Act really got us synchronized, and tactically and strategically as a state.\u00a0 And of course, the research has been ongoing.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019ve been reaching out and working with companies like SkyWater and Mediatech for \u2013 on the design and the fab portion of this project.\nBut it really starts much earlier than that if we\u2019re going to truly have a pipeline that\u2019s going to be able to supply that talent on an ongoing basis, and to be able to scale at the rate and velocity that\u2019s required for us not just to compete but catch up and lead.\u00a0 And so we start very early in the state of Indiana, very intentionally, with K through 12 \u2013 and you mentioned lab to fab.\u00a0 We view this as GED to PhD.\u00a0 And everyone has not just a role to play, but an opportunity to play it, and the state of Indiana is putting our money where our mouth is and making those investments regionally to be able to respond to the needs of not just the industry, but of the community.\u00a0 Our community college is here today as well, Ivy Tech.\u00a0 Vincennes University will have a prominent role in this, making sure students that come out of high school have a brightly lit pathway that they can contribute to this national and economic security issue.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Same question to you, President Daniels. You have done extraordinary things here \u2013 country\u2019s first semiconductor master\u2019s degree program.\u00a0 What have you learned and where do we go from here?\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Listening to the question and the answers has me reflecting back \u2013 I\u2019m near the end of 10 years here.\u00a0 But one of the first major speeches I was asked to give was to the National Academy of Engineers in 2013.\u00a0 And at that time, the \u2013 on everyone\u2019s mind was the Augustine Report, a national commission which had reported, oh, within a year or two before that, and its primary finding was the single most important thing to the nation\u2019s competitiveness and future success was to turn out at least 10,000 more engineers a year.\u00a0 Well, that happened to coincide with our plans and dreams for the growth of Purdue University, and specifically in the engineering and the STEM disciplines.\nAnd I remember telling that audience Purdue will speak for the first 7 or 8 percent; you folks figure out the rest.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve done that.\u00a0 We are now by a clear margin the largest engineering college, for instance, in the top five in the world.\u00a0 Similar growth has happened in computer science, the natural sciences, and applied engineering through our newly expanded polytechnic institute.\u00a0\u00a0 So we are trying to do our part \u2013 the governor mentioned our community college.\u00a0 We\u2019re offering our curriculum, all that applies to them, so that they can produce associate degrees.\u00a0 Many of those we hope will advance on to bachelor\u2019s degrees in semiconductor technology, the entire spectrum from materials through design to ultimate manufacturing.\u00a0 So we\u2019re excited about the role.\nI guess the last thing I\u2019ll say is we should all be sober about the challenges here.\u00a0 There\u2019s a labor shortage in this country.\u00a0 This state, largely through some great public leadership, is below the level we have thought of as full employment.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a02.6.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Unthinkable percentage not long ago.\u00a0 And by the way, the participation rate, which is stubbornly low in the country, is higher by a couple points in Indiana.\u00a0 It\u2019s not as though people aren\u2019t willing and eager to work.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve got our work cut out for us, not just because of the newness and complexity of this new \u2013 of this sector, but because we\u2019re going to have to build a semiconductor economy that attracts people when they have a lot of other choices.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, absolutely.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0So let me pick up on something that was mentioned a time or two.\u00a0 Many of us in this part of the country have imagined for a long time that the difference in, I\u2019ll say, business conditions, cost, quality of life, and other factors would lead ultimately to some migration of investment and people from the coasts to the Midwest, and a lot of people are talking about that. We\u2019re excited.\u00a0 We see what happened at Intel earlier this week.\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019re thrilled at the SkyWater investment, the only all-American-owned semiconductor company \u2013 (applause) \u2013 planning to come here.\nBut bring us a dose of realism if we need it.\u00a0 Our \u2013 will we look back at these as interesting exceptions or the beginning of a trend that does lead to this Silicon Heartland that people talk about?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I think you have all the ingredients.\u00a0 There\u2019s no reason it shouldn\u2019t be a trend, no reason it should not be a trend.\u00a0 You \u2013 and by the way, that\u2019s why the Midwest was once forever the industrial heartland.\u00a0 It\u2019s in your bones to make things here.\u00a0 And so we have to get back to it, making the next generation of more advanced \u2013 advanced manufacturing.\u00a0 But you have the research universities, the land grant research universities, what we saw today \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get any Big 10 rivalries up, but Ohio State\u2019s pretty good, Michigan\u2019s pretty good, Michigan State.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0They\u2019re really not rivals.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I know \u2013 okay.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I\u2019m \u2014\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t worry.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m tiptoeing into this, but we\u2019ll just say a deep well of public universities which are top notch.\u00a0 Every CEO I\u2019ve talked to today is thinking about climate risk.\u00a0 The Midwest is actually very well positioned in that regard \u2013 not that anywhere is immune from climate disasters and weather, severe weather events, but well positioned, plenty of water, reasonable energy prices.\u00a0 And so I \u2013 and a hub, as you just said, with Intel and SkyWater, so you\u2019re building from a base.\u00a0 So I think that it ought to be a trend.\u00a0 It should be a trend, and I think if you continue to make the right investments in workforce training, investing in your public universities, in having good business practices, good place to do business, I feel great about the opportunity.\nAnd by the way, it\u2019s good for the country.\u00a0 When you walk around and you hear from some of the students, are all the opportunities on the coasts?\u00a0 As someone from the coast, no.\u00a0 The opportunity\u2019s right here, and any of these companies would be lucky to have you.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Governor, you want to say an amen to that?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 Well, thanks \u2013 yeah, thanks for the softball.\u00a0 Yeah, I mean, as a \u2013 the reason I\u2019m most encouraged is this is nothing new to us.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing this since the founding of our state, forging our way out of the forest and innovating and manufacturing and making things, growing things.\u00a0 We\u2019ve figured that out.\u00a0 We\u2019ve developed very mature supply chain lines in multiple sectors.\u00a0 When you think about our state, orthopedics, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, logistics \u2013 all of these areas are dependent on that linchpin, that semiconductor, that transistor that\u2019s going to make, that\u2019s going to power not just our future but our \u2013 the actual companies.\nAnd what the \u2013 I think one of the big items involved in this whole act is the federal government putting skin in the game in such a big way has allowed our companies to now take risks that they maybe couldn\u2019t afford to take before.\u00a0 And so as we coalesce around this mission \u2013 and it truly is just that \u2013 it\u2019s going to attract more FDI, more foreign direct investment, but it\u2019s going to attract more SkyWaters and more designers, and that whole ecosystem will grow as we have been doing over the last couple centuries, tethered to the industries of the future.\u00a0 And, obviously, we have the right tax and regulatory environment, we have the energy, the fresh water, unlike some of our competitors around the world.\nAnd so it really is advantage Indiana, not to mention we\u2019re here at Purdue \u2013 proudly so \u2013 but we also sport, so to speak, Notre Dame and Indiana University and Trine.\u00a0 So we have this network of colleges and universities, public and private, community colleges as well, that really are the feeder system into a SkyWater\u2019s bright future.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 In a moment we\u2019re going to get to a couple of student questions, but I have one more, and if I may, let me start with the Secretary of State.\u00a0 Switching geographies here in a big way, you were among the very first \u2013 along with our good friend Keith Krach and others \u2013 to begin identifying the growing number of ways in which technology issues were intruding on and overlapping with foreign policy issues.\u00a0 We now refer to this under the heading of tech diplomacy sometimes.\u00a0 I \u2013 for all I know, you coined the term.\u00a0 But as an early thought leader in this area, could you talk a little bit about that and how some of the work that will happen here has implications for the work you do every day?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mitch, this really came out of necessity more than anything else.\u00a0 For my sins I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in government \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 now 30 years.\u00a0 And last time I was in government, during the Obama administration, working at the White House and the State Department, sitting around these conference tables grappling with foreign policy problems, challenges we had around the world, it struck me \u2013 and not a novel insight, but it nonetheless struck me that so many of the solutions or at least part of the solution probably had a science or tech component to it, and yet most of us who are working on foreign policy are not brought up in these disciplines.\u00a0 If you look, there are exceptions, but for the most part people are coming from the humanities, coming from law, and so it\u2019s not our natural instinct.\nAnd I came to the point where I thought that I needed scientists and technologists around the table just to tell me whether we needed scientists and technologists around the table to figure something out that we weren\u2019t necessarily seeing.\u00a0 And so we made a real effort to do that, because what we saw is that, look, whether you\u2019re dealing with everything from trying to figure out how to monitor an arms control agreement, to pulling a land mine out of the ground, to tracking refugees around the world, to building stronger food security systems, to electrifying different parts of the planet that need it \u2013 and I could go down the list \u2013 science, technology, engineering, all of that was front and center.\nAnd now, of course, as we are dealing with a world that is shaped \u2013 our lives are literally shaped day in, day out by technology, starting with the chip \u2013 but whether it\u2019s quantum, whether it\u2019s AI, whether it\u2019s biotech, the way we live, the way we work, all of that is shaped by technology.\u00a0 So that\u2019s one piece of it.\nThe other piece of it is that whether we like it or not, in order to make sure that technology is being used in a way that hopefully advances our interests, hopefully reflects our values, we have to be engaged with other countries.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have the luxury of getting to decide this and shape this alone.\u00a0 And so for us, at least, getting into that tech diplomacy, making sure that the United States is at the table when decisions are being made \u2013 for example, about what are the rules, what are the norms, what are the standards that decide how technology is going to be used.\u00a0 Well, a lot of that\u2019s happening in some windowless room somewhere around the world.\u00a0 We need to be there, and not only do we need to be there, we need to be able to carry the debate.\u00a0 And part of that is making sure we have the most talented expert people doing this.\u00a0 Part of it is also making sure that we have the alliances and partnerships of likeminded countries so that our collective weight can carry the day.\nAll of this is part of tech diplomacy, but there is issue after issue where this is front and center in what we\u2019re doing every day.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to protect businesses and the country from cyber attacks, unfortunately something that\u2019s increasingly prevalent.\u00a0 Well, that goes directly to our capacity to understand, deal with, and bring others along when it comes to creating a protective system.\u00a0 We want to make sure that technology is not used for ill.\u00a0 We see technology being used by surveillance states.\u00a0 That\u2019s a huge problem that we\u2019re contending with.\u00a0 We see technology potentially undermining privacy.\u00a0 But again, all of these things, if we\u2019re going to be effective in dealing with them, we have to be doing this on a global scale, not just here at home.\nSo we\u2019ve been inspired by that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve actually tried to build a State Department that\u2019s more fit for purpose.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t our natural bread and butter.\u00a0 We\u2019re usually in the business of trying to prevent conflicts or bring peace, and that\u2019s still the bread and butter, but technology may be a big piece of that.\u00a0 But we need to make sure that we actually have the organization and the talent to do it.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is just a few months ago we set up \u2013 the State Department\u2019s organized around bureaus.\u00a0 These are the most important components of the organizational structure of our department.\u00a0 We established a bureau for cyber security and digital policy.\u00a0 We now have a senior envoy for emerging technology.\u00a0 We want to make sure that we can play our part, we can do what we need to do, to help advance the national interest when it comes to this.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 By fascinating coincidence, we\u2019re having to learn something about your world too.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud to tell you that Purdue has thrown its arms open.\u00a0 We have welcomed more Ukrainian scholars than any other school we\u2019re aware of, and I look forward, of course, to them being able to go home safely, but for now they can continue their work here.\nAnd in addition to that, we welcome on an annual basis a number of refugees from the state of Illinois \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 who I\u2019m always proud to greet. \u00a0And one of them is our questioner this morning, so let me introduce Denae Galloway, an ECE student from Orland Hills I believe it is.\u00a0 Denae.\u00a0 And thank you for joining us this morning, and your question, please.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you for having me.\u00a0 Secretary Raimondo, we\u2019ve heard a lot this morning about the need to fill jobs in the semiconductor industry.\u00a0 So how can young students, especially women as myself, prepare to be competitive in this growing market?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Yeah, great question.\u00a0 So let me say a few things about this.\u00a0 The Governor and President referenced the talent shortage and the tight labor market, and you asked for some \u2013 a sobering comment.\u00a0 We have to be very real about the fact that if we don\u2019t as a country, as industry, figure out how to fully tap into and unleash the talent of women in tech companies, we will not compete.\u00a0 We cannot compete if we leave our most talented women out of the equation.\u00a0 And now, maybe when I say that you\u2019re thinking: Well, it\u2019s hard; women don\u2019t stick with it, this that and the other.\u00a0 I will stipulate that.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard.\u00a0 I agree with you.\u00a0 You\u2019re in the business of solving problems.\u00a0 Solve the problem.\u00a0 We have to solve the problem together.\nLet\u2019s think about teaching engineering differently.\u00a0 Let\u2019s think about mentorship initiatives.\u00a0 Let\u2019s think about starting earlier.\u00a0 The Governor talks about from pre-K and such \u2013 start when girls are four, five years old.\u00a0 I \u2013 prior to this gig, I was the Governor of Rhode Island, and one of the things I did there was we became I think the first state in the country to teach computer science in every public school, in every grade, starting in kindergarten.\u00a0 And we did that by partnering with companies to do it \u2013 innovative.\u00a0 And since we did that, not surprisingly, the number of women and students of color taking and succeeding on the AP Computer Science exam skyrocketed.\u00a0 So we just have to do it.\u00a0 We have to find ways to have more women at every level of science, technology, engineering, and math in academia and in business.\nAnd for the women, obviously what you need to do is what you\u2019re doing: Go to a world-class institution, work as hard as you can, seek out mentorship, and if you\u2019re trained here and you do well, you will get a job and you \u2013 as I said before, a company will be lucky to have you.\u00a0 And I would say, on a more personal level, although I\u2019m not a scientist \u2013 my dad was a chemist; he always wished that I could be, but I don\u2019t know, that wasn\u2019t my path \u2013 politics, every business, a lot of industries \u2013 I used to be in the business world; I sat on a dozen corporate boards, never with another man.\u00a0 I was the first female governor of Rhode Island.\u00a0 You\u2019ve just got to stick with it.\u00a0 Stick with it, because the world needs you to stick with it, because you have the talent and ability to solve the problems that we need to be solved.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Thank you, Denae.\u00a0 Great question.\u00a0 And we have a question from Jack Brewer, from right here in West Lafayette, a political science major.\u00a0 Jack.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, I\u2019d first like to start off by saying thank you on behalf of the entire student body for being here today.\u00a0 And my question is: As you had the opportunity to see today, Purdue is currently hosting the Industrial Roundtable, which is one of the largest student-run job fairs in the nation.\u00a0 And I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the Department of State is currently looking for new talent, and I was wondering, what sorts of skills or attributes are you guys looking for out of new hires?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 I love this.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Asking for a friend?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Happy to take a look at a CV right after this.\u00a0 We can talk.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIt really flows exactly from what we were talking about a few minutes ago, which is \u2013 it\u2019s pretty simple.\u00a0 We need and we are looking for folks who are not just trained and experienced in the humanities; we need STEM.\u00a0 We need engineers. \u00a0We need technologists.\u00a0 We need folks who are steeped in AI and biotech, you name it.\u00a0 And we need that because of what we were just talking about.\u00a0 So many of the issues that we are actually dealing with every single day are crosscutting and bring in science and technology in ways that we have to make sure we\u2019re ready and effective in doing our jobs.\nSo one of things that we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re here at Purdue.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to open people\u2019s eyes to the possibility of not only public service, which by the way, whatever it is, if you \u2013 any of you get a chance to do that, please consider it.\u00a0 We need the most talented people in public service.\u00a0 And what I\u2019ve experienced, just as a parenthesis, as I know there can be a lot of cynicism about it at times, but most of the people that I\u2019m fortunate enough to work with, including everyone on this platform today, are just trying to do what they think is the right thing to make the country a little bit healthier, wealthier, wiser, stronger.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what really counts.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut if you\u2019re interested in climate policy, come to the State Department.\u00a0 We are trying to \u2013 John Kerry is leading efforts by now to make sure that we are bringing the rest of the world along with us as we try to grapple with this issue.\u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in cyber security and cyber policy, well, we\u2019re trying to be at the leading edge of that.\u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in any one of the many challenges that we\u2019re \u2013 that we face that have technology and science at their heart, come on down to the State Department.\u00a0 We need you.\nSo I\u2019m really glad that we\u2019re here, but I\u2019m especially glad that you asked the question because I know it might not be the natural instinct of people to say, \u201cOh, the State Department\u2019s a place that I can work.\u201d\u00a0 But if you look at the many things that we\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll probably find an avenue to actually do what you\u2019ve been trained in and want to do and actually make a difference \u2013 make a difference here in the United States for our country, but also make a difference around the world.\nSo we really welcome hearing from people.\u00a0 We have \u2013 we\u2019re bringing in fellows from the sciences.\u00a0 We have, as I said, new bureaus that are focused on science and technological pursuits.\u00a0 We want to make sure that we have the talent to actually fill those bureaus, run those bureaus, and carry us into the future \u2013 so \u2013 and I\u2019ll see you just around the corner.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Thank you, Jack.\u00a0 We\u2019re down literally to our last few minutes, so let me just offer each of the group, lightning-round style, a chance to address this general question:\u00a0 This new achievement in which each of you played a significant role of the CHIPS Act, if and when it succeeds and meets its expectations, what will Americans notice that\u2019s different?\u00a0 What will Americans see kind of ten years from now that they wouldn\u2019t have seen absent that accomplishment?\u00a0 Senator, would you go first?\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ll see a broadening and deepening of our startup and technology economy.\u00a0 It won\u2019t just include some of our coastal states and hot beds of venture capital investment, but we\u2019ll see it across the industrial Midwest and other areas.\u00a0 We\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re planting the seed corn, as we speak, to ensure that\u2019s the case.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see more opportunities for investors, entrepreneurs, and researchers and in places like Indiana.\nAnd I think we\u2019ll see enhanced national security.\u00a0 You\u2019ll see the United States of America leading the way when it comes to development and, as we work with partners and allies, co-development of the technologies of the future, which hopefully will allow us to prevent wars, but if ever called upon will allow us to fight and win the wars of the future with many of these technologies.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Governor.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0I think we\u2019ll see \u2013 just to echo the Senator\u2019s point \u2013 I think we\u2019ll see a continued broadening of our kind of seven sector development here in the State of Indiana.\u00a0 I\u2019m reminded by Secretary Blinken\u2019s comment earlier that as we get around the world, certainly part of my job is to try to bring more investment to the state of Indiana.\u00a0 And although I don\u2019t do foreign policy \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get on the wrong side of the Logan Act ever, wouldn\u2019t dream of it \u2013 but I am trying to bring back partnerships and solve problems together.\u00a0 And that requires a diverse perspective and that\u2019s going to help us get there faster as well.\u00a0 And so I\u2019m reminded with every visit I have that everyone has a neighbor to the north, south, east, or west and some are hostile; some are very friendly.\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0 Illinois?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 And they\u2019re looking for, seeking places of certainty and predictability and stability and continuity.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we offer, and so it truly is an exciting time to partner with Purdue, to partner with the corporate sector and local, state, and federal governments and see it actually work and make a difference.\u00a0 And I\u2019m confident it will.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0Madam Secretary.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0I think when history writes about this, it\u2019ll be the beginning of a new chapter of American manufacturing, innovation, research and development.\u00a0 I really do.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been on the decline, and this is the beginning of the incline.\u00a0 And if we do it right, all these hundreds of thousands of jobs we create will go to people who look like America, to your question.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Last word, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think it\u2019s been covered incredibly well and comprehensively.\u00a0 I\u2019d just say that what I would expect to see, if we sustain this \u2013 if we carry it forward, if we do it, if we actually implement it \u2013 I think you\u2019ll see a lasting recognition that America\u2019s back, America is back on the world (inaudible).\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to see that countries respond to the fact that we\u2019re making these investments in our future.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to want to work with us.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to want to partner with us.\u00a0 And they\u2019re going to want to look to our leadership too.\u00a0 And that is going to have a material impact on our ability to provide for the safety, the wellbeing, the prosperity of our people.\u00a0 So if we get this right \u2013 which is not a guarantee, but if we get it right \u2013\u00a0 I think it does wonders over time in strengthening our standing around the world and really strengthening American leadership.\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0Over recent years, Purdue University has been privileged to play host to some spectacular leadership from all sectors of all society, but never a day that I recall in which we\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve felt more fortunate to have leaders as relevant both to our national success and to the mission we\u2019ve attempted to adopt here at Purdue University.\nSo to Secretary Raimondo, Secretary Blinken, as well as our own Hoosier public servants, thank you for a day we\u2019ll remember a long time at Purdue and do all we can to live up to.\u00a0 Thank you all for coming.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\n"}, {"url":

BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone.\u00a0 It is incredibly exciting to be here at Purdue at the Birck Center.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen this morning is for me an incredible source of optimism, optimism about the future of our country, optimism about the leadership of our country around the world on the most important technology that\u2019s going to power this century and beyond.\u00a0 And I really just want to say mostly thank you to President Daniels, who was with us earlier, to the governor, the senator, for \u2013 not just for today, but I have to say for your remarkable leadership across the board in making sure here at Purdue that the United States remains the great technology leader in the world.\nThis place is maybe one of the most inspiring human fabs that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0 And we know that some of the students that we met today are going to go on to do extraordinary things in the years ahead.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is this:\u00a0 Why am I here as Secretary of State?\u00a0 Simply because what we\u2019re doing at home, and particularly what is happening here, goes directly to our standing and leadership in the world.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve seen in American technological leadership in general and what we\u2019ve seen just in recent weeks with the passage of the CHIPS Act, that is resonating around the world.\u00a0 And I really want to applaud in particular Senator Young for his extraordinary leadership from the takeoff to the landing of the CHIPS Act.\u00a0 This is one of the most significant things that we\u2019ve done as a country, and just speaking as someone who has the responsibility of representing our country around the world, it is making a big difference around the world as well as here at home in the jobs of the future that we\u2019re going to be creating too.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Gina.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Thank you and good morning.\u00a0 Thank you all, Boilermakers, who welcomed us today.\u00a0 We had a fantastic tour this morning, and thank you to President Daniels, who welcomed us.\u00a0 Thank you to my colleagues \u2013 fantastic partner in Tony Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you to the governor, who has helped us get the CHIPS Act over the finish line.\u00a0 But big thank you to Senator Young.\u00a0 Truly without whom CHIPS would not have happened.\u00a0 He was an early sponsor and stuck with it all the way through.\u00a0 So thank you.\u00a0 It was a bipartisan effort, which I think is a critical thing to point out.\nAnd the CHIPS Act is a \u2013 it\u2019s an investment in America.\u00a0 It\u2019s actually the biggest investment in kind of industrial policy, research, and development that we\u2019ve seen in a generation in America.\u00a0 And it will unleash not only R&D, but the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of high\u2011paying jobs in the semiconductor industry all over America, including in the heartland, right here in Indiana.\u00a0 And Purdue, what\u2019s happening here, is at the heart \u2013 is at the heart and soul of that, the center of that.\u00a0 We talked today about going from lab to fab.\u00a0 It\u2019s about taking research and development that starts in research university and bringing it through to products that power American innovation.\nI also want to announce this morning that the Department of Commerce through NIST, the National Institute of Standards, which is in the Department of Commerce, is announcing a partnership with SkyWater right here in Indiana, a semiconductor company, and Google to provide free-of-cost, open source wafer designs to universities, so that we can do exactly the kind of research that\u2019s happening here in this facility.\u00a0 By providing these designs for free, open source, this is a public-private federal government collaboration that will help us to fuel this sort of wafer technology in research and development.\u00a0 So exactly what the CHIPS Act was meant to do, and exactly what you\u2019re doing so well here at Purdue.\u00a0 So thank you for having us.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 Thank you, Madam Secretary, and I think it\u2019s fair to say our longtime friendship has taken us to many places both past, present, and most importantly, maybe most excitingly into the future.\nAnd Secretary Blinken, it is truly a proud moment for all Hoosiers to welcome you to our state.\u00a0 President Daniels, thank you for rolling out the red carpet yet again.\u00a0 This is \u2014\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0 Not red.\n(Laughter.)\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0Roll out the golden carpet.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He makes a habit of correcting me.\u00a0 But let me just say what this highlights to me, and what the source of my pride is:\u00a0 just the collaboration and being able to harness the synergy of local (inaudible), state government, all of our institutions, all of our investments \u2013 building communities from rural to urban settings and then the federal partnership that has allowed us not just to compete in this new opportunity but also to take a \u2013 have a sense of responsibility about where we will end up five years, ten years, 20 years from today.\u00a0 Indiana won\u2019t look the same; indeed, the country won\u2019t look the same.\u00a0 We\u2019re not just catching up, we\u2019re leading the way.\u00a0 Purdue has proven that over the years with the technological advancements that they have discovered and created and shared with the world (inaudible).\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0\u00a0The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act is the sort of economic and national security win that really only comes together once every couple of generations.\u00a0 This is a bipartisan initiative.\u00a0 I\u2019m very excited to have played a leading role in authoring this and getting it through the process, but now it\u2019s time for implementation.\u00a0 I am so happy that we have our Secretary of State and Secretary of Commerce on the ground here on Hoosier soil to see how Hoosier workers and our universities and our state government and other stakeholders are poised to take advantage of the many provisions in this legislation to ensure that we outgrow, out-innovate, and out-compete the Chinese Communist Party to ensure that American values prevail.\nThe technologies that are funded from the research to design to the manufacturing incentive level that are \u2013 that\u2019s incorporated in this legislation are going to be technologies that define our 21st-century economy that we work and live but also they\u2019ll define the future of our national security.\u00a0 And to give rank and file Hoosiers a golden opportunity to participate in that meaningful work during a time when many people are wondering where they fit in economically because of the dynamism of this 21st-century economy is really exciting to me.\nAnd so having Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo here, who I partnered with very actively as we work together to get this legislation passed, is heartwarming.\u00a0 Of course, President Daniels, the leadership that you and so many others have shown here at Purdue University is also encouraging as Indiana looks to benefit maximally from this legislation.\u00a0 And my friend the governor with his continued leadership, there is no stopping Hoosiers as it relates to ensuring that the American taxpayer and rank and file Hoosiers get the maximum possible benefit from this effort.\u00a0 So thanks, all.\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 (Inaudible), sir.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR DANIELS:\u00a0\u00a0We all know how deeply honored we are to have these two great public servants \u2013 these four great public servants with us today.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to the brilliant world-class faculty and the students at Purdue University whose work has attracted them, and we hope to bring them back for kind of status updates in the future.\nLet me just say that as a public university, a land grant university, we feel profoundly our responsibility to turn out as many high-class new talents for this state and nation as we can, and we\u2019ve grown quickly in order to do that here.\nLastly, I\u2019ll just point out that one of our most, we think, profound responsibilities is to contribute to the economic vitality of the state and the nation through our research and through those young talents I mentioned.\u00a0 Here all around you, you can see our latest venture.\u00a0 This will be, I do truly believe, the center of semiconductor advance and production in the decades ahead.\nAnd finally, we also embrace, as not all universities frankly do, a duty to assist the national security in any way we can in areas like hypersonics, energetics, and now, what we believe is a \u2013very genuinely a national security imperative: to have self-sufficiency and leadership in semiconductors.\u00a0 We hope to play a role.\nSo today I think is emblematic of all those missions that Purdue accepts, and we\u2019ll deepen our resolve to do a good job at all of them.\u00a0 Thanks for coming.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 All right, we\u2019ll take a couple of questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with CBS4.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 For any of you:\u00a0 How are you hoping to ensure that Indiana and the United States as a whole has the skilled workforce it will need to fill these jobs?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0So I\u2019ll begin with that.\u00a0 Having a skilled workforce is critical.\u00a0 It\u2019s a rate-limiting factor to growth.\u00a0 So as we implement the CHIPS Act, there is a component for investing in apprenticeships and workforce development partnerships.\u00a0 Additionally, as we accept applications from partnerships who want \u2013 from companies who want the CHIPS Act funds, we are requiring them to show us that they will be making investments in workforce development partnerships.\u00a0 And we know from experience \u2013 the governor knows this and President Daniels \u2013 the best way to do workforce development is in partnership between the companies who hire people and colleges, community colleges, high schools that are training them so that when we are implementing the CHIPS Act, we are going to fund and prioritize exactly those kinds of training partnerships.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s go to AFP.\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0 The only other point \u2014\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Oh, please.\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0 \u2014 I\u2019d add to the Secretary\u2019s is that I want to make clear we are funding workforce training from the associate\u2019s level to the post-doctoral level through this legislation.\u00a0 So we\u2019re bringing opportunities for all Americans, all Hoosiers who want to meaningfully engage in this effort.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 Could I \u2013 it\u2019s too important to miss, because it\u2019s such a central part of realizing this CHIPS and Science Act.\u00a0 This is, fortunately, nothing new to us in Indiana, and I\u2019m sure other states as well.\u00a0 But we\u2019re making investments very early on \u2013 their first steps, you might say \u2013 K through 12.\u00a0 This is about GED to PhD, and making those investments along the way.\u00a0 And so those pipelines or those pathways that are in place, we seek to further accelerate our advancements and our investments so that we can in fact lead the way.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Let\u2019s go to (inaudible) with AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0 A question for Secretary Blinken, please.\u00a0 Sir, you were just in Mexico and you spoke about the semiconductors, and you\u2019re here now visiting this university.\u00a0 We understand the economic challenges, the technological challenges, but what about the geopolitical challenges?\u00a0 And of course, the elephant in the room is China, so could you speak to that, please?\u00a0 Is this really mostly about going after China after the U.S. lost its leadership in semiconductors?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Look, first and foremost, this is about investing in ourselves.\u00a0 And the fact is that when we invest in ourselves that has very positive and powerful effects on our standing in the world.\u00a0 Yes, we\u2019re in a competition with China, among other things, and our ability in that competition to offer the best choice, the best alternative is what ultimately is going to carry the day.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what these investments will do.\nSo we\u2019re seeing more and more countries looking, again, at the United States for our leadership in technology, the fact that, as we\u2019ve just demonstrated, we can bring our country together, we can bring academia, we can bring industry, we bring the federal government, we can bring state government together in order to advance this and create the strongest possible foundation for continuing and even expanding our technological leadership.\u00a0 That\u2019s incredibly attractive to other countries around the world who want to partner with us.\nAt the same time, I think we\u2019ve experienced \u2013 for example, through COVID \u2013 what disruptions to our supply chain can mean for virtually every single person in this country, not to mention around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all been talking this morning about how \u2013 what we were looking at today, as we look at \u2013 as we look at chips, as we look at semiconductors.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s your smartphone, whether it\u2019s your dishwasher, whether it\u2019s your automobile, that supply chain gets disrupted and your life is going to be disrupted.\nSo the fact that we\u2019re able to build our own resiliency, that we\u2019re able to do that ourselves, that we\u2019re able to do that with many likeminded countries, including Mexico in our region, but also beyond, that makes a big difference.\nAnd finally, one of the things that we\u2019re working on around the world in different parts of the world is, look, to the extent we\u2019re in a competition, we want to make it a race to the top \u2013 the highest possible standards for labor, for the environment, for intellectual property.\u00a0 And if we make it a race to the top, I\u2019m extremely confident we\u2019re going to do very well.\u00a0 And again, that is going to bring other countries along.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll go to Channel 13.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Governor Holcomb, where do you see Indiana in five years?\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0Even more of a leadership position, occupying that pole position, you might say, and not just looking to the coasts for these type of advancements.\u00a0 Again, this is a manufacturing powerhouse patch of property in the middle of the country.\u00a0 And Silicon Heartland is not a stretch to envision in 5,10,15 years.\u00a0 And to be able to play a part in turning a supply chain pain into a supply chain gain, this is an enormous source of pride as well.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Indiana has had issues with workforce recruitment and workforce retention.\u00a0 How do you plan on fixing that issue when it comes to keeping people in state?\nAnd then, Senator Young, you mentioned that it\u2019s time for implementation to happen with the CHIPS Act.\u00a0 When do you expect that to happen, and how is it going to affect Indiana?\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0\u00a0Indiana plans to continue to do what we\u2019re doing in a very \u2013 with purpose and intent all along the way from, again, K through 12, through re-skilling, through recruiting.\u00a0 Look, we find ourselves in the state of Indiana at peak private sector employment, and that\u2019s because people are getting the skills they need to \u2013 and sometimes double or triple their salaries. The jobs are there, and these aren\u2019t just jobs that we\u2019re talking about today.\u00a0 These are truly careers, and might I say life-saving careers.\u00a0 And so for a state like Indiana, regionally developed, whether you\u2019re talking about orthopedics or RV production or our five auto OEMs, our ag bioscience, pharmaceuticals \u2013 semiconductors play a central role in all of that.\u00a0 And so this is just a natural extension of the very mature supply chain that we already offer not just Hoosiers for careers, but the world for advancement.\nSENATOR YOUNG:\u00a0\u00a0So with respect to implementation, Indiana got to work before this legislation was signed into law.\u00a0 I mean, we have been preparing for years for this moment, setting the table for an opportunity to receive federal investment in these cutting-edge technology projects to ensure that Indiana\u2019s longstanding talent in making things is recognized when it comes time to make these next-generation technologies and ensuring we have the workforce development pipeline to support those private sector industry sectors.\nAnd so I commend our state leadership going back a number of years, our university partners, and all the way down to the local government level and, of course, our private sector leaders as well.\u00a0 They\u2019ve all been collaborating so that we can seize on a moment like this, and we\u2019re in the process of implementation.\nIn terms of brass tacks, that is going from my standpoint to mean continuing to work with the Department of Commerce, Department of State on ensuring that we\u2019re interpreting the law in a way that\u2019s consistent with legislative wishes but also doing whatever we can to remove obstacles so there are \u2013 if there are additional requests along the way, to ensure that the goals of this initiative are met and we\u2019ll certainly get the revenue to assist.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 We have time for one more.\u00a0 We\u2019ll go to CNN.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Governor Holcomb, you were recently in Taiwan to discuss cooperation on things like semiconductor production.\u00a0 Are you concerned that rising tensions between the U.S. and China could imperil that cooperation?\nAnd then Secretary Blinken, on the Armenia-Azerbaijan tensions, you spoke with both leaders overnight.\u00a0 How were those calls?\u00a0 And Russia has claimed they\u2019ve brokered some sort of ceasefire.\u00a0 Are you concerned about their role in trying to end these hostilities?\u00a0 Thank you.\nGOVERNOR HOLCOMB:\u00a0 Well, what I heard in both Taiwan and South Korea was that they are ready to invest, and part of our objective as a state is to not just grow our own here and expand but also to attract \u2013 attract more foreign direct investment, and that\u2019s true with those two governments but also true around the world.\u00a0 So when you look at a state like Indiana that\u2019s poised for this exact kind of growth, we\u2019re in a catbirt seat, as you might say, to lead.\u00a0 They\u2019re ready to invest and we\u2019re ready to welcome them into our \u2013 or onto our fertile soil.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And as to Armenia and Azerbaijan, yes, I spoke to Prime Minister Pashinyan of Armenia and President Aliyev of Azerbaijan last night; pretty early in the morning for them.\u00a0 We\u2019d seen the outbreak of hostilities again, something that is in no one\u2019s interest.\u00a0 It\u2019s not in the interest of the people of Azerbaijan, it\u2019s not in the interest of the people of Armenia, it\u2019s certainly not in the interest of the larger region.\u00a0 And I spoke to both, urged them to do everything possible to pull back from the conflict and to get back to talking about building a lasting peace between their countries.\nWe have our special envoy in the region right now working with both countries.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be in close touch with them going forward, and my hope is that we can move this from conflict back to the negotiating table and back to trying to build a peace.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Any concerns about Russia\u2019s involvement?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, always, always concerned, because whether Russia tries in some fashion to stir the pot, to create a distraction from Ukraine, is something that we\u2019re always concerned about.\u00a0 But if Russia can actually use its own influence for good, which is to, again, calm the waters, end the violence, and urge people to engage in good faith on building peace, that would be a positive thing.\nMR PATEL:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-secretary-of-commerce-gina-raimondo-mexican-secretary-of-economy-tatiana-clouthier-and-mexican-secretary-of-foreign-affairs-marcelo-ebrard-at-a-joint-pre/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State Antony J.

HLED.\u00a0 We were so happy last year; we went to Washington, and being there we made the commitment of moving forward on very concrete activities for us to have concrete actions and accomplishments.\u00a0 I remember \u2013 and this is something that I tell Gina about in a meeting we had in her office \u2013 and we said we have to really do things that will be moving forward very fast.\nWell, today the second meeting time becomes an increasingly important factor because we have to show results.\u00a0 We have to have deliverables, and we have to move faster because the moment it is of our country, the moment of our region, and this is also the moment of our relationship.\u00a0 And we believe this moment is going through a fundamental moment right now, and we have the possibility of making trade and commerce grow in our two countries.\u00a0 And to a certain degree right now as well, we have a situation that becomes even more important \u2013 first, to continue working on semiconductors, for instance, cyber security and everything that has to do with information and communication technologies, ICTs.\nWe\u2019ve set this on the table to continue moving forward on border infrastructure, where both nations and our activities are going to be important for us to continue developing our borders and for us to continue closing the gaps in terms of our trade activities, our commerce activities.\u00a0 One of the important items we mention is the importance of developing our labor force and many issues.\u00a0 The two main ones, however, that have to do with the technical work for semiconductors and ICT technologies and cyber security, that\u2019s of the utmost importance; and also for us to do follow-up on the different agreements, and the commitment is here now.\u00a0 We have established this commitment for our meetings to have weekly meetings now for us to continue having very important results.\nAnother important item we are going to be working on \u2013 and this is something that our friends are going to be talking about and Secretary Ebrard will be mentioning this \u2013 this has to do with work in south, southeastern part of Mexico and Central America, and the importance of our continuing and moving forward in this relationship.\u00a0 All we have to do now is we want to thank and we want to congratulate and we want to really thank Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Blinken for the efforts made to be here with us, especially the commitment for this relationship between our two nations to continue growing, and especially for all of us to have trade and commerce and the supply chain increasingly stronger, resilient, and strengthened, where competitiveness of North America will continue being right at the core of the work we do in this U.S.-Mexico bilateral economic dialogue.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter)\u00a0 Thank you so much, Mrs. Clouthier.\u00a0 Now Secretary Blinken, yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much, and good evening, everyone.\u00a0 Secretary Clouthier, thank you so much for your hospitality today and the work that we\u2019re doing every single day that you\u2019ve laid out, and to my friend Foreign Secretary Ebrard, Marcelo, to our colleagues, and especially to President L\u00f3pez Obrador for the very good time that we spent with him today.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for the time that he gave us.\nI think today\u2019s meeting reflects the very strong partnership between our countries that has developed from day one of the Biden administration, and you see that across the administration.\u00a0 I\u2019m joined today by my friend and colleague the Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\u00a0 We have the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jayme White.\u00a0 We have other leaders across the U.S. Government.\u00a0 You can see the breadth of Mexico-U.S. cooperation by the sheer size of our delegation today, which also includes representatives from U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. Customs and Border Protection \u2013 so many colleagues who are not only here today but are quite literally doing this every day \u2013 building, strengthening our cooperation.\nAs many of you know, this December Mexico and the United States will celebrate the 200th anniversary of our bilateral relations.\u00a0 Over that time, our countries have been bound by deepening familial, cultural, diplomatic, and the subject of today\u2019s discussion, economic ties.\u00a0 Mexico is the United States\u2019 second largest trading partner.\u00a0 The United States is Mexico\u2019s largest trading partner.\u00a0 Together we have among the world\u2019s most skilled and integrated workforces, advanced industrial centers, a wealth of innovation hubs.\u00a0 When we put our strengths together, each of us becomes more competitive, our region becomes more prosperous.\u00a0 And what that means in concrete terms for our people is more jobs, better jobs, better schools for our communities, more opportunities for small businesses.\u00a0 And I could go down the list.\nThis partnership has grown stronger over the last couple of years.\u00a0 The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement remains our best tool for promoting North American economic competitiveness and actually delivering results for our workers.\u00a0 The High-Level Security Dialogue that we will be picking up again in October is helping us tackle shared challenges like narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, as well as violence and insecurity.\nAnd the High-Level Economic Dialogue that we held today, relaunched by our presidents, is making our economies more resilient and ensuring that we can actually take advantage of some of the opportunities that are out there, not just dealing with the challenges but the real opportunities that we have.\u00a0 That was the primary topic of discussion when Secretary Raimondo and I met with President L\u00f3pez Obrador today with our colleagues.\nI shared and thanked President L\u00f3pez Obrador for the commitments Mexico made at the Summit of the Americas, including adopting the Los Angeles Declaration, which reflects a new regional approach to migration.\u00a0 We discussed shared efforts to address irregular migration in the Americas, including through humane border management policies and through expanding legal pathways and protections as together we address the root causes of migration \u2013 something that Mexico and the United States are collaborating on in ways that we\u2019ve not seen before.\u00a0 For example, our development agencies are working hand in hand in Central America, Northern Central America, to do just that.\nYou just heard from Secretary Clouthier about some of the progress that we made today \u2013 the initiatives we\u2019re driving to boost competitiveness, to create good-paying jobs, to accelerate North America\u2019s transition to clean energy.\u00a0 One of those initiatives that I think is important to underscore \u2013 and I\u2019ll also leave it to Secretary Raimondo to talk more about this \u2013 is the CHIPS and Science Act, which will provide funds to develop resilient semiconductor supply chains in North America.\u00a0 Major elements of the semiconductor supply chains are already well-established in Mexico with U.S.-based companies like Intel and Skyworks conducting research and development, design, assembly, and test manufacturing in parts of Mexico.\nThe CHIPS Act will incentivize more of this type of work.\u00a0 It will ensure that we can build these and other components that we need for the 21st century right here in North America.\u00a0 Tomorrow, Secretary Raimondo and I will travel to Indiana to visit a semiconductor factory and see the work already well underway to build the future in North America.\nAnother initiative comes through the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides among other things tax incentives for electric vehicles and battery components manufactured in North America.\u00a0 It\u2019s a smart investment in a shared future \u2013 a way to create more jobs for our people, combat the global climate crisis, strengthen our energy security.\u00a0 And this is something we discussed with President L\u00f3pez Obrador today.\nLike all partners, especially those with relationships as wide-ranging as ours, there are areas where we differ.\u00a0 We\u2019re secure enough in our relationship to acknowledge those differences and also to work through them in very practical ways so we can serve the best interests of our people.\nThe discussion that we had today was shaped immeasurably by the engagements that we\u2019ve had over the past year, not just between our governments but also with labor leaders, the private sector, civil society.\u00a0 Each step of the way, they\u2019ve made us better by sharing their experiences on the ground, pushing us to do more and to do better for underserved populations, partnering together to implement sustainable solutions.\u00a0 Ultimately, that\u2019s how we\u2019ll build inclusive, broad-based economic growth that delivers for all of our people.\nSo I just simply want to say thanks once again to our Mexican friends, partners, neighbors, for the incredibly warm hospitality we\u2019ve had today, but especially for the terrific partnership.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking good to making \u2013 looking forward to making good on the commitments that we\u2019ve made today, which I believe, we believe, will produce benefits for many, many years to come.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Now we give the floor to Secretary Marcelo Ebrard.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you so much.\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone, ladies and gentlemen.\u00a0 I greet once more Secretary Raimondo and welcome Gina Raimondo, welcome to Mexico.\u00a0 And my friend Antony Blinken, and who has saved the necessary time to go across the world to be here in Mexico, we highly appreciate it.\u00a0 Those of us in this type of positions know what this means.\u00a0 He has been sleeping on the plane for about three days now, and so we highly value your presence and \u2013 both of your presence here.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nWell, this has been a very successful meeting, and not only because of the cordiality but also because we share very transcendental objectives and there\u2019s a working plan, an action plan to do everything we have set out to accomplish at the standards of this type of dialogue and international meetings.\u00a0 We are facing an evident success.\nMexico is taking the U.S. up on its offerings.\u00a0 This is really something through which we have received the invitation of participating as partners, as allies that we are, in different initiatives implemented by President Biden\u2019s administration.\u00a0 They have to do with semiconductors.\u00a0 They have approved a very important package on this, and Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Blinken have invited us to participate in a more intensive fashion possible, and this is a big door opening for Mexico, for the Mexican economy years to come, starting with this year.\u00a0 Electromobilty, for instance, computers, laptops, and telecommunications.\u00a0 And in other words, we do have an invitation and we are receiving it maybe once in a lifetime.\u00a0 This is the type of invitation, just once in a lifetime, so thank you.\u00a0 We are taking you up on your word, and we\u2019re accepting your invitation.\u00a0 This is what President L\u00f3pez Obrador told you personally, and that\u2019s why he wanted to be present.\u00a0 He invited the delegation from the United States to the national palace.\u00a0 This is a historic opportunity for Mexico, and we are going to continue participating with great enthusiasm and gratitude to President Biden\u2019s administration and the U.S.\nWell, this means more jobs for Mexico, more integration in the future and right now as well.\u00a0 And we perhaps think Mexico could grow twice as much with what was proposed to Mexico today.\u00a0 And this means we can reduce poverty even faster in our country, and that infrastructure in Mexico can grow faster.\u00a0 And this is really where this dimension of this partnership between our two countries acquires its true impact, its true face.\nAnd we spoke about many issues.\u00a0 As Secretary Blinken has already mentioned, migration \u2013 we\u2019re working together on migration security.\u00a0 We\u2019re holding a meeting in October because there\u2019s a bicentennial understanding uniting both our countries, a single action plan, a single strategy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been invited to go to Washington; we are going to go to D.C.\u00a0 And I think what we\u2019re building through those different initiatives, President Biden and President Obrador\u2019s initiatives, is that we have certainty about the future.\u00a0 And this is something we share \u2013 security, certainty, predictability, and everything.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be working a world that has no certainty.\u00a0 This is a very big value for Mexico, a very valuable principle for Mexico to have shared certainty.\nWe have the security dialogue in October and also the summit of North American leaders in December.\u00a0 There, we are going to be reflecting everything I\u2019m telling you here today.\u00a0 So we want to thank President Biden for his interest for Mexico and the U.S. to be very close to each other, especially Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Antony Blinken.\u00a0 I know he has done everything for this to become a reality.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Secretary Ebrard.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s give the floor to Secretary Gina Raimondo to take the floor.\u00a0 Madam.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 I also want to join Secretary Blinken in thanking our Mexican colleagues for such warm hospitality and for such a productive day of meetings.\u00a0 So thank you, Secretary Clouthier and Ebrard.\u00a0 And a special thank you to President L\u00f3pez Obrador for meeting with Secretary Blinken and I.\u00a0 We met for more than two hours.\u00a0 The president was extremely generous with his time, and we\u2019d like to thank him.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to thank Secretary Blinken, my partner in this work and a dear friend and colleague.\nAs has been said, the United States and Mexico, we know, have one of the world\u2019s largest trading relationships, which is growing and surpassing its pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0 The best is yet to come.\u00a0 The relationship of course is not limited to trade and economics.\u00a0 It includes strong historical, familial, and cultural ties.\u00a0 And as Tony said, as our countries prepare to celebrate 200 years of bilateral relations, we will continue to build back together as neighbors and as longstanding partners.\nJust a year ago, our two governments restarted the High-Level Economic Dialogue to re-engage in positive economic and commercial dialogue and advance our shared prosperities.\u00a0 Our first meeting was in Washington, D.C. about a year ago, and here we are today, thrilled to be here in Mexico.\u00a0 The goal of this High-Level Economic Dialogue is to make it easier for our countries to trade, invest, and innovate.\u00a0 And when you trade, invest, and innovate, you create prosperity and you create jobs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this is about: shared prosperity and job creation for the people of Mexico and the people of the United States.\u00a0 And as we discussed today with President L\u00f3pez Obrador, that means opportunity for everyone at every level.\nI\u2019m thrilled with the progress we made today on issues ranging from climate change to semiconductors to supply chains.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re bolstering our supply chains and our energy security while creating jobs on both sides of the border.\u00a0 Huge thanks to President Biden\u2019s leadership.\u00a0 Because of that leadership, the United States is making massive new investments in both our domestic semiconductor industry and clean energy.\nBut the benefits of those investments in the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act will not be limited to the United States.\u00a0 These investments are going to create jobs and opportunities for Mexican workers and businesses, small businesses in Mexico as well as large businesses.\u00a0 And of course, I\u2019m especially pleased that the CHIPS and Science Act includes funding that will help us work with partner countries to strengthen our semiconductor supply chains.\nSo over the weeks and months ahead, we\u2019re going to continue our engagement with the private sector, with labor, education, and civil society, all of whom are essential to our success.\u00a0 And today, we agreed in our meetings to have a strong commitment to a transparent process and a lot of stakeholder engagement.\u00a0 We also reaffirmed our commitment to have continuous weekly dialogue as among our teams and a commitment to meet annually in person at the cabinet level so that we can build on the progress we\u2019ve made.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re building a secure and prosperous North America that stands ready to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 To continue with the press conference, the Q&A session, yes, let\u2019s begin with Ivette Salda\u00f1a,\u00a0El Universal\u00a0newspaper.\u00a0 Please, Ivette.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Hello.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 My question is for \u2013 I\u2019m right here, and it\u2019s for Secretary Antonio Blinken.\u00a0 Do you think the energy environmental policy in Mexico, does it go against the impetus or promotion of clean energies?\u00a0 Do you think it does that, and also protection of the environment?\nThis is for Secretary Clouthier.\u00a0 My question is: what are the topics of concern, the issues of concern for the United States?\u00a0 Did you include in your discussions today the solar panel situation?\u00a0 There\u2019s an agreement between Mexico and Canada, but there\u2019s no agreement between Mexico and the United States.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Two things.\u00a0 It\u2019s evident from the conversations that we had today, as well as the work that we\u2019ve been doing over many months, that we see \u2013 the United States and Mexico see \u2013 a shared opportunity to build an energy future that advances our climate goals, that advances sustainable growth, and that creates new opportunities.\u00a0 And one of the things that we focused on in our conversation today with President Lopez Obrador is something that has been, I think, a driving vision for him, and that is the integration of our economies and the integration of North America.\u00a0 And one of the ways that we\u2019re doing that is through clean energy.\nWe have the potential, as you heard Secretary Raimondo discuss, including through some of the facilities made available and new legislation in the United States, to be leaders in, for example, producing electric vehicles together.\u00a0 Our countries have a shared commitment, for example, to see that by the year 2030, 50 percent of vehicle sales are electric vehicles.\u00a0 But we should be making them together, and we now have further incentives to do just that.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be strengthening our supply chains more broadly, but a lot of the focus will be on producing clean energy, but also in doing that, producing good jobs, and in fact, in many cases better-paying jobs that will really be the jobs of the future.\nSo this was very much a part of the conversation that we had with the president today, and I believe very much part of Mexico\u2019s vision as he described it to us.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to put words in his mouth, but that was certainly what I heard, and I would invite my friend the secretary to elaborate on that if you\u2019d like.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Well, the truth is that we didn\u2019t talk about concerns or preoccupations; we spoke about occupations.\u00a0 And this is what we are occupying our time in, part of the things we discussed today and things we\u2019ve been working on.\u00a0 I said this from the beginning.\u00a0 In the morning, for instance, we were working with the private sector, with the academy, and with the governments to create a road map for us to solve problems.\u00a0 This means occupying our time in this.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a year now working on semiconductors and the supply chain for semiconductors how to integrate the supply chain, how to continue working in the development of our labor force capable of facing new challenges on semiconductors.\nSo Gina invited us to expand this margin, for us to go get more things, and to develop \u2013 and to develop our labor force in cyber security, for instance.\u00a0 And right now, well, we\u2019re working on this next week.\u00a0 We are going to \u2013 M\u00f3nica Duhem is going to Palo Alto to work on semiconductors with an academy that can be strengthening development of our labor force in Mexico.\u00a0 Monica has been working with area of Deputy Secretary de la Mora and the supply chain for semiconductors.\nAnd just to go into what Secretary Blinken was just saying, well, the president said something that is very interesting.\u00a0 This is something I think you had already heard in the president\u2019s morning press conference: the Sonora plant.\u00a0 This is a very important development for Sonora to become a space of clean energy, a space where we are going to be working with the entire supply chain, from the extraction of lithium with the value chain to reach electromobility and zero-emission vehicles.\nSo we\u2019re not worried, we\u2019re not preoccupied; we\u2019re occupied.\u00a0 And we shall continue being occupied in those issues.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s give the floor to Ana Swanson,\u00a0New York Times.\u00a0 Please, go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, on the energy dispute between the United States and Mexico, I understand there is a formal dispute settlement process under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but were there efforts made outside of that today to resolve the issue?\nSecretary Raimondo, on the energy issue, did you share any concerns with Mexico that U.S. businesses have about government interference or fair treatment when operating here?\u00a0 And Secretary Ebrard and Secretary Clouthier, I\u2019d welcome your response on the energy issue.\u00a0 I\u2019m also curious: did your discussion today touch on Mexican security issues and any disruptions that it\u2019s caused to trade or border security?\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Dispute settlement under international agreements is a normal part of trade relationships, even among the closest of partners.\u00a0 And the USMCA has this mechanism.\u00a0 Mexico has used it.\u00a0 We\u2019re using it.\u00a0 And if there\u2019s a difference, it\u2019s a very good way to resolve it and to do it in a way that actually inspires confidence in investors in predictability and stability in the application of the agreement and the broader relationship.\nSo that \u2013 that is going forward.\u00a0 But I think what\u2019s very important, and it\u2019s something that Secretary Clouthier said as well, is that even as we might have an issue or we\u2019re we\u2019re trying to resolve a difference, we are moving full speed ahead in the further integration of our economies and in building the most competitive region in the world, and we\u2019re doing that, as you\u2019ve heard, through the work on supply chains strengthening, the work that we\u2019re doing together in building a clean energy economy, the work on semiconductors, et cetera.\u00a0 So I think the most important thing to say is we\u2019re making very demonstrable and clear progress in a whole host of areas, many of which were covered by the economic dialogue today.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I truly love the way Secretary Blinken is saying this, because he says USMCA has dispute settle mechanisms.\u00a0 We have to use them in case there are any differences or a dispute.\u00a0 Nonetheless, part of what we said this afternoon \u2013 I think that was very important and it\u2019s not in vain \u2013 I mean that the High-Level Economic Dialogue starts with the word \u201cdialogue,\u201d and this is part of the things we discussed with President L\u00f3pez Obrador in terms of energy, to solve things through this \u2013 disputes through this dispute settle mechanism.\u00a0 And the USMCA has that, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing right now.\u00a0 There\u2019s interest on both parts to walk together to find solutions, and this is what I wanted to say.\nI give the floor to Foreign Minister Ebrard.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, I coincide with Secretary Blinken and Secretary Clouthier.\u00a0 The consultations are part of an already established process with foreseeability or predictability.\u00a0 It allows us to have this mechanism to settle disputes, and this is the way it was foreseen in USMCA.\u00a0 And today that wasn\u2019t the objective of the meeting.\u00a0 We are in the process of a dialogue, and we hope we\u2019ll reach an agreement in terms of that dialogue.\u00a0 I cannot reveal anything else because it\u2019s confidential information.\nAnd now, in terms of security, I wanted to say briefly that there\u2019s an action plan for the first time.\u00a0 This is a joint Mexico-U.S. \u2013 for the first time in the meeting we\u2019re going to be holding in October to exchange results we have \u2013 where are we at?\u00a0 What else can we do?\u00a0 We\u2019ve been working so much with a common action plan, and this is very important because Secretary Blinken is co-author of that understanding, which is translated into actions and a common plan.\u00a0 And yes, we are very optimistic and we see it very positively.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 To answer your question on \u2013 as has been said, we didn\u2019t talk extensively about it, but I would only add that what businesses are seeking is predictability, fairness, and transparency.\u00a0 And I think that that is true of every business everywhere in the world.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Now let\u2019s give the floor to Ernesto Gloria, Enfoque Noticias.\u00a0 One question, please.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Yes, good afternoon.\u00a0 My question is for Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 In the conversations you\u2019ve had with Mexican officials, do you have a date for the arrival of investments you\u2019ve announced \u2013 the $50 billion, for instance?\u00a0 Did you talk about the beneficiary states that are going to be getting those investments?\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So we have already started the process of engaging with stakeholders in the United States, and we expect that the first money will be invested in the first half of next year.\u00a0 But I can tell you that the fact that Congress passed the legislation has already unlocked billions of dollars of capital from businesses.\u00a0 So today, for example, as we\u2019re here, a company called Micron made a multibillion-dollar investment of a new manufacturing facility in Idaho.\u00a0 That\u2019s one example.\u00a0 Intel has already made a big investment.\u00a0 So the fact that these companies have the certainty that the CHIPS Act passed has already unlocked a great deal of capital.\nThe opportunity I think for Mexico is not just in the manufacturing facilities but in testing, packaging, and assembly.\u00a0 Now in China and Taiwan, there\u2019s about 60 \u2013 the testing, packaging, and assembly industry for semiconductors is a $60 billion industry.\u00a0 In North America it\u2019s $3 billion.\u00a0 So there is a huge opportunity for growth in North America and job creation just in the semiconductor supply chain.\u00a0 And as we discussed today, that doesn\u2019t even include the jobs for printed circuit boards, printers, computers.\u00a0 So we\u2019re really very excited about the opportunities for job creation in Mexico and in the United States on account of the CHIPS Act.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you.\u00a0 The last question for Iain Marlow, Bloomberg.\u00a0 Yes, one question, please, from Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, just moving to global events now, we\u2019ve seen some stunning developments on the battlefields in Ukraine with Ukrainian forces making unprecedented gains in recent days.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if you could give your perspective on what the last few days mean for the overall direction of the war, the role the U.S. and allies have played in the leadup to the counteroffensive, and what it might mean for broader efforts to eventually end the conflict.\nAnd just one other question on the JCPOA:\u00a0 There appears to be growing pessimism not just in Israel but also now in Europe about the prospect of a deal, particularly in the near term, with some suggesting any negotiated settlement may have to wait until after the U.S. midterm elections.\u00a0 I\u2019m just wondering if we could get your own assessment of the current timeline on those negotiations and your own view on any eventual settlement.\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (Inaudible) very much.\u00a0 Let me take the last part first on the JCPOA.\u00a0 What we\u2019ve seen over the last week or so in Iran\u2019s response to the proposal put forward by the European Union is clearly a step backward and makes prospects for an agreement in the near term, I would say, unlikely, and you\u2019ve heard the European Union and in particular you\u2019ve heard the so-called E3 \u2013 Germany, France, and the UK \u2013 pronounce themselves on the latest developments.\u00a0 I can\u2019t give you a timeline except to say, again, that Iran seems either unwilling or unable to do what is necessary to reach an agreement and they continue to try to introduce extraneous issues to the negotiation that make an agreement less likely.\u00a0 But certainly what we\u2019ve seen in the last week is a step backward away from the likelihood of any kind of near-term agreement.\nIn terms of Ukraine and the situation there, a few things.\u00a0 As you know, I was there last week and had an opportunity to spend time with President Zelenskyy and members of his administration, to hear in detail about the work that they were doing on the counteroffensive that was recently initiated in southern Ukraine but also, as we\u2019ve seen, in the northeast in and around Kharkiv.\u00a0 And what they have done has been very methodically planned out and, of course, it\u2019s benefited from significant support from the United States and many other countries in terms of making sure that Ukraine has in its hands the equipment it needs to prosecute this counteroffensive, which has one clear purpose, to take back the land that has \u2013 that was seized by Russia\u2019s aggression.\nAnd this is early days still, so I think it would be wrong to predict exactly where this will go, when it will get there, and how it will get there.\u00a0 But clearly we\u2019ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the northeast, and that is a product, as I said, of the support we provided, but first and foremost, it\u2019s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 That\u2019s the biggest difference maker.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve had the occasion to say, fundamentally, Ukraine is fighting for its homeland, for its future.\u00a0 The Russians who are there are not.\u00a0 Ukraine is not theirs.\u00a0 Ukraine does not belong to Russia.\u00a0 It belongs to the Ukrainian people, and that\u2019s the single biggest difference maker, as I said, that I think we\u2019re seeing play out now.\nHaving said all of that, it is too early to tell exactly where this is going.\u00a0 The Russians maintain very significant forces in Ukraine, as well as equipment and arms and munitions.\u00a0 They continue to use it indiscriminately against not just the Ukrainian armed forces but civilians and civilian infrastructure, as we\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 The brutalization of the country continues by the Russian aggressor, and there is, I think, unfortunately the prospect that this continues to go on.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s encouraging to see the progress that Ukraine has made, and what I said to President Zelenskyy on behalf of the United States \u2013 and what many other countries have continued to reaffirm \u2013 is we will continue to do what is necessary to support Ukraine, to maintain pressure on Russia so that it ends it aggression, and of course, as necessary, to shore up our own defenses.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is this.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen that this aggression by Russia, an attempt to erase Ukraine\u2019s existence as an independent, sovereign state, has also created tremendous challenges in virtually every corner of the world, not only in Ukraine but \u2013 and not only in Europe but all around the world, including in our own hemisphere.\u00a0 We see it in higher food prices, higher energy prices; we also see it in the assault that Russia\u2019s engaged in on the very principles of the international system that are necessary for keeping peace and security that should be of interest to every country \u2013 the notion that sovereignty matters, territorial integrity matters, independence matters.\u00a0 And I think what you\u2019re seeing from countries around the world is a strong desire that this aggression cease and that the second and third-order consequences are as a result diminished.\u00a0 That\u2019s very important too.\nSo bottom line is this:\u00a0 Russia committed this aggression.\u00a0 I think, given the price that it\u2019s paying, it can and should stop it.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via

interpreter) So good afternoon.\u00a0 What a pleasure to be here once more after this very good meeting with the president of Mexico and with Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 Ambassador Salazar and all our friends from Mexico, welcome, everyone \u2013 want to welcome you once more to this Ministry of the Economy of Mexico.\u00a0 First of all, we want to thank you for understanding because we did change the venue.\u00a0 This is the first anniversary of this first edition of the High-Level Economic Dialogue, which signifies promoting cooperation in our relationship.\u00a0 As we said this morning, Dr. De la Mora had an extraordinary meeting with stakeholders, with the academy, with the business community, and governments.\u00a0 She said that in such a broad relationship as the one we have between Mexico and the United States, well, there are all sorts of situations that arise, but we also have the very big commitment to address controversies and differences and to look for new ways to cooperate with each other.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re moving forward.\nAnd within one of these mechanisms is the High-Level Economic Dialogue, which is very good for us institutions to be able to find mechanisms of collaboration and how to continue moving forward.\u00a0 In this case, we\u2019ve set conditions to have a great region of competitiveness, and this is part of what Secretary Raimondo was telling us a few minutes ago with President L\u00f3pez Obrador.\nWe\u2019re convinced that today we\u2019re going to be holding a very productive discussion that will allow us to share vision of each one of the participants on the HLED for the second year, and we can thus agree a better path for us to continue moving forward and collaborating between our two countries.\nOnce more, thank you so much.\u00a0 I want to thank all of you for your presence.\u00a0 Let me now give the floor to our foreign minister of Mexico, Marcel Ebrard.\u00a0 You have the floor, Marcelo.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Tatiana.\u00a0 Very well, I cordially welcome all of you.\u00a0 Secretary of the Department of State Mr. Antony Blinken, Secretary Raimondo, thank you so much.\u00a0 I am delighted to have you in Mexico.\u00a0 Welcome, everyone.\nI simply wanted to say this is a meeting, a strategic vision.\u00a0 It\u2019s a common vision between Mexico and the U.S. to build a strong region, a prosperous region as well, and that will maintain its political weight in the world \u2013 North America, and we\u2019re just so happy to have all of you here where we\u2019re going to be discussing today has to do with progress we\u2019ve made.\u00a0 This is a very positive meeting and also invitations that we have to expand integration between Mexico and the United States on common issues as for instance clean energies, electronic vehicles,\u00a0 semiconductors, technology, and also this electromobility, which is an enormous topic, and this is the agenda.\nSo I do think this is a wonderful occasion and I really celebrate the fact we\u2019re discussing this.\u00a0 This has to do with a common vision for the future.\u00a0 Welcome, everyone, your respective delegations \u2013 your delegation from the U.S. and the Mexican friends that are here with us.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0 Yes, Secretary Blinken, you have the floor, sir.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary Clouthier.\u00a0 Thank you for your hospitality here as well.\u00a0 Marcelo, Secretary Ram\u00edrez de la O, thank you so much for hosting us here today in Mexico City.\u00a0 It\u2019s just great to be back with all of you.\nLast year, our two presidents agreed to relaunch the High-Level Economic Dialogue.\u00a0 They recognized together that a strong Mexico-U.S. relationship was vital for ensuring that our countries could actually take advantage of the opportunities of this century for our people.\u00a0 And since then we\u2019ve been working together on an incredibly wide range of issues, new areas, and deepened our cooperation in places where we had already been working together.\nTo name just a few very quickly, Mexico and the United States, our auto industry leaders are sharing information and best practices to speed up the transition to electric vehicles, which along with other clean energy technologies are critical to creating new jobs and addressing the global climate crisis.\u00a0 Our development agencies, AMEXCID and USAID, are working together to provide skills and training to young people in Central America so that they can find more opportunity at home and not feel compelled to leave their countries.\u00a0 Our governments are finding new ways to strengthen cyber security, which is increasingly central to the lives and livelihoods of our citizens, from the resilience of our supply chains to the success of small and medium enterprises increasingly reliant on a digital economy.\nAnd I think we\u2019re seeing results.\u00a0 Total trade between our countries recent surpassed even pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0 Mexico is our second-largest trading partner with trade between our countries exceeding $7 billion, supporting over a million jobs.\u00a0 And all of this is not just about abstract numbers: good-paying jobs, quality benefits, better schools, stronger small businesses, brighter futures for our people when we do it right.\u00a0 We have our differences, as any countries with relationships and deep and wide as ours are, but we work through them in a pragmatic way \u2013 and I\u2019m pleased about that as well \u2013 based on mutual respect.\nI will let Secretary Raimondo address this.\u00a0 But as we\u2019ve discussed today, we have some remarkable new opportunities before us in part because of some progress we\u2019ve been able to make in the United States with the CHIPS Act and then with the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act.\u00a0 These create, I think, new perspectives to go even further in some of the work that we\u2019ve already started to do, but I\u2019ll leave it to Secretary Raimondo to discuss that.\nBut the issues that we\u2019ll talk about today \u2013 expanding inclusive opportunities and jobs in North America, accelerating North America\u2019s clean energy transition, modernizing our border infrastructure, promoting an open and secure internet, among others \u2013 aren\u2019t simply issues that matter to our governments; profoundly, they matter to our people.\nTogether we can make North America the most competitive, dynamic region in the world.\u00a0 Both of our presidents share that vision, and it\u2019s our responsibility to actually try and make good on it.\u00a0 Delighted to be here and working with all of our colleagues.\u00a0 Thank you.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you so much.\u00a0 Now with the Secretary of Commerce of the United States.\u00a0 You have the floor, Gina, please.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good afternoon and thank you \u2013 thank you to our hosts, our Mexican partners.\u00a0 We\u2019re having a fantastic day.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you in person in a very productive session.\nAs Tony said, a year ago our governments agreed to restart this High-Level Economic Dialogue to re-engage in positive economic and commercial dialogue to advance our shared priorities, to increase trade, to increase cross-border investment; but fundamentally, what it is all about is creating opportunity for the workers of our countries, as we just spoke with your president.\u00a0 And we are moving forward on our shared priorities of supply chains, information and communication technology, cyber security, and workforce development.\nWe\u2019ve already made progress, of which I am very proud.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already identified the areas of the supply chain that are the most ripe for collaboration.\u00a0 We\u2019ve shared best practices to strengthen cyber security.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve implemented an Academy of Women Entrepreneurs program supporting 800 women across 13 Mexican states.\u00a0 So this isn\u2019t just talking.\u00a0 This is doing.\nBut obviously, there is so much more to do.\u00a0 And as Secretary Blinken just said, in the past month the United States Congress passed two pieces of game-changing legislation.\u00a0 One, which we\u2019ll talk about later, is the semiconductor act, the CHIPS Act, which will make a $50 billion investment in the semiconductor supply chain in the United States, and we have already heard from all of the semiconductor companies that as they build new manufacturing facilities in America, they would like to see the rest of their supply chain in North America.\u00a0 And so we want to explore with you how do we align our policies as between America and Mexico to maximize that entire supply chain and the jobs that go with it in North America, in Mexico specifically.\nThe other piece of legislation is the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the single largest investment that the United States of America has ever made in fighting climate change:\u00a0 $400 billion of incentives to move us towards green technology and electric vehicles, and very importantly, incentives for vehicles assembled in North America.\u00a0 So I can speak for President Biden and for Secretary Blinken and our teams:\u00a0 We are just bursting with enthusiasm and ready to get to work.\nThe one word of caution I have is we do need to move quickly.\u00a0 Companies are moving quickly.\u00a0 Congress has passed this legislation.\u00a0 The Commerce Department is already at work figuring out how to invest the $50 billion in semiconductors.\u00a0 We have a moment in time now, and so together we\u2019ll get to work and seize this opportunity.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you so much, Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 We\u2019re so happy to have our Finance Minister of Mexico Rogelio Ram\u00edrez de la O.\u00a0 Doctor, you have the floor.\nFINANCE SECRETARY RAM\u00cdREZ DE LA O:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you.\u00a0 Good morning \u2013 good afternoon, rather.\u00a0 What a pleasure to be here with you.\u00a0 I want to greet the U.S. delegation today, especially DOS Secretary Mr. Blinken and Secretary of Commerce Mrs. Raimondo and Jayme White, who is the deputy secretary for economic growth, energy, and the environment; distinguished ambassador, our friend, Ken Salazar, welcome \u2013 yes, ambassador of the United States to Mexico.\u00a0 I want to also thank you for being here.\u00a0 What a pleasure to have all of you here in Mexico.\u00a0 And I would also like to greet with great affection the Mexican delegation, Secretary Tatiana Clouthier and \u2013 secretary of economy \u2013 Foreign Minister Mr. Marcelo Ebrard, and Esteban Moctezuma, ambassador of Mexico to the United States.\nI also want to thank \u2013 after a year of reactivation of this dialogue, I want to thank for the commitment shown through this mechanism of collaboration, which reveals not only the strategic vision of our cooperation at the economic level but also the capacity that our two administrations have to go over and beyond the traditional concerns at the bilateral level.\u00a0 And I want to congratulate and commend both delegations for this great progress being made and the work we\u2019re all doing.\nAnd today in this annual meeting we\u2019re going to be discussing results we\u2019ve been able to reach in this first year of work in each one of the four pillars, and I am certain that this will allow us to reflect on our priorities for the future and the importance for those accomplishments to generate a positive impact on bilateral trade, but especially the well-being of our citizens.\u00a0 And as already said by Secretary Raimondo, well, especially for workers, yes.\u00a0 And we shall also look into new actions that will be complementing those that we\u2019ve already implemented in key areas for both administrations, as for instance supply chains, climate change, and integration of our labor markets.\nI conclude reasserting the commitment of the Mexican administration so that through the Ministry of Finances, we can work as a team with the purpose of having greater regional cooperation and integration between both countries to increase the well-being of our peoples.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nECONOMY SECRETARY CLOUTHIER:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you so much, Secretary.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s give the floor to \u2013 yes, Jayme White, you have the floor.\nDEPUTY TRADE REPRESENTATIVE WHITE:\u00a0 I also want to echo my colleagues by saying thank you for hosting.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a great day so far collaborating, especially with the stakeholders that have so much valuable information.\nIt\u2019s an honor to be here to represent the United States.\u00a0 Ambassador Katherine Tai and I remain excited about serving as co-leads for the United States in this important dialogue.\u00a0 As deputy United States trade representative, one of my chief responsibilities is the North American relationship, including the continued implementation and enforcement of the USMCA, which is the foundation of our economic and trade relationship.\u00a0 It\u2019s been two years since we entered into this new agreement.\u00a0 Along with our neighbor and ally to the north, Canada, we are all recommitting to our regional economic partnership.\u00a0 The USMCA represents a high-standard, high-ambition trade agreement that promotes the rights of workers, advances our environmental priorities, and creates new opportunities for our producers.\nThe bottom line is this:\u00a0 The HLED provides a framework to engage collaboratively with Mexico on key projects to complement and fortify the foundation of the USMCA.\u00a0 The HLED helps advance our regional economic integration and our collective prosperity.\u00a0 Our partnership under the HLED supports the development and implementation of a worker-centered economic policy, a top priority of the Biden-Harris administration.\nFor example, we are coordinating joint efforts in a number of areas, including, number one, promoting innovation and our efforts to invest in entrepreneurs and SMEs, who we all know are the backbone of our economies; number two, expanding access to economic opportunities for underrepresented groups; and number three, pursuing strategies for joint workforce development that prioritize the tech skills and training needed to meet the demands and seize the opportunities of the 21st century.\nThese objectives can only make us stronger as a region and reflect the values of the Biden-Harris administration to ensure that all citizens can participate in and benefit from our economic policies.\u00a0 USTR remains committed and ready to help guide this relationship forward along with Secretaries Blinken and Raimondo.\u00a0 Thank you for your time.\u00a0 Thanks.\n\n"}, {"url":

The Secretary General and the Secretary of State will make introductory remarks, and then they\u2019ll be happy to take a few questions.\u00a0 Secretary General.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0\u00a0Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, welcome back to NATO.\u00a0 It\u2019s always great to see you here and thank you for your personal leadership and your personal commitment to our transatlantic Alliance.\nToday, the NATO flag and the flags of 30 allies are at half mast to honor Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\u00a0 She was a strong supporter of our transatlantic Alliance, of our armed forces, and our values.\u00a0 She knew and worked with all NATO secretaries general, since the founding of NATO.\u00a0 She visited NATO headquarters and hosted NATO leaders at Buckingham Palace.\u00a0 I\u2019ll always remember her wisdom, her warmth, and her strong personal interest in transatlantic security.\u00a0 Our heartfelt condolences to King Charles III, the royal family, and the people of our allies, the United Kingdom and Canada.\nWe have just concluded a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, where we addressed NATO\u2019s strong and united response to Russia\u2019s brutal war on Ukraine.\u00a0 This includes unprecedented military, financial, and humanitarian aid from allies so that Ukraine can uphold its right to self\u2011defense. \u00a0The United States is leading the way, and I welcome the billions of dollars of additional support announced this week.\nYesterday, I participated in the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Russia.\u00a0 We all agree on the importance of stepping and sustaining our winter support so that Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign state.\nIn June, NATO leaders agreed a strengthened package of assistance with fuel, food, medical supplies, military gear, secure communications, and equipment to encounter mines and drones.\u00a0 We will support Ukraine in the long term and help its transition from Soviet-era to modern NATO equipment.\nThe war in Ukraine is entering a critical phase.\u00a0 Ukrainian forces have been able to stall Moscow\u2019s offensive in Donbas, strike back behind Russian lines, and retake territory.\u00a0 Just in the last few days, we have seen further progress \u2013 both in the south in Kherson, and in the east in the Kharkiv region.\u00a0 This shows the bravery, skills, and determination of Ukrainian forces, and it shows that our support is making a difference every day on the battlefield.\nIn the coming months our unity and sovereignty will be tested with pressure on energy supplies and the soaring cost of living, caused by Russia\u2019s war.\u00a0 But the price we pay is measured in money, while the price Ukrainians are paying is measured in lives \u2013 lost lives every day.\u00a0 And all of us will pay a much higher price, if Russia and all the authoritarian regimes see that their aggression is rewarded.\nIf Russia stops fighting, there will be peace.\u00a0 If Ukraine stops fighting, it will cease to exist as an independent nation.\u00a0 So we must stay the course for Ukraine\u2019s sake and for ours.\u00a0 At the same time, we are sending an unmistakable message to Moscow about our readiness to protect and defend every inch of our territory.\u00a0 We are significantly enhancing our presence in the east of the Alliance, putting hundreds of thousands of troops on high readiness, supported with significant air and naval forces, and continuing to invest in cutting-edge capabilities.\nAll of this makes clear that our commitment to Article 5 is unshakeable.\u00a0 Europe and North American must continue to stand together in NATO, in defense of our people, our nations, and our values.\nSo Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, thank you again for leadership, for being here, and for a strong personal commitment to our Alliance.\u00a0 Please, start, of course.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Jens, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you especially for your remarkable leadership of our Alliance in what is the decisive period of the Alliance.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come out of the NATO Summit with a new Strategic Concept.\u00a0 We\u2019ve faced Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done it together, and that\u2019s in no small measure because of your leadership.\nBefore speaking about what brings me here today, I\u2019d like to join Jens in taking a moment just to honor the truly extraordinary life of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\u00a0 On her 21st birthday, then Princess Elizabeth committed to dedicating her life to serving the people of the Commonwealth.\u00a0 For more than 70 years \u2013 a period during which the United Kingdom and world witnessed unprecedented change \u2013 the Queen did just that, while personifying a sense of stability and continuity in turbulent times.\u00a0 She was a powerful, unifying force, a source of comfort and resilience to millions of people from all walks of life.\u00a0 On behalf of the United States, I extend our deepest condolences to our British friends, to the Government of the United Kingdom, to the royal family.\nSo as Jens noted, we just finished a session with our NATO Allies, where I had an opportunity to share a readout of my talks in Kyiv with President Zelenskyy, Foreign Minister Kuleba, and other senior Ukrainian officials.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have an opportunity to speak to President von der Leyen from the European Union tomorrow to continue the strong transatlantic cooperation that we\u2019ve had on Ukraine and on so many other things.\u00a0 These consultations are just the latest example of the unity and strength of our Alliance.\nYesterday, as I was in Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Austin convened the fifth meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\u00a0 More than 50 countries took part, including Ukraine\u2019s defense minister as well as the Secretary General.\u00a0 Support from that group continues to make a decisive difference on the battlefield, where Ukraine\u2019s great defenders are not just holding ground, they are retaking their sovereign territory in a two-front counteroffensive.\nAs I told President Zelenskyy, the support of the United States is unwavering.\u00a0 I announced more than $2.8 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine and also for its neighbors.\u00a0 That support includes $675 million in new military aid to Ukraine.\u00a0 This is part of the twentieth drawdown of military equipment that President Biden has initiated, going back before the Russian aggression.\u00a0 It includes more guided multiple launch rocket systems, artillery ammunition, high-speed anti-radiation missiles, anti-tank systems.\u00a0 The twentieth drawdown now totals $14.7 billion.\nThat sum also includes approximately $2.2 billion in what we call foreign military financing for Ukraine, but also for European allies and partners.\u00a0 That will allow them to begin to begin to acquire assistance for the medium and long term that will be essential to deterring and, if necessary, defending against further Russian aggression in the years to come.\nOur unity here at NATO, across our alliances and partnerships at the United Nations and other international institutions, is essential to advancing our objectives \u2013 shared objectives of supporting Ukraine\u2019s capacity to defend itself, sustaining pressure on Russia for its aggression, ensuring that Ukraine is in the strongest position when conditions are ripe for negotiations.\u00a0 As President Zelenskyy has said, and rightly said, diplomacy is the only way to definitively end Russia\u2019s war of aggression.\u00a0 We see in this moment no indication from Russia that it would be prepared to seriously pursue such diplomacy, but if and when that time comes, Ukraine has to be in the strongest possible position.\nNow, President Putin thought that he would divide and weaken NATO.\u00a0 Today, the Alliance is stronger, more unified, better resourced than ever before, and I heard further evidence in our session with NATO partners today.\u00a0 We\u2019ll soon welcome Finland and Sweden as new allies. We\u2019ve approved a new Strategic Concept to meet twenty-first century threats, and more allies are meeting their pledge to spend two percent of their GDP on defense.\nPresident Putin thought that he would divide the Ukrainian people and swiftly absorb their nation into Russia, but the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to impose its will by force on Ukraine have only further united its people around the goal of defending their sovereignty and preserving a free and open democracy.\nPresident Putin thought his invasion would showcase the Russian military\u2019s might and sophistication.\u00a0 Instead, the Russian army is turning to North Korea and Iran for badly needed supplies, while Ukraine\u2019s military capability continues to get stronger, thanks to its leadership, thanks to the courage of its fighters, and thanks to the robust support from allies and partners.\nPresident Putin thought that our willingness to apply economic pressure would fade with time.\u00a0 Instead, we and our partners and allies have stuck together in the face of Moscow\u2019s coercion and threats, imposing unprecedented costs on Russia\u2019s economy.\u00a0 To date, over 1,000 foreign companies have quit the Russian market.\u00a0 Export controls on semiconductors and other advanced technologies mean that Russia cannot sustain \u2013 never mind modernize \u2013 key sectors, from automobile manufacturing to military exports, to energy exploration.\nRussian imports parts and finished products, have been cut in half from a year ago.\u00a0 What does that mean?\u00a0 It means that they can\u2019t replace the weapons that they\u2019re using up in Ukraine, that they can\u2019t make products for their domestic market, that their people are accustomed to buy.\u00a0 They can\u2019t produce things for export, which will shrink their foreign markets.\nHalf a million people \u2013 half a million people, many of them highly skilled workers \u2013 have left the country.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are estimated to have fallen by $75 billion and an additional $300 billion are currently frozen abroad.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Russia is cut off from the international lending market.\nAll of this is building.\u00a0 It\u2019s cumulative.\u00a0 It will get to be a heavier and heavier burden, as long as Russia\u2019s aggression continues.\nAnd yet, even as President Putin has failed in virtually all of his objectives, the human suffering he\u2019s inflicted on Ukrainians and other people around the world is staggering.\u00a0 I saw some of those consequences up close on my visit yesterday in Ukraine, including to Irpin, whose very name, like the battle of Bucha and Mariupol has become synonymous with Russian war crimes, including indiscriminate violence and the intentional targeting of civilians.\nI saw the costs in my visit to the children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv, where I met kids who will spend the rest of their lives without limbs, with enduring brain injuries, or with other trauma that may be invisible to the eye, because of atrocities committed by Russian forces.\u00a0 Hundreds more Ukrainian boys and girls have been killed by this unprovoked war.\nIt\u2019s not just Ukrainians who are bearing the costs.\u00a0 As Russia falls short of its battlefield aims and is increasingly isolated on the global stage, President Putin has turned to blunter tools to try to peel off support from Ukraine.\u00a0 He\u2019s weaponized energy against European countries standing up to his aggression, raising the costs on families, on businesses, on entire nations.\nPresident Putin is betting that these actions will break the will of countries to stand with Ukraine.\u00a0 He\u2019s betting that the Kremlin can bully other countries into submission.\u00a0 He\u2019s already lost that bet, because the last six and a half months show a growing recognition around the world that while the costs of standing up to the Kremlin\u2019s aggression are high, the costs of standing down would be even higher.\nThat\u2019s why the United States is doing everything in its power to support people around the world who are shouldering the greatest cost of Russia\u2019s aggression, like our comprehensive efforts to help Europeans get though a winter during which they\u2019ll face heavy energy costs, making it hard for many to heat their homes.\u00a0 We won\u2019t leave our European friends out in the cold.\nIt\u2019s also an opportunity to make a decisive shift finally \u2013 once and for all \u2013 away from dependence on Russian energy, which Putin will never stop trying to weaponize to Europe\u2019s detriment; and to make the transition to renewable sources, necessary as well to combat the climate crisis.\u00a0 We can \u2013 we will \u2013 emerge stronger and in a better place.\nAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so vital that we stay the course, that we stay united \u2013 united in support of Ukraine, united with our allies and partners, united for as long as it takes.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take questions now.\u00a0 I see\u00a0Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\u00a0(inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks a lot.\u00a0 Thomas Gutschker,\u00a0Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\u00a0 My question to you, Secretary Blinken:\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen this astonishing move of Ukrainian forces in the northeast of their country, pushing possibly 50 kilometers into Russian occupied territory.\u00a0 How do you explain that?\u00a0 It appears that the Russian army is hardly even fighting.\u00a0 Is that \u2013 is it on the brink of collapse in that area.\u00a0 Do you have an explanation for that?\u00a0 And do you see this potentially as a turning point in this war?\nAnd the question to the Secretary General, if I may:\u00a0 You are constantly making the case for member states to send more ammunition, more arms to Ukraine.\u00a0 One of the replies we are constantly hearing from our defense ministers is that it will compromise capacities that they have pledged to NATO.\u00a0 So, when push comes to shove, and member states do have to make a decision on either supporting Ukraine or holding up their commitments to NATO, what is your suggestion?\u00a0 What\u2019s the right decision to take?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yeah, so happy to start.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Let me say two things.\u00a0 First, what we\u2019re seeing is that the counteroffensive that the Ukrainians have put in place with strong systems and backing from many countries is now underway.\u00a0 It\u2019s early days, but it is demonstrably making real progress.\u00a0 It\u2019s focused in the south, around Kherson, in that area.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also seeing Ukraine not only hold the line in the Donbas and in the northeast, but as you noted, make a significant advance moving some 45 to 50 kilometers in one area past what had been the existing Russia line.\nI think it\u2019s too early to say exactly where this will go, when it will get there, and exactly where it will end up.\u00a0 But I think we can say that Ukraine is proceeding in a very deliberate way with a strong plan, and critically enabled by resources that many of us are providing.\nBut fundamentally \u2013 and I think this may explain more directly the answer to your question \u2013 why am I absolutely confident in the success of the Ukrainians in pushing back the Russian aggression, whether it\u2019s in the northeast, the Donbas, or in the south?\u00a0 For one simple basic reason:\u00a0 This is Ukraine\u2019s homeland, not Russia.\u00a0 People are fighting for their homeland; they\u2019re fighting for their future.\u00a0 And while we can calculate the benefits of weapon systems and financial resources, it\u2019s hard to put a value on that determination to fight for one\u2019s own country, except to say that it\u2019s invaluable and the single biggest difference maker that I think we\u2019ll see play out over the weeks and months ahead.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0\u00a0NATO has had provided unprecedented support to Ukraine with the weapons, with the ammunition and other capabilities.\u00a0 And of course, they have done that bolstered by reducing existing stocks.\u00a0 And you are right that, of course, our allies are now raising the issue of whether these stocks are depleted too much.\nMy answer to that is actually twofold.\u00a0 One is to realize that weapons, ammunitions that we are providing to Ukraine are used to stop the aggressive actions of Russia against an independent, sovereign nation in Europe which is a close partner of NATO.\u00a0 And if President Putin wins in Ukraine, it\u2019s not only bad for Ukrainians, but it is also dangerous for all of us.\u00a0 So actually, by ensuring that Russia, that President Putin doesn\u2019t win in Ukraine, we\u2019re also increasing our own security and strengthening the Alliance by proving that we don\u2019t allow that kind of behavior close to our own borders.\u00a0 So, the use of these stocks actually helps to increase our own security and reduce the risk of any aggressive actions by Russia against NATO Ally countries.\nLet me also add that more than 80 percent of Russia\u2019s land forces are now dedicated to the war in Ukraine.\u00a0 So for what happens there, not just for the total capacity of Russia to pose any threat to any NATO Ally from here.\nSo, my first message to the Allies is that we welcome the unprecedented support.\u00a0 We are calling for even more support, and we urge them to dig deeply into the inventories, to the stocks, to continue to provide the supplies that Ukraine need immediately.\u00a0 And we see that this is making a huge difference on the ground, because as Secretary Blinken \u2013 Tony \u2013 just referred to, there are \u2013 we see progress on the ground in Ukraine.\u00a0 But make no mistakes, you have to be prepared for the long haul.\nThe second answer to the concern about the level of stocks is of course to produce more.\u00a0 Therefore we are now in close contact with the defense industry, with capitals.\u00a0 We have established structures here at NATO on defense planning, on capabilities, to ensure that we are now ramping up production, that we are replenishing the stocks, both to be able to continue to provide support to Ukraine, but this is not only about supporting Ukraine; it\u2019s also about ensuring that we have the weapons, the munitions, the capabilities in place for our own deterrence and defense.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Okay, with\u00a0Agence France-Presse.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary General.\u00a0 Can I follow up on my colleague\u2019s question a bit on the state of where it is?\u00a0 Russia has just announced that they\u2019re sending reinforcements into the Kharkiv area.\u00a0 How do you see this going?\u00a0 Do you think this is a sign of \u2013 how do you see this as a sign in terms of the direction that Russia\u2019s going in?\u00a0 And how do you see this as a \u2013 in terms of where it could be seen in Kharkiv?\nCould I ask you also, since you\u2019re talking about the Alliance and unity among the \u2013 within the Alliance, the question of Turkey.\u00a0 Turkey, there was some concerns raised previously on Sweden and Finland.\u00a0 This past weekend there were comments from President Erdo\u011fan regarding Greece and comments perceived as threatening.\u00a0 How do you see the role of Turkey in this?\u00a0 Do you have any specific reaction to President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s remarks this weekend?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Shaun, thank you.\u00a0 On the first question, following up on our German colleague, look, the counteroffensive, again, is in its early days, so I don\u2019t want to prejudge, as I said, where it will go and how far it will get.\u00a0 But the initial signs are positive, and we see Ukraine making real, demonstrable progress in a deliberate way.\nBut fundamentally, what we\u2019re also seeing \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen this throughout \u2013 even as President Putin threw as much as he could against Ukraine earlier this summer, Ukraine absorbed the blow and now is pushing back, enabled by our partners and allies, the United States.\nBut the single most important factor, I believe, is this: Ukrainians are fighting for their own country.\u00a0 The Russian forces in Ukraine, many of them have no idea why they\u2019re there.\u00a0 Some didn\u2019t even know where they were being sent.\u00a0 We see reports that their morale is low, and when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re fighting for, that is something that\u2019s not sustainable.\nNow, Russia has significant resources, military resources.\u00a0 It is acting in horrific, indiscriminate ways.\u00a0 Ukrainians are bearing an incredibly heavy cost, as Jens alluded to.\u00a0 Their lives are on the line.\u00a0 And even on the front lines now, in and around the Kherson area \u2013 even as they\u2019re making progress, they\u2019re bearing real costs.\u00a0 But fundamentally they are fighting for their own homeland, they\u2019re fighting for their future; the Russian forces in Ukraine are not.\u00a0 And I am convinced that that is the most decisive factor, and we\u2019re seeing some manifestations of that.\u00a0 But this is likely to go on for some significant period of time.\u00a0 There are a huge number of Russian forces that are in Ukraine, and unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, President Putin has demonstrated that he will throw a lot of people into this, at huge cost to Russia, at huge cost to its future.\nAnd let me just add something I\u2019ve said from the beginning.\u00a0 How is what Putin is doing doing anything to improve the lives of the Russian people?\u00a0 How is this helping them?\u00a0 How is this assuring their own future?\u00a0 How is this creating opportunity for them?\u00a0 Not only is it not; it\u2019s doing just the opposite.\u00a0 It\u2019s cutting Russia off from the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s denying opportunity.\u00a0 It\u2019s depleting its resources, resources that could go to help the Russian people.\u00a0 In a closed information society that Putin has created in Russia, that information doesn\u2019t get there as quickly as it otherwise might, but I believe it will.\u00a0 And Russians have to ask themselves why in the world they are losing so many lives trying to take another country that is not theirs.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0 Just briefly on that, yes, we see some encouraging signs.\u00a0 The Russian offensive in Donbas has been stalled by the Ukrainian forces, and they are retaking some territory both in the east and in the south.\u00a0 But make no mistake.\u00a0 This can last for long time, and at least we have to be prepared for long haul and be ready to provide support to Ukraine for as long as it takes.\nWars are, by nature, unpredictable; and we know that Russia has a lot of military capabilities, and they are willing to use them to attack a sovereign, independent democratic nation, as we are seeing over the last months in Ukraine.\nThe first task is actually to be prepared for the winter.\u00a0 The winter is coming, it\u2019s going to be hard, and therefore we need both to continue to supply weapons and ammunition, but also winter clothing, tents, generators, and all the specific equipment which is needed for the winter.\u00a0 Partly because the size of the Ukraine army has just increased so much, they need more of these kind of winter equipment; and NATO is particularly focused on how can we provide tens of thousands of, for instance, winter uniforms to the Ukrainian army.\nOn Turkey and Greece, Turkey and Greece are two highly valued Allies.\u00a0 They participate and contribute to NATO in many different ways.\u00a0 Any differences between them, of course, should be solved by diplomatic means.\u00a0 We have also at NATO established what we call a deconfliction mechanism where Turkey and Greece can engage and have used this previously to provide information to provide also ways to deconflict any dangerous situation or behavior in, for instance, the Aegean Sea.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to follow up on Shaun\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d like to follow up on Shaun\u2019s question about Turkey and just press a little bit more.\u00a0 You talked about the importance of unity to the Alliance.\u00a0 President Erdo\u011fan in many ways, not only with this recent threat to Greece, seems to be threatening that unity.\u00a0 He\u2019s talked about another incursion into northeast Syria.\u00a0 He renewed over the summer his threat to block the admission of Sweden and Finland into the Alliance, and then this latest issue with Greece, among others.\u00a0 Just can you talk a little bit more about the effect this has on the unity you say is so crucial?\nAnd specifically Secretary Blinken, I believe I heard you say in your introductory remarks that you\u2019re confident or looking forward to Sweden and Finland being admitted into the Alliance.\u00a0 Can you tell us what your basis for that optimism is given that President Erdo\u011fan, as I said, renewed his threat over the summer to block their admission?\nAnd if I just might briefly ask you to talk a little bit about where things stand with the Iran nuclear negotiations.\u00a0 They appear to have stalled out, perhaps once and for all.\u00a0 Can they be revived?\u00a0 And what comes next?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Michael, thank you.\u00a0 And I\u2019m really going to defer to the secretary general on questions fundamentally related to NATO.\u00a0 Let me simply say this.\nFirst, with regard to Finland and Sweden, I think it\u2019s very clear that there is a strong Alliance consensus, strong support for their admission.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the ratification of the protocols process move forward with land record speed, and there\u2019s strong support in the United States, of course, from both political parties.\u00a0 I had the honor of depositing the instruments of ratification last month.\u00a0 So I\u2019m very confident that this is moving forward, moving forward deliberately, but I would defer to Jens on anything further on that.\nMore broadly, I can only repeat what Jens said, for example, about Greece and Turkey \u2013 both vital, important Allies, friends of the United States.\u00a0 They have differences, and of course we\u2019d like to see them resolve these differences in a constructive way through dialogue.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done so in the past, and we would expect them to do so going forward.\nAnd it is precisely because we have a fundamental challenge before us when it comes to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, a challenge that matters to every single ally and many countries well beyond the Alliance, well beyond the transatlantic area.\u00a0 And so, we should be making sure that we\u2019re focusing all of our attention and our resources as necessary in supporting Ukraine and pushing back against Russia\u2019s aggression.\nNow, what I\u2019ve heard in the room today with all of our NATO partners present was a very strong reaffirmation of that focus, of that unity \u2013 unity of purpose, unity of action.\u00a0 President Biden heard that very clearly in the conversation that he initiated just yesterday with many of our partners.\u00a0 Secretary Austin heard that and saw that at Ramstein where for the fifth time this coalition of countries has come together to further support Ukraine.\u00a0 So what I\u2019m seeing as a practical matter is an Alliance that is united and is focused on the biggest challenge that many of our countries face right now.\nWith regard to Iran and the JCPOA, a few things.\u00a0 First, it\u2019s a negotiation.\u00a0 It\u2019s back and forth.\u00a0 We have a response from Iran to what was put forward most recently by the European Union.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been looking at that along with the European partners, and needless to say, I\u2019m not about to negotiate anything in public.\u00a0 In past weeks, we\u2019ve closed some gaps.\u00a0 Iran had moved away from some extraneous demands, demands unrelated to the JCPOA itself.\u00a0 However, the latest response takes us backwards, and we are not about to agree to a deal that doesn\u2019t meet our bottom line requirements and/or that tries to continuously introduce extraneous demands that are not relevant to the JCPOA itself.\u00a0 If we conclude a deal, it\u2019s only because it will advance our national security.\u00a0 The President is focused on that, and what we\u2019ve just seen again would appear to move us backward, not forward.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:\u00a0\u00a0On differences in NATO \u2013 yes, of course, there are differences in NATO.\u00a0 We are 30 different Allies, 30 different democracies, and of course we don\u2019t always agree on all issues.\u00a0 And that has been the case since this Alliance was founded more than 70 years ago, dating back to the Suez Crisis in \u201956 or the differences on the Iraq War 20 years ago.\u00a0 And of course, we also see differences today.\u00a0 What makes NATO the most successful alliance in history is that we\u2019re able to overcome those differences, and then make decisions together, and then implement them together.\nAnd we saw that demonstrated at the NATO summit in Madrid just a few months ago.\u00a0 We made big decisions on further increasing our presence in the eastern part of Alliance.\u00a0 We only had 40,000 troops under NATO command as a direct response to the Russian attack on Ukraine.\u00a0 And we have also agreed to strengthen deterrence and defense across the whole Alliance.\nWe made also the decision to invite Finland and Sweden.\u00a0 That\u2019s an historic decision.\u00a0 And all Allies agreed to invite them.\u00a0 And I also welcome that, so far, this has been the fastest accession process in NATO\u2019s modern history.\u00a0 Up to now, 24 Allies have already ratified, in national parliaments, the accession protocols, and including the U.S. \u2013 the United States Senate.\nAnd I also think it\u2019s important to recognize that we have to take the security concerns of all Allies seriously, meaning that we need to address the fact that no other Ally have suffered \u2013 has suffered more terrorist attacks than Turkey. \u00a0And therefore, I welcome that as part of the agreement in Madrid \u2013 it was a trilateral agreement between Finland, Sweden, and Turkey to strengthen cooperation when it comes to fighting terrorism.\u00a0 They have established a permanent mechanism to exchange more informations, to exchange intelligence, and to work more closely together.\nSo, I\u2019m confident that we will move forward, and that Finland and Sweden will become members; and so, far this has been the fastest accession protocol process ever in NATO\u2019s history.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0I know there are more questions; unfortunately, we have run out of time, so this concludes this press conference.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-to-traveling-press-before-departing-poland/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemarks to Traveling Press Before Departing

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Rzeszow Airport", "location": "Rzeszow, Poland", "date": "September 9, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I just thought I\u2019d say a few words before we head off to Brussels and reflect for a minute about what we did yesterday in Ukraine as well as what we can expect today in Brussels.\u00a0 This was my fifth trip to Ukraine as Secretary and in many ways the most meaningful because it took place coincident with the beginnings of this counteroffensive that Ukraine is engaged in to liberate the land that has been seized by Russian forces as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nWe had a chance yesterday to hear directly from President Zelenskyy and his team about the state of their efforts in this counteroffensive, and I had an opportunity to share with him and his team additional significant assistance that the United States is providing both in the near term and longer term on the security side \u2013 an additional $2.8 billion. This assistance combined with the extraordinary courage and resilience of Ukrainian forces and the Ukrainian people has been the recipe for success thus far in the Ukrainians pushing the Russians back, and now engaging in this counteroffensive.\nI told President Zelenskyy on behalf of President Biden and the American people that we have been with Ukraine. We\u2019re with Ukraine today. We will be with Ukraine tomorrow and for however long it takes to deal with Russia\u2019s aggression. And I come away, again, very confident in Ukraine\u2019s future because the Ukrainians are fighting for their homeland.\u00a0 It\u2019s their homeland, not Russia\u2019s.\nWe head now to Brussels. I think I\u2019ve spent more time in Brussels than in any other city other than Washington, D.C., these past 18 months or so, and there\u2019s good reason for that. It\u2019s home to the NATO Alliance, the European Union. Allies and partners come together in Brussels to work together on the major challenges of our time; Ukraine now being at the top of the list.\nSo, I\u2019ll have an opportunity in Brussels to debrief NATO Allies, other partners, on what I learned in Ukraine and to work with them on a number of issues that are of concern to everyone, starting with the situation in and around Zaporizhzhia, where Russia has seized as part of its aggression a nuclear facility, and that\u2019s of real concern to many of us; making sure that food which needs to get out of Ukraine after it\u2019s been blocked by Russia \u2013 make sure the agreement that was reached continues; support for Ukraine, not just security support but economic support and humanitarian support; thinking about longer-term reconstruction needs \u2013 all of this is going to be part of the agenda in Brussels.\nAnd I think I\u2019ll have a chance to reflect a little bit on what I saw yesterday just in terms of the human toll of Russia\u2019s aggression \u2013 seeing kids at the children\u2019s hospital who are victims of that aggression; going to Irpin, a city that was devastated by Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 You see just miles from downtown Kyiv these bombed-out buildings, civilian dwellings.\u00a0 The only thing you can say when you see it is, at best \u2013 at best, these were indiscriminate attacks on civilian buildings, and at worst, intentional, deliberate, designed to terrorize the population.\u00a0 It\u2019s important that we remember this, because all of this comes down to the effect it\u2019s having on the lives of real people in Ukraine.\nBut finally, the most important reason I think we\u2019re in Brussels is because what has worked so well for us thus far has been our unity \u2013 unity of purpose, unity of action.\u00a0 When it comes to helping Ukraine defend itself, when it comes to making sure that there\u2019s significant pressure on Russia to end this aggression, when it comes to making sure our own Alliance is as strong and resolute as it can be to deter any additional Russian aggression, I think you\u2019ll see that unity in action, once again.\u00a0 And I\u2019m confident that based on every conversation I\u2019ve had, every engagement I\u2019ve had, it\u2019s going to continue.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, going into the Brussels visit, how concerned are you that the energy challenges facing European countries, including the high prices and the supply challenges, are going to erode the unity that you just mentioned of the anti-Russia coalition and the support of Europeans for what\u2019s happening in Ukraine?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Look, President Biden said from the start that standing up for what\u2019s at stake with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was not going to be cost-free.\u00a0 And countries have stepped up.\u00a0 They stepped up because, in the first instance, the aggression on a human level is abhorrent but also because, fundamentally, it\u2019s an aggression against the basic principles of the international system that helped us keep the peace, that helped us maintain security, that allowed countries to grow and move forward.\u00a0 And if we allow this to stand, this aggression to stand with impunity, it opens a Pandora\u2019s box for a world of conflict, for a world of hurt going forward.\nBut it comes with costs, but the cost of inaction, of not doing anything, of allowing this to go forward, would be far greater.\nNow, when it comes to energy, we have taken and we\u2019re taking significant action to deal with the challenges that exist.\u00a0 The United States has released significant oil from our strategic petroleum reserve.\u00a0 We have redirected liquefied natural gas to Europe to help alleviate some of the challenges that Europe is facing with the reduction in energy coming from Russia.\u00a0 We have a task force with the European Union looking at how we do this effectively not just in the immediate, but for the long term.\u00a0 And of course the fact that Russia has cut off the Nord Stream I pipeline, again, is further evidence that it is so vital strategically for Europe to move away from dependence on Russian energy, because Putin has shown repeatedly that he will use it as a weapon.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not going to stop now.\nSo, the challenge is to get through the coming winter.\u00a0 Europe has taken very significant steps to put itself in a position to do that, and I\u2019ll hear more about that later today.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing everything we can to help.\u00a0 But there\u2019s also a tremendous opportunity born of necessity.\u00a0 The opportunity is finally, once and for all, to move away from this dependence on Russia \u2013 to get rid of the chokehold that Russia has on Europe, using energy as a weapon, and to diversify supply, diversify roots, but also do it in a way that addresses the climate challenge.\nThis is a real, genuine opportunity.\u00a0 We see decisive action being taken by Europe.\u00a0 And again, from what I\u2019ve seen and heard so far, I\u2019m confident this is moving in a good direction.\u00a0 Is there going to be a cost to this?\u00a0 Is it going to be challenging?\u00a0 Yes, but I think we\u2019re looking at landing in a place where manifestly Europe, the United States, countries around the world will be better off.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, on the offensive in the east and south, what would have to happen?\u00a0 You talked with Mr. \u2013 President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 What would have to happen?\u00a0 What would they have to achieve with those offensives for it to make sense to go to the negotiating table, and for the West to support negotiations between Ukraine and Russia?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 That is for Ukraine to decide.\u00a0 That\u2019s for President Zelenskyy, the democratically elected leader of Ukraine, to decide.\u00a0 They have to decide the terms upon which they would want to engage and pursue diplomacy.\u00a0 President Zelenskyy said very clearly that when this ends, it will end with diplomacy, but it takes two to engage in meaningful diplomacy.\u00a0 And one is not \u2013 it\u2019s not present and shows no signs of being present, and that\u2019s Russia.\nSo, unless and until Russia demonstrates that it\u2019s serious about engaging in diplomacy, there\u2019s not much, alas, to be done.\u00a0 And as to the specific terms, that is up to Ukraine.\u00a0 Their country has been aggressed.\u00a0 Russia has seized territory in southern and eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s Ukraine, it\u2019s not Russia.\u00a0 And ultimately, territory needs to go back to Ukraine. \u00a0Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence needs to be reaffirmed. \u00a0I have no doubts with \u2013 about that.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve already seen that Putin\u2019s efforts to erase that sovereignty, to erase that independence, to try to make good on his conviction that Ukraine is not its own country and belongs to Russia \u2013 that\u2019s already game over.\u00a0 Putin\u2019s lost on that, but, meanwhile, doing tremendous damage to Ukraine, to lives, to livelihoods.\u00a0 That has to stop.\u00a0 The exact terms upon which it stops, again, will be up to Ukraine.\nMR PRICE: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Again, all of this is up to the Ukrainian people through their democratically elected representatives.

an exodus of more than 1,000 international companies from Russia, a brain drain of the most talented people from Russia; a huge decline in their imports so that they are unable to replace the weapons that they are using.\u00a0 They are unable to produce the products for their own people that they\u2019ve expected in the past.\u00a0 They\u2019re unable to make the things that they used to export to other countries, and their markets will dry out as a result.\u00a0 And they\u2019re unable to borrow money against their sovereign debt.\nSo it\u2019s gotten to a point where Moscow is now seeking military assistance from North Korea and Iran as we have systematically choked off their access to inputs elsewhere, and we will continue to exert that pressure until the aggression ceases and Ukraine is fully sovereign and independent.\nAcross all of these measures, our support \u2013 the pressure on Russia, the humanitarian and economic assistance \u2013 I think together we\u2019ve proven very effective, and we will keep (inaudible).\u00a0 You have our word and our track record.\u00a0 I should also add this:\u00a0 The rest of the world, of course, has felt the consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 And one of the consequences has been an increase in food insecurity that was already severe because of climate change and because of COVID.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s aggression added to that problem.\nThe agreement that was reached that lifted the blockade by Russia on Odesa has already resulted in 100 ships bringing grain and food products to the world, and most of that has gone to what we call the Global South \u2013 countries in Africa and elsewhere who are the most in need.\u00a0 President Putin\u2019s threat to discontinue that agreement I think will deeply anger and upset the countries that are benefiting now from Ukraine\u2019s right to export its own food.\nVery quickly, Mr. President, in April I pledged that we would reopen our mission at the first possible opportunity.\u00a0 Today, joined by Ambassador Brink, I spent some time with our team at the embassy.\u00a0 It was very meaningful to me to see the American flag flying over the United States embassy.\u00a0 We are committed to it, and I\u2019m glad we did it.\nSecretary of Defense Austin and I also promised that we will continue to provide security assistance at the president\u2019s request, and as I mentioned, we\u2019ve since provided billions of dollars.\u00a0 Today, the Secretary of Defense Austin is in Ramstein, Germany where he has been working and coordinating with countries around the world in providing assistance to Ukraine.\nI said we\u2019d continue to step up with economic assistance.\u00a0 Since April, we\u2019ve provided about $7.5 billion in economic support that goes directly to your (inaudible), including support for 600,000 teachers, and the school year has now started.\u00a0 And so for your future, for our future together, this is so important.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to be there for you.\nFinally, Mr. President, I visited a children\u2019s hospital today, and that made very real the costs (inaudible) that you\u2019re suffering, but also what\u2019s at stake \u2013 quite literally the future of the country, as represented by those children who are victims of Russian aggression.\u00a0 Their bravery, their courage is incredibly inspiring.\u00a0 It\u2019s clear, Mr. President, that Ukrainians both young and old have extraordinary resolve.\u00a0 So does the United States.\nThank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-an-event-in-honor-of-the-anniversaries-of-the-thomas-r-pickering-foreign-affairs-fellowship-charles-b-rangel-international-affairs-program-donald-m-payne-internatio/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

looked up to for guidance, for wisdom for so many years.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve heard today why he\u2019s such an effective diplomat.\u00a0 A hundred percent, okay.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We know where we need to go.\u00a0 So, Tom, thank you.\nBut this is really remarkable, because \u2013 again, I want to come back to something that Tom said.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at 30, we\u2019re looking at 20, we\u2019re looking at 10, we\u2019re looking at 5.\u00a0 And to the ambassador\u2019s point, not that many things actually survive institutionally in this town for as long, but not only survive, thrive.\u00a0 And this is the evidence of that.\u00a0 And it\u2019s incredibly powerful.\nIf you go anywhere in the corridors of this department, AID, around town, the halls of Congress, and you hear the names Pickering, Rangel, Payne, and now FAIT, you know what people are talking about.\u00a0 This has resonated throughout this town, and it\u2019s resonated not simply because we have these extraordinary programs, but because of the extraordinary people that have been able to participate in them and that have enriched our institution, enriched our foreign policy, enriched our development work in ways that are, quite frankly, immeasurable, but so incredibly powerful.\nSo for me, this is an easy thing to celebrate these anniversaries, but also to dedicate, dedicate ourselves to doing even more, going even further, digging even deeper, because it makes a profound difference.\nMilestones like the ones we\u2019re celebrating today are reached because a lot of people work to make them happen.\u00a0 So our program partners at Howard University, the Washington Center, thank you, thank you, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you to Wayne Frederick, president of Howard University, Kim Churches, president of the Washington Center, for joining us today.\u00a0 And I have a special affinity for the Washington Center; my uncle Alan was long a participant and supporter of its efforts.\nSam I think had to go on to carry out her work day, but she has been remarkable as a supporter of the Payne Fellowship \u2013 a fierce commitment to making our nation\u2019s development workforce even stronger, even more capable, even more resilient.\u00a0 And I see that every single day.\nAnd a huge thank you to the team here at the State Department who run these fellowships, starting with our great director general of the Foreign Service, Marcia Bernicat.\u00a0 Marcia, my thanks to you.\nWe also have, I think, with us today the \u2013 I think the word \u201clegendary\u201d is appropriate \u2013 Ambassador Ruth Davis, who\u2019s done so much to champion these fellowships not only in her time as director general, but later, too, as a member of the Rangel selection committee, a mentor to quite literally generations of fellows.\nAnd I want to come back to the trailblazers whose names adorn these programs and who really have blazed an incredible trail for this department and for our country.\u00a0 Tom, a legend here at the department, but as you\u2019ve heard, and this \u2013 there really is something to getting your name on something when you\u2019re still able to lead, because you feel a sense of responsibility; you don\u2019t let us forget it, every single day.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nCongressman Rangel.\u00a0 There was a special pleasure I\u2019ve got to say I took in hearing his voice across the video.\u00a0 It\u2019s a voice that resonates with me powerfully.\u00a0 I\u2019m a native New Yorker.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Charlie Rangel \u2013 wow.\u00a0 This is someone that I\u2019ve looked up to and revered for so many years as an extraordinary leader.\u00a0 And that voice gets you every single time, and it was really great to hear it today.\u00a0 He has been a leading force for so long in making us more diverse.\nAnd the late Congressman Don Payne, who, as we\u2019ve heard, set an incredibly powerful example in his dedication to equality, and we\u2019re lucky to have his son, Congressman Don Payne, Jr., here with us today.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nNow, in my experience, devoted public servants like these don\u2019t actually think about their legacies.\u00a0 They\u2019re actually focused on doing good work, and that\u2019s what becomes their legacy.\u00a0 These fellowships represent living legacies for these remarkable people.\u00a0 And then, as I said, we heard from Melanie, we heard from Krina, we heard from Jared, we heard from Hermes about how these programs transformed their lives and careers.\nI don\u2019t think you need any better evidence of the incredible power and impact and value of these programs than hearing from the four of them.\u00a0 They are the powerful living evidence of why this has been so important, why this has added so much value to what we do.\u00a0 So thank you each for your testimonies, for sharing with us, and thank you for what you continue to do every day to make us better and stronger.\nWe heard how the fellowships have transformed their lives.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also heard how these fellowships have transformed our department.\u00a0 If you look around \u2013 and I see this every day; not a day goes by, and this is almost literally true, when I don\u2019t come across a Rangel or Pickering Fellow here \u2013 we see them advancing our work in critical roles around the world, from special assistants to ambassadors.\u00a0 Payne Fellows are advancing the work of development, creating tangible change for communities.\u00a0 When I visit our embassies around the world and I\u2019m with colleagues from USAID, I see the incredible work that they\u2019re doing every day.\u00a0 This is where the rubber meets the road, actually making a tangible difference in people\u2019s lives.\nAnd our FAIT Fellows, they\u2019re making sure that we have the technology we need to actually carry out 21st century diplomacy.\u00a0 When I started at the department and Tom was one of the people I looked up to, technology was not exactly a hallmark of this institution.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I inherited an office in the front office of the European Affairs Bureau that, as I\u2019ve said before, its previous occupant had been a very large safe.\u00a0 Then I took the office and the large safe was gone because they needed to make room for me, and there was a very large \u2013 remember these, Tom? \u2013 Wang computer on the desk.\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ve made a little progress since then, but we need to do more and FAIT Fellows are making sure that we have the technology that we need to carry out diplomacy in this century.\u00a0 Without them, quite literally so much of what we do would be a heck of a lot more difficult if not actually impossible.\nAnd here\u2019s the thing that I really want to focus on for a few minutes today.\u00a0 Our fellows deliver for America; they reflect America.\u00a0 Secretary Powell said back in 2002 when he announced the then-brand new Rangel Fellowship, our diplomats, and I quote, \u201csend a powerful, positive signal around the globe that differences do not have to be divisive, and that freedom works.\u00a0 They send that message not just by doing what they do \u2026 but also being who they are \u2026 personifying America in its beautiful diversity.\u201d\nSo you\u2019ve heard, starting with Marcia, why we\u2019re so focused on this.\u00a0 We used to talk about our foreign policy after the Second World War as being animated by enlightened self-interest.\u00a0 Well, this, too, is enlightened self-interest.\u00a0 It is not only the right thing to do, it\u2019s the smart thing to do.\u00a0 You\u2019ve heard from all of our speakers how diversity, how inclusion makes our foreign policy that much stronger, that much more innovative, that much more effective.\nWe know, simply put, that in a diverse world it would be to penalize ourselves not to draw on our full diversity.\u00a0 It simply makes no sense.\u00a0 But for decades, American diplomats pretty much all looked the same.\u00a0 Many came from the same parts of the country, even the same schools.\u00a0 Just about everyone else \u2013 people of different genders, different faiths, different racial and ethnic backgrounds, nations of origin \u2013 they were relegated to supporting roles if they could find a place here at all.\nGenerations of public servants worked diligently, determinedly to change that.\u00a0 They faced a lot of headwinds, sometimes very, very strong.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard how Congressman Rangel and the Congressional Black Caucus fought to pass legislation creating the Pickering and Rangel Fellowships; how dedicated leaders inside the department moved these programs forward, like Ambassador Edward Perkins, who implemented the Pickering Fellowship as director general of the Foreign Service.\u00a0 Even after leaving office, he continued to watch over the program, including threatening to go to Congress himself when he heard that funding might be cut.\nI think you can get a sense of how cherished the program is, how much good it\u2019s doing, by how hard people are willing to fight for it.\u00a0 Many people have fought hard for these fellowships because they know how vital they are.\u00a0 They know how important they are.\u00a0 They know what a difference it makes for our diplomacy and for our standing and effectiveness in the world.\nSo, as you heard, just the last two years these four fellowship programs together have increased their numbers by 50 percent or more.\u00a0 In total, we now welcome more than 100 fellows a year between the four programs.\u00a0 Thirty years ago, when all of this started, we had eight exceptional people.\u00a0 So that\u2019s progress, that\u2019s moving forward, but I\u2019m inspired by Tom\u2019s \u2013 (laughter) \u2013\u00a0 admonition that we\u2019re going to do more and do better.\nToday \u2013 and this is remarkable.\u00a0 Think about this for a minute \u2013 one in nine \u2013 one in nine \u2013 active Foreign Service officers participated in Rangel or Pickering.\u00a0 Thanks to them, the number of generalists from underrepresented backgrounds has increased by 33 percent.\u00a0 Among Payne Fellows, 75 percent are racial or ethnic minorities; 75 percent are women.\u00a0 And 65 percent of FAIT Fellows come from underrepresented backgrounds.\nSo this is progress.\u00a0 These numbers represent progress.\u00a0 But \u2013 and this is what I want to focus on and finish on \u2013 we still have a lot of work to do.\u00a0 We still have a lot of work to do to create a department that truly reflects the people that we\u2019re here to represent, that\u2019s truly as diverse and inclusive as it needs to be if we\u2019re going to fulfill our mission on behalf of this country and on behalf of its people.\nSo in that spirit, I do have some good news to share today, and I\u2019m happy to announce that we have two new fellowships to put forward today.\u00a0 Next month we will launch the Colin Powell Leadership Program to recruit college students.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 This program will recruit college students and recent graduates to the Civil Service.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 These participants are going to join fellowships and internships that lead to full-time employment with the State Department.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to get training, mentoring to prepare them for the world of diplomacy.\nWe\u2019re also creating a new fellowship for something that is very near and dear to me, and that is our Diplomatic Security Service.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Graduate students from underrepresented communities will receive scholarships, professional development training, and mentoring.\u00a0 And after completing the program, they will enter the Foreign Service as DS special agents.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Now, this fellowship is going to be named for another exceptional public servant, William D. Clark, Sr.\u00a0 He was the first member from Diplomatic Security to achieve the rank of ambassador.\nSo beyond these fellowships, we will keep driving progress on diversity, on inclusion, on equity, on accessibility.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be driving it across the department, working with the leadership of another remarkable person, Ambassador Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, our first chief diversity and inclusion officer.\u00a0 Gina has been leading an extraordinary effort from almost day one.\u00a0 We created this office \u2013 it was one of the very things that I did as Secretary \u2013 reporting directly to me to make sure that every single day we are driving the work, driving the agenda of building a department that reflects this country.\nThere has been a lot of good work done over the last 18 to 20 months.\u00a0 I won\u2019t rehearse it all.\u00a0 But simply put, standing up this office, having senior leadership in every bureau at the deputy assistant secretary level reporting to and connecting with this office, having a senior advisory board across the department working together to make sure that we are advancing this agenda.\u00a0 We have for the first time ever a remarkable data set where we\u2019ve disaggregated data, and we have a picture of virtually every single office in the department, where we are, where we\u2019re not, where we need to go.\u00a0 We have a five year strategic plan that will soon be published \u2013 it\u2019s at the White House now \u2013 that reflects commentary, ideas from almost a thousand Foreign Service officers and civil servants.\nTogether, we\u2019re looking at every single aspect of how we need to carry this \u2013 forward this agenda, from recruitment, which is vital, and particularly reaching out to communities that have been underrepresented here in high school, in college, opening hearts, opening minds to the idea that this could be a career \u2013 this could be a place where they want to spend their working lives.\nBut we know from experience that even as people come through the doors of C Street \u2013 and thanks to these fellowships more and more have done so \u2013 that that\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 Because if you don\u2019t have a genuinely inclusive workplace, then people won\u2019t stay.\u00a0 We\u2019ve learned that and we\u2019ve learned that the hard way.\u00a0 So even as we\u2019re focused on opening the doors wider and bringing more people in, we want to make sure that we\u2019re building a culture at the State Department that makes everyone not only feel welcome but genuinely included and convinced that they can aspire to do any job in this department.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of work that goes into that, a lot of effort, and it\u2019s not like flipping a light switch.\u00a0 It is moving an aircraft carrier, but we\u2019re moving it.\u00a0 Relentlessly, it is moving.\nI want to close with a shout out to one particular Pickering Fellow, who I happen to work with every day, and this is one of my special assistants, Bryan Furman.\u00a0 Bryan, where are you?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo \u2013 and a group of us had lunch just yesterday and catching up and learning some of the stories.\u00a0 And the question I\u2019m always asking people, especially the younger folks among us, is what brought you here; how did you wind up here?\u00a0 So in college Bryan studied languages.\u00a0 He studied psychology.\u00a0 He also practiced martial arts.\u00a0 So when he thought about his future, he thought maybe I\u2019ll keep studying languages, maybe I\u2019ll go into the health field, maybe I\u2019ll open a martial arts studio, which tells you a little bit about the multi-talents that he brings to this job.\u00a0 And by the way, having some background in martial arts is extremely helpful in the work that we\u2019re doing every day, and it makes me feel a lot better.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut then Bryan spent a year in Tajikistan on a Fulbright and saw all of the extraordinary work that our embassies and our diplomats are doing.\u00a0 So he applied for a Pickering.\u00a0 He was accepted.\u00a0 He joined the department, and now we travel the world together, and he\u2019s making sure that this office \u2013 the office of the Secretary \u2013 runs smoothly, which, as you can imagine, is not necessarily a job for the faint of heart.\u00a0 So Bryan, thank you.\u00a0 It\u2019s just one more powerful example of how wonderful these fellowship programs are.\nWhen you ask Bryan what Pickering meant to him, he says that it helped him break into this world of diplomacy, learn to navigate this bureaucracy \u2013 something I\u2019m still trying to figure out \u2013 and to hit the ground running when he became a Foreign Service officer.\u00a0 But perhaps even more important, the Pickering Fellowship showed him how diplomats at their best spot problems and then work together to fix them.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what these fellowships have done.\u00a0 They\u2019ve taken on a serious problem, and they\u2019ve helped us make real progress towards solving it.\u00a0 So we will keep working together in the days to come, in the weeks to come, in the months to come, in the decades to come, to make sure that this department is a place that genuinely reflects our values, that looks like America, and that is equipped to do the best possible work on behalf of America.\nThank you all so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/to-african-diaspora-youth-and-exchange-alumni/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo African Diaspora Youth and Exchange Alumni\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J.

want it to end, so we found a way to sort of continue it \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 today.\u00a0 And I\u2019m really grateful to each and every one of you for coming out.\nErv, by the way, who doesn\u2019t look it unless you consider that we had a grade school program has actually been in this line of work for 27 years.\u00a0 So \u2014\n(Applause.)\nSo as Erv said, we did just get back from the trip.\u00a0 Actually, truth be told, we started on another continent.\u00a0 We started in Cambodia, we went to the Philippines, and then we transitioned to South Africa, to the DRC, to Rwanda.\u00a0 We made a couple of pit stops, too, on the way home, a quick pit stop in Ghana to refuel, but managed to see the president in the waiting room at the airport.\u00a0 Very good.\u00a0 Even hit Cabo Verde; it was our very last stop.\u00a0 And then finally, finally back home.\nBut this is an ongoing story, which is really why I wanted to have the chance to be here with all of you today.\u00a0 The trip, my second to Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 and in a sense the third, because the very \u2013 I think the second trip that I did as Secretary was actually a virtual trip to Kenya and Nigeria very early on when we weren\u2019t actually traveling.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve had extensive engagement, and I\u2019ll come to it again later.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have an African Leaders Summit that President Biden\u2019s hosting at the end of the year.\u00a0 So there\u2019s a lot of work leading and ramping up to that.\nBut I think, as Erv suggested, this is evidence that for us, Sub-Saharan Africa is a major force for the future.\u00a0 And it\u2019s the very numbers that Erv cited that go to the heart of this, the fact that, as he said, in the next couple of years virtually half the population will be under the age of 25, and by 2050, one in four people on this planet from Africa.\u00a0 That is the definition of the future, and we have a profound stake in trying to get that shared future right.\nOne of the opportunities that I had during the trip was to lay out our Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa, and we tried to focus on a simple proposition.\u00a0 For us now, this is not about what we do for Africa; it\u2019s what we do with Africa.\u00a0 And it comes down to a \u2013 I think a simple, powerful recognition.\u00a0 There is not a single issue that is really having an effect on the lives of our people and on Africans \u2013 whether it is COVID that we\u2019ve all been grappling with and global health more broadly, whether it\u2019s climate change, whether it\u2019s the impact of emerging technologies on all of our lives \u2013 not a single one of these issues can we effectively address alone.\u00a0 We have to find ways to cooperate, find ways to coordinate.\u00a0 We have to find ways to do more with other countries.\nAnd precisely because Africa represents so much of the future as well as the present, it\u2019s in our interest to find ways to deepen our cooperation.\u00a0 The partnership that we\u2019re looking for extends well beyond government.\u00a0 It goes to civil society and NGOs; it goes to the private sector; it goes to citizens more broadly.\u00a0 And we had an opportunity on the trip to connect across these many different groups, and that\u2019s part of the reason I was so anxious to in effect extend the trip by talking to all of you.\nAnd in effect, these partnerships are actually going to be driven by whether you wind up or are in government, whether you\u2019re in civil society, whether you\u2019re in business, whether you\u2019re in academia, whatever the case may be \u2013 the arts \u2013 you\u2019re at the heart of the kind of partnerships that we hope to build.\nIn particular, we have here, as Erv said, folks from the diaspora and the Mandela Fellowship, something I\u2019m very excited about.\u00a0 You are, as a result, already in fact building the partnerships that we\u2019re trying to build.\nLet me just say a couple of quick words about the extraordinary power of the fellowship program.\u00a0 Since President Obama launched the fellowship program, over 5,800 rising leaders from Sub-Saharan Africa have actually taken part.\u00a0 That\u2019s remarkable in just a few short years.\u00a0 But what\u2019s even more remarkable \u2013 because I\u2019ve had a chance to talk to a number of you over the years, including most recently on this trip \u2013 is that I think the Mandela Fellowship does a couple of very powerful things.\u00a0 One is that it actually allows you to create networks that will endure long after your fellowship and, I think, are going to power change far into the future.\nI met some alums in South Africa just this past trip.\u00a0 Fellows are tackling issues like getting more girls into STEM, just to cite one example.\u00a0 But what is fundamental to the fellowship is that it goes both ways.\u00a0 Ideas, innovations are flowing in both directions.\u00a0 That\u2019s true of the fellows who are here among you today.\u00a0 You actually manage to enrich our college campuses, universities, even as you study there.\u00a0 So American students who are there got as much, if not more out of this, I would say, than you did.\nAnd it\u2019s also true of members of the diaspora who are with us today.\u00a0 You\u2019re doing work that bridges our countries, our cultures, our communities, the arts, public health, education, human rights, democracy \u2013 all of that is what you\u2019re doing.\nThe last thing I wanted to share is this, because I\u2019m mostly anxious to hear from you and have a conversation.\u00a0 One of the things that I hear some of the time when I\u2019m meeting with young people is: how can the U.S. talk about the importance of democracy \u2013 which is one of the things we talked in the strategy \u2013 when you face your own challenges here at home in the United States when it comes to democracy, challenges that I think are visible every day?\u00a0 And actually, that\u2019s part of the answer.\u00a0 The very fact that they are visible, that you see us grappling with them every single day, that it\u2019s not pushed under the carpet, it\u2019s not pretended that these problems don\u2019t exist, we\u2019re actually confronting them openly, transparently \u2013 that is actually part of the answer.\u00a0 Because as long as you can do that, I think you\u2019ll come out on the right side of things.\nBut the main point for our strategy is this:\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t treat democracy as an issue where Africa has problems and the United States has solutions.\u00a0 On the contrary, it recognizes that we all have challenges in strengthening our democracies, making sure they\u2019re resilient, and it\u2019s everything from misinformation to inequity.\u00a0 And we have a real stake in learning from each other.\nOne of the things that I found over almost 30 years of being engaged in foreign policy and so getting to travel the world in one way or another \u2013 first with President Clinton, and then with President Obama, and now with President Biden \u2013 is on just about everything that we\u2019re trying to figure out, someone somewhere probably has.\u00a0 And if we can just find ways to share that information so we don\u2019t have to keep reinventing the wheel, we\u2019re going to make progress a lot faster than what people can imagine.\nWe need to draw on the best ideas, we need to draw on the best innovations no matter where they\u2019re from.\u00a0 And that is the spirit of the Summit for Democracy that we initiated last year \u2013 President Biden did \u2013 and it\u2019s the spirit that will animate the Africa Leaders Summit at the end of the year.\u00a0 And that summit is going to have a big role for young people, rising generations, and a big role for the diaspora.\nSo stay tuned.\u00a0 A lot more to come in the next few months.\nThe last point is this. \u00a0This trip, again, underscored for me that so many issues that we now consider global priorities and that we\u2019ve talked about \u2013 including, for example, the interconnectedness of our health and our climate \u2013 are actually championed first in Africa by African citizens and nations.\u00a0 In South Africa and beyond, we heard how our respective civil rights movements had inspired and energized each other over the generations, and we still find that today.\nSo let me end with this: two requests.\u00a0 First, the 2023 Mandela Washington Fellowship application opens tomorrow.\u00a0 So help us recruit.\u00a0 If you had a good experience, if this is something that\u2019s been beneficial to you, spread the word.\u00a0 Share it.\u00a0 We want to get the best of the rising generation to take part.\nSecond, from day one I have made it a priority to try to recruit and retain a workforce at the State Department that actually reflects the country that we represent.\u00a0 So if any of you Americans here are interested in a career in foreign policy, the Foreign Service, the Civil Service, come on down.\u00a0 We need you; we want you.\u00a0 This is a time \u2013 it\u2019s the most exciting time, as challenging as it is to be engaged in diplomacy, because of the very reason that I cited at the outset.\u00a0 None of the problems that really matter can be tackled by any one country acting alone.\u00a0 The role of our diplomacy, the role of our diplomats, is to build that cooperation, that coordination among countries.\u00a0 There\u2019s never been a more important time to do it, so come on down.\nLet me stop talking with that, because I\u2019m really anxious to hear (inaudible).\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda", "date": "August 11, 2022", "content": "\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, members of the press, good morning.\u00a0 I would like to start by welcoming Secretary Blinken and his delegation to Kigali.\u00a0 And this visit is an opportunity to enhance bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Rwanda and discuss matters of mutual interest.\nEarlier today, His Excellency the President of Rwanda received Secretary Blinken and his delegation.\u00a0 We had productive discussions about the partnership between our two countries.\u00a0 At the bilateral level, we appreciated our substantial cooperation in various sectors, including defense and security, trade and investment, peacekeeping, and health.\u00a0 The Government of Rwanda appreciates the significant support of the U.S. Government in the fight against COVID-19 in Rwanda, where the U.S. Government contributed more than 5 million doses of vaccines and 100 medical ventilators to Rwanda.\u00a0 The U.S. continues to be, indeed, a strong partner in Rwanda\u2019s efforts to build a strong and resilient health system.\nWe are also very pleased with our cooperation in the defense sector.\u00a0 Our military cooperation has continued to grow, and we were happy to co-host with the U.S. the 11th Annual African Air Chiefs Symposium earlier this year in Kigali.\nWe also discussed the security in eastern DRC, the very real consequences for Rwanda, and reaffirmed our support to regional efforts, including the Nairobi and the Luanda initiatives toward peace and stability in our region.\u00a0 We agreed on the need to eradicate all illegal armed groups operating in eastern DRC, including the FDLR and its factions.\u00a0 We noted the resurgence of hate speech, public incitement, and genocidal ideology in DRC, and the need to address this issue.\u00a0 We also reaffirmed the importance of respect of territorial integrity by all the countries in the region.\nAt the global level, this visit was an occasion to discuss the consequences of the war in Ukraine on Africa, and Rwanda in particular.\u00a0 We look forward to working with the U.S. Government on addressing the challenges we are facing in relation to the consequences of this conflict.\nOnce again, we are happy to host you, Secretary Blinken, and your delegation in Rwanda, and we look forward to continuing our work together and strengthening our partnership with the U.S.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Minister, thank you very much, and thank you for hosting our delegation today.\nA few days ago in South Africa, I set out our administration\u2019s new Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa, a strategy that recognizes African nations and peoples as equal and vital partners in advancing our shared priorities, tackling together global challenges, and being able to deliver for our citizens.\nYou see those same goals reflected in the relationship between Rwanda and the United States. \u00a0The journey that Rwanda has taken over the past two decades has been remarkable. \u00a0You\u2019ve risen from the ashes of genocide to become a global destination for innovation, for investment, for tourism. \u00a0You lead internationally on priorities that we share: making critical contributions to the United Nations and regional peacekeeping missions; speaking up for Ukraine\u2019s right to sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia\u2019s unprovoked and brutal invasion; co-sponsoring a resolution at the United Nations to start negotiations on a legally binding global agreement on plastic pollution \u2013 with scores of countries\u2019 support, including the United States.\nAnd our two countries have worked closely together on the issues that matter a great deal to Rwanda\u2019s future: improving the quality of your health care system; strengthening your agricultural production and food security; expanding economic opportunities; bolstering the education system, so that Rwandan youth are empowered to seize opportunities in the 21st century economy.\nIn partnership with COVAX, as the minister mentioned, the United States has donated more than five and a half million doses of safe and effective vaccines to Rwanda, which has helped the country vaccinate nearly 70 percent \u2013 fully vaccinate nearly 70 percent of its population.\nIn the last six years, we\u2019ve helped more than 2.8 million Rwandans get access to electricity for the first time \u2013 electricity generated using renewable energy.\nSo the relationship between our peoples is deep and diverse, as is evident in the collaboration between Rwandan and American nongovernmental organizations, students, entrepreneurs, doctors, and others.\nAs the foreign minister said, we just came from a meeting with President Kagame, where we covered a wide range of issues, including many of the ones that I\u2019ve just discussed. \u00a0I also raised issues where we have real concerns. \u00a0On those, our discussions were direct, candid, respectful. \u00a0The president candidly conveyed his views as well.\u00a0 I discussed the credible reports indicating that Rwanda continues to support the M23 rebel group and has its armed forces inside the DRC.\u00a0 We recognize that Rwanda has security concerns of its own, including reports of cooperation between the Congolese military and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, the DFLR, an armed group.\nMy message to both President Tshisekedi and President Kagame this week has been the same: any support or cooperation with any armed group in eastern DRC endangers local communities and regional stability. \u00a0And every country in the region must respect the territorial integrity of the others.\u00a0 The United States has the same message for all neighboring countries.\nWe\u2019ve seen where the failure to respect these principles can lead in the immeasurable consequences of the decades-long conflict in eastern DRC, which has taken the lives of more than 5 million people and displaced millions more.\nComing out of the discussions, both presidents have agreed to engage in direct talks with each other.\u00a0 They\u2019re both ready to resume the talks in the context of the Nairobi Process with armed groups, and both welcome the continued U.S. engagement in support of African-led mediation efforts.\nWe know that Rwandans are also alarmed \u2013 justifiably \u2013 by the increase in hate speech in the DRC targeting Rwandaphones. \u00a0The United States will continue to condemn such unacceptable and dangerous rhetoric, and I encouraged President Tshisekedi, his government, to do the same.\nLeaders in the region \u2013 particularly Kenya and Angola \u2013 are working hard to lower tensions and address the problem of armed groups in the eastern Congo. \u00a0We\u2019re deeply grateful for these efforts. \u00a0These initiatives are crucial for getting the actors to resolve their differences peacefully, through diplomacy rather than through violence, and to address the underlying drivers of the conflict.\nIn our discussions, I also raised serious concerns about human rights. \u00a0As I told President Kagame, we believe people in every country should be able to express their views without fear of intimidation, imprisonment, violence, or any other forms of repression. \u00a0That\u2019s true whether they are political opponents, human rights defenders, journalists like the ones in this audience, or simply citizens. \u00a0These are values cherished by the American people and people around the world; that\u2019s why I raised them, as have members of the U.S. Congress.\nI raised the case of Paul Rusesabagina, who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States, and underscored our concerns about the lack of fair trial guarantees provided to him.\nLater today, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to visit the Kigali Genocide Memorial. \u00a0It will provide a chance to reflect on the unimaginable horrors of the genocide, which reverberate to this day; to reaffirm the importance of standing up, rather than standing by, in the face of atrocities; and to ask ourselves what history teaches us about the need to prevent hatred and fear from taking hold again and squandering the progress the people of Rwanda have made since that time.\nWe have the deepest admiration for the people of Rwanda, their courage, their resilience, all that they have built. \u00a0And we hope the conversations we\u2019ve had today will help our partnership grow even stronger.\nFinally, Mr. Minister, if you would indulge me just a point of personal privilege, as we say back in the United States.\u00a0 One of the most important tools in our arsenal is the power of the spoken word \u2013 what we say both at home and on the world stage.\u00a0 In the past 18 months, our voice, my voice, has been shaped and sharpened by our chief speechwriter, Megan Rooney.\u00a0 I raise this now because Megan will soon be leaving the department.\u00a0 Others\u2019 gain is our profound loss, and that loss is especially pronounced when it comes to me.\u00a0 Not only is she a master wordsmith who can make what can sometimes be a dry policy soar, she\u2019s a wonderful person.\u00a0 Kind.\u00a0 Funny.\u00a0 Fun to be around.\u00a0 To put her in the vernacular, she brings a trademark\u00a0joie de vivre, which has been a light for me and our entire team, especially the case when we\u2019re traveling around the world.\nSo, Megan, thank you, thank you, thank you, and I\u2019ll end by saying that going forward should I happen to say something, I don\u2019t know, less than artful, we\u2019ll know why. Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you Minister, thank you Secretary Blinken. Now, we\u2019ll take a couple of questions now starting with RBA.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Isabelle Masozera from RBA.\u00a0 I have a question for both officials.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, the State Department has designated Paul Rusesabagina as wrongfully detained.\u00a0 What does this mean in this case?\u00a0 Also, we understand that you are unable to meet the victims of FLN attacks due to your tight schedule, but what would you say to the victims and their families?\nAnd also, to Minister Biruta, on the same issue \u2013 President Paul Kagame last night tweeted, saying there are things that just won\u2019t work here.\u00a0 Was this discussed this morning in the meeting, and what does the government plan to do about this issue of putting pressure on releasing Rusesabagina?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 We have been clear about our concerns related to Paul Rusesabagina\u2019s trial and conviction, particularly the lack of fair trial guarantees.\u00a0 We continue to urge the government to address our concerns about the legal protections afforded to him in his case and establish safeguards to prevent similar outcomes in the future.\u00a0 I had an opportunity to discuss this matter with President Kagame this morning.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to get into specifics, but we\u2019ll continue to engage on it.\u00a0 And I also had an opportunity just a few days ago to talk to Paul Rusesabagina\u2019s family, and we\u2019ll continue to be in contact with them as well.\u00a0 Thank you.\nOh, and I\u2019m sorry, the second part of your question.\u00a0 One of the most profound reasons that we are engaged in support of African-led mediation efforts in the eastern Congo as well as in other parts of the region is precisely because at the heart of everything is human suffering and real people, individuals, men, women, and children who are the victims of conflict, the victims of violence, the victim of armed groups of one kind or another.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very easy to get focused on big questions of policy, but what this comes down to is actual lives \u2013 real human lives.\u00a0 That\u2019s what motivates me.\u00a0 That\u2019s what motivates us to seek to help wherever we can resolve conflict, preserve peace, and give people a chance.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019ve seen far too many victims of violence and conflict, and that\u2019s why we have a strong incentive to do whatever we can to end it.\nI have opportunities wherever possible to meet with those who have been victimized by violence of one kind or another, who have been victimized by conflict, who have been victimized by a lack of opportunity that results from places and societies being in conflict.\u00a0 And if I don\u2019t have an opportunity with an individual group, I usually have a pretty good idea of their stories, what\u2019s happened to them.\u00a0 And that is the motivating factor for me every single day.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0\u00a0And listen, on the question about Rusesabagina, as far as the Government of Rwanda is concerned, Paul Rusesabagina is a Rwandan citizen.\u00a0 And he was arrested.\u00a0 He was tried and convicted along with 20 others \u2013 20 other accomplices for serious crimes they committed against Rwandan citizens and which he committed while residing in the United States.\u00a0 And this was done lawfully under both Rwandan and international laws.\u00a0 Therefore, Rwanda will continue to abide by our rules, and the decisions that were made by our judiciary.\u00a0 And we request our partners to respect Rwanda\u2019s sovereignty, Rwanda\u2019s laws, and its institutions.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I can state about your question on Rusesabagina.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, next question, Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m going to sit so I can read my questions so excuse me.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, as you mentioned in your opening remarks, there have been reports of \u2013 regarding harassment and arrest of domestic dissidents by the Rwandan Government along with reports of transnational aggression, including the use of spyware and alleged attacks against opponents in South Africa and Mozambique and elsewhere.\u00a0 Some members of the U.S. Congress are calling on the Biden administration to withhold foreign assistance and employ the Khashoggi Ban.\u00a0 At the same time, these messages have been made before U.S. officials.\u00a0 Did you hear anything today that indicates there will be a change in these actions?\nAnd going back to Paul Rusesabagina, now deemed as wrongfully detained, based on what I heard from the Foreign Minister, it doesn\u2019t seem like the Rwandan Government is prepared to release him.\u00a0 How do you believe this can be resolved?\u00a0 And do you believe this issue \u2013 along with the others I mentioned \u2013 will pose a threat to the two countries\u2019 ability to work together smoothly?\nAnd for you, Mr. Minister, what is your response to the allegations of domestic and transnational repression and to U.S. advocacy on these points?\u00a0 And what is your \u2013 how do you see the U.S. response to your government statements about Paul Rusesabagina\u2019s alleged actions?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Missy, thanks very much.\u00a0 First, let me start by saying this: we recognize Rwanda\u2019s incredibly difficult history, the 1994 genocide.\u00a0 And we know the ongoing legacy of that history of the genocide.\u00a0 But criminalization of some individual\u2019s participation in politics, harassment of those who express opposition to the current government, we believe underlie future peace, stability, and success \u2013 success which has already been extraordinary in the case of Rwanda over the last 20 plus years, but which will not reach its full potential if those who express disagreements \u2013 criticism of whatever the current government happens to be are repressed in their ability to do that whether that is here in Rwanda or abroad.\nAnd to that point, as you noted, we established what is called the Khashoggi Ban to make clear that any country that engages in repressive actions against those who criticize it, if those persons are in the United States, they face consequences for those actions.\nI\u2019ve shared all of this with President Kagame today.\u00a0 It\u2019s not for me to characterize his response, but these are concerns that I shared.\u00a0 And I did that, again, in the context of making clear our desire for an even stronger, even more productive relationship between the United States and Rwanda, building on what Rwanda has done so successfully, building on what we\u2019ve already done together.\u00a0 But these are issues that we care deeply about, our Congress cares deeply about, the American people care deeply about.\nI also shared with President Kagame that in many ways our own focus and motivation on these issues goes back to our very founding.\u00a0 It\u2019s maybe a little bit particular in some ways to the United States, but it\u2019s in our DNA.\u00a0 As you heard President Biden discuss, we come \u2013 we came together as a country, not around any particular group, any particular race, religion, ethnicity.\u00a0 We came together around an idea, a shared idea that all are created equal and that all are entitled to the same basic inalienable rights.\u00a0 And of course, we have never made fully good on that ideal.\u00a0 We\u2019re in constant search of it, constant efforts to form our own more perfect union, which is an acknowledgment that we\u2019re not perfect and this is a constant, ongoing effort.\u00a0 But we do it openly, we do it transparently, we deal with our challenges, as I think the world can see.\u00a0 And so by way of explanation as well why we care so deeply about what we believe to be universal rights, not simply those that pertain to Americans.\nAnd again, on the \u2013 on the matter and the case of Paul Rusesabagina, all I can share with you today is that I raised this with President Kagame.\u00a0 We had a discussion about it.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to, again, characterize that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to engage, and I\u2019ll also follow up with the family.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 When Rwanda deals with people who commit crimes against our country and our people, we abide by laws, both national and international.\u00a0 We know some other countries have their own method to deal with those kind of people, those criminals who commit crimes against their own countries.\u00a0 But as far as Rwanda is concerned, we do it along with, in respect of our laws, and in respect of international laws.\u00a0 Any other people could qualify these as international repression or whatever, but when we deal with people who commit crimes against our country, against our people, we abide by the laws, both national and international with total (inaudible).\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Our next question,\u00a0New Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 My name is Edwin Musoni from\u00a0The New Times.\u00a0 I\u2019ll ask the minister and the Secretary of State.\u00a0 Minister, a (inaudible) UN group of experts report indicated that the DRC army was supplying arms to FDLR, and it\u2019s also \u2013 it also indicated that the FDLR commander under that arrangement ordered the shelling of Rwandan territory in May.\nNow, this happens at a time when Rwanda is under pressure that it is allegedly supporting M23.\u00a0 What is your take on that, and how can Rwandans be assured of their security?\nMr. Secretary, now given \u2013 given the fact that FDLR gets support from the Congolese army, how does the U.S. expect Rwanda to protect its borders against any attacks that happen like what happened in May?\u00a0 And also at the same time, you cannot talk about FDLR without talking about the genocide.\u00a0 They are responsible for the genocide.\u00a0 Today, the United States remains the only country in the world that has deliberately refused to adopt the official definition of the genocide, the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.\u00a0 Now, what\u2019s the logic behind this deliberate stubbornness of the U.S. not adopting the genocide?\u00a0 Yet as you said you stand by Rwanda.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0\u00a0Rwanda is not the cause of longstanding instability in eastern DRC, where we have over 130 armed groups, including the M23.\u00a0 And the presence of the FDLR in the close collaboration with the army of the DRC has always been the most significant cause of insecurity.\u00a0 And this enables the FDLR to conduct terrorist operations on Rwandan territory, something the Government of Rwanda cannot accept.\u00a0 In Rwanda we always reserve the right to take necessary measures to protect its territorial integrity, its sovereignty, and to ensure the security of its people.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve said, Rwanda remains committed to the processes mandated by the African Union, and the other regional organization, which we hope the United States will continue to support for all of us to bring lasting peace to eastern DRC and to the entire region.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 There are very credible reports of support for armed groups by all sides, including the FDLR by Congolese forces and M23 by Rwandans.\u00a0 And our position is clear.\u00a0 Whoever it\u2019s by, whoever it\u2019s to \u2013 that support needs to cease for any \u2013 any armed group.\nWhen it comes to the FDLR, it has sought to conduct attacks on Rwanda and it\u2019s supported hateful ideologies.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve seen support, as I said \u2013 we\u2019ve seen reports of cooperation between Congolese forces and the FDLR.\u00a0 I raised this directly with the president in the Congo, and we are pressing again for that support to cease, just as we\u2019re pressing for any support to M23 to cease.\nThese groups need to end the violence, demobilize, and pursue talks with the government.\u00a0 And as I noted, both leaders \u2013 here in Rwanda and in the Congo \u2013 made clear to me that they\u2019re prepared to engage in talks with the various armed factions as necessary in order to pursue their demobilization in the context of the process led by President Kenyatta and others, the Nairobi process.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to support that.\nAnd when it comes to recognition of the genocide and the horrors committed, we\u2019ve been very clear about that.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have an opportunity to visit the memorial in just a few hours and to continuously take note, to take account of the almost unfathomable suffering of so many people that remains present in people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to work at the United Nations for every appropriate recognition of history, even as we do everything possible every single day to make sure that that history is never repeated.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Final question from (inaudible).\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Following up on that same issue, Mr. Secretary, you mentioned your conversations with both the president of Rwanda and of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\u00a0 And in Congo, you heard many complaints about the violence in eastern Congo and the support of Rwanda supposedly for some of the armed groups to the extent that they demanded sanctions be imposed against Rwanda.\u00a0 And yet here, you probably heard a certain amount of popular support for the M\u00a0deux trois\u00a0group.\u00a0 So how do you reconcile those two very disparate positions in your quest for negotiations as you described?\u00a0 Did you specifically ask President Kagame to end the support for M23?\u00a0 And then finally, do you now put the M23 and the FDLR on the same ground?\u00a0 It seems like they\u2019re almost making a \u2013 an equivalency between the two.\u00a0 So I\u2019m interested about that.\nAnd then Mr. Minister, the U.S. Government is asking you to end support for M23.\u00a0 How do you respond to that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So it\u2019s a matter of principle that applies equally.\u00a0 This is not a question of weighing one group against another.\u00a0 There\u2019s a basic principle that there should not be support coming from governments or coming from their entities like their armed forces for arming groups like \u2013 non-state groups like M23 or like FDLR.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a basic principle, because to the extent that that happens, that\u2019s likely to perpetuate conflict and violence, not end it.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t suggest one way or another equivalence between groups or some valuation, but the basic principle is very important and it\u2019s very important here.\u00a0 And yes, I specifically raised that with President Kagame just as I raised it with President Tshisekedi\u00a0in the DRC.\nWe also raised another principle, which is the territorial integrity of states and the need to protect that.\u00a0 And we also raised another principle, which is that leaders have a responsibility to speak out against hate speech \u2013 something that we\u2019ve seen, unfortunately, increasingly in recent months with regard to the Congo, and in particular, directed at certain communities, including Rwandaphones, and directed at the UN and its mission there.\nSo this is something that I raised in both \u2013 both meetings with both leaders.\u00a0 And the question, of course, is now turning principle into practice, and that\u2019s what we talked about.\u00a0 And the best way to do that, in our judgment, is to pursue the African-led mediation efforts through the Nairobi process.\u00a0 President Kenyatta has now been designated by the East African Community to carry on that mission, even when he is no longer in office as president of Kenya.\u00a0 President Louren\u00e7o from Angola is also very engaged.\u00a0 And what we heard from both presidents is their appreciation for our own efforts, the United States efforts to support that African-led mediation effort.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to do that just as we\u2019ve been doing in the months leading up to this visit.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA:\u00a0\u00a0Whatever Government of Rwanda could do in DRC or in our region would be about protecting our people and protecting the territorial integrity of our country and its sovereignty.\u00a0 It is not about supporting M23.\u00a0 And if we want a lasting solution for the problems in eastern DRC, in our region, we just need to deal with the root causes of the problem, which is the presence and the preservation of the FDLR, the FDLR in eastern DRC and their cooperation with FRDC.\u00a0 Let me remind you that they have together, jointly they have shelled the Rwandan territory three times \u2013 on 18th March, on 27 May, on \u2013 and on 10th June.\u00a0 And we have always warned the Government of DRC \u2013 we ask them to stop those attacks.\u00a0 And if we need to get a lasting solution, we should go to the root causes of the problems, which is the genocide they acknowledge being spread in our region from \u2013 the genocide which took place here in 1994 \u2013 and the preservation of the FDLR, which is a genocidal force.\nAnd there are mechanism in place, the original mechanism which were agreed on by the African Union, by the East African Community, by the ICJR, and we just need to go to those mechanism (inaudible) us with them, and you permit them.\u00a0 And we find solutions to the existing political issues in DRC, and hopefully we achieve peace for all of us.\u00a0 Eastern DRC \u2013 DRC needs peace, but we also need peace for us to develop our countries.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you, Minister.\u00a0 Thank you much \u2013 thank you very much, everybody.

Tshilombo suggested to conduct an official visit to DRC, and you accepted the suggestion, the proposal.\u00a0 And on June 2nd of last year, during our meeting in our cabinets, the Department of State in Washington, then after the decision of the chiefs of states, we communicated officially the invitation of the government of my country and to actually accept that visit.\u00a0 And you told us, dear Antony, that you will come to DRC before the end of this year.\u00a0 And given words and taken words (inaudible).\nSo this is evidence of the interests United States has to DRC to willing \u2013 the will of its leaders to develop with our country a cooperation and partnership, strategic partnership, and fruitful for American people and Congolese people.\u00a0 Thank you very much for keeping your words, and thank you very much for this interest, and this will confirm today officially.\u00a0 So we ensure that the chief of state, His Excellency Felix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo are in the same dispositions of mind or of state of mind.\nLadies and gentlemen of the press, it\u2019s based on this, on political will shared, to advance our old friendship that resists to the time and different challenges that we\u2019ve faced throughout history, whatever they have been.\u00a0 And it\u2019s on \u2013\u00a0 it\u2019s based on this and still based on it that have been marked by determination of the United States and of DRC to consolidate their partnership in a period that you actually know which is really, really turbulent.\u00a0 And either in the international level or on the eastern side of the country, always in trouble, facing challenges with terrorists and an armed group that is \u2013 are killing our populations since two decades ago now.\nAnd it\u2019s based on this that we have exchanged and discussed bilaterally with the delegation, the American delegation, conducted by the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and exchanging \u2013 exchanged on common interests, particularly in the following fields:\u00a0 defense and security, focusing on security in the eastern side of the Congo, and military cooperations, finance and economy, precisely regarding the program of reform \u2013 economic reforms and foreign investment of the government, and the exploitation of natural resources industries.\u00a0 We also exchanged on environment, mining, and democracy.\nAnd based on all those materials, we have exchanged our analysis to develop a common understanding.\u00a0 And more importantly, we have underlined new perspectives based on the reciprocal engagements.\u00a0 And the hardest part remains to come, is yet to come.\u00a0 And the main challenge that we are facing is actually on the implementation \u2013 the implementation of these new perspectives and this involvement in order to give real content to \u2013 tangible content to our cooperation or friendship, but also a content \u2013 a profitable content to Congolese and Americans, and that will give legitimacy to democracy and the fate and the well-being that you actually know in Democratic Republic of Congo, the ultimate goal, the outcomes of all political actions.\nAnd on his part, Mr. Secretary of State, DRC will make biggest effort to honor his engagement and involvement, and I say it on the behalf of the chief of government that DRC has not \u2013 doesn\u2019t have any reason, objective reason, to not believe that it will be \u2013 it will be likewise on behalf of Americans\u2019 government.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Dear Minister, dear Christophe, I\u2019m happy to meet with you and to be in Kinshasa, and I would like to thank you and thank your President Tshisekedi for this very deep and productive meeting that we just had about an hour ago.\nIf you may, allow me to continue in English.\nGood afternoon.\u00a0 Good evening, everyone.\u00a0 And just to repeat, it is a real pleasure to be here in Kinshasa.\u00a0 This is my first visit as Secretary of State.\u00a0 And as my friend Christophe said, I\u2019m following up on a very kind invitation from the president and from the foreign minister, and now we\u2019re here and very pleased to be so.\u00a0 I again want to thank the president, the foreign minister, the entire team for the excellent conversations that we had this afternoon.\u00a0 I was able to spend some time just one-on-one with the president.\u00a0 The teams got together, and I think the fact that we have a very strong delegation here and we were able to spend time with our counterparts reflects the strength \u2013 the growing strength of the partnership between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United States.\nThe DRC is central to pursuit of peace and prosperity in Africa and beyond.\u00a0 Your commitment to democracy will shape not only your future but the region\u2019s as well: the fight against corruption and the promotion of transparency, for example in the mining sector, these are critical to regional stability.\u00a0 The Congo\u2019s stewardship of its part of the Congo Basin, the rainforest, one of the largest on Earth, is vital to dealing with the climate crisis.\u00a0 Your response to infectious disease protects people beyond your borders as well as within them.\u00a0 In short, what happens here is felt in many places.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the work that our countries do together is so important.\nToday, we had a chance, as the foreign minister said, to discuss a broad range of issues, to include our efforts \u2013 shared efforts to bring peace to the eastern DRC, our support for free, fair, and on-time elections next year, efforts to promote respect for human rights, to protect the environment, to promote clean energy, to improve the investment climate, to strengthen food security \u2013 all critical steps for the DRC to become the anchor of stability and prosperity that it can become.\u00a0 And in these efforts, the United States is your steadfast partner.\nYesterday in South Africa, I had a chance to speak about what being a partner to countries across Africa actually means to us.\u00a0 And as I said \u2013 but it\u2019s worth repeating \u2013 too often African nations have been treated as instruments of other nations\u2019 progress rather than as authors of their own progress.\u00a0 Resources have been exploited for other countries\u2019 gains.\u00a0 People of the DRC know this all too well.\u00a0 That is not what the United States will do.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want a one-sided transactional relationship.\u00a0 Instead, we want to work with you on shared priorities in pursuit of shared goals.\nOne of those goals is strengthening democracy.\u00a0 And we discussed reforms that reflect the will and aspirations of the Congolese people, including, as I said, preparations for next year\u2019s free, fair, and on-time elections.\nThe DRC was a strong participant in the Summit for Democracy last year.\u00a0 The work that\u2019s already been done here to advance the rule of law, good governance, citizen participation, and human rights is commendable, but there\u2019s more to do and I know that the DRC is committed to going forward.\u00a0 To reduce the allure of joining armed groups, the young people of the DRC must see that there is a true path forward, a better path, a brighter future.\nOn the situation in the eastern DRC, we share a strong desire here \u2013 and that of so many people across the region and beyond \u2013 for the violence and suffering there to end at long last.\u00a0 As we discussed, an enduring peace will require a political solution that respects the DRC\u2019s sovereignty and its territorial integrity.\u00a0 To that end, the United States strongly supports the mediation efforts led by Angola and Kenya, and we urge continued cooperation with the UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO and agree on the importance of its mandate to protect civilians.\u00a0 And we fully endorse the pursuit of dialogue and cooperation between the DRC and its neighbors.\u00a0 I intend to build on our discussions when I visit Rwanda tomorrow.\nOn climate, the Democratic Republic of Congo is vital to the future of the planet.\u00a0 It\u2019s as simple as that.\u00a0 The Congo Basin rainforest absorbs more carbon than is emitted by the entire continent of Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s a place of tremendous biodiversity.\u00a0 Its rainfall helps sustain agriculture across the region.\nWe appreciate the short-term economic challenges confronting the Congo \u2013 the challenges facing countries all over the world, including the United States.\u00a0 We agreed to work together to establish a formal working group to help Congolese achieve a balanced approach to responsible development of the country\u2019s resources that contributes to Congo\u2019s economic growth and to generating jobs.\u00a0 By conserving irreplaceable forests and other ecosystems and by undertaking development projects only after carrying out rigorous environmental impact assessments, the DRC can act on behalf of all the world\u2019s people to protect our shared home.\nWe talked about reforms to the mining sector.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to work together to ensure that investments in the DRC support best practices, that companies are engaged in a race to the top on environmental protections, labor rights, good governance, and transparency, not a race to the bottom that ends up hurting workers, hurting the environment, fueling armed conflict.\nAnd on food security we\u2019re very pleased that the DRC joined the Feed the Future program this summer.\u00a0 This is a flagship program for the United States.\u00a0 And even as we respond to some immediate humanitarian challenges and the crisis that has been created in food insecurity as a result of climate, of COVID, of conflict \u2013 Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine \u2013 we\u2019re also very focused on working in partnership with countries around the world to invest in sustainable, resilient food production for the long term.\u00a0 That\u2019s what Feed the Future is all about, and we\u2019re very pleased that the DRC is a part of that.\nAt a moment when COVID-19, climate change, and conflict are all doing their part, as I said, to intensify food insecurity, it\u2019s more important than ever that we tackle the root causes of hunger, poverty, and malnutrition, and we do it together.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking forward to working closely with the DRC on this in the months ahead.\nThe United States is committed to this partnership.\u00a0 We see tremendous potential for us to do more together to advance stability, opportunity, democracy, health, and security for the people of Congo, our people, people in many other countries and regions whose lives will be shaped in part by your success and by your progress.\nSo that\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to Kinshasa, and why, again, I\u2019m so pleased to be here.\u00a0 And Christophe, thank you very much for your hospitality and for the very good meetings we\u2019ve had so far.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you, Excellencies, for your respective opening remarks and (inaudible) conference of press, and I\u2019ll associate my dear fellow also be conveyed or invited to give (inaudible) interventions, and there will actually be four interventions on the side of media, two from the American side and two others from the Congolese side.\u00a0 And I would then invite my colleague to choose two reporters that are ready for the questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Tracy Wilkinson,\u00a0LA Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, you just mentioned that you will be raising the issue of the violence in eastern Congo tomorrow when you are in Rwanda.\u00a0 Will you be raising allegations that Rwanda is, in fact, backing the militias that have been attacking civilians in Congo?\u00a0 Do you \u2013 does your government concur with the United Nations report that makes those allegations and seems to substantiate them?\nAnd finally, here in Congo there is a public clamor for the United States to do more and help with this issue, to the extent that there are some people who believe that the United States is sort of turning a blind eye to this issue.\u00a0 How do you respond to that?\nAnd Mr. Minister, have you received assurances from the Secretary that he will seriously raise this issue of Rwanda\u2019s support for the militias?\u00a0 And do you have confidence that that\u2019s going to help?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re certainly not turning a blind eye.\u00a0 In fact, I\u2019m here.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to Rwanda tomorrow, and a big focus of this trip \u2013 but not just this trip, the work that we\u2019re doing day in, day out \u2013 is to make sure the United States is doing everything it can to support the very important African-led mediation efforts, particularly processes that are being led by Kenya and Angola, to bring peace, security, and stability to the eastern Congo.\nWe are not only following this very closely and carefully, we\u2019re engaged on it.\u00a0 And I had the opportunity to speak at length to the minister about this a couple months ago in Washington.\u00a0 Of course, it was a focus of my conversation with the president today.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be a focus of the conversation with President Kagame when we\u2019re in Rwanda.\nWe are very concerned by credible reports that Rwanda has provided support to M23.\u00a0 We call on all parties in the region to stop any support or cooperation with M23 or, for that matter, any other non-state armed group.\u00a0 That is essential to actually bringing peace and security to the region.\u00a0 And we urge the groups themselves \u2013 M23, all non-state armed groups operating in the eastern DRC \u2013 to cease violence, to demilitarize, to pursue talks, as necessary, with the government.\nLet me simply add that all countries have to respect their neighbors\u2019 territorial integrity.\u00a0 This is a proposition that we take very seriously around the world.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent some time talking about that when it comes to Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s equally important here.\u00a0 Any entry of foreign forces into the DRC must be done transparently, with the consent of the DRC, de-conflicted from the UN mission, and pre-notified to the Security Council, consistent with the UN resolution.\nSo to circle back to where you were, this is a front and center, part of the reason I\u2019m here, as well as deepening and expanding the broader partnership that we have with the DRC on the issues that the minister and I talked about.\nVICE PRIME MINISTER LUTUNDULA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) (In progress) regarding to what the Secretary of State just said.\u00a0 So I want to \u2013 also to remind you in reality the United States was \u2013 were our first \u2013 the first country to care about the presence and to support of Rwanda to the M23.\u00a0 And remember that the declaration that has been delivered by the representative, diplomatic representative of United States in Kinshasa, and initiated the talk or discussion with the representative of member-states\u2019 ambassadors and the Secretary (inaudible).\u00a0 And the embassy was expressing its \u2013 the appreciation of the United States regarding to this information that we have received.\nSo I followed today the interview of the Secretary of State.\u00a0 I think it was (inaudible) from Johannesburg.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t hide it at all, the way Americans perceive the issue, and he said it himself that it\u2019s thematic, in fact, that will it be discussed, and he\u2019s done well to state it again.\u00a0 He said he would talk about it in bilateral meeting.\u00a0 And as I say, there is no reason not to believe to what the Secretary of State said, and more again because it\u2019s the truth.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Next question, American side.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Edward Wong,\u00a0New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Minister, last year, the \u2013 your government pledged to help protect the rainforest resources here in the DRC, but your call for companies to step forward on \u2013 and bid for up to 30 blocks of rainforest land to do energy extraction from there seems to undermine the pledge from the government.\u00a0 How do you address the criticism of that?\u00a0 And what would you say to the international organizations and donors that stepped forward to support your pledge when it was made?\nAnd Mr. Secretary, the DRC has made the argument that it needs the revenue from this energy to help bring its citizens out of poverty and to get its economic engine going. You mentioned that yourself and acknowledged that.\u00a0 You said that you were forming a working group.\u00a0 Are there any concrete plans or proposals related to trade or economics that you\u2019re putting forward to the DRC to try and stem this auction that they\u2019ve called for?\u00a0 Thank you.\nVICE PRIME MINISTER LUTUNDULA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) So our commitment to protect, as I said, the biodiversity and to ensure \u2013 I want to assure everybody here that we will stay firm regarding to the commitment and we\u2019re not going to settle (inaudible).\u00a0 So the call for the \u2013 I think which is (inaudible) 27 petroleum blocks and gas blocks (inaudible) recissions.\u00a0 So the first one we\u2019re not selling them.\u00a0 There are concessions that will be (inaudible).\u00a0 We\u2019re not selling the public auction ones.\nSo the second is generally we\u2019re protecting the ecosystem for the well-being for mankind.\u00a0 That mean (inaudible) here to eat, to enjoy, to heat \u2013 heat electricity, water, and so forth.\u00a0 So today, DRC finds paradox that\u2019s \u2013 conduct as to \u2013 the DRC is \u2013 is rich, is a wealthy country, but with a very poor population.\u00a0 But the challenge is to find an equilibrium, a balance between the well-being of Congolese people and also the necessity to guarantee the \u2013 a framework, a development framework, an ecological framework (inaudible).\nAnd what we have done is exactly to make sure that the nature in (inaudible) as is wealth in our country to protect it without \u2013 preventing the destructions.\u00a0 But as you know, we know that there are some countries that are exploiting DRC\u2019s riches as for \u2013 since years now and not respecting at all the biodiversity.\u00a0 And so what we are trying to do is not to damage the ecosystem.\u00a0 So they\u2019re in Africa, in Europe, and so on.\nSo what is important for us is that \u2013 it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about.\u00a0 What we talked about with the American delegation is that whoever has the technology, I mean, that we need to do a lot \u2013 to save and secure our ecological system, the ecosystem, are welcome in our country.\u00a0 We\u2019re counting on (inaudible) capacities, technology capacities of countries like United States (inaudible) and so on to actually help us securing nature diversity and biodiversity.\u00a0 This is how we conceive or perceive the issue and certainly did in conditional \u2013 in the standards that we\u2019re going to establish in (inaudible) over \u2013 it won\u2019t be \u2013 it\u2019s enterprises that will come to exploit the resources we not allow them to kill, to destroy the nature.\u00a0 But what we\u2019re doing is to put the nature into the service of the human Congolese people and humanity entire.\nSo this is what I wanted to say, and once more I was satisfied to the same \u2013 the same understanding \u2013 to share the same understanding with the Secretary of State, and then we are also happy that we\u2019re going to work together.\u00a0 And I also seize the opportunity to say that United States and DRC will quickly set a working group on climate change and which going to be our consultation framework where we share a common interest.\u00a0 And that\u2019s also a guarantee, a structure that is going to help us to (inaudible) necessity to see Congolese people profiting from this.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And just to follow up on the minister, President Tshisekedi very eloquently talked about Congo as a solution country when it comes to climate change, when it comes to protecting the environment, conserving and protecting the Congo Basin, the rainforest in particular.\u00a0 DRC is home to vast forests and peatlands, and this is a critical habitat for plants, wildlife, and it\u2019s crucial for us to avoiding climate catastrophe.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a strong track record of leadership on conservation and climate as part of our relationship.\u00a0 Back at COP26, the world made a collective pledge, $1.5 billion, to support the Congo Basin\u2019s forest.\nSo in that context, we had concerns about the announcement of the auction of these oil and gas exploration blocks.\u00a0 Some of the blocks infringe on sensitive rainforest and peatland areas, including in the Virunga National Park and Salonga National Park.\nBut what you just heard from the foreign minister is exactly what the president said to me: a commitment to make sure that DRC is a solution country when it comes to protecting the environment and combating climate change, and in particular to make sure that everything contemplated will proceed \u2013 or not proceed, I should say \u2013 in the absence of full environmental impact assessments and studies and making sure that any development that is done is not done in a way that harms the environment or that undermines the important role that DRC plays in combating climate change.\nBut to that end, as the minister said, as I noted earlier, we agreed today to form a working group on this issue.\u00a0 Because as the minister said, here\u2019s the challenge:\u00a0 The DRC needs additional resources, support, financing in order to do what is necessary to fully protect the rainforest and the peatlands, which are already under tremendous challenge, irrespective of any energy exploration or exploitation.\u00a0 We see deforestation that\u2019s already taking place; we see a challenge to the resources that are already there.\u00a0 And the government wants to be able to act on that.\u00a0 But it needs assistance, it needs help to do that.\nThat\u2019s exactly the commitment that was made by countries around the world at COP26.\u00a0 So what we want to do is now get together and work this very closely together to make sure that on the one hand these resources are being protected and that what\u2019s irreplaceable is not damaged, but at the same time that the necessary support is there for the DRC to do the work that it needs to do to preserve the rainforest, the peatlands, and to create opportunity for its people.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you, Excellencies.\u00a0 And now we are going to submit our (inaudible) question.\u00a0 We\u2019ll begin with Madam Tudieshe of VOA.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Merci.\u00a0 Mr. Blinken, would you prefer me to ask the question in English or in French?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Either way.\u00a0 (inaudible)\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Good morning, Mr. Blinken, (inaudible).\u00a0 Secretary of State, you are visiting for the first time the biggest countries of \u2013 French-speaking countries in Africa, and you\u2019re staying 24 hours.\u00a0 And it seems that you are staying \u2013 you stayed \u2013 you will stay is twice this time, like 24 hours, 48 hours, in Rwanda.\u00a0 So do you understand that the short stay that \u2013 in DRC is not really appreciated as we wished in DRC?\nAnd to you, Mr. Lutundula, you have been a star in social medias in Congo and abroad, and when you are intervene at the Security Council of UN you made last May.\u00a0 And meanwhile, there were this UN report that explained clearly that Rwanda was still behind M23.\u00a0 So we \u2013 our (inaudible) has been established in the (inaudible) regarding the (inaudible) are clear in the rest of the world, and stand and say what\u2019s come of this and been talked about decades ago.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (In French.)\nIn fact, just for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m spending pretty much the same amount of time in the DRC as I am in Rwanda, and we\u2019re here for \u2013 I wish we could be here longer.\u00a0 But we\u2019re here for about 24 hours; we\u2019ll be in Rwanda for about 24 hours.\u00a0 So if we\u2019re comparing schedules, it\u2019s pretty much the same thing.\nBut what is most important is the work that we\u2019ve gotten done today, we\u2019ll continue to get done tomorrow between the United States and the DRC, and both of us have talked about it.\u00a0 There is an extraordinary breadth as well as depth to the work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 It covers numerous issues of concern to the people in both of our countries, the region, and the world.\nAnd while the focus of this trip is eastern Congo and the United States doing what it can to support efforts to mediate and prevent a crisis from erupting, as we both discussed, there was a lot more that we talked about today and that we\u2019re working on together today, including work that we\u2019re doing together to combat climate change, to provide economic opportunity here in the DRC, to deal with the food insecurity crisis, to pursue democratic reforms, and many other things that we talked about.\nSo I would simply invite you to look at everything that the minister set out as part of our agenda today as evidence of the breadth and depth of this partnership and the commitment that we both have to growing it even stronger in the months and years ahead.\nVICE PRIME MINISTER LUTUNDULA:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) (In progress) talked about the (inaudible) so we do not (inaudible).\u00a0 So as you know in this field and in \u2013 as it in other fields, the responsibilities are not claimed (inaudible).\u00a0 They \u2013 we prove them, but we don\u2019t claim them.\u00a0 So to prove them, so there are some trust issues (inaudible) state of (inaudible) that state of (inaudible) is some pillars over construction of Democratic State of Congo, is authority the chief of states (inaudible).\u00a0 And then all that\u2019s can support to establish this enforcement the goal is to identify the other, as we\u2019ve said previously to our neighbor, that whoever is going to be caught with being in a lie over those M23 armed forces will be, and the persons haven\u2019t (inaudible).\u00a0 So the sanction will fall in compliance with what\u2019s (inaudible).\u00a0 The work has to be conducted on the level \u2013 at a level of the ones who have the responsibilities of DRC, the DRC like military \u2013 the army and the justice (inaudible) \u2013 and will have sanctions for them.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I would to invite Mr. Jacques Kini of Univers TV to ask his question.\nQUESTION:\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much.\u00a0 The first question is addressed to Mr. Blinken.\u00a0 Mr. Blinken, (inaudible) yesterday morning in South Africa (inaudible) you\u2019re worrying about a possible advance in the conflict in Rwanda.\u00a0 And of course, the \u2013 because of the war caused by the M23 you tried to reduce, mitigate the conflict.\u00a0 So I want to know how the United States want to make it into a good decision between DRC and Rwanda.\nMy second question is addressed to Vice Prime Minister Mr. Lutundula.\u00a0 (Inaudible) of DRC, as stated, are established, but what are DRC (inaudible) of Rwanda in supporting M23 (inaudible)?\u00a0 Where is DRC regarding United Nations and also to \u2013 regarding all the war materials?\u00a0 And the second question is: Are we going to expect acknowledge from the United States as \u2013 as they stated, the inventory is terrorism problem.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Merci, thank you.\u00a0 As I noted earlier, the big focus of my visit here and then tomorrow\u2019s visit to Rwanda is to support the important medication efforts that are already underway \u2013 African-led \u2013 to try to stop conflict, violence in the eastern DRC.\u00a0 And this is an opportunity for me, of course, to speak directly with the president, with the foreign minister.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have the same opportunity with President Kagame in Rwanda.\u00a0 And our focus right now is on supporting the efforts that are underway, notably by Angola and Kenya, to bring this challenge to an end, to cease violence and demobilize armed group, to pursue talks as well.\nSo I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself any further because I\u2019ll have an opportunity to pursue this as well in conversations with the Rwandan Government over the next 24 hours.\u00a0 But we\u2019re in very regular contact about this.\u00a0 I\u2019m in very regular contact as well with partners in Africa, to include the Kenyans, the Angolans.\u00a0 And our hope is to do whatever we can in support of these mediation efforts to prevent further violence, to end conflict, to preserve the territorial integrity of the DRC as we do it.\nVICE PRIME MINISTER LUTUNDULA:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) (In progress) the report of the experts group proved that the support of Rwanda to M23 and the presence of its military on Congo soil.\u00a0 I think that we have to acknowledge that diplomacy for peace, for cooperations, and friendship between people that President Tshisekedi is conducting since his (inaudible) is moving forward and bearing fruit.\u00a0 It\u2019s obviously the \u2013 it\u2019s obviously the (inaudible) can notice\u00a0 (inaudible) where we have \u2013 is conducted so far by the President Tshisekedi.\nAnd today, the problem that reports \u2013 that we highlight in the report that we want \u2013 need to be examined by the Council of Security.\u00a0 In Congo we have an unfortunate experience.\u00a0 The mapping reports that has been submitted, I think, about 10 years ago now, hasn\u2019t been examined.\u00a0 They were talking about it, and we did not know at last what we\u2019re going to do with it one day.\u00a0 So we\u2019re asking and (inaudible) that the Security Council firstly publish the report as it is integrally and then examine it.\u00a0 And then we have written yesterday to the president of Security Council.\u00a0 The letter has been sent, delivered yesterday.\u00a0 And today, we received the commission\u2019s \u2013 African Commission.\nSo the Government of Republic of Congo under the authority of (inaudible) has started this exam, examination of this report and its contributions.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important \u2013 its contribution by all the (inaudible) bilateral and multilateral in order to remove (inaudible) of greater share that are created deliberately, and find a solution, a sustainable solution.\u00a0 This means that the report is actually the diagnosis that will allow us to find medicines that we need.\nSo of course, it\u2019s a big issue that \u2013 of course, the resolution that have been voted lately didn\u2019t please everybody.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also true that we have technology that we could at least try to manage the issue in order that some kind of weapons that are no longer used.\u00a0 So it\u2019s an \u2013 I can say an improvement, but the real \u2013 the challenge is still real, still effective.\u00a0 So it is that there\u2019s a suspicion on DRC that\u2019s made that the trust \u2013 the convenience, banks, and even (inaudible) that we can legally to (inaudible) and to buy weapons.\u00a0 We do not do it because at level of United States and the Security Council, we are on the blacklists.\u00a0 We are blacklisted and it\u2019s not a small thing.\nSo we can see the (inaudible) of the republic is (inaudible) and we continue to insist to our partners like United States, who is with us all the time, and in order to remove this barriers, in order to be completely clean, in order to allow this to become \u2013 to start building a powerful defense system and also to equip us with instruments, defense equipment through our army.\nSo the folder is still open.\u00a0 The issue is open.\u00a0 So can we expect that the United States acknowledge the M23 as a terrorist group \u2013 is that the question?\u00a0 I hope \u2013 it\u2019s not to me that you need to ask.\u00a0 I cannot respond to that question.\u00a0 But what I know, I can \u2013 I will say it.\u00a0 The first country before the global coalition\u2019s (inaudible) acknowledges at Marrakesh, where we have participated to a session to that organization to which we belong, the United States and \u2013 let me say are the first to acknowledge and tell to the world that there is \u2013 how can I say it \u2013 cancer, I can say cancer test, cancer disease kind of in DRC, on the eastern side of DRC.\nSo I think the United States will really take it in consideration.\u00a0 So this is what I can tell \u2013 I can tell you regarding \u2013 to your questions.\u00a0 So we\u2019re trying to make sure that every \u2013 our partners understand that M23 are not difference to terrorist movement.\u00a0 So still on that point, you can bet on the \u2013 you can watch the conversion of the African Union, I think it was, of 2002.\u00a0 That conference classify M23 as a terrorist group and it\u2019s inside of our country.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what I can say.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) So Excellencies, on the behalf of all the media here present, we thank you for your availability, and good evening to you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-a-jazz-cultural-event/", "title":

We have spent most of the day speaking, and so I don\u2019t really think we need to say more except to confirm that we\u2019ve had extensive and excellent deliberations on a wide range of issues, some of which I\u2019m sure will form the substance of the questions that you wish to pose.\u00a0 We\u2019ve confirmed the good standing of the relationship between South Africa and the United States of America.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very extensive partnership in which we cooperate in a wide range of sectors.\u00a0 We had reports from four commissions that are part of our bilateral strategic structure.\nWe should have this kind of political dialogue on a regular basis, but we\u2019ve had a hiatus for almost eight years.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve agreed that this is going to be a \u2013 an interaction that takes place on a regular basis.\u00a0 I have had many opportunities to hold meetings and discussions with Secretary Blinken, and I\u2019ve always found him open to listening and to sharing perspective on various world affairs.\u00a0 So having said that, I\u2019ll now hand over to him.\nSecretary Blinken, over to you, and then I think we should allow the (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Naledi, thank you very, very much.\u00a0 I may slightly abuse the privilege of having a captive audience in saying\u00a0a few\u00a0things, starting with the fact that it\u2019s just an honor and a pleasure to be with you, to be here in Pretoria.\u00a0\u00a0We have a joint vision, a\u00a0Strategic Dialogue to get together, and I would just underscore there were nearly 50 officials and experts from across the U.S. Government, and that really is a testament to our commitment to the partnership between South Africa and the United States.\u00a0 And I\u2019m also extremely pleased to be joined today by our ambassador-designate to South Africa, Reuben Brigety, who arrived at his new post just in time for this visit and will be presenting his credentials to the president very soon.\nI think for so many Americans \u2013 and I include myself among them \u2013 South Africa holds a special place in our hearts.\u00a0 I was last here in 2013 with President Obama, and I remember still his words about how South Africa and the United States have been bound together throughout our history, how the freedom fighters of our Civil Rights Movement back in the United States inspired those fighting for freedom and equality here in South Africa, and how the movement against Apartheid here in turn inspired a generation of activists in the United States and well beyond.\nAnd I had a chance to reflect on that a little bit yesterday \u2013 those of you who were with us at the Hector Pieterson Museum in Soweto honoring the 12-year-old boy who was killed by police in 1976 during anti-Apartheid protests.\u00a0 His remarkable sister, Antoinette, met us at the museum, and one of the things she talked to me about was how badly her brother wanted an education for himself, for her, for all the children in the community.\u00a0 Hector and others valued something every child everywhere is entitled to.\u00a0 That profound wrong galvanized global action in support of justice and equality \u2013 another demonstration of how what happens in South Africa reverberates well beyond South Africa, indeed around the world.\nAnd still today, as two great constitutional democracies, our countries face the challenge of ensuring that all of our people can participate fully and freely in our political systems and have equal access to justice and economic opportunity.\u00a0 Here too, I think our countries can learn from each other and I hope make progress together.\nToday, South Africa is a leading global voice on global health, the climate crisis, democracy, security, so much else.\u00a0 The South African economy is renowned for its cutting-edge tech sector, for pioneering work in medicine.\u00a0 A very vibrant press is ranked as one of the freest in the world.\u00a0 Cultural contributions are vast.\u00a0 Universities draw students from pretty much everywhere.\u00a0 In short, what happens here and the reason we\u2019re here is because what happens in South Africa really does shape the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so committed to this partnership, because fundamentally we believe that together we can deliver more progress for the people of our two countries and many others across a whole range of issues that matter most to their lives and their futures.\nSo we had the Strategic Dialogue this morning, and I won\u2019t go through it in detail.\u00a0 We talked a little bit about it with all of you present at the start.\u00a0 I think you know that it covers the four areas that President Ramaphosa and President Biden laid out after their conversation earlier this year \u2013 \u00a0\u00a0health, climate, infrastructure, trade \u2013 issues that are critical to the well-being of our countries, to their security, to the strength of our economies, but especially to the well-being of our people.\u00a0 So a number of things came out of this that I know we will put out and summarize in each of these areas, so I won\u2019t belabor that for today.\nBut I think what\u2019s so important is we agreed not only to shared approaches on a number of issues but also to concrete steps that we are going to take to deepen our cooperation.\u00a0 And the foreign minister and I talked about the importance not only of trying to forge a shared perspective, but actually implementing what we say and holding ourselves accountable to the progress that we\u2019ve agreed to make.\nSo I think that\u2019s the most important thing coming out of today.\u00a0 Let me just add quickly that beyond our bilateral relationship, which is what the Strategic Dialogue focused on, our countries are poised to drive progress together across the region and around the world.\u00a0 We talked about a whole range of leading global issues today, including regional security challenges, the future of multilateralism and the United Nations, and global food security.\nWe\u2019ve seen the repercussions of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine which are felt across the planet and especially across Africa in rising food and energy prices.\u00a0 We\u2019ve supported the efforts by the United Nations and Turkey to broker a deal so that Ukraine can start shipping all of the agricultural commodities that had been held back by Russia blocking their export.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to helping as many people as possible suffering from rising food insecurity.\nSince the Russian aggression began, we have provided $5.5 billion in food aid worldwide.\u00a0 A few days ago, our Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced an additional $150 million in humanitarian funding for Africa.\u00a0 But we also want to strengthen the foundation of food security across Africa, to increase local agricultural capacity, local resilience, so that more people have access to affordable, nutritious food over the long term, not just in response to an emergency.\nFinally, a little bit later today I\u2019m going to have an opportunity to speak to our broader approach to Sub-Saharan Africa.\u00a0 For now, let me say this:\u00a0 Across all of the work that we\u2019re doing together, what we seek most of all is a true partnership between the United States and Africa.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want an imbalanced or transactional relationship.\u00a0 And our commitment to a stronger partnership with Africa is not about trying to outdo anyone else.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all heard that narrative, that South Africa and the continent as a whole are the latest playing field in the competition between great powers.\u00a0 That is fundamentally not how we see it.\u00a0 It\u2019s not how we\u2019ll advance our engagement.\nThe truth is South Africa is a powerful, dynamic country helping write the future of the region and the world.\u00a0 We know in the United States by working together in the spirit of a true partnership we can advance a whole host of mutual interests and the collective interest.\u00a0 We can do good for our people, we can do good for our countries, we can do some good for the world.\u00a0 So that\u2019s really what today is about, and that\u2019s what we want this relationship to be about.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Excellencies.\u00a0 We will now take a question from the SABC\u2019s foreign editor, Ms. Sophie Mokoena.\u00a0 There\u2019s a roving microphone in front of you.\u00a0 Please, go ahead, Ms. Mokoena.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, my name is Sophie Mokoena from the South African Broadcasting Corporation.\u00a0 Secretary of State and Minister, you spoke about world affairs.\u00a0 As we speak, the war in Ukraine, South Africa and the U.S. holding to frank views, and then you have a situation in the Middle East, the Gaza conflict.\u00a0 We saw what happened a few days ago.\u00a0 And finally, in Asia, the visit of the Speaker of the U.S. Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan has also caused a major tension between the U.S. and China.\u00a0 What is it that both countries can do in maintenance of peace and prosperity, looking at these three issues?\nAnd finally, the elections in Kenya, your message on the eve of the elections, the biggest economy in East Africa?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Naledi, would you like me to start?\nMINISTER PANDOR:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, please..\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s a lot there.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if I can \u2013 first of all, on the eve of elections, we, and I think everyone in the region and beyond is watching to see that they go forward peacefully, freely, openly, and that\u2019s certainly our expectation.\nLet me try and put this in broader context because in our conversations that we\u2019ve had over many months but also that we had today, there is a fundamental agreement between us.\u00a0 And that is that this is a time of tremendous challenge across a whole host of issues that are affecting our people \u2013 obviously COVID, also climate change, also the impact of new technologies on all of our lives.\u00a0 And the shared desire of the United States and South Africa is to focus our energies, our attention, our resources, our time, to engaging these issues.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I think our people expect, and that\u2019s where \u2013 what we prefer to be doing.\nSo we don\u2019t seek conflict anywhere.\u00a0 We did not want the Russian aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 We tried very hard to \u2013 diplomatically to ward it off because that\u2019s not how we want to be spending our time.\u00a0 And similarly, the reaction now by China with regard to Taiwan and the military actions it\u2019s taken allegedly in response to the peaceful visit of a member of our Congress, that too doesn\u2019t help things.\nNor does the fact that China has said it\u2019s ceasing cooperation with the United States on dealing with climate change.\u00a0 That\u2019s not punishing the United States; that\u2019s punishing the entire \u2013 the entire world and especially the developing world, and notably Africa, because China and the United States are the number one and number two emitters in the world.\u00a0 We have a special responsibility to make sure that we\u2019re leading on dealing with climate change.\u00a0 It\u2019s deeply unfortunate that China has chosen, for now at least, to stop that engagement.\nSo my point is I think there is profound agreement between us that we want to be spending our time focused on the issues that are really having an impact on the lives of our people, and together \u2013 that\u2019s what we did with the Strategic Dialogue today \u2013 we can make a real difference.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also important that when some of the basic principles of the international system, of the international order are being challenged, that we stand up and defend them.\nSo the problem that we have with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine is that it\u2019s not only an aggression against another country, it\u2019s an aggression against the foundational principles of the international system.\u00a0 Multilateralism is something that we both believe in and invest in.\u00a0 The United Nations Charter, which puts at its heart the sovereignty and independence of nations, and it was created in large part to try to \u2013 after two World Wars to make sure that there wasn\u2019t another one.\u00a0 And the basic principles that it established were designed to do that.\nBut if we allow a big country to bully a smaller one, to simply invade it and take its territory, then it\u2019s going to be open season not just in Europe but around the world.\u00a0 It will have repercussions here and repercussions everywhere, which is why we\u2019ve felt it important to stand up for those principles.\u00a0 And we hope to see, as the Ukrainian president has said, this resolved diplomatically over time.\u00a0 But meanwhile, we have to defend the proposition that Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence matter.\u00a0 They matter to Ukrainians, but they also matter to the world.\nOn the Middle East, I\u2019ll just say that we\u2019re pleased to see that there is apparently a ceasefire now, and I want to note the important role that Egypt has played in helping to achieve that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve talked about this a lot over these months and again today.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important that all of the parties also find ways to pursue peace, to pursue a resolution of their differences.\u00a0 It\u2019s been very encouraging to see, for example, Israel and so many countries in the region normalize their relationships.\u00a0 That\u2019s good for peace.\u00a0 That\u2019s good for security.\u00a0 It\u2019s good for the well-being of people.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also not a substitute for resolving the differences between Israel and the Palestinians.\u00a0 And we believe strongly in the need to find a two-state solution that has, for Palestinians and Israelis alike, equal measures of democracy, dignity, and opportunity, and we\u2019ll keep working toward that.\nMINISTER PANDOR:\u00a0 Thanks very much, Tony, and thank you, Sophie.\nFirstly, on the matter of Russia and Ukraine, there is no one in South Africa who supports war.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made that very clear.\u00a0 And we have said that we wish to see intensified efforts at increased diplomacy utilizing the good offices of the United Nations, particularly the secretary-general and other leaders who may be of weight in terms of persuading the interlocutors to come around a table and negotiate a settlement of this awful conflict.\nThis is the position of South Africa.\u00a0\u00a0 We support a search for peace.\u00a0 We are appalled by war.\u00a0 We abhor war because it brings untold suffering, which is something we experienced under Apartheid.\u00a0 So this is the position that we have.\nWith respect to the role that multilateral bodies such as the United Nations should play, we believe that all principles that are germane to the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law must be upheld for all countries, not just some.\u00a0 Just as much as the people of Ukraine deserve their territory and freedom, the people of Palestine deserve their territory and freedom.\u00a0 And we should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine.\nWe\u2019ve not seen an even-handed approach in the utilization of the prescripts of international law, and we encourage that the world should have greater attention to ensuring that we are equal to everybody else.\u00a0 This has been a concern, and this is what at times leads to cynicism about international bodies and a lack of belief in their ability to protect the weakest and most marginalized.\u00a0 We have to change that belief and cynicism and ensure that all international institutions treat all human beings in a fashion that shows them\u00a0\u2013 whether we are ICC, ICJ, UN Security Council, G20, EU, whoever we are \u2013 we will protect those interests.\nAlso, on Taiwan, clearly as South Africa we have very clear separation between the executive and the legislature.\u00a0 And recently, the speaker of the national assembly was invited to be part of a group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a group of speakers who were a delegation that would visit Ukraine.\u00a0 I could not say to the speaker, \u201cSpeaker, don\u2019t go there, don\u2019t go there.\u201d\u00a0 It is parliament\u2019s decision as to what they do.\u00a0 This is what separation of power means.\u00a0 So I think for us, decisions by presiding officers, whether we agree with them or not, as the executive they would have to live with our decisions, we have to live with their decisions and repair any breaches in relations that they may cause.\u00a0 That\u2019s our duty to do that.\nOf course, we welcome the ceasefire in Palestine.\u00a0 However, we do express concern that many civilians have been killed, infrastructure that provides services to ordinary civilians has been destroyed, the people of Palestine are living in buildings that are shells.\u00a0 And this worries us, having experienced Apartheid ourselves and living in corridors.\u00a0 So we do think there\u2019s world for the work\u00a0\u2013 work for the world to do insuring that we create peace in the territory of Palestine and have a two-state solution where you have two nations existing in peace side by side.\nWe also think we\u2019re not satisfied that there\u2019s been an independent investigation of the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh, and we still call for a full, independent investigation and a full report on who actually shot her, because you can\u2019t say bullets shot a person.\u00a0 It\u2019s an individual who wields the gun, and we need to get to the truth of that.\u00a0 This is what will show that we are truly committed to being honest and even-handed toward all people, and in particular toward media practitioners, who must be given the security to practice their craft.\nOn the elections in Kenya, we\u2019ve been very pleased that thus far the campaign up to its end yesterday seemed to have been largely peaceful.\u00a0 We hope that the election which occurs on our Women\u2019s Day in South Africa, that it will result in a stable, free, and fair election.\u00a0 We wish the people of Kenya well in this process.\u00a0 We recall the last election, and we are hoping that tomorrow everyone will be able to exercise their democratic right to vote in a condition of peace and security.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Missy Ryan from\u00a0Washington Post.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 First for you\u00a0\u2013 oh, sorry.\nFirst for you, Minister Pandor, the U.S. Government has been adamant, as Secretary Blinken just reinforced, that it is not asking African nations to choose between Russia and China and the West.\u00a0 At the same time, the United States clearly is hoping to marshal support at the UN and elsewhere for its isolation of Russia along with American allies.\u00a0 You made reference in a recent article to the failure on the part of some to appreciate the principles of sovereignty and freedom of choice that African nations must consider in this regard.\u00a0 Do you think that the United States and its European allies sufficiently appreciate the complex interests of African nations in this arena, and did you discuss that today with Secretary Blinken?\nAnd then, Secretary Blinken, for you:\u00a0 One thing we noticed during Foreign Minister Lavrov\u2019s recent African visit was his promotion of Russia\u2019s model of arms sales with few strings attached, and the fact that Russia typically refrains from criticizing African nations on human rights.\u00a0 I know you\u2019ve talked about an affirmative American vision for the continent, but how do you see that competing with the appeal that easy access to arms or state-backed loans from China might have to some leaders in Africa?\u00a0 And just really quickly, how would you respond to the minister\u2019s statement she just made about inconsistency on the part of some global actors in regard to principles the U.S. is advocating for in the Ukraine conflict, which seemed to be an allusion to the U.S. position in the conflict in the Middle East?\u00a0 Thanks.\nMINISTER PANDOR:\u00a0\u00a0Well, let me start this time.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad that Secretary Blinken has confirmed that America is not asking us to choose.\u00a0 I don\u2019t recall any attempt by the United States to do that.\u00a0 But in terms of our interaction with some of our partners in Europe and elsewhere, there has been a sense of patronizing bullying toward \u201cyou choose this or else,\u201d and the recent legislation passed in the United States of America by the House of Representatives we found a most unfortunate bill that we had hoped the media would say more about.\u00a0 Because when we believe in freedom \u2013 as I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s freedom for everybody \u2013 you can\u2019t say because Africa is doing this, you will then be punished by the United States.\u00a0 So that\u2019s been a disappointing passage of legislation by one house, and we hope the other house will not agree to such offensive legislation.\nSo indeed, it is important that all of us accept our ability to hold different opinions.\u00a0 We are, after all, sovereign nations that are regarded as equal in terms of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 We may differ in terms of economic power and economic ability to influence development in different parts of the world, but what will make the world work is if we respect each other.\u00a0 This is very, very important.\u00a0 And one thing I definitely dislike is being told \u201ceither you choose this or else.\u201d\u00a0 When a minster speaks to me like that, which Secretary Blinken has never done but some have, I definitely will not be bullied in that way, nor would I expect any other African country worth its salt to agree to be treated.\nOn Russia, I\u2019ve tried so many times to explain to so many people, Russia is a very negligible economic partner for South Africa.\u00a0 Our trade with Russia is less than $4 billion annually compared to the $20 billion that I referred to earlier with respect to the United States.\u00a0 So this fear that we exist under some push is, I think, a totally \u2013 a really unfounded belief in the relationship that we have with either country.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been quite clear in saying we really advocate peace because we knew what would happen.\u00a0 We knew there\u2019d be destruction, there\u2019d be death, there\u2019d be desolation.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re all seeing.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve always asked is: where is this going to end?\u00a0 Let us make every effort to get peace.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I think the most important point I would want to emphasize is what Neladi just touched on and also what you noted in your question, which is, first, as we\u2019re here in South Africa \u2013 we\u2019ll be going on to the DRC and Rwanda; I\u2019ve spent time in Nigeria, Kenya, other places \u2013 and again, the purpose of our engagement, which I\u2019ll talk about at some length a little bit later this afternoon in laying out our broader approach to Africa, is about Africa, is about the relationship between us, is about what we can do together as partners to the benefit of our own people and I think to the benefit of people around the world.\nBy 2050, one in four people on this planet will be African.\u00a0 Over the next couple of years, half the population of this continent will be 25 years old or younger.\u00a0 So this is the future, quite literally.\u00a0 And what we\u2019re investing in is that future.\u00a0 And this gets to the point that when it comes to other countries that may be engaged here, our purpose is not to say you have to choose; it\u2019s to, in effect, offer a choice.\u00a0 And the choice that we offer \u2013 at least that we hope and expect to offer \u2013 is an affirmative one, a positive one, where we hope together to engage in a race to the top, not a race to the bottom, whether it\u2019s infrastructure, whether it\u2019s health, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s security.\nAnd on security, I think what we\u2019re seeing Russia mostly export to the most challenged places on the continent is its proxy, the Wagner Group, which is resulting in increased death and destruction in far too many countries.\u00a0 But part of the reason that the Wagner Group has some traction is that in the absence of an alternative to building security, countries may sign on and sign up.\u00a0 So this comes to offering an alternative.\u00a0 Congress passed and we\u2019re implementing something called the Global Fragility Act, which allows us to focus resources in a sustained way and in a comprehensive way in helping countries, mostly in Africa, address challenges in a way that does not lead to violence, to insecurity, to terrorism; that tries to get ahead of the problem.\nAnd our perspective on security is, yes, there is obviously an important part for the hard security element of this, including arms sales with principles that we attach to it.\u00a0 But that is, while necessary, totally insufficient.\u00a0 And what we really need and what we\u2019re focused on is a much more holistic approach that gets at some of the root causes that lead to state failure, that lead to people having deep frustration and seeing no hope for the future, and changing that trajectory.\u00a0 So that\u2019s our focus.\u00a0 I\u2019ll speak a little bit more about it in just a little while.\nIn terms of inconsistency, sure, I think it\u2019s \u2013 we have these conversations, and we like to think that we\u2019re engaged consistently on every issue.\u00a0 But we all have our shortcomings, and we can probably look back at a number of things that suggest that we\u2019re applying principles in one place in one way but not the same way in another.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a really important conversation to have, and I learned a tremendous amount from my friend and colleague in having these conversations.\nBut in the case here, whether it\u2019s Ukraine and the aggression by Russia, whether it\u2019s Taiwan and China, or whether it\u2019s the Middle East, we are working to uphold some of these basic principles.\u00a0 We may have different ways we think it most effective to do it in a given case.\u00a0 But again, in the case of the Middle East, we both believe strongly in a two-state solution; we both believe strongly in the need for Israelis and Palestinians to live with equal measures of democracy, of opportunity, of dignity; we both believe strongly that diplomacy is the most important tool that we can bring to bear on any problem, any challenge.\nNow, within that there may be different tactical approaches.\u00a0 There may be concerns that we\u2019re spending too much time on one thing and not enough on another, and that\u2019s exactly what we talk about.\u00a0 And one of the great strengths of the relationship that we have is we talk about things and lay out our differences in how we approach problems.\u00a0 And what I find is I learn a tremendous amount from each one of these conversations.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Right, last but one question, Ziyanda Ngcobo, Newsroom Africa.\u00a0 There\u2019s the microphone behind you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Ziyanda Ngcobo from Newsroom Africa.\u00a0 Quite important that Minister Pandor mentioned the Section 232 tariffs which I think would speak to the implementation part of the two countries\u2019 cooperation.\u00a0 Was there any discussion, then, on the removal of these \u2013 the Section 232 tariffs on aluminium and steel inputs?\u00a0 How soon would that happen as well, and at what percentage?\nAnd then with regards to Rwanda and the DRC, Secretary Blinken, you\u2019ll be heading there next, but of course, you\u2019ll know about that report which basically said that there\u2019s hard proof that Rwanda is funding the M23 rebels in the eastern part of DRC.\u00a0 So what will your approach be as you\u2019ll also be visiting both these countries?\u00a0 As you prepare for that visit, what kind of stance will you be taking going in?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t want to put words in my colleague\u2019s mouth.\u00a0 I think I can safely say that, yes, this question of the tariffs was raised, but I\u2019ll let the minister address that.\u00a0 And similarly, my colleagues back home in the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office are looking at this as we speak, and \u2013 but I\u2019ll defer to them about that process.\nI also don\u2019t want to get ahead of the visit to the DRC and to Rwanda except to say that I think there are deep concerns about the violence that we\u2019ve seen, about the potential for that getting worse and spreading in eastern Congo.\u00a0 And there is a shared determination to see if, through our own diplomacy in coordination with other partners, we can help reduce the tension, reduce the violence and help put these countries on a path to both resolving their differences, but also looking at what steps can be taken to actually address the well-being of the people who live particularly in eastern Congo, and to make sure that we\u2019re focused on that.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll have a lot more to say about this in the next couple of days.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Edward Wong,\u00a0New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hello.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, our understanding is that the Blinken administration\u2019s approach to Africa and its Africa strategy is predicated on democracy promotion and a promotion of open society as the underpinning for its priorities here.\u00a0 There\u2019s been a history of many American projects that are done under the name of democracy promotion ending poorly or with disastrous outcomes, whether it\u2019s during the Cold War or more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u00a0 How will that approach be different here in Africa and lead to different outcomes?\u00a0 And why is the approach seemingly different in a place like the Middle East, where you don\u2019t have the same demands of partners like the UAE or Saudi Arabia compared to your approach in Africa?\nAnd for Minister Pandor, do you think that this emphasis on democracy will be well received across all of Africa given the different political systems and traditions here on the continent, or do you think there will be some pushback against this?\u00a0 And in the case of what Secretary Blinken views as America\u2019s main challenger, which is China, that country doesn\u2019t make these kinds of demands of political assistance or governance in its diplomatic relations, so do you think that will give China an advantage in some areas in its dealings in Africa?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, Ed, very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m tempted to say stay tuned because we\u2019ll talk about this in a couple of hours, I think at the minister\u2019s alma mater, which I\u2019m really looking forward to.\u00a0 And this \u2013 the question you raised is part and parcel of what I\u2019ll be talking about, but maybe for now just a couple of things.\nFirst, this is not our demand, insistence, whatever you want to call it, for democracy.\u00a0 It\u2019s a reflection of what people in Africa want and are looking for.\u00a0 And that\u2019s clear in poll after poll.\u00a0 They want openness.\u00a0 They want the ability of \u2013 on an individual basis, of communities, and countries for that matter, to choose their own path.\u00a0 And that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\nBut fundamentally, our proposition is that as a democracy \u2013 and we happen to be two of the leading constitutional democracies \u2013 or countries that aspire to strengthen their democracies, or for that matter countries that may be falling back from democracy, the challenge is, as we\u2019ve said and President Biden has talked about a lot, the need to demonstrate in very concrete ways that democracies actually deliver for their people.\u00a0 That\u2019s what our focus is.\nAnd so as we\u2019re focused between us in this Strategic Dialogue on these core issues that go to the heart of what people are looking for now, similarly in Africa writ large you\u2019ll see a focus on similar issues and an effort to demonstrate that in partnership we can actually make a difference in the lives of our citizens.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the approach is about.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the strategy is about.\u00a0 And we happen to believe that in order to do that effectively, in order to do it equitably, that democracy is the best system for doing that.\u00a0 But it has to continuously prove itself, and that\u2019s a lot of what we\u2019ll be talking about this afternoon.\nSo let me leave it there for now and just ask you to stay tuned, and we\u2019ll come back to it in a few hours.\nMINISTER PANDOR:\u00a0 Thank you very much for the question.\u00a0 I think that when you approach a strategy you need to think very carefully about the kinds of tactics that you would utilize.\u00a0 So your overall strategic intention might be to advocate for democracy and support its presence on the African continent.\u00a0 However, if your tactic is to approach African countries and say that, listen, you must be democratic either and use our model, it works, I think it\u2019s bound to lead to some failure.\nI do agree with Tony that all countries and peoples deserve the right to exercise their civil and political rights, but I think given history the approach has to be somewhat different.\u00a0 And I would recommend a greater attention to tools that Africans have developed, such as the African Peer Review Mechanism, as a way into broader discussions about governance and democracy, rather than we will \u2013 there are 44 African countries that have now agreed to be transparent and evaluated under the African Peer Review Mechanism principles of democracy and good governance.\u00a0 It\u2019s extremely important too \u2013 we\u2019ve already had over 40 such evaluations.\u00a0 Let\u2019s discuss the outcomes of those reviews with each of the African countries and look at areas where it was found there are gaps that must be addressed, and look at how we work together.\nAnd in that way, you build a platform toward the objective you eventually seek to achieve.\u00a0 But to come in and seek to teach a country that we know how democracy functions and we\u2019ve come to tell you, you do it, it\u2019ll work for you \u2013 I think it leads to defeat, so we need to think in different ways.\nI also think that one of the lessons we also need to learn and perhaps draw lessons from \u2013 one of the experiences we should draw lessons from is the reality that there has been a lot of external interference in Africa.\u00a0 And a lot of that external interference has fueled conflict in many African countries, has fueled instability and supported opposition groups against liberation fighters and so on.\u00a0 You know the history perhaps better than myself.\u00a0 This is a reality.\nSo in my view, while there may be concern about Wagner Group or Van Dyck, which is another security group which was in Mozambique, there\u2019s also a concern about countries that have mineral interests in African countries and are there as a destabilizing force.\u00a0 So I think we need to look at the full plethora of problems that give rise to insecurity, bad governance, and the absence of democracy on the African continent.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a one country problem.\u00a0 It\u2019s a world phenomenon which is \u2013 results from Africa\u2019s rich mineral wealth that has made it a significant target of external players that don\u2019t always have the interests of Africa at heart.\nThen countries are free to establish relationships with different countries.\u00a0 African countries that wish to relate to China, let them do so, whatever the particular form of relationships would be.\u00a0 We can\u2019t be made party to conflict between China and the United States of America, and I may say it does cause instability for all of us because it affects the global economic system.\u00a0 We really hope that the United States and China will arrive a point of rapprochement where all of us can look to economic development and growth for all our countries because that\u2019s extremely important for all of us.\u00a0 And these are two great powers, the two biggest economies in the world.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got to find a way of working together to allow us to grow.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Your Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you everyone.\n\n"}, {"url":

We didn\u2019t really want to come here because we were enjoying our discussion so much, but we took pity on you and decided that we should come out. So allow me to begin.\nSecretary of State Mr. Antony Blinken; Ms. Heather Merritt, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria; Ambassador-Designate Ruben Brigety II; Excellencies; Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Ambassador Molly Phee; Assistant Secretary of Global Health Affairs and Department of Health and Human \u2013 Assistant Secretary for Global Affairs Ms. Pace; Ambassador Nkengasong \u2013 where are you? You\u2019re a \u2013 you\u2019ve deserted us. I don\u2019t want to call you a traitor but \u2013 Ambassador Nkengasong, U.S. global AIDS coordinator and head of PEPFAR; National Security Council \u2013 National Senior Director for Africa Mr. Devermont; Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Mr. Fernandez; senior officials of both the governments of South Africa and of the United States of America; ladies and gentlemen \u2013 and Secretary Blinken, you don\u2019t have to repeat all of this. I\u2019m doing it for both of us.\nI\u2019m really pleased, Secretary, to welcome you and your delegation to our beautiful country and to the department of international relations and cooperation. You\u2019ll remember that in our many conversations, we\u2019ve discussed a possible visit by you several times, and I\u2019m very happy that we\u2019ve achieved our agreed objective.\nI also wish to welcome Ambassador-Designate Reuben Brigety II. I am glad, Ambassador, that you\u2019re able to observe this meeting and visit. I hope our deliberations today will set the tone for your tenure in South Africa, and I wish you a productive and enjoyable term as U.S. ambassador to South Africa. It will be enjoyable as long as you don\u2019t tweet about me. I hope you will contribute to strengthening the already strong links between South Africa and the United States of America.\nMr. Secretary, the United States is one of South Africa\u2019s most valued partners. I appreciate the commitment you have shown to expanding our bilateral relations. The bonds that were forged between the United States and South Africa during our struggle for democracy and racial justice in our country are enduring bonds and created a firm foundation for advancing people-to-people cooperation between the two countries, including in the spheres of education, cultural, and tourism exchanges.\nWe\u2019ve established many positive initiatives since our freedom in 1994. Our areas of cooperation include trade and investment, technology transfer, education, health, environment, safety and security, institution building, and many other areas. Our country continues to be confronted by deep challenges linked to our Apartheid history and its legacy. They center on three main elements: inequality, poverty, and unemployment. These are challenges we have to address to avoid social strife.\nThrough the generous support of the Government of the United States of America and its people, we\u2019ve been able to make progress in addressing many of the socioeconomic challenges faced by the majority in our country, be this in providing access to equal and quality education, decent housing, or basic health services to the most vulnerable in our society. We have seen support. Our bilateral cooperation is broad and deep and aligned to South Africa\u2019s national priorities. We are determined as a nation and working hard to set our economy on a new trajectory of growth and development to satisfy our people\u2019s desire for a better life.\nI\u2019m especially pleased at our scientific cooperation at the Square Kilometre Array site in Carnarvon, in the Northern Cape, where the United States has a very important HERA astronomy research initiative.\nWhat stands out in particular in our journey was the timely and significant support given to South Africa and the region to address the original pandemic of HIV/AIDS through the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. This has indeed been a gamechanger, as it set the marker for the way we bilaterally as government and civil society came together to turn around the devastating impact of the HIV/AIDS scourge, which threatened to derail our development progress and set us back many decades. For me, our cooperation in HIV vaccine development stands out as our most significant medical sciences research initiative, with Professor Glenda Gray and Professor Shisana achieving outstanding results in collaboration with American research partners.\nIt\u2019s clear, Mr. Secretary, that the United States Government makes a significant contribution to our own development efforts, as set out in our national development plan. These do assist us to address the triple challenges I referred to. South Africa is the largest United States trade partner in Africa. The significant presence of United States companies operating within our borders, including historic long-term investors such as General Electric and Ford to name just two, has helped to upskill our young people, create jobs, livelihoods, and has made the United States private sector a key partner in supporting South Africa\u2019s socioeconomic growth.\nMore recently, the tremendous support shown by United States companies for President Ramaphosa\u2019s investment drive has demonstrated our belief that the United States still has a future in our country, and an interest in our future and the value proposition that we offer as a key investment destination and trade partner. This is even in the context of the setback of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI\u2019m really pleased to welcome the growth in two-way trade in goods, which has gone from 13.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2010 to 21 billion U.S. dollars in 2021. In 2021 the United States ranked as the second-largest destination for South Africa\u2019s exports globally. South African firms have also become significant foreign investors. Investments from South Africa into the U.S. are also on the increase, with the U.S. accounting for 17.4 percent of total South African outward FDI to the world.\nBut we believe there\u2019s much more we can and should do. As we discussed in our meeting of the 12th Annual Bilateral Forum this year, our objective should be to significantly expand two-way trade and investment, which will contribute to shared growth and prosperity of our people. A good start in this vein would be to speedily resolve the longstanding unresolved trade issues around market access, including the removal of Section 232 tariffs on South African steel and aluminium imports into the United States. We\u2019ve discussed this on the phone previously.\nSouth Africa is proud to count on the U.S. Government and its private sector as partners in our efforts directed at post-pandemic economic recovery. Our president and his economic team have been hard at work making it easier for foreign investors to invest in our country and to advance our trade and investment relations for mutual benefit. The support we received and continue to receive from the U.S. to combat COVID-19 and its effect, as well as America\u2019s support for the WTO TRIPS waiver deliberations which have enabled South Africa and Africa to begin production of vaccines locally, is a tangible demonstration of the international solidarity we all need to overcome the global challenges of our time. I would like, through you, to thank President Biden for understanding this imperative and for his efforts to make Africa an equal partner in the global community\u2019s plans to address the most pressing challenge of our time.\nSecretary Blinken, as I\u2019m sure you will say, our world is going through an extraordinarily difficult period. Many countries are having to contend with high costs for fuel, food, and transport, all of which are basic necessities. The current global economic environment, which is marked by rising inequality, by conflict, unequal technological advances, environmental degradation due to climate change, all have huge implications for food security and agricultural systems, particularly here in Africa where the pandemic has reversed the gains that have been made under the African Union socioeconomic development blueprint, Agenda 2063.\nThe present moment, which has given rise to widespread uncertainty and fear, requires us all as leaders to come together and chart a way forward that will give hope and inspiration to our respective peoples. We must ensure that the undertakings we make at the United Nations, the G7, and the G20, which include addressing food insecurity, global health, peace and security, sustainable and just energy transition, as well as human security, that all of these are meaningfully addressed. We must also reinforce our common commitment to multilateralism, democracy, and human rights, and use the proven tools of diplomacy, peacebuilding, dialogue, and mediation to resolve conflict and end the intolerable and unnecessary human suffering which results from wars and other forms of conflict.\nWorking together, we must identify a path to greater prosperity and human-centered development, which would improve local communities\u2019 self-reliance, social justice, and inclusive decision making. We are keen to play a role in such an endeavor. This is informed by our own foreign policy principles, which are based on our value of ubuntu: I am, because you are.\nI believe, Mr. Secretary, that our strategic partnership, which is based on common values and aspirations, is the foundation for our strengthening of bilateral relations between our two countries. Our gathering here for this Strategic Dialogue after a quiet period of almost seven years, as well as the arrival of Ambassador Brigety, presents an opportunity for us to reinvigorate our relations on the various fronts I have referred to. I believe we should place economic recovery for Africa at the front and center of our agenda. The implementation of the African Continental Free Trade agreement and the convening of the AGOA Forum in South Africa next year present both our governments, our private sectors, and civil society with numerous opportunities to advance our trade and investment relations.\nWe really hope that on our path to economic recovery we will ensure that both South Africa and the United States of America do not leave behind women, youth, and the disabled. I\u2019m really thrilled by the continued support that President Biden has given to the Mandela Washington Fellowship through the Young African Leaders Initiative, and the good work that is being done by the United States-South Africa Higher Education Network, as well as support for our technical/vocational education and training institutions, which have formed exciting partnerships with community colleges in the United States. I also acknowledge support for training and capacity building for our law enforcement, defense, and security agencies, including in the important fight against wildlife trafficking.\nI would like to conclude by conveying my sincere thanks and appreciation to your embassy in Pretoria under the able leadership of both Mr. Todd Haskell and Ms. Heather Merritt, who\u2019ve worked very hard to support our efforts against COVID-19 and to ensure that we remain focused on our common goal to maintain and strengthen bilateral cooperation, even during such a challenging period. I\u2019m looking forward to our discussion with our officials and our discussion later at lunch today. I believe that it is only through open and frank dialogue, through \u2013 on matters on which we do not share similar views that we could perhaps begin to understand each other\u2019s positions, dispel misunderstandings, enhance our trust, and find solutions that will benefit both our countries and peoples.\nI think I\u2019m correct if I share with our colleagues that we have had very frank discussions where at times we don\u2019t agree, but it\u2019s not broken this friendship. In fact, it\u2019s made it stronger. We look forward to participating in the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, which will be hosted by President Biden in December. And I also look forward to your talk this afternoon on the revised Africa strategy, and really wish to thank you for choosing our country to make this very important statement.\nMr. Secretary, once more, welcome to my country. Your visit is far too short for my liking, but I\u2019m certain that it will be productive, and I look forward to seeing you again in our beautiful country in the future. Thank you very much, and I now invite you, Secretary Blinken, to make your opening remarks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good morning, everyone. And Foreign Minister Pandor, Naledi, thank you. Thank you for your remarkable hospitality, for the warmth of the greeting we\u2019ve received, and yes, especially for the dialogue that we\u2019ve had for many, many months on so many different issues, and we\u2019re profoundly joined and connected in, I think, a basic outlook as two great constitutional democracies with a shared set of values. But to your point, we bring different perspectives on some issues, and I have to tell you, as a result of our many conversations, you\u2019ve helped me rethink things and look at things in a different light. And I\u2019m really grateful for that and, and it\u2019s an ongoing conversation.\nI think the fact that so many American policymakers have traveled to take part in this Strategic Dialogue \u2013 from the White House, from the State Department, from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, from the Department of Health and Human Services, from bureaus in our departments dealing with economic growth, global health, policy planning. That, in and of itself, is a signal, evidence of the importance that we attach to the relationship with South Africa and the importance that South Africa has in our work at home and also around the world, and how committed we are to making the ties between us even stronger.\nOn one level, it\u2019s simple. Given your economic heft, your leading global voice, your membership in the G20, your influence among the G-77 countries \u2013 and the critical role that South Africa plays on global health, on climate, on democracy, regional security, and so much else \u2013 what South Africa says, what South Africa does has powerful global implications.\nAnd that makes this Strategic Dialogue a vital forum, marking a serious commitment by both of our governments to this bilateral relationship and to the work we\u2019re doing together not only between us, but regionally and globally. And as we\u2019re going to get briefed in a moment on some of the work of the Strategic Dialogue, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the breadth and depth of the topics covered here today reflect the scope of our shared priorities. You said it very well and powerfully; we\u2019re dealing \u2013 both of us \u2013 with an incredibly challenging time. The world faces threats from disease, from climate change, from food insecurity, from violence. What we can achieve together as two leading democracies I think is even more urgent, and that\u2019s also why so many colleagues are here and so invested in this process.\nSo I\u2019m very much looking forward to hearing from our teams about, particularly, the focus areas set out by Presidents Ramaphosa and Biden when they spoke a few months ago: health, climate, trade and investment, infrastructure. These are critical areas of both of our countries, and our teams have done important work in advancing our work in each of these areas.\nLet me just say very quickly, even before we hear from them, I think on health we have reaffirmed the longstanding partnership through the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. I have to say this is something, as an American, I am proudest of over the last 25 or 30 years. It\u2019s hard to think of a more significant initiative that has saved more lives, changed more lives than PEPFAR: 21 million lives saved over nearly 20 years. And we continue to work toward epidemic control of HIV and TB and an AIDS-free generation.\nOur work on HIV/AIDS and TB has given us a strong foundation to collaborate effectively on COVID-19 and other emerging health threats. So we\u2019ll keep working together \u2013 including under the COVID-19 Global Action Plan \u2013 on this pandemic, but critically, and as you said, to try to strengthen global health security going forward and more broadly, because even as we get through this pandemic we know that there will be others lurking, and if we don\u2019t learn the lessons and act on the lessons from this pandemic and create a stronger global health system, then, really, bad on us. So we\u2019re both committed to doing that together.\nAnd I especially want to thank South Africa and its world-class scientists for your role in identifying the Omicron variant and immediately, immediately alerting the world. It\u2019s no wonder that you\u2019re becoming a hub of vaccine development to help Africa generate its own production and to help the world prepare, as necessary, for the next pandemic.\nOn climate and energy, very much look forward to hearing the details of how today\u2019s discussion advanced our robust joint efforts. Energy access and production are critical to South Africa\u2019s future \u2013 while at the same time, both our nations have been affected by the ravages of the climate crisis. We\u2019re feeling it, you\u2019re feeling it, every single day. And part of the challenge over many years in dealing with climate is it always seemed to be: well, yes, it\u2019s a problem but it\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s problem. No longer the case \u2013 it\u2019s today\u2019s problem. And I think we all feel the fierce urgency of now when it comes to dealing with climate. We see that just in the recent floods in Durban and in Kentucky.\nSo we know that to preserve our planet and protect our citizens, we have to find a way to an energy transition that allows us to meet those goals while supporting those who have been most affected by the climate crisis. The United States and other partners are committed to a Just Energy Transition Partnership with public-private investments in renewable energy and in supporting South Africa\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy.\nInfrastructure: South Africa is so well-positioned to lead development of transportation and digital infrastructure throughout the region. We\u2019re looking for ways that the G7\u2019s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, announced by the G7 leaders at President Biden\u2019s initiative just a couple of months ago, can support these goals through access to financing, project preparation, and facilitating partnerships with the private sector.\nAnd on trade, Naledi, as you\u2019ve said, we have a vital economic relationship. And it is very encouraging that even with COVID, trade and investment between South Africa and the United States reached, as you said, a record $21 billion last year. But we know that we can make something good even better. As South Africa\u2019s second-largest trade partner, we\u2019re committed to continuing this robust, dynamic, and mutually beneficial partnership.\nToday was not the culmination of our partnership, but I think the start of a new chapter. President Biden is very much looking forward to welcoming President Ramaphosa to Washington next month. And in December, we\u2019re incredibly excited to be hosting the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, picking up something that President Obama started, and we welcome South Africa\u2019s input on making that summit a success.\nWe have between us a long history of cooperation, from regional peace and security to promoting democracy and global health, to shaping our technological and economic futures. And our shared values and interests extend beyond our two governments. They\u2019re woven through the fabric of our societies through partnerships between our private sectors, exchanges between our cultural and educational institutions, and especially, ties of friendship and family among our people, especially our young people.\nSo to conclude and say simply as we hear from our colleagues, my team and I very much look forward to continuing to work closely with you to overcome the challenges that we both have to face, to engage frankly and meaningfully on issues where our views might differ, and to chart a course toward a promising future that will benefit the people of both South Africa and the United States, and I think beyond.\nSo thank you again for today, thank you for the (inaudible), and thank you for the invitation to come back. We\u2019re going to take you up on that. Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-to-the-press-3/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

We\u2019re not fated to any particular (inaudible).\u00a0 We can make change.\u00a0 And young people, especially, are the most powerful agents of change.\nAnd this is \u2013 there\u2019s a photograph in the museum that went around the world, and it probably did as much to open hearts and open minds \u2013 and raise consciousness about Apartheid and about the struggle for equality and freedom \u2013 as anything.\u00a0 So to see this today, to have you share it with us, thank you.\nMS SITHOLE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s incredibly meaningful to me.\nMS SITHOLE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much. \u00a0And actually, the museum is a reminder of \u2013 like, for generations to come.\u00a0 Even us as adults, you\u2019re like: we must know where we are coming from and where we are going to. \u00a0And don\u2019t forget that the youth actually took a stand for us to live better today. \u00a0That means we\u2019re opening the path, we\u2019re opening the doors for youth as generations to come to take a stand in whatever problem that they have, but with responsibility.\u00a0 That is very, very important. \u00a0So we are relying on our youth to really take a stand.\u00a0 We are there to support and motivate them that really, we want to live in peace but not in pieces.\nThank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you all.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0What\u2019s your message to the South African Government while you\u2019re here?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll have more to say about that in the next couple of days.\u00a0 I really want to keep the focus on this extraordinary place, extraordinary story. \u00a0That\u2019s what today\u2019s about.\u00a0 And this extraordinary woman, this is someone who, despite her experience, which is \u2013 which is hard to \u2013 I think hard for any of us to wrap our minds around \u2013 who has the most open heart that I\u2019ve found.\u00a0 And that\u2019s inspiring, too, so thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\nThank you all very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-u-s-trade-and-development-agency-offshore-wind-grant-signing/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken  At a U.S. Trade and Development Agency Offshore Wind Grant Signing\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Ayala Gardens", "location": "Manila, the Philippines", "date": "August 6, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, and thank you, everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful, first of all, to be here in the Ayala Triangle Gardens, and I hope you had an opportunity, however briefly, to look at some of the work that\u2019s on display over to my left.\u00a0 It really is remarkable, and I\u2019ll come to it again in a minute.\u00a0 But I think what it demonstrates, among other things, is that somewhere in the\u00a0\u2013 thank you \u2013 somewhere in the world, we have problems that are shared.\u00a0 Someone is finding a solution, and if we can make sure that that information is shared, spread the knowledge, it\u2019s going to make a big difference everywhere.\nAnd so something happening here in the Philippines\u00a0\u2013 innovation, ingenuity \u2013 can make a difference not only here, but literally around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredibly impressive to see the\u00a0\u2013 not only the brilliant ideas, but the actual achievement of those ideas in having an effect and an impact on people here in the Philippines and, I believe, well beyond.\nAnd thank you to all of our esteemed colleagues who are here.\u00a0 Mr. Ambassador, it\u2019s very wonderful to be with you \u2013 all of our colleagues from the government, thank you for being here today.\u00a0 And thank you as well to everyone joining us from companies here in the Philippines.\nSo as we were going around, it was almost a series of what we would call \u201celevator pitches\u201d in business \u2013 but entrepreneurs, innovators, making a powerful difference.\u00a0 And they were all outstanding.\u00a0 Bringing power, solar power to fishing communities; expanding access to hydro power; developing microgrids, which make electric grids more flexible and more efficient; and so much more, all over there.\nThese efforts are more important than ever because every region in the world is experiencing the dangerous effects of the climate crisis.\u00a0 The Philippines is especially vulnerable.\u00a0 You\u2019re dealing with more intense typhoons, extreme rainfall, rising temperatures and sea levels.\u00a0 This is a threat by definition that no one country, no one government can solve alone.\u00a0 We have to tackle it together.\u00a0 And investing in clean energy is one very powerful way to do that.\nLast year the Philippines announced an ambitious clean energy goal\u00a0\u2013 to produce 35 percent of the nation\u2019s energy from renewable sources by 2030 and 50 percent by 2040.\u00a0 The United States commends these goals, and we\u2019re committed to helping the Philippines achieve them.\nToday, with a grant from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, we will lay the groundwork together for one of the first offshore wind projects in the Philippines.\u00a0 In time, that project will produce up to 3,000 megawatts of clean energy every single year.\u00a0 And to put that in perspective, 3,000\u00a0megawatts of clean energy, that\u2019s enough to power more than two million homes.\u00a0 We hope it will galvanize more investments in wind power.\u00a0 That\u2019s an industry with tremendous potential for growth here in the Philippines.\nThis new collaboration that we\u2019re announcing today is only the latest example of our work in clean energy together.\u00a0 This summer we helped support your first competitive bidding program with energy providers committed to producing another 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy by 2025.\u00a0 This past March, the Philippines joined the Clean Energy Demand Initiative.\u00a0 That\u2019s a program run by the United States that connects countries looking to switch to clean energy with companies that can help them do that.\u00a0 So far to date, 12 companies representing $2 billion of investments have signed letters of intent to partner with the Philippines.\nLast year our countries launched the Energy-Secure Philippines Initiative.\u00a0 That mobilizes private-sector investments and more clean energy generation throughout the Philippines.\nWe\u2019re working together to develop a nuclear energy sector in the Philippines with our recent agreement to facilitate cooperation between our nuclear experts.\nAnd as a founding member of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the Philippines joins 13\u00a0countries across the region who are committing to clean energy, decarbonization as a key pillar of a stronger, fairer, more resilient economy.\nThis work is critical, and we are grateful to our partners across the Philippines \u2013 the government, the private sector, and civil society for their dedication to this nation\u2019s clean energy future.\u00a0 Together we\u2019re reducing carbon emissions while creating jobs.\u00a0 We\u2019re sparking innovation.\u00a0 We\u2019re producing affordable, reliable energy for families and communities throughout the country.\nSo it\u2019s fitting that we\u2019re marking this new partnership here in these gardens.\u00a0 As some of you may know, this location was actually an international airport until 1948.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s an oasis in the middle of a bustling, busy city, a living reminder that with the right policies and investments, we can improve on our past, we can honor our planet, and we can deliver tangible benefits to our communities.\nSo thanks very much to everyone for being here today.\u00a0 Thanks for all the good work that we\u2019re doing together.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 I\u2019m honored to invite on the stage Ambassador Romualdez.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR ROMUALDEZ:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Betty.\u00a0\u00a0 Well, first of all, I\u2019d like to greet Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 It\u2019s very good to see you in Manila instead of the usual Benjamin Franklin Room at the State Department.\u00a0 Great to see you here.\nAmbassador MaryKay Carlson, you\u2019ve been here two weeks, but it looks like you\u2019ve been here for a year already with everybody.\nBut I\u2019d like to also like to thank our hosts of for this beautiful triangle here \u2013 good friends Jaime Fernando Z\u00f3bel de Ayala \u2013 for hosting this event here; of course, Madame Ebong, the director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency; and Betty Chung, the Acting Mission Director of the USAID; (inaudible) the Philippine department of energy; our other colleagues in the Philippine and U.S. governments, our partners in the private sector; ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon to all of you.\nI am honored to be joining you today for this clean energy expo.\u00a0 This event speaks very well of the importance of our two sides we place on addressing climate change and to the invaluable role of a private-public partnerships in making progress on this gargantuan task.\nThe Philippines takes climate seriously, being one of the three most vulnerable countries in the world when it comes to climate change.\u00a0 Betty and the USAID team here at Manila know that very well that we are receiving the end of the natural \u2013 number of natural disasters annually, super typhoons, earthquakes \u2013 we just had one recently \u2013 including the most recent one, the volcanic eruptions also.\nThe USAID is usually among the first of our international partners that come to our aid and support the emergency response and recovery efforts of the Philippine Government in the aftermath of this crisis.\nThank you very much, Betty, for the USAID\u2019s Temporary Shelter Program, support for our communities in northern Luzon following last week\u2019s earthquake.\u00a0 Beyond humanitarian assistance and disaster response, we need to zero in on the root of the problem and pursue solutions that would have significant impact in the long run.\u00a0 For this reason, the Philippines very much welcomed the first act of the Biden administration in rejoining the Paris Agreement.\u00a0 That reaffirmed, at the highest levels, the United States\u2019 commitment to climate efforts, and we are proud and very grateful for the continuing partnership in this regard.\nThe United States remains a steadfast partner and supporter of emerging economies like the Philippines in facilitating job creation and building of a high quality and environment friendly energy infrastructures that support initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change.\nDirector Enoh, in April last year I witnessed virtually the signing of the USTDA grant for the Metro Pacific Intel and Transportation System master plan technical assistance.\u00a0 I am very pleased to witness in person today another ceremonial signing of a new USTDA project for this grant \u2013 this time will be Aboitiz Renewables Incorporated, which we hope will translate to new and better wind energy infrastructures that could provide Filipino homes in the near future economical, high quality, and sustainable, of course, or sourced electricity.\nAccording to the World Bank estimates, the Philippines has over 170 \u2013 or 178 decawatts of technical offshore wind protection, which, if harnessed, would significantly help in meeting the increasing demand for energy in our country.\u00a0 I am confident that the Aboitiz Group, one of the largest power generation companies in the country, will be able to accomplish the goal of this grant and deliver the desired outcome of the project.\u00a0 I salute the USTDA\u2019s Global Partnership for the Climate-Smart Infrastructure Initiative, and we certainly are looking forward to seeing more of that take shape here in the Philippines.\u00a0 Again, thank you very much and thank you to all of you.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\n(Applause.)\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Ambassador Romualdez.\u00a0 We\u2019ll now move to the grant signing portion of the event.\u00a0 May I invite Director Ebong to please sit here up at this table?\n(Off-mike.)\nMS EBONG:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Betty, and Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Romualdez, Ambassador Carlson, our partners across the Philippines Government.\u00a0 It\u2019s such a pleasure to be here meeting such innovative and impactful renewable energy companies.\u00a0 It is so clear that the ecosystem for innovation, creativity, and partnership remains very strong here in the Philippines.\u00a0 The U.S. Trade and Development Agency is well suited to meet the needs of the Philippines clean energy transition.\nOur mission is to support the development of high-quality, sustainable infrastructure in emerging economies in collaboration with U.S. industry.\u00a0 This includes broad-based funding for feasibility studies and technical assistance, which are critical tools for ensuring that infrastructure products are financed, implemented, and sustained.\nUSTDA\u2019s model of assistance is based on partnership and trust and shared priorities.\u00a0 Perhaps there\u2019s no greater shared priority than tackling the climate crisis.\u00a0 In June, President Biden and the leaders of the G7 launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment to deliver game-changing projects to close the infrastructure gap and support a clean energy transition in countries like the Philippines.\nWe are committed to delivering on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to strengthen our ties and build more resilient economies for our countries, our businesses, and our families.\u00a0 These are some of the reasons why USTDA is working with Aboitiz Renewables, Inc. to support the development of an offshore wind power project with the potential to deliver clean energy solutions in the Philippines.\nColorado-based Rocky Mountain Institute will perform the USTDA-funded feasibility study and provide incoming resources towards its completion, as will Singapore-based (inaudible) Capital.\nI am grateful for their contributions and partnership, and I am proud of USTDA\u2019s role in supporting the Philippines and its ambitious climate agenda.\u00a0 Thank you.\n(Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-covid-19-assistance-event/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

On behalf of the people of Manila, we would like to welcome the Honorable U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, officials from the U.S. Government, the United States Agency for International Development, and our friends from the department of health.\u00a0\nCountries from all corners of the world were stunned with unexpected influx of COVID-19 cases since 2019.\u00a0 But everybody worked hard to immediately develop systems to address the crisis, from tracing, treating, and preventing the spread of this virus among their countrymen.\u00a0 The city government of Manila, as the capital city of the Philippines with almost 2 million people, tried to respond to the pandemic by implementing (inaudible) COVID-19 \u2013which stands for contain and delay COVID-19 \u2013 through lockdowns and curfews as the pandemic hit in early 2020.\nWe make the most out of our health cluster comprised of the city health department and six city-run hospitals to face the challenges to test, trace, and treat patients.\u00a0 In this instance, we saw more the importance of having allies and partners with whom we can forge and sustain relationship, partnership including the U.S. Government and USAID, to help our citizen get lifesaving care and access to the rollout of vaccines.\u00a0 We thank the U.S. Government for providing such extensive support to the city government of Manila.\nWith your help, we were able to administer more than 300 doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the deployment of mobile (inaudible) and donations of IT equipments to enhance our vaccine data reporting and management.\u00a0 We are proud to share that during the early phases of the nationwide vaccination rollout, we were actually one, if not the first among the local government units in the national capital region with the fastest vaccination rate.\u00a0 Again, we are grateful for your help.\nWe also appreciate the U.S. Government\u2019s donation of BIDA campaign materials and the installation of hand hygiene stations in 16 health facilities.\u00a0 This has provided free hand-washing access to 290 people per day, thus giving Manile\u00f1os additional layers of protection from COVID-19.\u00a0 USAID \u2013 the U.S. Department of Defense also provided more than 19,000 PPEs and essential medical supplies and 10,000 rapid antigen testing kits which helped us weather the last Omicron surge early this year.\u00a0 All these collaborations are in synch with the national government\u2019s \u201cprevent, detect, isolate, treat\u201d reintegration and COVID-19 vaccination program.\nWe are honored and grateful to have the United States Government and USAID here with us today, and I would like to extend my warmest gratitude to Secretary Blinken and our U.S. Government partners for being our key ally during these most challenging times.\u00a0 And we hope that we can further enhance this partnership to ensure that our health systems are better equipped for the crisis of the future.\u00a0 We say welcome (in Filipino).\u00a0 Thank you and\u00a0mabuhay.\n(Applause.)\nEsteemed guests, friends, ladies, and gentlemen, let us now listen to the Honorable U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n(Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Madam Mayor, thank you so much for that wonderful introduction.\u00a0 I have to say I think we\u2019ve seen first-hand just a moment ago why Manila is so fortunate to have a former physician leading its COVID-19 response.\u00a0 Talk about constituent services \u2013 I think some of you saw the mayor administer a vaccine to a young child.\u00a0 That\u2019s impressive.\nAnd let me just give a special thanks as well to everyone who has been involved in fighting COVID in the Philippines, including those of you from the department of health, the Manila City Health Office, the Philippines Genome Center, the Bulacan Medical Center, the many community health care workers and other civil society leaders who stepped forward to save lives.\nSo I just had the opportunity to some of the extraordinary efforts underway to get shots into arms, particularly for children.\u00a0 In a few minutes, I\u2019ll also get to meet some of the civil society leaders who have been involved in the Philippines response.\u00a0 They\u2019re also alumni of American exchange programs like the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative \u2013 known as YSEALI \u2013 and the International Visitors Leadership Program, something that we at the State Department are also very proud of.\u00a0 So we share in their nation\u2019s pride in their public service.\nThe organizations that they lead are playing a critical role in fighting COVID-19 here in the Philippines.\nTo name just a couple two examples, Joie Cruz is the founder of a design agency.\u00a0 It\u2019s called Limitless Lab.\u00a0 She and a group of other YSEALI alumni created AdaptPH, a nationwide campaign that encourages people to observe public safety protocols like wearing masks and social distancing.\u00a0 More than 240 local governments across the Philippines are now using her materials to try to flatten the curve of COVID cases.\nGabriel Billones\u00a0is the co-founder of the Break the Fake Movement.\u00a0 That works to try to debunk disinformation that\u2019s out there about the pandemic, about COVID-19.\u00a0 He partnered with our embassy here in Manila to create the \u201cMedia Civics Lab,\u201d training elected officials to understand how disinformation threatens the pandemic response.\u00a0 Hundreds of officials are now better equipped to counter disinformation in their communities as a result of working in this partnership.\nSo there are many other stories that I could tell, but the main thing is this:\u00a0 The civil society leaders who are here with us are protecting people\u2019s lives, protecting their livelihoods, and helping speed the Philippines\u2019 recovery from COVID.\nAnd we\u2019re seeing very encouraging signs of that recovery all around us.\u00a0 More than 70 million Filipinos have been vaccinated.\u00a0 Infections have gone down.\u00a0 Fewer people who get COVID are hospitalized or dying from it.\u00a0 And soon, children will return to school in person.\nBut there is still work to do.\u00a0 There are approximately 2,500 new cases of COVID-19 each day all across the Philippines.\u00a0 Sixteen million people have received their booster shots.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot, but more need to get it if we\u2019re going to stay protecting against all of the variants.\u00a0 Fewer than four million children ages 5 to 11 are fully vaccinated, and that\u2019s about six million below where I know the Philippines wants to be.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it was so encouraging just a moment ago to see all the children who are here, ready to get their vaccines.\nAs the Philippines continues to work to vaccinate people, to reduce the spread and save lives, my message is simple:\u00a0 The United States is with you.\nWe\u2019ve been proud to have donated more than 33 million safe, effective vaccines to the Philippines, no political strings attached.\nWe\u2019ve provided more than $50 million to your COVID-19 response to help train healthcare workers, to boost the vaccine rollout, to support the economic recovery.\nWe\u2019re also providing supplies for the continued fight against COVID-19, and we have some here with us here today \u2013 testing kits, laboratory equipment.\u00a0 All of that will go to the Philippines Genome Center, the Bulacan Medical Center, and our other partners who are here with us today.\nUltimately \u2013 ultimately \u2013 we will end this pandemic and emerge better prepared for future health crises by working together not only across governments, but across private sectors and across civil society.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind something we started called the Global Action Plan \u2013 we launched in February.\u00a0 And the idea was to identify the remaining gaps in global COVID response and then match countries that have unique capabilities to help fill those gaps.\u00a0 The Global Action Plan focuses on six key lines of effort: getting shots into arms, bolstering supply chains and their resilience, addressing the information gaps and dealing with misinformation, supporting healthcare workers, improving testing and treatments, and strengthening the global health security architecture for the long term because we know, even as we get through this pandemic, there will be more to come.\u00a0 And we have to learn all of the lessons from this experience to make sure that we\u2019re better prepared, more effectively prepared next time to see if we can prevent \u2013 and if not prevent, prepare for and mitigate \u2013 any future pandemics.\nIf the world can make strong progress along those six lines of effort that I\u2019ve described, we can end the acute phase of COVID-19.\u00a0 But that requires a great deal of coordination and cooperation among countries.\u00a0 No single one of us can do it alone.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why strong health partnerships \u2013 like the one between the United States and the Philippines \u2013 are so critical.\nSo again, I simply want to thank everyone who contributed and continues to contribute to that partnership \u2013 simply put, if for the sake of people in both our countries and people around the world.\nAnd now, Dr. Maria Rosario Vergeire from the department of health, the microphone is yours.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS VERGEIRE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much for Honorable Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2013 (in Filipino) \u2013 for being here and attending and joining us in this event.\u00a0 To our U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, MaryKay Carlson; to our USAID colleagues headed by acting Mission Director Betty Chung; to the acting health director, Katherine Tilout, our colleague Dr. Yolanda Oliveros; Dr. Ernesto Bontuyan, and also Ms. Consuelo Anonuevo; of course to our honorable mayor, our very good friend, very dynamic worker, Mayor \u201cHoney\u201d Lacuna-Pangan; and also to their Vice Mayor Yul Servo.\nAs the world embraces the new normal, the Department of Health continues to work tirelessly to ensure that the Filipino people are equipped with accurate health information, preventive health care services, treatment, and vaccination.\u00a0 Since 2020, we have received several donations from the United States to support the country\u2019s COVID-19 prevention and control efforts: 33.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility; different equipment such as mechanical ventilators, ICU beds, and ultra-low freezers; and medicines and hospital supplies.\u00a0 We also received support to our sub-national laboratories for vaccine-preventable diseases.\u00a0 We have also received supplies and equipments coming from the World Health Organization.\nToday we are pleased to witness the ceremonial turnover to the Philippines of these following laboratory equipments and medical supplies coming from the United States: one automated extraction machine for Bulacan Medical Center; 13,000 rapid antigen tests for the Bulacan Medical Center; (inaudible) COVID testing reagents for Philippine Genome Center; 5,000 test kits for the Manila health department; and assorted PPEs and 103 wash kits for the schools of the city of Manila.\nThese donations equate to a massive improvement of the capacity of our public health care system to deliver critical care as part of our arsenal in the fight against COVID-19. \u00a0We express our sincerest gratitude to the United States Government for its unwavering assistance to the Philippines in responding to COVID-19 and protecting Filipinos with much-needed vaccines and technical assistance.\u00a0 Your support helped save the lives of many, many Filipinos.\u00a0 Today, the department of health has administered more than 168 million doses of vaccines.\u00a0 Our BIDA, Resbakuna, and now the Pinas Lakas campaign would not have been successful without your help.\u00a0 We cherish this longstanding health partnership, and we hope that this level of commitment is sustained beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the next few months we will be working to meet Mr. President Bongbong Marcos\u2019 directive, which is to vaccinate 90 percent of our senior citizens and also to administer at least 50 percent to our eligible population for these first booster shots.\u00a0 The department of health aims to achieve this in the first 100 days of this current administration, and your help would be of great aid.\u00a0\u00a0 Recently, we just launched the Pinas Lakas campaign encouraging everyone to get fully vaccinated \u2013 Pinas Lakas campaign encouraging everyone to get fully vaccinated, particularly our senior citizens or our elderly population.\u00a0 We are working hand in hand with other national agencies, our local government units, and our public and private stakeholders, and of course our development partners including USAID, to help prepare our communities \u2013 especially our teachers and children \u2013 as we are opening our schools one hundred percent face to face this school year.\nMore than ever, the pandemic has also emphasized the importance of having universal health care for all, and as we aspire for our universal health care for all Filipino people, DOH is also grateful to USAID for providing technical assistance in preparing us for UHC\u2019s rollout.\u00a0 The DOH, USAID, and others development partners are working collaboratively to establish the management, technical, and financing mechanisms for such an endeavor, strengthening local government capacity and providing technical resources to roll out this priority legislation here in the Philippines.\u00a0 We envision that with this cooperation with the U.S. Government and other partners, we can make health accessible to every Filipino in the coming years.\nFurther, we look forward to sustaining and expanding our partnership to ramp up booster vaccinations, better integrate COVID-19 activities with our universal health care efforts, and thus strengthen our health systems to prevent and respond to further pandemics in the future.\nOn behalf of the department of health, I would like to extend my most fervent gratitude to the United States Government helping the Philippines get back on its feet and build back better.\u00a0 The Filipino people will never forget the kindness you have shown during these trying times.\u00a0 (In Filipino.)\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-philippine-secretary-of-foreign-affairs-enrique-manalo-at-a-virtual-press-availability/",

our friends from the media, both local and the U.S. traveling press corps \u2013 ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.\u00a0 It is with great pleasure that I address you today, although only on this virtual platform.\nSecretary Blinken and I just held our first meeting since I assumed my post as secretary of foreign affairs.\u00a0 This was also the Secretary\u2019s first visit to the Philippines and the first of a U.S. Secretary of State since March 2019.\u00a0 What stood out from our discussion was our resounding commitment to sustaining the positive momentum and trajectory of Philippine-U.S. relations.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken and I talked extensively about the alliance between our two countries.\u00a0 We also discussed the steps we can take to build on our two-way high-level engagements over the past year, including the 9th bilateral Strategic Dialogue last November where we adopted the Joint Vision for a 21st Century Philippine-United States Partnership.\nWe agreed to work together over the next couple of months in firming up opportunities for our presidents for a possible meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York next month, as well as a possible visit by President Marcos to Washington, D.C. \u2013 their schedules permitting \u2013 in response to an open invitation extended by President Biden.\nIn November, we look forward to hosting here in Manila the 10th bilateral Strategic Dialogue, where we hope to advance our discussions on the full range of political, security, and economic cooperation between our two countries.\u00a0 We also agreed to reconvene the 2+2 Ministerial meeting in early 2023 to further cement the outcomes of these and earlier defense and strategic engagements and ensuring action plans and initiatives.\nWe looked at strengthening our cooperation to better address current and emerging security threats and cross-cutting challenges.\u00a0 We welcome the U.S. Government\u2019s assurances of their readiness to work closely with the new Philippine administration, recognizing the Philippines as a United States equal, sovereign partner in advancing our shared objective of promoting peace and prosperity in the region.\nWe acknowledge the significant challenges we face and the amount of work that still needs to be done in the post-pandemic recovery.\u00a0 The Philippines is grateful for the substantial and critical support of the United States in our COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.\u00a0 The over 33.6 million donated vaccine doses to date is the largest we have received from a single country partner, and these have saved millions of lives and supported our economy and health system.\u00a0 We hope the United States will extend its support to also facilitate investments and capacity building for our local vaccine development, manufacturing, and distribution industry.\nI echo the message of President Marcos on the imperative of attracting capital investments and infrastructure, as well as to mitigate the effects of the food security issues arising from climate change and the conflict in Ukraine.\u00a0 We recognize the important role that the United States can play in ensuring that developing countries like ours can have access to key commodities, including fertilizers.\u00a0 We agreed to continue our discussions to how we can cooperate on accessing fertilizers, lower prices for our farmers, as well as technology that will allow us to modernize and make agriculture in the Philippines more efficient, cost effective, and climate smart.\nIn line with a greater push towards economic cooperation between our two countries, we agreed to flesh out further opportunities for enhanced cooperation that would support efforts to promote resilient supply chains, health systems, and infrastructure, as well as opportunities to collaborate in marine resource management and clean energy, especially nuclear energy. \u00a0We will do so bilaterally and within the context of the United States-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, where the Philippines is a country partner.\nFinally, we touched on the very foundation of our partnership, our common values and shared commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.\u00a0 Recognizing that democracy, whether in the Philippines or the United States, will always be a work in progress, we agreed to maintain open lines of communication.\u00a0 We\u2019re discussing human rights issues.\u00a0 To demonstrate our commitment to dialogue on this matter, I announced today the designation of DFA Undersecretary Theresa P. Lazaro as the Philippine representative to the (inaudible) group preparing for the 2nd U.S.-led Summit for Democracy to be hosted by President Biden in early 2023.\nOur request made to our American partners is also to actively contribute to cultivating a constructive environment within the UN Human Rights Council.\u00a0 Recognizing the importance of financial and technical assistance to support national institutions in the areas of human rights, I urge Secretary Blinken to support Philippine work in the UN joint programme in the Philippines.\nI would like to take this opportunity finally to thank Secretary Blinken for this visit.\u00a0 Indeed, from our meeting, it is clear the U.S. and the Philippines are allies, partners, and friends.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good afternoon, everyone, and Secretary Manalo \u2013 Ricky \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 My thanks to you, to President Marcos, to the people of the Philippines for an incredibly warm welcome.\u00a0 This is a somewhat unusual format for a press conference, but these are unusual times.\u00a0 And I\u2019m simply grateful that you\u2019re feeling well, looking good, and that we\u2019ve been able to meet and have a very good meeting virtually just a little while ago, and now to be able to address our colleagues from the media together as well.\nI wanted to come to the Philippines at the start of the Marcos presidency because the Philippines is an irreplaceable friend, partner, and ally to the United States.\u00a0 This is our oldest alliance in the Indo-Pacific region.\nAs you heard from the Secretary, we share interests, we share values, and we\u2019re profoundly connected by ties of family and friendship that go back literally generations.\u00a0 The United States seeks to work closely with President Marcos, Secretary Manalo, and all of their colleagues to carry forward our alliance \u2013 and make sure the proud history we share into a living history for the benefit of Filipinos and Americans alike.\nToday\u2019s itinerary reflects the scale and scope of our relationship, our partnership.\nThis afternoon, in a short while, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to visit a COVID-19 vaccination clinic to say thank you to the public servants and civil society activists who are leading the fight against COVID here in the Philippines.\u00a0 The United States has been proud to support their excellent work, including by donating more than 33 million doses of safe, effective vaccines with no political strings attached.\nWe\u2019ll continue to work together to end the acute phase of this pandemic and strengthen our shared health security.\nI\u2019ll also visit a clean energy fair, where our countries will sign a new agreement laying the groundwork for one of the first offshore wind power projects in the Philippines.\u00a0 This is the latest in a long line of clean energy collaborations between us, because clean energy is vital for economic growth, it\u2019s vital for innovation, and of course, it\u2019s vital for responding to the climate crisis.\nFood security is another priority that joins our two countries.\u00a0 At a time when food prices are rising and availability is scarcer in many parts of the world \u2013 in part because of the combination of climate change, the effects of COVID-19, and now the consequences of conflict: Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine \u2013 we want to work more closely with the Philippines, both to alleviate any short-term food insecurity, but especially to help continue to build food production capacity here in the Philippines for the long term.\nIn my conversations today with President Marcos and Secretary Manalo, we spoke about deepening our economic relationship.\u00a0 The United States remains a top three trading partner and investor in the Philippines.\u00a0 American firms are among the largest employers, the biggest taxpayers, and highest value exporters here.\nWe want to expand those ties \u2013 through private sector investment, public-private partnerships, and by working together to address leading challenges of the 21st century economy, like shaping emerging technologies, strengthening our supply chains, accelerating the transition to a green economy.\u00a0 These are all pillars of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which the Philippines joined this spring and which reflects our shared vision of a region that\u2019s free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.\nI was struck by something President Marcos said in our meeting today: this is not about getting back to where we were before COVID-19; it\u2019s about moving forward and transitioning all of our economies to the needs, the demands, and the opportunities of the 21st century.\nWe also talked about strengthening democracy.\u00a0 The United States is committed to working collaboratively with the Philippines to defend the rule of the law, protect human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2013 including freedom of expression \u2013 and safeguard civil society.\nThese values are critical to our alliance.\u00a0 They\u2019re essential to building the future that the people of the Philippines want and deserve.\nWe talked as well about our security partnership, and I reiterated our ironclad commitment to the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty and reaffirmed that an armed attack on Philippines\u2019 armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke U.S mutual defense commitments under that treaty.\nIn addition to working with the Philippines to help secure its maritime domain, we also partner with Filipino fisherman and scientific researchers to preserve and protect the Philippines\u2019 precious maritime resources, which are under threat from illegal fishing and environmental destruction by outside actors.\nWe always stand by our partners.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to underscore that because of what\u2019s happening north of here in the Taiwan Strait.\nSince the People\u2019s Republic of China launched nearly a dozen ballistic missiles toward Taiwan two days ago, we\u2019ve been hearing from allies and partners across the region who are deeply concerned about the destabilizing and dangerous actions.\nMaintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is vital, not just for Taiwan but for the Philippines and many other countries.\u00a0 What happens in the Taiwan Strait affects the entire region.\u00a0 In many ways, it affects the entire world because the strait, like the South China Sea, is a critical waterway.\u00a0 Almost half the global container fleet, nearly 90 percent of the world\u2019s largest ships, pass through the Taiwan Strait this year.\u00a0 Since their missile launches, Beijing has taken an irresponsible step of a different kind:\u00a0 They\u2019ve shut down eight different areas where our two countries have been able to work together.\nThose include several military-to-military channels which are vital for avoiding miscommunication and avoiding crisis, but also cooperation on transnational crime and counternarcotics, which help keep people in the United States, China, and beyond safe.\nThey\u2019ve also suspended all climate cooperation with the United States.\u00a0 The world\u2019s largest carbon emitter is now refusing to engage on combatting the climate crisis.\u00a0 Suspending climate cooperation doesn\u2019t punish the United States; it punishes the world, particularly the developing world.\nWe should not hold hostage cooperation on matters of global concern because of differences between our two countries.\u00a0 Others are rightly expecting us to continue to work together on issues that matter to the lives and livelihoods of their people as well as our own.\nThe Philippines knows how alarming this is \u2013 as a nation of thousands of islands, they\u2019re especially vulnerable to climate change.\u00a0 China walking away from climate talks could have lasting consequences for the future of the region \u2013 the future of our planet.\nOur allies and partners across the region have told us in no uncertain terms that they are looking for responsible leadership right now.\u00a0 So let me be clear.\u00a0 The United States doesn\u2019t believe that it\u2019s in the interest of Taiwan, the region, or own national security to escalate this situation.\u00a0 I conveyed that directly to Wang Yi, the PRC\u2019s foreign minister, at the East Asia Summit just yesterday.\nWe\u2019ll keep our channels of communication with China open with the intent of avoiding escalation due to misunderstanding or miscommunication.\nIn the days to come, you will see the United States remaining steady.\u00a0 We\u2019ll stand with the Philippines, with all our allies and partners.\u00a0 We\u2019ll work through regional organizations like ASEAN to enable friends in the region to make their own decisions free from coercion.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to support Taiwan and cross-strait peace and stability because we know that a free and open Indo-Pacific demands it.\nLet me just conclude on a personal note to say it is great to be back in Manila and to say thank you, as well, to our embassy team, led by Ambassador MaryKay Carlson, who only just got here but has already hit the ground running, fully energized, engaged, and I can see that in the meetings that we\u2019ve had today.\u00a0 She and the team are doing outstanding work on behalf of our country.\u00a0 I and we are very grateful to them.\nSo my thanks again, Ricky, to you, to the government, to the people of the Philippines, for the warm hospitality but, even more, for the ongoing partnership and friendship that joins us together.\nThank you.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Inaudible)\u00a0 I\u2019m going to read the first question that has actually been sent us.\u00a0 This comes from Celerina Monte of NHK.\u00a0 It\u2019s addressed to Secretary Manalo.\u00a0 Her questions reads:\u00a0 \u201cWill the Philippines and the U.S. undertake further defense and military cooperation under the Marcos administration?\u00a0 Please specify.\u00a0 A related question is:\u00a0 Can we expect a regular joint patrol between the Philippines and the U.S in the West Philippines Sea?\u201d Secretary Manalo.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0 Regarding the first question \u2013 well, first of all, let me begin by saying that our defense and security engagements with the United States continue to be a pillar of our bilateral relationship, and our defense relations are really anchored on the Mutual Defense Treaty, succeeding agreements like the Mutual Logistic Support Agreement, Visiting Forces Agreement, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, as well as the other mechanisms which go along with these various agreements.\nNow, one of these mechanisms is the conduct of joint activities between the Philippines and the United States security forces, including training, military exercise, as well as subject matter exchanges, technical assistance, as well as assistance aimed to facilitate interoperability, improvement of capabilities, as well as readiness to address security concerns, and consultations at different levels on mutual security concerns, to assess security threats,\u00a0 planned activities as well as update procedures and policies are also part of this.\u00a0 A transfer in the nation of defense material to the \u2013 by the United States to the Philippines, including corresponding training and maintenance services in support of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program, is another element of this.\nSo the cooperation facilitated by all of these existing agreements also extends beyond the traditional security issues of defense and maritime security but now also include cooperation areas such as terrorism, cybersecurity, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, as well as pandemics.\nOn the second question regarding the defense and military cooperation, well, first \u2013 oh, excuse me \u2013 on the issue of joint patrols between the Philippines and the United States on the West Philippines Sea \u2013 well, first, let me say very succinctly that in our view, joint patrols between the Philippines and the United States can take place.\u00a0 They are under the ambit of the MDT and also within the context of the Mutual Defense Board and Security Engagement Board.\u00a0 So I think this is an issue which will be continued to be explored bilaterally.\u00a0 And, as I mentioned, there are existing, multiple platforms for which the discussions of this nature could be held.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Our first question, we\u2019ll go to Ryohei Takagi of Kyodo News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I have question for both of you.\nSecretary Blinken, China has suspended regular communications channels with the United States military as well as climate talks in retaliation for Speaker Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan this week.\u00a0 How can the United States keep open lines of communication with the PRC?\nYesterday, you mentioned you talked to Chinese foreign minister in Bali, and not to use \u2013 urged not to use the visit as a kind of pretext of escalation \u2013 for escalation.\u00a0 But China did it.\u00a0 Is there room for diplomacy to work?\u00a0 Will you reach out again to Chinese foreign minister to reduce the tension of Taiwan Strait in the near future?\nAnd then Foreign Minister Manalo, you have mentioned the potential President Marcos visit to\u00a0 Washington.\u00a0 Can you hear me okay?\nFOREIGN MINISTER MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 Yes.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0 So when exactly will he go to Washington?\u00a0 Next month?\u00a0 And secondly, the President Marcos mentioned today he didn\u2019t think Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan raised the intensity between the United States and the PRC.\u00a0 So what do you think the root cause of the intensity in Taiwan is?\u00a0 As ASEAN member, how can the Philippines contribute to reduce the tension?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Ricky, I\u2019m happy to start.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 First, let me say that we and the world have an abiding interest in keeping lines of communication open.\u00a0 Even before this unnecessary crisis, we placed an important emphasis on that.\u00a0 As you may recall, I spent about five hours with \u2013 speaking with Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Indonesia, in Bali, just a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0 President Biden has spoken with President Xi, I think, five times over the last 18 or 19 months, including just a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0 The National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Treasury, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs all have engaged their counterparts one way or another and done so repeatedly in past months.\nI think maintaining dialogue is arguably even more important when we\u2019re in a period of heightened tensions, as we are now because of China\u2019s activities around Taiwan.\u00a0 We seek to de\u2011escalate those tensions, and we think dialogue is a very important element of that.\nAnd then I would simply say this:\u00a0 What I\u2019m hearing from countries around the region and countries around the world is that they expect us to maintain our channels of communication.\u00a0 They respect\u00a0\u2013 expect us to responsibly manage our differences.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the United States is determined to do.\nRicky, over to you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Right.\u00a0 Thank you, Tony.\u00a0 On the first question on the possible visit to the United States, yes, President Biden has already invited President Marcos to visit the United States.\u00a0 The issue, of course, now is when that visit will actually take place, which will depend, of course, on the scheduling\u00a0\u2013 on the schedules of both presidents.\u00a0 And if we can come up with a mutual date, then obviously we\u2019ll be able to push through with that visit.\u00a0 So talks will be on trying to find what date might be suitable for both.\nOn the issue of the Taiwan, well, the Philippines and ASEAN have always been ready to see how we can help in any way to reduce the tensions.\u00a0 May I just say at this important point, as mentioned by Tony, it\u2019s \u2013 from a Philippine perspective \u2013 very important that the lines of communication be maintained between the parties concerned, especially as a way of trying to prevent matters from escalating and reducing tensions.\u00a0 And the Philippines will always see how we can encourage to maintain such lines of communication.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0Secretaries, the last (inaudible) from our side, it comes from Federico Segarra, EFE, Spanish press agency.\u00a0 \u201cThe harassment from Chinese paramilitary vessels of Philippine fishermen has increased this year, according to diplomatic protests based by the Philippines.\u00a0 Was this issue talked through?\u00a0 And is there any political or military advice from the U.S. to avoid this continuous harassment?\u201d\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Ricky, do you want to start?\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, I think the question here refers to the Chinese maritime militia vessels that appear to be private fishing vessels.\u00a0 Well, we have protested their activities in various areas \u2013 in the one Julian Felipe Reef, the (inaudible), the Pag-asa Island \u2013 and they\u2019ve all been subject to appropriate diplomatic action.\u00a0 And one of our concerns is some of these vessels have been conducting illegal, unregulated fishing, and this is an area where the Philippines certainly has concerns, especially in protecting our legitimate sovereign rights and jurisdiction (inaudible) enforcement, particularly against IUUF.\u00a0 And we have now issued various notes (inaudible) to this effect to China.\nNow, this is an area at the same time where we can have ongoing discussions with the United States in the context of our bilateral relationship, and of course with regional partners.\u00a0 But at the same time, we continue to hold bilateral negotiation or discussions even with China within the framework of our existing dialogue mechanisms so that we can come up with ways to cooperate in this area.\u00a0 So I think it\u2019s in that respect utilizing existing bilateral dialogue mechanisms, as well as regional, where we seek to further address this issue.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0And I don\u2019t have much to add because I agree with everything that the secretary said.\u00a0 I would only put one point of emphasis on this problem of illegal fishing.\u00a0 This is something we see here; we see it much more broadly in the South China Sea and beyond.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a direct threat to the livelihoods of thousands, tens of thousands, of people engaged in fishing to support themselves and their families.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a threat because it threatens fish stocks, it threatens the environment in the way it\u2019s done, and what I\u2019m hearing from countries across the region and beyond is this is an issue of particular concern and one that I expect we will all continue to bring focus to.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Dan Flatley of Bloomberg News.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I also have a question for you, Secretary Blinken, and for you, Mr. Secretary Manalo.\nSecretary Blinken, you mentioned the ASEAN statement as making the case that the U.S. is not alone in condemning China\u2019s actions.\u00a0 But many in ASEAN were also clearly concerned that Pelosi\u2019s visit provoked China into acting.\u00a0 Now China\u2019s actions are seen as at least understandable by some countries.\u00a0 How do you respond to criticism that Pelosi\u2019s visit did nothing to help the U.S. and Taiwan strategically?\nAnd Secretary Manalo, if I may, last month President Marcos signaled a openness to the idea of doing some military cooperation or coordination with China.\u00a0 Can you tell us a little bit about the status of those talks?\u00a0 I believe they were in the context of trying to reduce tensions.\u00a0 And what is the status of those talks, and how would that affect your relationship both with the U.S. and with China?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Dan, thank you.\u00a0 On the one hand, you have the peaceful visit of Speaker Pelosi and other members of Congress to Taiwan.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had, I think, something like a dozen congressional delegations of one kind or another in this calendar year alone, and there is a long, long history of members of Congress visiting Taiwan.\u00a0 So you have that on the one hand.\nOn the other hand, you have \u2013 allegedly as a reaction to the visit \u2013 the use of the Chinese military; the launching of 11 ballistic missiles, including five that, according to Japan, landed in the sea very near Japan itself; you have military maneuvers, including maneuvers that threatened to impede passage of ships through the Taiwan Strait, something that is vital to global commerce.\u00a0 So the total disproportion between a peaceful visit on the one hand and escalatory military maneuvers on the other I think is very clear, and very clear to countries throughout the region.\u00a0 And certainly that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been hearing as I\u2019ve been here for the last few days.\nBut I think what\u2019s also important to note is that, as we\u2019ve said to our counterparts in Beijing over the last weeks when the possibility of this visit was in the air, don\u2019t use it as a pretext to do what you\u2019ve just done because this is not something that\u2019s happened overnight or in a vacuum.\u00a0 What we\u2019ve seen over the last few years is China engaging in increasingly destabilizing and potentially dangerous actions with regard to Taiwan, and this follows from that.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we say that the change to the status quo that\u2019s prevailed with regard to Taiwan for more than 40\u00a0years is coming from Beijing, not from the United States or anyone else.\nThat status quo is founded on something that was clearly understood for decades, and that is: the differences between Taiwan and the mainland need to be resolved peacefully.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve seen China do over the last few years is move away from a peaceful resolution of differences to doing so coercively and, potentially, forcefully.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s changed.\u00a0 And I think countries throughout the region and around the world are very concerned about that development, and I think what we would hope Beijing would focus on is the fact that for 40 years plus, we\u2019ve managed this problem, this challenge well.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done it in a way that\u2019s avoided any conflict.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done it in a way that\u2019s allowed Taiwan itself to flourish.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s the expectation that countries around the region and around the world have.\u00a0 They certainly expect us, the United States and China, to manage our differences responsibly.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re determined to do.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY MANALO:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, thank you.\u00a0 Well, in response to that question, what I can say is that in our discussions when Foreign Minister Wang Yi came here last month, we discussed essentially how to enhance our cooperation by reviving a number of our existing bilateral dialogue mechanisms, such as foreign ministry consultations, and also to consider reviving also or continuing our discussions on the bilateral consultation mechanism, where we discuss issues covering a wide range of areas on the South China Sea.\nSo I think these are the ones which we have\u00a0\u2013 we discussed extensively and as \u2013 in addition, of course, to various areas of economic cooperation.\u00a0 And those are the ones\u00a0\u2013 those are the areas which we will be pursuing with China.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0That concludes (inaudible) press conference\u00a0between Secretary Manalo and Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon.\u00a0 To our visitors, safe travel.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 Ricky, thank you.\u00a0 Good to be with you.\nFOREIGN SECRETARY

it just demonstrated how the intensity of the conflict has been.\u00a0 It actually has been at that level for a good while now, but we sort of got used to the idea and then put it aside.\nBut nonetheless, this just demonstrates how volatile the international diplomatic scene is not only in the region \u2013 the obvious \u2013 obviously the events in the Ukraine have been of significant \u2013 of significant importance to, surprisingly, even countries like the Philippines, which we would imagine was very far away.\nSo again, this just points to the fact of the importance of the relationship between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines.\u00a0 I hope that we will continue to evolve that relationship in the face of all the changes that we have been seeing and the changes that are between in our bilateral relationship with the United States.\u00a0 The Mutual Defense Treaty is in constant evolution, as I \u2013 I\u2019d like to think of it.\nAnd as we \u2013 the other, with the United States \u2013 as I spoke \u2013 as we spoke with your ambassador at some length when she came to present her credentials, is that the \u2013 we cannot \u2013 we can no longer isolate one part of our relations from the other.\u00a0 We are too closely tied because of the special relationship within the United States and the Philippines and the history that we have shared, and of course all the assistance and help and support that we have received from the United States over the years.\u00a0 And they can no longer be categorized as one thing or another because they cover such a large \u2013 a large scope.\nSo I am glad that you are able to come and visit the Philippines once more.\u00a0 Unfortunately, with your crushing schedule, I don\u2019t know if you will be able to do any actual visiting, but perhaps you can do some good work while you are here.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. President, thank you so much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great pleasure for me to be back in the Philippines, and it\u2019s an honor for me to have this opportunity to meet you and to speak with you.\u00a0 Thank you so much for receiving us \u2013 so talking about busy schedules, especially with your recent election, I know that you take office, the inbox is very high.\u00a0 The outbox, not quite as high \u2013 so I very much appreciate it.\nAnd I think it really is evidence of exactly what you\u2019re saying, Mr. President.\u00a0 The \u2013 our relationship is quite extraordinary because it is really founded in friendship, it\u2019s forged as well in partnership, and it\u2019s strengthened by the fact that it\u2019s an alliance as well.\u00a0 To your point, the people-to-people ties between us are almost unique, and it\u2019s something that we tremendously value in the United States, just as I know you do here.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also working together as partners in so many different areas, particularly economically, and of course, the alliance is strong and, I believe, can grow even stronger.\nWe\u2019re committed to the Mutual Defense Treaty.\u00a0 We\u2019re committed to working with you on shared challenges.\u00a0 But I think what\u2019s so striking to me, Mr. President, is that we are working together on bilateral issues between us, we\u2019re working together in the region, and increasingly, we\u2019re working globally because so many of the challenges we face are global in nature \u2013 whether it\u2019s COVID-19, and we\u2019ve been proud to be your partner in working on that and protecting all of our people; whether it\u2019s climate and the need to deal with that existential challenge; or whether it\u2019s the impact of all of these new technologies on the lives of our people.\nIn these and so many other areas, the work we\u2019re doing together matters.\u00a0 It matters to people back home in the United States, and I hope and believe it matters to people here in the Philippines.\u00a0 So I\u2019m grateful for this opportunity to deepen everything we\u2019ve already been doing, and we\u2019re grateful to be working with you and your administration.\nPRESIDENT MARCOS JR:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-philippine-secretary-of-foreign-affairs-enrique-manalo-before-their-virtual-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken At a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Raffles Hotel", "location": "Phnom Penh, Cambodia", "date": "August 5, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 I\u2019ve had a productive and meaningful two days here in Cambodia.\u00a0 We\u2019ve still got a few meetings to go this afternoon, but it\u2019s been a very productive couple of days so far, and then we\u2019re heading, as you know, to the Philippines later today.\nWe covered a lot of topics here in Phnom Penh, but let me begin with the situation in the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 Yesterday the People\u2019s Republic of China launched nearly a dozen ballistic missiles toward Taiwan.\u00a0 They landed in waters to the northeast, the east, and southeast of the island.\u00a0 Japan reported that five of those missiles landed in its exclusive economic zone, understandably causing them and all of us grave concern.\u00a0 The People\u2019s Liberation Army has now declared seven restricted zones near Taiwan and say that they will extend a range of military exercises through Monday.\nThese provocative actions are a significant escalation.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen how Beijing has attempted to change the status quo on Taiwan for some time \u2013 for example, more than doubling the number of aircraft flown over the centerline that separates China and Taiwan over the past two years; pursuing economic coercion, political interference, cyber-attacks against Taiwan.\u00a0 Now they\u2019ve taken dangerous acts to a new level.\nThe United States has conveyed to the PRC consistently and repeatedly that we do not seek and will not provoke a crisis.\u00a0 President Tsai has said the same thing.\u00a0 China has chosen to overreact and use Speaker Pelosi\u2019s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 We anticipated that China might take steps like this.\u00a0 In fact, we described this exact scenario.\u00a0 The fact is the Speaker\u2019s visit was peaceful.\u00a0 There is no justification for this extreme, disproportionate, and escalatory military response.\nLet me say again that nothing has changed about our \u201cone China\u201d policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Communiques, and the Six Assurances.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want unilateral changes to the status quo from either side.\u00a0 We do not support Taiwan independence.\u00a0 We expect cross-strait differences to be resolved peacefully, not coercively or by force.\nWe\u2019re not alone in this.\u00a0 ASEAN released a statement yesterday about the need to de-escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 The G7 has rejected Beijing\u2019s attempt to coerce and intimidate Taiwan.\u00a0 There are serious concerns not only for Taiwan but for the possibility that these actions by Beijing will destabilize the broader region.\nFor our part, the United States will not be provoked.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to do what we\u2019ve done for a long time.\u00a0 We\u2019ll support cross-strait peace and stability and a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 You\u2019ll see that in the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0 We will stick by our allies and partners and work with and through regional organizations to enable friends in the region to make their own decisions, free from coercion.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take further steps to demonstrate our commitment to the security of our allies in the region, including Japan.\u00a0 We will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to conduct standard air and maritime transits through the Taiwan Strait, consistent with our longstanding approach to working with allies and partners to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, which has enabled the region\u2019s prosperity for many decades.\u00a0 Almost half the global container fleet and nearly 90 percent of the world\u2019s largest ships passed through the straits this year.\u00a0 That\u2019s just one reason why these actions by Beijing are so disruptive.\nWe\u2019ll continue to support Taiwan in cross-strait peace and stability.\u00a0 Secretary Austin has directed that the aircraft carrier\u00a0USS Ronald Reagan\u00a0remain on station in the general area to monitor the situation.\u00a0 In short, the world will see us continue to support the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and advance our shared goals throughout the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 That is what the region expects of us: to be a steady and responsible leader.\nAnother major topic of conversation was the crisis in Burma.\u00a0 The regime\u2019s execution of four democracy activists despite pleas from many \u2013 including the ASEAN chair, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the ASEAN special envoy \u2013 has alarmed and horrified people across the region and around the world.\u00a0 I urge my fellow ministers to continue to press the regime to end its brutal violence, to release those unjustly detained, to allow humanitarian access, and restore Burma\u2019s path to democracy.\u00a0 We also have to increase economic pressure, do more to stop the flows of arms and revenue to the regime, insist on accountability for the atrocities that have been committed, and we strongly urge the international community not to endorse the regime\u2019s plans for sham elections next year.\u00a0 They can be neither free nor fair under present conditions.\nOne of the participants in the East Asia Summit and ASEAN Regional Forum meetings, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, visited with regime leaders in Burma just a few days ago, calling them a friendly partner.\u00a0 That directly flies in the face of ASEAN\u2019s hard work to bring the violence to an end.\nOn the matter of Russia, as we\u2019ve said many times, the Kremlin has not only attacked Ukraine;\u00a0 it\u2019s also attacked the UN Charter and ASEAN\u2019s Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which enshrines the principles of independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and national identity for all nations.\u00a0 Russia is a party to that treaty, as it\u2019s a party to many other agreements that it\u2019s signed over the years and now violates in Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s in the interest of all countries and people in Southeast Asia, the broader Pacific region, and the world that Kremlin end this aggression and its painful global consequences.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard many countries here condemn Russian aggression, just as they did in joining 141 countries at the United Nations for a UN resolution supporting Ukraine and calling for an end to the aggression.\nI want to very much thank Cambodia again for serving as ASEAN chair and also for hosting us this week.\u00a0 The United States is grateful for our cooperation with ASEAN on so many urgent priorities, including fighting COVID-19, addressing the climate crisis, strengthening cyber security, ensuring freedom of navigation, supporting the lawful unimpeded flow of commerce.\u00a0 We support the central role that ASEAN plays in the region, and now we look forward to the summit in November, where we\u2019ll launch the first comprehensive strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States.\nA few hours ago, Yohannes Abraham, a close advisor to President Biden, was confirmed as our next ambassador to the U.S. mission at ASEAN.\u00a0 He will be an excellent partner for all of our friends in ASEAN.\nThis has been my first visit to Cambodia as Secretary of State.\u00a0 I have to tell you I\u2019ve been struck by and deeply appreciate the friendliness, the warmth of the Cambodian people that I\u2019ve had an opportunity to meet and interact with.\u00a0 And I\u2019m also glad to say thank you in person to our outstanding embassy team, led by Ambassador Patrick Murphy.\nYesterday I had the opportunity to meet with a group of alumni from our YSEALI program \u2013 that\u2019s the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative.\u00a0 I met with farmers and food producers from across Cambodia who are partners of ours through the global food security program Feed the Future.\u00a0 In my constructive and candid conversations with Prime Minister Hun Sen and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, we discussed the best way to ensure that all of Cambodia\u2019s people enjoy a bright future by protecting democratic rights, preserving Cambodia\u2019s independence, pursuing inclusive economic growth.\u00a0 The United States looks forward to deepening our partnership with Cambodia on these fronts and many more.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for our longstanding friendship with the Cambodian people, and I thank Cambodia again for showing us such warmth and hospitality these past two days.\nWith that, I am happy to take some questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with David Brunnstrom with Reuters.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, I wanted to follow up on your remarks on Taiwan.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard from the U.S. side that it\u2019s maintained communications with China over the fallout from Speaker Pelosi\u2019s visit.\u00a0 Can you tell us how exactly that\u2019s been done?\u00a0 We saw Foreign Minister Wang Yi walk out of yesterday\u2019s dinner, but he was at the EAS today.\u00a0 Have you had any contact with him at all in Cambodia?\u00a0 And has the United States asked Taiwan to show restraint to in response to China\u2019s military activity?\nAnd one more, if I could.\u00a0 We saw you make a point of walking into last night\u2019s dinner with Foreign Minister Hayashi.\u00a0 Was that a show of solidarity with Japan after these missiles?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Let me start with the first \u2013 the last part first.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Hayashi is a good friend and colleague, and sometimes a coincidence is just a coincidence.\u00a0 We happened to be walking in together because we were talking together in advance of the dinner.\u00a0 But irrespective of that, we stand in strong solidarity with our partner and ally, Japan, including with regard to the very dangerous actions that China has taken by firing off these missiles, including five that, according to Japan, landed in its exclusive economic zone.\nWith regard to China more broadly, we have open lines of communication.\u00a0 When I had the opportunity to see Foreign Minister Wang Yi a few weeks ago in Bali, we had a lengthy conversation then about Taiwan.\u00a0 The question of the possibility of the Speaker\u2019s visit came up, and I was extremely clear with him about the importance of not using that visit, if she decided to proceed with it, as some kind of pretext for escalation or other actions that China has now, in fact, taken.\nIn the meeting that we just had with all of the ASEAN foreign ministers, we had a vigorous communication about the situation in and around Taiwan, and I reiterated the points that we\u2019ve made publicly, as well as directly to Chinese counterparts in recent days again about the fact that they should not use the visit as a pretext for escalation, for provocative actions, that there is no possible justification for what they\u2019ve done, and urged them to cease these actions.\nBut I think what\u2019s very important is this is not just our view.\u00a0 It\u2019s the view of many countries throughout this region.\u00a0 I\u2019d refer you to the statement that ASEAN itself put out yesterday.\u00a0 It\u2019s the view of countries well beyond the region, including the G7 countries.\u00a0 You saw the statement that the G7 put out.\u00a0 And we look to China to take account of the views of many countries around the world.\nFor our part, we don\u2019t seek, and do not want, a crisis.\u00a0 We\u2019re prepared to manage what Beijing chooses to do; I think that\u2019s the case for all else involved.\u00a0 And it\u2019s in no one\u2019s interest that this escalate further and that there be any kind of crisis.\u00a0 But we look to Beijing to act accordingly.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Hasanah Isa, PNN TV.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So good afternoon, sir.\u00a0 I\u2019m Sokheng Pa from VOD Khmer.\u00a0 I have the question, and thank for your remark.\u00a0 Absent your state \u2013 (inaudible) Department of State that you met Prime Minister Hun Sen yesterday, and you urge him to reopen civil and political space before 2023 election.\u00a0 May you have clarify?\u00a0 What do you want Cambodia to do, exactly?\nAnd the second question: Do you wish to see the reinstatement of CNRP and the return of Sam Rainsy and (inaudible) Kem Sokha, for them to join political life?\nAnd late \u2013 CNRP again, the last one is, if \u2013 yes.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Let me say a couple of things.\u00a0 First, we had a very lengthy exchange about a number of issues with the prime minister yesterday.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made clear that our strong desire is for a positive relationship between the United States and Cambodia, one that we would hope to deepen even further.\u00a0 But one of the things that stands in the way of strengthening the relationship between our countries are concerns that are shared about eroding respect for human rights, the weakening of democratic institutions here in Cambodia.\nAs a friend of Cambodia, we\u2019re urging the authorities to uphold the kingdom\u2019s international obligations, its commitments to protect human rights, to protect fundamental freedoms, including those which are also enshrined in Cambodia\u2019s constitution.\u00a0 We made known our concerns.\u00a0 I made known our concerns directly to the prime minister, and we\u2019ll continue to speak in support of multi-party democracy.\u00a0 We are not focused on individuals, personalities, or parties.\u00a0 We\u2019re focused on the process and making sure that that process is open, transparent, and allows full and genuine participation by representatives of all the Cambodian people.\nI should also mention that I raised a number of cases of concern when it comes to human rights, and we focused on this both with regard to the systemic challenge and also specific challenges.\u00a0 So I mentioned a number of people where we have concerns, including a dual citizen, Seng Theary.\u00a0 And I met this morning with Kem Sokha, and this is, as you know, a key opposition leader.\u00a0 And again, the purpose is not to support in any way any particular individual, but the principle of the need for democracy, the need for respect for human rights, the need for an open, transparent, participatory system that would only strengthen Cambodia \u2013 strengthen its \u2013 strengthen it at home and strengthen it around the world.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Edward Wong,\u00a0New York Times.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 You\u2019ve mentioned several ways in which the U.S. might try and counter some of the aggression that you say you\u2019ve seen from Beijing.\u00a0 All of these are military counterweights that you\u2019ve presented.\u00a0 And I think, in general, there has been a lot of talk from the U.S. Government about new military alliances like AUKUS or partnerships, maybe putting more missiles in the region, things like that.\u00a0 Do you think that there is an inevitable spiral going on in the region, where militarization on all sides is occurring which might lead to greater crises?\nAnd then what do you say to the widespread criticism that the U.S. is refraining from entering into ambitious trade agreements in the region, and is thus missing an economic piece of competing with China here?\u00a0 People say that IPEF is a pale shadow of what TPP is.\nAnd finally, do you have any comments on Brittany Griner\u2019s conviction yesterday in Moscow, and have you spoken with Lavrov about this here?\u00a0 Lavrov told reporters earlier today that he was surprised he hadn\u2019t tried to talk to him about various issues.\u00a0 Thanks.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Great, thank you.\u00a0 First, there is nothing inevitable about crisis, nothing inevitable about conflict.\u00a0 On the contrary.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us and incumbent upon China to act responsibly and to manage what is a very vigorous competition between us, to manage that competition responsibly.\u00a0 That was very much a key part of the conversation that I had with Wang Yi over \u2013 the foreign minister, over five hours in Bali just a couple of weeks ago, and it reflects what I said today as well, including with all of our ASEAN colleagues.\nI think what we\u2019re hearing around the region is an expectation from all of the countries, virtually all the partners in ASEAN, to do just that.\u00a0 That is our responsibility.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly why we made very clear that we do not want, we do not seek, and we will not take actions to provoke a crisis.\u00a0 We call on China to stand back from the actions it\u2019s taken, which are a serious over-reaction to the peaceful visit of Speaker Pelosi to Taiwan and, I think, consistent with what they\u2019ve been doing for several years now, which is making it clear that they will no longer abide by the status quo when it comes to Taiwan.\nWhat we\u2019ve said all along \u2013 and it\u2019s been the foundation of our management of Taiwan for more than four decades, successfully, in making sure that it was not a source of conflict, and that the people in Taiwan could flourish \u2013 is we have said that the differences between the mainland and Taiwan need to be resolved peacefully, not coercively, not by force.\nSo it is incumbent upon China to continue to seek to resolve those differences peacefully, not to use coercion, and certainly not to use force.\u00a0 But what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years is China moving in that direction.\u00a0 And what we\u2019re hearing from countries around the region is that that\u2019s the last thing that they want.\nI\u2019d add also, we spend a lot of time talking about so many of the challenges that our countries face together:\u00a0 the need, the desire that I think people in all of our countries have to build a sustainable recovery from COVID, to continue to manage global health challenges, to deal with climate change, to pursue the need for an energy transition and new energy infrastructure.\u00a0 These are the kinds of things that our citizens expect us to be working on together.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the United States is committed to doing.\nWhat we don\u2019t seek, and what we don\u2019t want, are efforts by any country, whether it\u2019s China with regard to Taiwan or the South China Sea, or Russia in terms of its aggression against Ukraine, to disrupt international peace and security because it\u2019s incredibly dangerous, it violates basic principles that undergird relations between countries \u2013 for example, sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence \u2013 and it takes time, focus, and attention away from the things that our people want us to be working on together. \u00a0So that was one of the cases that I also made today with the Chinese foreign minister, the Russian foreign minister, and all of our colleagues from ASEAN.\nWith regard to trade, we put forward, as you know, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and it\u2019s gotten an extremely positive response from more than a dozen countries that have signed on to be founding members.\u00a0 And it remains an open, inclusive process, and I expect that other countries will join in.\u00a0 And what IPEF, as the acronym goes, focuses on are economic areas that are going to be critical to the 21st century economy.\u00a0 For example, digital trade.\u00a0 For example, securer supply chains.\u00a0 For example, governance, combatting corruption, all of which are absolutely vital to trade and investment moving forward.\u00a0 Trade facilitation is also a part of that.\nThe response has been extremely positive, and we\u2019re now in the process of really building it together with all of the founding members, shaping the different pillars of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\nWith regard to Brittany Griner and to Paul Whelan, a few things on that.\u00a0 I think, first, we\u2019ve all seen the sentencing, conviction of Brittany Griner to nine years in prison, and that further compounds the injustice that\u2019s being done to her and her wrongful detention.\u00a0 It puts a spotlight on our very significant concern with Russia\u2019s legal system and the Russian Government\u2019s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.\u00a0 The same goes for Paul Whelan.\nWe put forward, as you know, a substantial proposal that Russia should engage with us on.\u00a0 And what Foreign Minister Lavrov said this morning, and said publicly, is that they are prepared to engage through channels we\u2019ve established to do just that, and we\u2019ll be pursuing that.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question from Sorath Sorn, CamboJA.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 My name is Sorath from CamboJA News.\u00a0 I have the question about the election.\u00a0 After the coming election, the opposition leader will sue by the ruling party as the NEC.\u00a0 And so what do you think about this, and what is your expectation about the Cambodian election next year?\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, one of the things \u2013 thank you.\u00a0 One of the things that I shared with the prime minister and other Cambodian interlocutors is our expectation and, I think more important, the expectation of the Cambodian people that elections in Cambodia will be free and fair and genuinely participatory so that everyone in Cambodia can be represented in the elections and, depending on their outcome, in governance.\nOur purpose is not to be for any individual or any party, not at all.\u00a0 As I said earlier, it\u2019s about the process, making sure that there is a genuinely democratic process when it comes to Cambodia\u2019s elections.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to, that\u2019s what I shared with the prime minister.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank

pleasure to welcome you back in the region.\u00a0 And I appreciate very much your presence in this meeting.\u00a0 It shows the U.S. commitment to further strengthen relations with ASEAN.\u00a0 And thank you also for hosting the ASEAN-U.S. Summit in Washington, D.C., on the 12th and 13th of May this year.\nColleagues, we all know that we are living in a very challenging time.\u00a0 While COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, WHO has declared monkeypox as another public health emergency of international concern.\u00a0 In the meantime, the war in Ukraine continues.\u00a0 This situation creates significant impacts to the world, in particular the developing countries.\u00a0 Food and energy insecurity became more (inaudible) than before.\u00a0 The financial space is tightening.\u00a0 The question is:\u00a0 How can ASEAN-U.S. partnership help to ease these situations?\nColleagues, the Indo-Pacific is the future of our region.\u00a0 Our future will depend on how we manage the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 The Indo-Pacific region should not be approached with an either/or mindset, but rather with the mindset of Indo-Pacific cooperation, strategic trust, and, last but not least, always upholding the international laws.\u00a0 We have no other option but to vigorously reinforce this view.\u00a0 For Indonesia and ASEAN, it is very important to have concrete cooperation with partners, including with the U.S. \u2013 a win-win cooperation that can contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.\nSecretary Blinken, colleagues, in this challenging time, what the world needs is the wisdoms and responsibility of all leaders, all of us, to ensure peace and stability.\nMy last point \u2013 and this is very important \u2013 we are very glad that work is underway to elevate the ASEAN-U.S. relation into a comprehensive and strategic partnership, and I am sure that this new level of partnership will be a good avenue for us to further strengthen our relation.\u00a0 And I look forward to facilitating a fruitful discussion today with you, Tony.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nNow I would like to invite my co-chair to deliver his opening remarks.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, the floor is yours.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Foreign Minister, Retno, thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you for your good and kind words.\u00a0 Thank you especially for Indonesia\u2019s support as the country coordinator for the United States at this meeting and throughout these past months.\u00a0 It\u2019s greatly appreciated.\u00a0 And let me also thank very much our hosts for (inaudible) \u2013 for today, tomorrow \u2013 Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, for hosting us in Phnom Penh and for Cambodia\u2019s leadership as chair of ASEAN this year.\nBefore I go further, I want to speak to the recent activity concerning Taiwan, because I know it\u2019s on people\u2019s minds.\u00a0 The United States continues to have an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 We oppose any unilateral efforts to change the status quo, especially by force.\u00a0 We remain committed to our \u201cone China\u201d policy, guided by our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Communiqu\u00e9s, and the Six Assurances.\nAnd I want to emphasize nothing has changed about our position, and I hope very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretext to increase its aggressive military activity.\u00a0 We, and countries around the world, believe that escalation serves no one and could have unintended consequences that serve no one\u2019s interests, including ASEAN members and including China.\u00a0 We\u2019ve reached out to engage our PRC counterparts in recent days at every level of government to convey this message.\u00a0 Maintaining cross-strait stability is in the interests of all countries in the region, including all of our colleagues within ASEAN.\nThis year, we proudly mark 45 years of ASEAN-U.S. relations.\u00a0 Even as we mark those 45 years, we\u2019re looking to the future.\u00a0 And as we look to the future, the United States is determined to deepen and strengthen our partnership with ASEAN to meet the challenges of this moment, challenges that are affecting citizens in all of our countries.\u00a0 We are committed to ASEAN centrality.\u00a0 We strongly support the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and we wholeheartedly endorse the values upon which the outlook is based: openness, inclusivity, commitment to the rule of law, good governance, and \u2013 Retno, as you said \u2013 respect for international law.\u00a0 These values are also at the heart of our own Indo-Pacific strategy.\u00a0 Our strategy and the ASEAN Outlook are very coincident in their approach.\nAs President Biden said at the ASEAN-U.S. Special Summit in May, we\u2019re launching a new era in ASEAN-U.S. relations.\u00a0 And to name just a few examples of our cooperation, last September U.S. Secretary of Energy Granholm participated in the ASEAN-U.S. Energy Ministerial to deepen cooperation on shared goals, like promoting renewables and emerging energy technologies.\nJust this past May, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Becerra joined the ASEAN-U.S. Ministerial on Health.\u00a0 We\u2019re expanding cooperation on global health, health care delivery, including improved disease surveillance, stronger health workforces, increased access to primary care.\u00a0 This will help lift up all of our populations, not only in dealing with things like pandemics that we\u2019ve been grappling with for the last couple of years, but as a general matter in strengthening our health care systems to the benefit of all of our citizens.\nAt the special summit between the United States and ASEAN in May, our Special Presidential Envoy on Climate John Kerry led the discussion on working together to achieve global and regional decarbonization goals.\u00a0 We very much hope to continue this conversation at a U.S.\u2011ASEAN Climate Ministerial very soon.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve done a dialogue on transportation, as well as the first-ever ministerial on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment.\nIn short, we\u2019re working together across an incredibly wide range of issues that are central to the prosperity and security of our combined one billion people.\nAs we look ahead to the November ASEAN-U.S. summit, we\u2019re laying the foundations for a comprehensive strategic partnership so that we can expand our cooperation into even more areas, including maritime security, public health, cybersecurity.\u00a0 We also hope to increase cooperation with ASEAN throughout the broader region.\u00a0 For example, with the Quad and within the Indo\u2011Pacific Economic Framework (inaudible) for your ideas to advance that kind of cooperation and collaboration.\nTo guide all these efforts, President Biden selected his great longtime advisor Yohannes Abraham, an exceptional public servant, as our next ambassador to the U.S. Mission at ASEAN.\u00a0 If confirmed, I can tell you from personal experience he will be an excellent partner for ASEAN.\nEarlier today, I had a chance to meet with a group of young people from all across the region who are participating in the U.S. program called YSEALI, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative.\u00a0 To date, more than 5,000 young people are alumni of YSEALI exchanges.\u00a0 More than 150,000 belong to the YSEALI network.\u00a0 They represent the extraordinary talent and dedication of young people across Southeast Asia, who are eager to contribute to their countries progress and help shape a shared future.\nSo it was very inspiring to sit with them and hear from them, and now it\u2019s inspiring for me to be able to sit with each of you.\u00a0 And so I look forward \u2013 Retno, colleagues \u2013 to speaking with each of you over the next two days about how we can ensure that this partnership, which really will shape the future for generations to come, can continue and even more effectively deliver for our people.\nSo with that, Foreign Minister, back to you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MARSUDI:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And I now kindly request the media to leave the room, as we will start the closed session.\n\n"},

strongly about.\u00a0 Because, as you know from your own experience, it\u2019s doing so many wonderful things to connect some of the most remarkable members of the younger generation here in Cambodia and throughout Southeast Asia with the United States, with young Americans, with our leading universities, and hopefully not only giving you some experience and knowledge and tools to build on the things that you want to do back home, but also creating remarkable networks among each other that last well beyond your formal participation in the program.\nCambodia is going to be hosting the next big session of YSEALI later this year.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s an opportunity to bring together another remarkable generation of young people.\u00a0 So we\u2019re really, really looking forward to that.\u00a0 And at the same time, there\u2019s a very strong network here in Cambodia, the thousands of Cambodians who are part of the YSEALI network, the 300 or so alumni at this point.\u00a0 But I\u2019m eager to learn from you about your experience with the program but also, especially, the work that you\u2019re doing, the experience you\u2019re having working to help protect the environment, to deal with the challenges that all of our countries face with climate change to build a really sustainable future where people all across Cambodia can provide for themselves, provide for their country.\nI was just \u2013 by the way, I came from a wonderful program that we have with Cambodians who are in the agricultural sector, and I saw some of these remarkable products that we\u2019ve helped build partnerships to produce and export, from cashew nuts to mangos, but done in an environmentally protective way.\u00a0 And all of this is, I think, a tremendous possibility in the future of making sure that we are doing what\u2019s necessary both to protect our planet but also to give our people opportunity.\u00a0 And I know that each of you in different ways is working on that.\u00a0\nSo I\u2019m eager to not talk and really to listen to each of you and to have a conversation.\u00a0 So why don\u2019t I stop there and we can open it up.\nMS GARCIA:\u00a0\u00a0All right.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 Well, to open it up \u2013 oh, I think they want to clap.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Good, good.\u00a0 So to open it up, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Cynthia Chen (ph), who is going to start us off with a brief story about her experience.\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0So good morning, Mr. Secretary, and good morning, Mr. Ambassador, and good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Really, thank you for coming here and (inaudible) with YSEALI.\u00a0 (Inaudible) ambassador working on the topic of fish migration and the chain of water quality and (inaudible) the Mekong River.\u00a0\nBefore YSEALI, I was not doing so good at school, but along the way I did a (inaudible).\u00a0 And I was surrounded by a lot of great people, and they kept telling me that you did a great job and you should apply to YSEALI.\u00a0 But I keep \u2013 I have a certain doubt because of my GPA is only 2.0, and I kept questioning my ability to learn and to grow.\u00a0 But with them to encourage me to apply to YSEALI, and I passed YSEALI, and during the fellowship I actually met with one inspiring woman named Susie Lacey (ph).\u00a0 It\u2019s the best (inaudible).\u00a0 And she said to me, like, the first thing is come and tell us in front of us young people that \u2013 the YSEALI fellows.\u00a0 She said that thank you, and America is glad to have you here, and what you did matters for this generation and the next generation.\nAt the moment I feel, like, awake because really, those things and \u2013 I mean, like, we really have those things as we as Cambodians.\u00a0 And we are young.\u00a0 We are very energetic.\u00a0 And with those support, those acknowledgements, those recognitions, we feel like it helps us to live just like a quarter of (inaudible) say that it\u2019s never too young to live.\nThank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 What you said is really important because \u2013 and it\u2019s especially important for me to hear that because one of the things that happens is as you get older \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 you kind of get more and more set in your ways.\u00a0 Even if you try to have the most open mind possible, we all are the product of our own experiences and what we\u2019ve done.\u00a0 And the most important thing is for all of you, this generation and the generation that will follow you, to make sure that we are thinking in fresh ways and new ways about the challenges we face.\u00a0\nAnd the simple truth is this just because we did something one way for the last 50 years doesn\u2019t mean we need to do it the same way for the next 50 years.\u00a0 So your ability to think anew about things, to look at maybe how we can do something better, and then to challenge all of us who may be in positions of responsibility to do the same thing \u2013 that\u2019s the most important thing.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we make progress.\u00a0 So thank you.\u00a0\nMS GARCIA:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 With that, I would like to invite our friends from the press to please step outside.\n"}, {"url":

Blinken.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good morning, everyone, and it\u2019s wonderful to be with all of you here, to see you all here.\u00a0 Patrick, thank you not just for the introduction but for your remarkable leadership of this mission every single day.\u00a0 And thanks to everyone who\u2019s joined us here today, especially our wonderful colleagues from USAID in our \u2013 in mission after mission around the world, where, as we would say, the rubber really meets the road.\u00a0 It is through our AID missions.\u00a0 They do remarkable work in place after place to create the most powerful connectivity possible between ourselves and our host countries, including here in Cambodia, by bringing to life powerful projects that make a difference in lives and livelihoods and futures.\u00a0\nSo I\u2019m glad to be with our USAID colleagues and our Cambodian partners.\u00a0 I met a few of them just a moment ago, and these are remarkable, dedicated entrepreneurs who are committed not just to their own success but to their country\u2019s success.\u00a0 I got a chance to sample some of the remarkable products that they\u2019re producing with assistance from the United States, and I can tell you firsthand this is good stuff.\u00a0 I happen to be an afficionado of cashews.\u00a0 Well, Cambodia is the number one cashew producer, exporter in the world, and I just tried some very good cashews, wonderful mango products and other things, beautiful vegetables, incredible things that are making a difference in lives.\nSo about 12 years ago, the United States launched an initiative called Cambodia Harvest, and that was part of our flagship global food security program called Feed the Future.\u00a0 The idea behind Feed the Future is that when it comes to chronic food insecurity, food aid is vital but it is not enough.\u00a0 We have the knowhow to improve farming across all climates, across all income levels, so that countries have their enduring capacity to produce their own food.\u00a0 It\u2019s the classic example of the old adage about give a person a fish, feed them for a day; teach them to fish, feed them for a lifetime.\u00a0 Feed the Future is all about that: creating self-sufficiency, creating indigenous productive capacity, investing in that, investing in that future.\u00a0\nWith the right partnerships, countries become more food secure.\u00a0 People\u2019s health improves.\u00a0 Poverty is reduced.\u00a0 The need for food aid itself goes down.\u00a0 Here in Cambodia, our two countries have worked together to increase crop yields, to improve the health of livestock, to promote climate resilience, to train farmers, to create new markets.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeing strong results.\u00a0 So as I met some of the individuals behind the numbers just now, they were kind enough to share some of the work that they\u2019re doing, to share their cashews, their mangos with us.\u00a0 This event is actually a diversion because as we\u2019re doing it, I made sure that my team is taking the wonderful baskets of produce so that we can bring them back with us.\u00a0\nBut it \u2013 in all seriousness, you can see the demonstrable impact of the partnership, and that\u2019s a powerful thing.\u00a0 We often deal in big issues of policy that sometimes are abstractions.\u00a0 It is particularly gratifying to see the tangible results of this partnership between the United States and Cambodia.\nThrough our partnership, Bun Sieng has helped provide technical support to farmers across the country.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for that.\u00a0 Holly Mio\u2019s (ph) team used grants for our program to expand the Dry Food Company internationally.\u00a0 And so we see that resonating around the world, not just here in Cambodia.\u00a0 Dara An built new cashew processing facilities with a Harvest grant.\u00a0 And Sothea Mao runs a food export and distribution business with our support; she signed a deal to distribute a local company\u2019s fruit in Cambodia and beyond.\u00a0 So congratulations for the remarkable work that each of you is doing.\u00a0 We\u2019re proud to be your partners.\nWe want to build on these successes.\u00a0 So today we\u2019re announcing the next phase of our collaboration, and it\u2019s called Harvest III.\u00a0 It will launch next week.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to provide up to $25 million over the next five years.\u00a0 So what will it do?\u00a0 It will continue to help farmers boost their incomes \u2013 for example, by increasing access to tools like greenhouses, which can help lengthen growing seasons, improve the quality of what\u2019s grown, and help products actually meet market standards. \u00a0We want to reach more farmers, especially women and young people, to make sure that they\u2019re reaping the benefits of these investments as well.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll help connect more Cambodian farmers and businesses to markets both here at home and abroad.\u00a0\nMore than 60 percent of Cambodians live in rural areas.\u00a0 You heard the ambassador speak to this.\u00a0 More than three-quarters of those households rely on agriculture, fisheries, or forestry as their main sources of income.\u00a0 Many of these workers have only limited access to markets or financing.\u00a0 We want to change that so that more people can enjoy Cambodian products and more farmers and entrepreneurs can grow their businesses.\u00a0\nWith this new phase, we\u2019re basically expanding our scale.\u00a0 The last stage of our program that was called Harvest II worked in select provinces.\u00a0 Harvest III will be nationwide.\u00a0 Harvest II focused on fruits, vegetables, spices.\u00a0 Harvest III will add grains, fish, other products.\u00a0 We\u2019re almost tripling the amount of grant money available to our partners.\u00a0 We believe in this program.\u00a0 We believe in our partners.\u00a0 And we want to do a lot more good work together.\u00a0\nThe needs are urgent.\u00a0 Far too many Cambodians still live in food insecurity.\u00a0 Far too many Cambodian children are malnourished.\u00a0 As a parent myself, whenever I see this, it goes right to the heart.\u00a0 I think each of us who\u2019s fortunate, when we see a malnourished child, we think \u2013 if we have children, we think of our own.\u00a0 We think of our families.\u00a0 And we want to do everything we possibly can to make sure that no child on Earth is malnourished.\nThis is a humanitarian issue.\u00a0 It\u2019s a health issue. \u00a0It\u2019s an economic issue.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a security issue because widespread hunger makes communities and countries less secure, particularly now when food insecurity around the world is on the rise because of Russia\u2019s war of aggression on Ukraine, which has blocked millions of tons of Ukrainian crops from being shipped to global markets.\u00a0 It\u2019s critical that we strengthen global food security and that we address the root causes of hunger, of malnutrition, and of poverty.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the United States and our partners have been doing in Cambodia and in more than 40 countries where Feed the Future operates.\u00a0\nSo let me say again how grateful we are to all of our partners across Cambodia, like our friends Bun, Holly, Sothea, Dara, who work hard every day to produce food, to grow their businesses as well, to support their families, to contribute to their communities, to share the bounty of Cambodia with people across the country but also around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to be part of your journey.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-indian-external-affairs-minister-subrahmanyam-jaishankar-before-their-meeting/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 Very good to see you all here in New York at the United Nations, and I have to say that I\u2019m very pleased to be here on behalf of the administration, on behalf of the United States to help kickoff a critical 30 days \u2013 the Review Conference for the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nThis has now been in force for 50 years.\u00a0 It\u2019s made a powerful difference to the world in making the world a safer place, making it less dangerous, making sure that countries with nuclear weapons, including the United States, pursue disarmament; making sure that countries that don\u2019t have nuclear weapons do not acquire them by upholding and strengthening nonproliferation; and making sure that countries can engage in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, something that is even more vital as we deal with the challenges posed by climate change.\nThis is a critical moment for the NPT.\u00a0 It\u2019s a challenging one too because different parts of this regime are under challenge.\u00a0 And of course, we see that particularly in the area of nonproliferation when we have challenges being posed by Iran, by North Korea, and now in different ways, by Russia.\nSo the next 30 days, the work that\u2019s being done here by countries around the world to reaffirm the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to strengthen it, to strengthen each one of its pillars \u2013 disarmament, nonproliferation, peaceful use \u2013 is more vital than it\u2019s ever been.\nThe United States will be here in force over the next month.\u00a0 We have about 60 people on our team who will be here every single day working with any and every country around the world that seeks to strengthen this very, very vital regime, a treaty that has made a huge difference over the last 50 years and needs to continue to make a difference over the next 50 years.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Pam, go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much Ned and thank you \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Nice to see you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 It\u2019s Pamala Falk from CBS News.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yes. \u00a0Good to see you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0We heard some pretty dire forecasts this morning from the Secretary General about nuclear annihilation.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Mm-hmm.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0How worried are you about Russia-occupied nuclear plants in Ukraine like Zaporizhzhia \u2013 that doesn\u2019t have supervision \u2013 or Chernobyl?\u00a0 And what is your worst fear about, say, Speaker Pelosi\u2019s trip to China?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, first on Russia and Ukraine, step back for just one second.\u00a0 Recall that when the Soviet Union dissolved, nuclear weapons were left on the territory of three new countries: Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine.\u00a0 Ukraine had the confidence to give up the weapons that it inherited when the Soviet Union dissolved because of commitments that Russia made to respect and protect its sovereignty, its independence, its structural integrity.\u00a0 The fact that Russia has now done exactly the opposite, that it\u2019s attacked Ukraine unprovoked in an effort to erase that sovereignty and independence \u2013 that sends a terrible message to countries around the world that are making decisions about whether or not to pursue nuclear weapons.\u00a0 So just stepping back, it\u2019s usually important to recognize that.\nSecond, and more practically speaking in the immediate, we\u2019re deeply concerned about the fact that Russia has taken over nuclear facilities in Ukraine, particularly in Zaporizhzhia, one of the largest nuclear facilities in Europe.\u00a0 There are credible reports, including in the media today, that Russia is using this plant as the equivalent of a human shield, but a nuclear shield in the sense that it\u2019s firing on Ukrainian from around the plant.\u00a0 And of course, the Ukrainians cannot and will not fire back, lest there be a terrible accident involving a nuclear plant.\u00a0 So this is the height of irresponsibility.\u00a0 It\u2019s vitally important that the IAEA get access to understand what\u2019s happening in these facilities and to make sure that they continue to be used in ways that uphold all of the necessary commitments on safety and security at the plants.\nWith regard to Taiwan, first, the Speaker will make her own decisions about whether or not to visit Taiwan.\u00a0 Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government.\u00a0 The decision is entirely the Speaker\u2019s.\u00a0 What I can say is this: this is very much precedent in the sense that previous speakers visited Taiwan.\u00a0 Many members of Congress go to Taiwan, including this year.\u00a0 And so if the Speaker does decide to visit, and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions, that would be entirely on Beijing.\u00a0 We are looking for them, in the event she decides to visit, to act responsibly and not to engage in any escalation going forward.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 NBC.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The Japanese \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary \u2014\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 NBC, go ahead.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 The Japanese \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Secretary Blinken, on the topic of grain, we know that a ship was able \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Yes.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 \u2014 to leave the port of Odesa today carrying 26,000 (inaudible) of grain across the sea.\u00a0 Can you give us an update on how that\u2019s going?\u00a0 Do you expect more to get out to help the food shortage?\u00a0 And also, is that a sign that tensions might be easing?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So this is a good and important first step.\u00a0 We were pleased to see that the first ship did move.\u00a0 It does have 26-, 27,000 tons of grain, but keep in mind there are something like 20 million tons that are in silos and in storage in Ukraine that\u2019s been held back by the Russian blockade of Odesa up until now, and it needs to get out.\u00a0 It needs to get out to world markets, it needs to get to places where people are in desperate need of food, it needs to get out so that prices also continue to go down, not up.\nThe test will be in the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0 It\u2019s a start, it\u2019s important.\u00a0 I have to say that the leadership of Secretary-General Guterres and the United Nations has been absolutely instrumental in getting us to this day when at least we see the first ship moving.\u00a0 But the test is now really in the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0 More ships need to move, more grain needs to get to market.\u00a0 That\u2019s what will really make a difference.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Reuters, Michelle.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Did you talk to Prime Minister Kishida \u2014\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Reuters \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Michelle Nichols from Reuters.\u00a0 You mentioned this morning that a return to the Iran nuclear deal would be the best outcome for the world.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Iranian officials have signaled a willingness to return to talks.\u00a0 Is the United States ready to return to talks?\u00a0 And has Speaker Pelosi told you she\u2019s stopping in Taiwan tomorrow?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Second part first.\u00a0 We do not know what Speaker Pelosi intends to do, but again, that is entirely her decision, and one that we respect one way or the other.\nSecond, with regard to the JCPOA, we continue to believe, as I said this morning, that that would be the best path forward, a return to compliance on both sides to the JCPOA, to make sure that we are putting Iran\u2019s nuclear program back in a box and averting any kind of crisis.\u00a0 The EU has put forward a best proposal based on many, many months of discussions, negotiations, conversations.\u00a0 It\u2019s very consistent with something that they put forward in March that we agreed to that we would pursue in March, but we \u2013 it remains to be seen whether Iran is willing and able to move forward.\nSo we remain prepared to move forward on the basis of what\u2019s all been agreed.\u00a0 It is still unclear whether Iran is prepared to do that.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a final question right here.\u00a0 Yes.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Sir.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Did you talk to Prime Minister Kishida about Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan?\u00a0 And did you share any concern about it?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 I did not speak to the Prime Minister about that.\u00a0 I did have the opportunity to speak to him briefly this morning simply to say how powerful it is that he\u2019s here on day one of the Non-Proliferation Review Conference.\u00a0 It sends a very strong message around the world.\u00a0 Japan\u2019s commitment to disarmament, to nonproliferation, to the peaceful use of nuclear energy is both as a matter of history and as a matter of Japan\u2019s leadership role in the world vitally important, and I think the Prime Minister sent a very strong message by being here today on day one of the conference.\u00a0 And I just thanked him very much for doing that.\nThank you.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you everyone.\n\n"}, {"url":

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "UN Headquarters", "location": "New York, New York", "date": "August 1, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 Secretary General Guterres, President Zlauvinen \u2013 thank you \u2013 Director General Grossi:\u00a0 Thank you all for your longstanding leadership on nonproliferation.\nI noted that Prime Minister Kishida of Japan is here as well this morning, which sends a very powerful message.\u00a0 Earlier this year, he reaffirmed Japan\u2019s commitment to nonproliferation in a joint statement with President Biden.\nAnd a very special thanks to the foreign ministers, the deputy foreign ministers, the teams who have traveled to New York for these meetings and to get us off to a good start.\nIt\u2019s great to be with you all here in person today, especially \u2013 especially \u2013 given the critical role the NPT has played in upholding the global nonproliferation regime.\nMore than five decades ago, at the height of the Cold War, representatives of 18 nations drafted the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nIn the years that followed, nearly every country on Earth has joined the NPT.\nCountries put safeguards in place to monitor their nuclear programs.\nNuclear weapon states moved toward disarmament, including the United States.\u00a0 The number of nuclear weapons in our stockpile is now nearly 90 percent lower than it was at its height in 1967.\nThe United Nations Security Council affirmed that proliferation constituted a threat to international peace and security.\nEntire regions \u2013 the South Pacific, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Africa \u2013 joined Latin America and the Caribbean in declaring themselves nuclear weapons-free zones.\nAnd we saw countries use nuclear technology safely and peacefully to improve the lives of millions of people on Earth.\nSo there is no question that the NPT has made the world safer.\u00a0 But there\u2019s also no doubt that it\u2019s under increasing strain.\nAnd so we come together at a critical moment.\nThe DPRK continues to expand its unlawful nuclear program and continues its ongoing provocations against the region.\u00a0 As we gather today, Pyongyang is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test.\nIran remains on a path of nuclear escalation.\u00a0 Although it publicly claims to favor return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, since March, Iran has been either unwilling or unable to accept a deal to achieve precisely that goal.\u00a0 Getting back to the JCPOA remains the best outcome \u2013 for the United States, for Iran, for the world.\nIn January, President Biden and the leaders of the other NPT nuclear weapon states \u2013 China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom \u2013 all affirmed the principle that, and I quote, \u201ca nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\u201d\nThe very next month, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 And it\u2019s engaged in reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling, with its president warning those supporting Ukraine\u2019s self-defense, quote, \u201crisk consequences\u2026such as you have never seen in your entire history,\u201d end quote.\nRussia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine is a brazen violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter, and it\u2019s also contrary to the rules-based international order that we all seek to uphold.\u00a0 But critically, and it\u2019s directly relevant to what brings us together this month for the NPT Review Conference, its actions are also contrary to the assurances that it provided to Ukraine in 1994 in the so-called Budapest Memorandum, assurances of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence that were vital to giving Ukraine the confidence to give up the nuclear weapons it inherited when the Soviet Union dissolved and that were left on its territory.\nSo what message does this send to any country around the world that may think that it needs to have nuclear weapons to protect, to defend, to deter aggression against its sovereignty and independence? The worst possible message. And so it\u2019s directly relevant to what\u2019s going on here this month at the United Nations.\nMost recently, we saw Russia\u2019s aggression with its seizure of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest such plant in all of Europe.\u00a0 Russia is now using the plant as a military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can\u2019t and won\u2019t shoot back because they might accidentally strike a nuclear \u2013 a reactor or highly radioactive waste in storage.\u00a0 That brings the notion of having a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level.\nThe United States believes that all nuclear-armed states have a duty to act responsibly.\u00a0 We\u2019ve chosen to act with restraint and avoid actions that could unintentionally add to nuclear tensions \u2013 for example, by forgoing previously scheduled ICBM tests and not raising the alert status of our nuclear forces in response to Russian saber-rattling.\u00a0 There is no place in our world \u2013 no place in our world \u2013 for nuclear deterrence based on coercion, intimidation, or blackmail.\u00a0 We have to stand together in rejecting this.\nTogether with the United Kingdom and France, we\u2019ve released a set of principles and best practices that should be expected of every responsible NPT nuclear weapon state, among them that every effort has to be made to ensure that nuclear weapons are not used again.\nThe United States is committed to reducing the role of nuclear weapons and re-establishing our leadership on arms control, and we\u2019ve undertaken a deliberate policy review toward that goal.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to emphasize strategic stability, seek to avoid costly arms races, facilitate risk reduction and arms control agreements wherever they are possible.\nAny country that asks others to reject the pursuit of nuclear weapons also has to be willing to reduce \u2013 and eventually, eliminate \u2013 their own stockpiles of nuclear weapons.\nPresident Biden\u2019s commitment to disarmament has long been evident.\u00a0 Just two weeks into his term, he extended the New START Treaty with Russia until 2026, and that\u2019s made our countries and our world safer by preserving verified restrictions on our strategic nuclear arsenals and avoiding an arms race.\u00a0 Earlier today, he reiterated his readiness to negotiate expeditiously a framework to replace New START, if Russia is prepared to operate in good faith.\nWe continue to adhere to our policy not to use \u2013 or threaten to use \u2013 nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states that are party to the NPT and are in compliance with their nuclear nonproliferation obligations.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll continue to implement, to the fullest extent possible, the commitments contained in the final documents of previous NPT Review Conferences.\nAnd as long as nuclear weapons exist, the fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attacks on the United States, on our allies, and partners.\u00a0 The United States would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States, its allies, and partners.\nAt this Review Conference, we hope to make tangible progress on all three pillars of the NPT \u2013 nonproliferation, disarmament, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy \u2013 and we\u2019ll work with all states parties to a successful outcome.\nThe world must reject the spread of nuclear weapons.\nThat starts with demanding compliance by all NPT state parties, ensuring we have safeguards in place to monitor ourselves, strengthening the IAEA\u2019s ability to implement those safeguards.\u00a0 We\u2019re encouraging states to adopt a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and an Additional Protocol, which will represent together the most rigorous standard of verification.\nIf any NPT state party does pursue nuclear weapons, we have to act as one to bring them back into compliance.\nEven as we verify that countries are not using their nuclear programs to pursue nuclear weapons, we also have to ensure that the programs are safe and secure.\nI commend Director General Grossi for his work promoting the safety and security of existing facilities, and especially for all that he\u2019s done to help prevent a nuclear catastrophe in Ukraine.\nThis Review Conference is also an invaluable opportunity to discuss how to reduce the risk of nuclear conflict and the chance of miscommunication during a crisis.\nThe United States is committed to pursuing a comprehensive risk reduction package, including creating secure communications channels among nuclear weapon states.\u00a0 We stand ready to work with all partners, including China and others, on risk reduction and strategic stability efforts.\nAs we look to the future, we also have to strengthen agreements preventing nuclear conflict \u2013 and create new ones.\nTo cap the growth of nuclear arsenals anywhere in the world, we continue to support the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty.\u00a0 We also stand ready to begin working with partners to restart negotiations this year on the long delayed Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty.\nFinally, we remain focused on enhancing the peaceful uses of nuclear technology.\nNuclear energy technologies are helping the world to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and fight the climate crisis, giving farmers new tools to boost crop yields and tackle global food insecurity, improving our ability to screen for dangerous diseases, and preventing the next pandemic.\nThe United States wants to expand access to these essential benefits for NPT states parties.\nTogether with the United Kingdom, we\u2019re launching the Sustained Dialogue on Peaceful Uses to find new ways to use peaceful nuclear energy technology to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe\u2019re also supporting clean energy innovations \u2013 like small nuclear reactors \u2013 to combat climate change, ensure reliable access to nuclear power.\u00a0 At the G7 Leaders\u2019 Summit in Germany just last month, President Biden announced $14 million in funding to support the deployment of small modular reactor power plants in Romania, which will provide zero-emissions nuclear energy.\nNow, some have asked about our new partnership with the United Kingdom and Australia, known as AUKUS.\u00a0 Through this partnership, Australia will acquire submarines.\u00a0 I want to emphasize that these submarines will be nuclear powered, not nuclear armed.\u00a0 Other countries have this kind of submarine.\u00a0 And these will adhere to the highest safety and nonproliferation standards under the NPT.\u00a0 We\u2019re working very closely with the IAEA to make sure that that\u2019s the case.\nAs we work together across the three pillars of the NPT, we build upon the efforts of so many who have come before us in this room.\nLast month, we lost one of those leaders: former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was deeply committed to nuclear nonproliferation throughout his career.\nIn 2016, Prime Minister Abe and President Obama made an historic visit to Hiroshima together \u2013 a place that represents the enormous destruction that nuclear weapons make possible.\nThere, President Obama said \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cWe must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them,\u201d end quote.\nPrime Minister Abe said this: \u201cWe are determined to realize a world free of nuclear weapons. No matter how long or how difficult the road [may] be.\u201d\nThat has to remain the charge for each of us here \u2013 to escape the logic of fear and live up to our responsibility to prevent nuclear conflict, to reduce nuclear weapons, to secure nuclear technologies, to advance peace and progress around the world.\nThank you very much.\n(Applause.)\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-before-his-meeting-with-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty-npt-non-nuclear-states-parties-on-the-margins-of-the-npt-review-conference/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken and Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo, Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa, and Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry Hagiuda Koichi at a Joint Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Dean Acheson Auditorium", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "July 29, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 So we just concluded the inaugural meeting of the new U.S.-Japan Economic Consultative Committee, otherwise known as the EPCC or \u201cepic.\u201d\u00a0 Secretary Raimondo and I were very glad to welcome our colleagues here to Washington today.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Hayashi and I saw each other just a few weeks ago in Bali for the G20 and then in Tokyo, where I had the opportunity to convey the profound sympathy and sorrow of the American people to the people of Japan after the assassination of Prime Minister Abe.\nAs you may know, the EPCC was a product of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s meeting in January, their first major talk after the prime minister took office last fall.\u00a0 They agreed that the U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger or more necessary and that our countries should deepen our cooperation to strengthen the rules-based economic order to address urgent challenges facing our workers, our businesses, people, and accelerate open, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.\nToday\u2019s first meeting of the EPCC was, I think it\u2019s fair to say, a resounding success: productive, substantive, directly connected to issues that matter in our peoples\u2019 lives and in their futures.\u00a0 We discussed building resilient supply chains after the COVID-19 pandemic revealed just how fragile they are.\u00a0 We addressed emerging technologies which bring so much promise of opportunity but also risks to national security, human rights, consumer health and safety, intellectual property.\nWe talked about Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine.\u00a0 Our countries are working closely to impose costs on Russia so that President Putin will end the war and address, of course, in the meantime food and fuel prices worldwide that have been spiked in part because of Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 We discussed development finance and the problem of opaque lending practices that can weigh down countries with unsustainable debt.\nAnd we addressed the People\u2019s Republic of China and how its coercive economic practices go against an open, inclusive rules-based international economic order that gives all countries a chance to participate, to compete, and to grow.\u00a0 Japan and the United States believe in a global economy where all countries hold themselves to norms, to standards, to practices that allow people, ideas, goods, capital to move freely; where disputes are resolved swiftly, peacefully, openly; and where trade and commerce support workers, raise incomes, protect the environment, and create opportunity for as many people as possible.\u00a0 The EPCC is the latest addition to an ever growing partnership with Japan.\nA few months ago in Tokyo, our two countries joined 12 others to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to support a stronger, fair, more resilient economy across the region.\u00a0 Our countries work together through the Quad with India and Australia on issues from global health to the climate crisis to infrastructure.\u00a0 We cooperate through the OECD to tackle bribery and corruption, through the Global Action Plan to fight COVID-19, through the new Mineral Security Partnership to bolster critical mineral supply chains.\nAnd beyond all of these different initiatives and fora, the bilateral relationship between Japan and the United States encompasses just about every issue we face, from protecting our national security, to defending human rights, to advancing our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 The work that we did today, making clear together that our economic security is a vital component of our overall national security and well-being, I think just underscores the importance and the breadth and depth of our partnership.\nWe are deeply grateful for our alliance with Japan.\u00a0 It stretches back decades, sustained by cherished ties of family and friendship between our peoples.\u00a0 The work we did here today reflects the strength of that partnership but also importantly carries it forward.\nOn a separate note, earlier today I spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.\u00a0 We had a frank and direct conversation.\u00a0 I pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.\u00a0 I also emphasized that the world expects Russia to fulfill its commitments under the deal it reached with Ukraine, Turkey, and the United Nations on grain shipments from Ukraine.\u00a0 Ambassador Brink, our ambassador to Ukraine, was in Odessa this morning.\u00a0 She confirmed that the ships are loaded and ready to go.\u00a0 It is important and vital that Russia make good on the commitments it\u2019s made \u2013 made to the world.\u00a0 As I made clear, we\u2019re looking to see that move forward as soon as possible.\nI also made clear to Foreign Minister Lavrov that in light of recent statements coming from the Kremlin about their plans to proceed with the further annexation of Ukrainian territory \u2013 indeed, the foreign minister\u2019s own words about replacing democratically elected Ukrainian Government as well as being part of their ongoing plans \u2013 those plans would never be accepted.\u00a0 The world will not recognize annexations.\nWe will impose additional significant costs on Russia if it moves forward with its plans.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also continue to stand with Ukraine, support its ability to defend itself, impose costs on Russia until it ends its aggression.\u00a0 We continue to coordinate closely with allies and partners, including very closely with Japan, to support Ukraine and to hold Moscow to account.\u00a0 And as always, we\u2019re prepared to work with Ukraine and others to support any meaningful diplomatic efforts to end the war, to end the aggression.\nSo with that, let me just thank my colleagues so much for an incredibly productive meeting and for designing together the way ahead and to make sure that the EPCC really is an epic achievement between our countries.\u00a0 Thank you.\nYoshi.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Hello, everyone.\u00a0 This is my very first visit to Washington, D.C., as a minister of foreign affairs.\u00a0 First, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude for President Biden, Secretary Blinken, and many people from the United States Government for your deepest condolences for the passing of former Prime Minister Abe.\u00a0 I would like to thank the thoughts extended by the people in the United States.\nWe have just come out of the very first ministerial-level Economic 2+2 with Secretary Blinken, Secretary Raimondo, and Minister Hagiuda.\u00a0 We had a very fruitful exchange of thoughts.\u00a0 I would like again to thank both secretaries for their wonderful hospitality.\u00a0 The Economic 2+2 is the first attempt in the alliance of Japan and the United States to discuss foreign and security policy and economic policy as a unit.\u00a0 In a background, there is a shared urgency between Japan and the United States that existing international order is challenged not only by unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force, but also by attempt to realize strategic interest by exerting economic influence in unfair and opaque ways.\nIn order to respond to such crisis effectively, today four ministers from Japan and the United States gathered and discussed a wide variety of issues, including economic policies of respective countries, establishment of regional economic order, and economic security.\u00a0 This is the response to the requirement of time, and I believe it serves as a strong message about the adaptability of Japan-U.S. alliance in a rapidly changing international economy and about the resolve by Japan and United States to lead the international cooperation in this area.\nToday we discussed the following points and confirmed on the cooperation.\u00a0 First, we discussed a rules-based, free, and open international order.\u00a0 As the economy has a strong influence on diplomacy today, Japan and the United States confirmed that we would cooperate with likeminded countries not only from the economic perspective but also from a strategic perspective in order to maintain and develop international order to ensure economic security.\nRegarding energy security and food security, we discussed assistance to those countries that are gravely impacted by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\nAlso I expressed Japan\u2019s support of IPEF and as the United States plays more active role in economic order of the Indo-Pacific region, and conveyed my strong hope to both secretaries that the United States come back to TPP soon.\nSecond, we discussed response to the exertion of international economic influence to hinder \u2013 sorry, intentional economic influence to hinder solidarity in the international community, and to distort foreign policies of different countries and confirmed on a shared awareness.\u00a0 Economic coercion issue was also taken up by G7 Elmau summit, and I hope to deepen the discussion towards the G7 Hiroshima summit.\nAlso, regarding the unfair and opaque development finance, I hope that Japan and the United States can work together to ensure all countries comply to the international rules and standards.\nIn addition, we agreed that for Japan and the United States to ensure our own competitiveness and resilience, we will continue to promote cooperation based on core partnership that was concurred in April last year.\u00a0 We also agreed to establish stronger supply chain cooperating with likeminded countries.\nI would like to reiterate that we are not pursuing protectionism or bloc economy, but any policy will give due consideration to transparency and predictability for businesses.\u00a0 I hope that we can continue to deepen our discussion in various related areas with likeminded countries, taking opportunities of occasion such as G7, chaired by Japan, and APEC, chaired by the United States.\u00a0 We have agreed to hold the ministerial meeting on a regular basis, and I look forward to our next meeting.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, good afternoon, and thank you to Secretary Blinken for hosting us, bringing us together.\u00a0 And thank you to Ministers Hagiuda and Hayashi for joining us and for being present here in the United States for this very important meeting.\u00a0 I also would like to join with Tony in expressing my condolences to our colleagues and to the people of Japan for the tragic loss of Prime Minister Abe.\nSo I share the assessment with Secretary Blinken that today\u2019s meeting was a resounding success.\u00a0 We had candid, productive, open, substantive discussion, and I\u2019m very proud of the joint progress on promoting economic growth, addressing threats to the global order, and enhancing security and resilience.\nThe close ties between the United States and Japan support good jobs in both of our countries and contribute to our mutual prosperity and security.\u00a0 Our alliance is an increasingly important force for peace and prosperity not only in the Indo-Pacific region but, in fact, throughout the world.\nI also want to acknowledge how deeply grateful I am that Congress yesterday finally approved funding for the CHIPS Act.\u00a0 As we discussed today, semiconductors are the linchpin of our economic and national security, and we had an excellent discussion today around how Japan and the United States could collaborate, especially with respect to advanced semiconductors.\u00a0 The $52 billion investment in the CHIPS Act in domestic semiconductor production will enable us to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States, rebuild American manufacturing, and strengthen our supply chain for decades to come.\nJust as important, this funding will strengthen our partnerships with allies like Japan.\u00a0 It will enhance our joint work on supply chains, promote the competitiveness of both of our nations, and importantly, make us less dependent on our adversaries for such a critical piece of technology.\u00a0 It will build on \u2013 excuse me.\u00a0 Just as importantly, the funding will strengthen our partnerships and will build on the meeting that Minister Hagiuda and I had in May, where we expressed shared intent for cooperation on semiconductor supply chains.\nI look forward to the day, not too far from now, where here in America we have American-made chips supplying Japanese auto plants here in the United States.\u00a0 Together our two nations are leading the way in investing in our futures.\u00a0 So again, I just want to thank Minister Hagiuda and Minister Hayashi for joining us.\u00a0 Thank you for your efforts to forge new and stronger bonds between our nations, our communities, and our people.\nMINISTER HAGIUDA:\u00a0(Via interpreter) I am Hagiuda Koichi, Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry.\u00a0 First I express also my gratitude to American people for sending heartfelt condolences to former Prime Minister Abe.\u00a0 Japan-U.S. alliance is a cornerstone of Japan\u2019s diplomacy.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Abe has always said so.\u00a0 On his historic visit to Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor with President Obama, I also accompanied them as then-deputy chief cabinet secretary.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Abe has staked his political life throughout, while making Japan-U.S. people\u2019s ties stronger.\nPresident Biden came to Japanese Embassy to express condolences.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken came to Japan, and Secretary Raimondo gave us a heartfelt message.\u00a0 I understand within the United States, flag was hoisted half-mast at many places, not only government buildings.\u00a0 It shows deep ties at people\u2019s level between our two countries.\u00a0 In place of former Prime Minister Abe, I sincerely express my gratitude from the bottom of our heart.\n\u201cJapan is back,\u201d Prime Minister Abe declared in Washington about 10 years ago.\u00a0 Japan will once again exert leadership with the United States, the champion of democracy, hand in hand for peace and prosperity of the world.\u00a0 So the determination was expressed in CPTPP, free and open Indo-Pacific, Quad, over a decade that its foundation underpinning peace and prosperity of the region was built.\u00a0 State Secretary Blinken the other day said he feels such a loss.\u00a0 Frankly, entire Japan is covered with a big sense of loss.\nHowever, Japan is here to stay.\u00a0 Going forward, Japan will work hand in hand with the United States and work toward peace and prosperity of the world.\u00a0 To clearly state our determination to you, I came here.\u00a0 Today, for the very first time, Economic 2+2 was held.\u00a0 The framework has been laid down.\u00a0 Supply chain risk, economic coercion, foreign security policy, and economic policy have become inseparable.\u00a0 Under such an era, Japan-U.S. foreign and economic ministers are meeting together, having a intensive discussion and sending the unified messages to the world.\u00a0 Its significance is very large.\nTo address new challenges such as digital, a new economic order based on rules will be built under U.S. administration\u2019s leadership with wide participation of countries in the region.\u00a0 We welcome that new economic architecture is being built at the IPEF.\u00a0 Energy secretary, business and human rights, developing trusted infrastructure such as information communication, supply chain resilience such as batteries and critical minerals and such and such \u2013 there are heaps of issues out there to be tackled.\nThis time, alongside a joint statement, plan of action on specific items was also released.\u00a0 This is a big outcome.\u00a0 In critical and emerging technologies like space, ocean, and cyber cooperation will be strengthened, and economic security will be ensured.\u00a0 Today, substantial time was spent on these topics for discussion.\u00a0 Issues will be dealt with in an offensive way as well as defensive way at the same time; combined with protection with export control, advanced technology development will be promoted.\nWe concurred to accelerate the Japan-U.S. joint development over next-generation semi-conductors.\u00a0 Japan will quickly move to action.\u00a0 Japan\u2019s wisdom will be collected from AIST, RIKEN, and University of Tokyo own research on next-generation semiconductor research.\u00a0 Decision was made to launch a new R&D organization.\u00a0 It will be open to overseas businesses and to research institutes.\u00a0 It will be an international joint research hub.\u00a0 We are determined to collect the strength of Japan, science and technology-based nation, and lead a cooperation between Japan and the United States and among likeminded countries.\u00a0 Unilateral use of economic force in violation of international rules to fulfill diplomatic demand should never happen.\nFrom the Pacific Ocean to Indian Ocean, this wide expanse of ocean and sky is free and open to anyone.\u00a0 Regardless of the size of the country, it should bring benefit to all the countries.\u00a0 This economic 2+2 is, as it were, compass for realizing free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 This is a foundation for peace and prosperity of the region.\u00a0 Toward that end, together with Commerce Secretary Raimondo, State Secretary Blinken, and Foreign Minister Hayashi, who are all here, I am determined to do my best.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll now turn to questions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll alternate two per side.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Good afternoon.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, could I begin by following up on your remarks about your conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov?\u00a0 How confident are you about this raising the chances of bringing home Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan?\u00a0 What is the sense that you got from Foreign Minister Lavrov?\u00a0 I know also you mentioned earlier this week that you\u2019re not planning to negotiate on Ukraine with the Russians, but what was the overall sense that you got from Foreign Minister Lavrov?\u00a0 Are you any more confident that the United States could be dealing with Russia and making progress in any area there?\u00a0 And do you plan to speak to him again or even meet him?\u00a0 As was announced today, you\u2019re going to be in Cambodia next week for ASEAN.\nAnd perhaps, if I could open up to everybody here \u2013 a week of phone calls, I suppose.\u00a0 The phone call yesterday that the President had with President Xi of China, does this \u2013 do you feel that this makes any progress on the issue of Taiwan?\u00a0 How concerned are you about the tensions in Taiwan right now, and a potential visit by Speaker Pelosi.\u00a0 Do you think that \u2013 are you confident that that\u2019s something that you can work through or are you worried about that aggravating the situation?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Shaun, thank you very much.\u00a0 First, just to put this in perspective, we said all along that if we thought there was any opportunity to advance diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, we would of course take it.\u00a0 Unfortunately, tragically, we\u2019ve seen no opening, willingness on the part of Russia to engage meaningfully on ending the aggression.\u00a0 At the same time, I\u2019ve also said that if there are issues where it could make a difference in senior Russians hearing directly from me or from colleagues, we would of course pursue that.\nAnd with regard to the call with the foreign minister today, as I noted the other day when we had an opportunity to speak, I told you what I intended to raise with him, and I raised exactly what I said I would raise with him \u2013 that is, the significant proposal that\u2019s been on the table for some weeks now that would lead to bringing home Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.\u00a0 I urged Foreign Minister Lavrov to move forward with that proposal.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to characterize his response, and I can\u2019t give you an assessment of whether I think things are any more or less likely, but it was important that he heard directly from me on that.\nSecond, as I said the other day, on behalf of many, many countries around the world, getting Russia to move on the commitments it\u2019s made \u2013 not just to the United Nations, Turkey, and Ukraine in the context of the deal that was agreed, but to the entire world that is looking for an end to the blockade of the Odessa port by Russia that has denied so many people the food that they need and depend on and has also resulted in a significant increase in food prices over many months \u2013 important that he hear directly from me on behalf of many other countries the expectation that Russia would move forward with its commitments and would stop, end the blockade, and allow the ships to sail.\nAnd finally, you\u2019ve heard me say the other day the deep concern that many countries around the world have in hearing in recent days about Russia\u2019s expanded war aims in Ukraine, particularly their plans to proceed with the annexation of additional Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 And I laid out exactly what we anticipate they will do in the weeks and months ahead \u2013 including having sham referendums in these parts of Ukraine, trying to falsely demonstrate that the people in these parts of Ukraine somehow seek to become part of Russia \u2013 all to advance President Putin\u2019s objectives in gobbling up as much Ukrainian territory as he can and, from his perspective, trying to erase Ukraine as an independent, sovereign country.\nThat of course is not going to happen.\u00a0 The Ukrainian people have made clear that that\u2019s not going to happen, and the world has made clear they\u2019re not going to let that happen.\u00a0 But short of that, President Putin is trying to grab as much Ukrainian territory as he can, and it was very important that the Russians hear directly from us that that will not be accepted \u2013 and not only will it not be accepted; it will result in additional significant costs being imposed upon Russia if it follows through on those plans.\nSo I don\u2019t want to characterize any of Foreign Minister Lavrov\u2019s responses.\u00a0 If you have an opportunity to ask him, please proceed.\nWith regard to the call between President Biden and President Xi, first, as you know, this followed previous discussions, including most recently in March, and it also builds on a number of recent engagements, including the time I spent with Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bali where we spent about five hours together.\u00a0 The National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the Secretary of Defense, the Treasury Secretary, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have each had recent conversations or engagements with their counterparts.\u00a0 And this is part of our effort to make sure that we maintain and deepen lines of communication with China to responsibly manage the many differences that we have and to work together wherever it is that our interests align.\u00a0 And that was very much the nature of the conversation.\nI can just say, again, it covered basically three things: where our two countries can work together, with a particular focus on climate change, on health security, on counternarcotics; second, an exchange of views on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine; and finally, Taiwan, where President Biden underscored that our policy has not changed.\u00a0 The United States strongly opposes any unilateral efforts to change the status quo or to undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 So that was the nature and basically the substance of the conversation they had.\u00a0 They touched on a number of other issues.\nBut look, I\u2019ll just say this in conclusion.\u00a0 We have many differences when it comes to Taiwan, but over the past 40-plus years, we have managed those differences and done it in a way that has preserved peace and stability and has allowed the people on Taiwan to flourish.\u00a0 It would be important as part of our shared responsibility to continue to manage this in a wise way that doesn\u2019t create the prospect for conflict.\u00a0 And keeping open lines of communication on this issue, especially between President Biden and President Xi, I think is vital to doing that.\u00a0 We believe direct communication between the leaders is the most essential aspect of meeting our responsibilities to manage issues as fraught as Taiwan in the most responsible way possible.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Mr. Matsuura from Kyodo.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you very much for the opportunity.\u00a0 This is Matsuura.\u00a0 This is a question to Minister Hayashi and Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Looking back at the history of Japan-U.S. relations, it was in 1990 that Security 2+2 was upgraded to the ministerial level.\u00a0 Today 2+2 has been expanded to economic area, and the Japan-U.S. alliance has come to the new stage.\u00a0 On the other hand, in the international community China is attempting to widely broaden its influence, leveraging its economic power.\u00a0 So what is the significance of Japan and the United States coming together to try and maintain and strengthen the economic order?\u00a0 Also, how do you plan to build on today\u2019s discussion in G7 and with ASEAN, as they have a strong economic tie with China?\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) First of all, Japan and the U.S. have been working together in solidarity to make sure that unilateral attempt to change status quo would not be allowed in the international community.\u00a0 On the other hand, as I said at the outset, for Japan and U.S. to effectively respond to the unfair and opaque use of economic influence, it is necessary to think about diplomacy, security, and economy as a unit.\u00a0 In particular, since the United States and Japan are number one and two democratic economies in the world, it would be beneficial for us to discuss strategically about the policies to be implemented in such situation.\u00a0 Economic 2+2 is here to respond to this kind of requirement of this era, and to demonstrate that the alliance can adapt to the changes in the international environment.\nBased on today\u2019s Economic 2+2 discussion, the Governments of Japan and the United States will promote cooperation in various area and work to maintain and develop orders in the international community, including Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 Also, for forming international economic order, not only cooperation between Japan and United States, but also cooperation with likeminded countries is essential.\u00a0 We hope to share strategic cooperation and issues that we discussed today at Economic 2+2 with the G7 countries in the summit chaired by Japan next year so that we can further expand the cooperation.\nAlso, regarding the relationship with ASEAN, Japan and the United States have always respected the unity and centrality of ASEAN while promoting concrete cooperation towards achievement of free and open Indo-Pacific and ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 We will continue to closely cooperate with regional partners, aiming to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth in Indo-Pacific region and economic security that we discussed today during the Economic 2+2 and also by utilizing framework such as IPEF by the United States.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0I agree with everything that my colleague has said.\u00a0 I would simply add a couple of points or reinforce a couple of points.\u00a0 First, the United States and Japan share a conviction that economic security and national security are inseparable.\u00a0 They are fundamentally linked.\u00a0 And I think it was very important to both of us and our \u2013 all of our colleagues to further elevate the discussions we\u2019re having on economic security issues because they\u2019re really front and center on our agenda and on the world\u2019s agenda and the very \u2013 the issues that you heard us talk about today I think really go to in many ways very practical things that our people in Japan and the United States and beyond are feeling and experiencing in their lives.\u00a0 And we have a shared conviction that working together we can make a genuine difference in advancing opportunity and dealing with challenges to the wellbeing of our people in the economic sphere.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the most important thing.\nSecond, I would simply say that many of the initiatives that we\u2019re engaged in together, whether it\u2019s between the United States and Japan, whether it\u2019s in the context of ASEAN, IPEF, the Quad; these are mutually reinforcing.\u00a0 And they in affect add strength to each other, and I think we saw that today because many of the things that we talked about overlap with issues that are on the agenda of IPEF, the Quad, et cetera.\u00a0 When the United States and Japan can work together to help drive some of these issues \u2013 and next year, as you know, Japan will be in the lead of the G7 \u2013 we will be in the lead of APEC \u2013 we can make a big, big difference in actually moving forward.\nThe last thing is this: we get to stand up here and share with all of you the results of our meeting.\u00a0 The truth of the matter is, there are a number of people who are sitting with us today and others who are back in their ministries in Tokyo and here in Washington, who really drive the work every single day.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve agreed that we will meet again among the four of us next year, but in\u2011between then we\u2019ve laid out a very detailed and concrete agenda for our teams to follow up on between now and the end of the year and then into next year so that not only have we set out a basic vision together and framework for the work that our countries can do; we\u2019ll actually follow up with concrete initiatives to make all of this real.\u00a0 So I think that\u2019s the other importance of today, an agreement that we\u2019re really going to drive this forward together over the next months.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Hi, thank you for doing this.\u00a0 Mr. Foreign Minister, I wonder \u2013 starting on Taiwan, is the Japanese Government making any contingency planning from a security perspective for a potential crisis in the near term, whether that would be prompted by a visit from Speaker Pelosi or some other visit?\u00a0 And does the Japanese Government envision a role for the G7 to intervene with any economic leverage to deter or mitigate the risk of escalation in such a crisis?\nSecretary Raimondo, you\u2019ve spoken before about the Russian military being forced to strip semiconductors from kitchen appliances in Ukraine.\u00a0 Do you have any sense of whether those supply constraints that they have are imposing a time limit on their military operations there?\u00a0 And more generally, do you see that being applicable in a \u2013 with respect to China in a crisis or even on the other foot, does the U.S. have sufficient semiconductor supplies to see it through a Taiwan crisis in the near term?\nAnd then to Secretary Blinken, the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan Carrier Striker is in the South China Sea, but there\u2019s been a lot of ink spilled on the vulnerability of the surface fleet if there were a crisis with China.\u00a0 Are you having any conversations about a near term prepositioning of defense assets and \u2013 with Japan or other allies in the region next week?\nThank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0(Via interpreter) Thank you for your question.\u00a0 Regarding the visit by Speaker Pelosi, as a \u2013 we are not in the position as the Japanese Government to comment on that.\u00a0 Now, going on to \u2013 between Japan and the U.S. in May in a summit at the Joint Declaration regarding Taiwan, the basic approach to Taiwan has not been changed.\u00a0 It \u2013 Taiwan Strait peace and prosperity is important \u2013 remains the same.\u00a0 And a peaceful resolution of the Strait issue has been agreed upon between the leaders.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 With respect to the export controls, we have reason to believe that with each passing week and month, the export controls have an even more devastating effect on Russia\u2019s ability to continue this war.\u00a0 As the \u2013 they developed a stockpile in preparation for the war for these sorts of technology and spare parts.\u00a0 As that continues to dwindle, their ability to continue to operate is reduced significantly.\nI will say the reason that these export controls are having such an effect is because we\u2019re doing them in coordination with our allies, first among them the Japanese.\u00a0 I mean, this isn\u2019t the United States acting alone; we have a coalition of 36 countries.\u00a0 Japan stepped up immediately.\u00a0 And together, we are denying Russia parts, including semiconductors, and importantly, as we discussed today, collaborating on enforcement.\u00a0 And we will continue to collaborate on enforcement to continue to deny Russia what it needs to continue this war.\nWith respect to the United States, I have no concern that we have an ability to meet our needs.\u00a0 And furthermore, the fact that Congress acted yesterday on the CHIPS Act is an enormous step forward to ensure that we\u2019ll be able to protect ourselves and our allies and have adequate semiconductor supplies for decades to come.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And with regard to any contingencies and any preparations made on a military level, I defer to the Pentagon.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Well, I have a question to both Minister Hagiuda and Secretary Raimondo.\u00a0 Well, economically, competition can take place and it might develop into a trade friction \u2013 it had happened in the past.\u00a0 But what do you think about the alliance relationship covering the economic area?\u00a0 And what are you thinking about further strengthening the semiconductor supply chain?\u00a0 What will be the future state of cooperation between Japan and U.S., particularly in the semiconductor?\u00a0 And also, do you have a plan to widen the framework between the Japan and the United States?\nMINISTER HAGIUDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Thank you for your question.\u00a0 Well, when you talk about competition, it should be based on the free and fair rules.\u00a0 Then it can drive economic growth and can be a source of vitality.\u00a0 We are the world\u2019s number one and number three economic power.\u00a0 Japan and U.S. will work closely, encouraging each other and enhance competitiveness and grow together.\nOn the other hand, problems have come about that there are conduct which might threaten economic order or free and fair rules.\u00a0 Sometimes one country may use force of superiority over supply chain to their advantage.\u00a0 Economic coercion violating international rule is totally unacceptable.\u00a0 Freedom, democracy, basic human rights, rule of law \u2013 these are the universal values we share together between our two countries.\u00a0 We need to keep on adhering to the economic order based on the rule.\u00a0 We are always looking for a level playing field in terms of the competition so that a region of peace and prosperity\u2019s foundation can be laid down.\u00a0 That is a big responsibility incumbent upon the two countries.\nNext-generation semiconductor technology development would determine the future and show competitiveness \u2013 top priority area for cooperation.\u00a0 Leaders\u2019 summit in May had agreed to have a joint task force on the research and development of next-generation semiconductor research.\u00a0 Already met last month.\u00a0 And together with Secretary Raimondo, we agreed on the basic principle for the cooperation on semiconductor.\u00a0 We will work with likeminded countries to expand our cooperation toward a 2020s realization of R&D on the next-generation semiconductors, HRD, and supply chain resilience.\u00a0 We are going to put that into action.\nWe will look into the future implementation R&D.\u00a0 As I said, AIST, RIKEN, and University of Tokyo will offer their expertise in the next-generation semiconductor research.\u00a0 Wisdom will be collected to launch a new R&D organization.\u00a0 It will be made open to overseas businesses and research institutes, inclusive of Japan, U.S., and likeminded countries in the region.\u00a0 We hope to make into a hub for the international joint research.\nRight before this press conference, I had a bilateral with Secretary Raimondo, and thanks to her effort, CHIPS Act have passed in the United States.\u00a0 It\u2019s epoch-making.\u00a0\u00a0 And there is going to be a way where further commitment can be made on both public and private side.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Extremely well said by my colleague.\u00a0 I concur with everything he said.\u00a0 I would simply underscore two points.\nOne, in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which we have launched and \u2013 with Japan and a dozen other economies in the Indo-Pacific, there is a pillar focused on supply chains, and we expect that a core piece of work in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework in supply chains will be focused on semiconductors, aligning research and development, coordinating on export controls, working together.\nSecondly, after the passage of the CHIPS Act, our goal now \u2013 the Department of Commerce will be implementing the CHIPS Act with the goal of rebuilding the entire semiconductor supply chain in America, and we welcome Japanese foreign direct investment into the United States as we develop that supply chain.\u00a0 Specifically in the areas of chemicals and substrates, materials, the Japanese are world leaders \u2013 tooling \u2013 and we look forward to \u2013 and as the minister said, research and development in emerging technology.\u00a0 It\u2019s impossible to overstate the significance of Congress\u2019s action yesterday and the opportunity for collaboration that that opens for the United States and Japan to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 That concludes the press conference.\u00a0 Thank you, Your Excellencies.\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\n\n"},

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "U.S.-Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee", "location": "Benjamin Franklin Room Washington, D.C.", "date": "July 29, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Well, good morning everyone.\u00a0 Ministers Hayashi, Hagiuda, Secretary Raimondo, it\u2019s wonderful to welcome each of you here to the State Department.\u00a0 And Gina and I are delighted to welcome you to Washington for what is the inaugural meeting of the U.S.-Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee.\nEarlier this year when President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida announced the creation of the EPCC \u2013 appropriately, \u201cepic,\u201d as we call it \u2013 this was a reflection of the strength of our two countries\u2019 economic relationship and partnership, Japan\u2019s and America\u2019s leadership in the global economy, and the seriousness of the economic challenges facing our workers, our businesses, our people.\u00a0 As the world\u2019s first and third largest economies, it is critical that we work together to defend a rules-based international economic order, one in which all countries can participate, compete, and prosper.\nRecent events in the world \u2013 around the world prove how necessary this new gathering is.\u00a0 COVID-19 has revealed the vulnerability of critical supply chains.\u00a0 A growing number of countries struggle with debt burdens due to unsustainable and nontransparent lending practices.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, its blockade of the Port of Odessa has caused a spike in global food prices and fuel prices as well.\u00a0 The coercive and retaliatory economic practices of the People\u2019s Republic of China force countries into choices that compromise their security, their intellectual property, their economic independence.\u00a0 These and other challenges call for our two countries to work together even more closely on economic matters.\u00a0 This has always been a key element of our bilateral relationship, and with EPCC we will make our cooperation in this arena even stronger.\nThe EPCC also complements the work of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which our two countries launched with 12 others in Tokyo this spring to create a stronger, fairer, more resilient economy across the entire Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 Our conversations today and in the weeks ahead \u2013 and by the way, in the weeks ahead will also be leading to Japan assuming the leadership of the G7, the United States APEC next year \u2013 but all of these conversations, including through EPCC, will address our shared priorities, including securing critical infrastructure, building better supply lines and supply chains, shaping emerging technologies so that they deliver opportunity without undermining our security or, for that matter, our values.\nOn these issues and more, we will advance our shared vision of a open, inclusive, sustainable economic growth rooted in the rules-based international order.\u00a0 Ultimately, our cooperation will help move us closer to a future in which trade and commerce support workers, create incomes, create opportunity where countries are secure from coercion and aggression, where people, ideas, goods, and capital move freely, where universal human rights are respected, and countries and people can forge their own paths.\u00a0 Japan and the United States both share that vision.\n(Off-mike.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Tony.\u00a0 (Off-mike.)\n(Via interpreter) I would like to thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo for hosting.\u00a0 Currently Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine poses a serious challenge to the international order, but we must never allow unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force.\n(Interruption.)\n(Via interpreter) It is a powerful indication of the close collaboration between Japan and the United States that the first ministerial meeting of the Japan-U.S. Economic Policy Consultative Committee, which the two leaders concurred to hold in July at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting in May, was realized as concurred.\u00a0 I would like to thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Raimondo for hosting.\nCurrently, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine poses a serious challenge to the international order, but we must never allow unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force.\u00a0 At the same time, we are concerned that there are prominent attempts to use economic influence unfairly and opaquely to realize their strategic interest and to modify the existing international order.\u00a0 In order to effectively deal with this, it is essential to discuss foreign policy and economic policy as a unit, rather than discussing foreign policy and economic policy individually.\u00a0 It is also necessary to strongly disseminate such efforts by Japan and United States and lead the collaboration of the international community.\nFrom that point of view, this economic 2+2 is a timely framework.\u00a0 In addition, it is important to promote multi-layered bilateral cooperation in terms of policies, institutions, and technological development, with a focus on the CoRe, or Competitiveness and Resilience Partnership, in order for Japan and the United States to maintain competitiveness and resilience in the ever-changing international economic situation.\u00a0 Now, under Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s new form of capitalism, Japan is aiming for an economic society that balances solving social issues and economic growth, while emphasizing investment in people and promotion of \u2013\n(Interruption.)\nJapan and the United States should work together.\nToday, I look forward to discussing how Japan and United States exert our leadership towards realization of sustainable and inclusive economic growth of the international community, including the Indo-Pacific region, as well as maintenance and reinforcement of the rules-based free and open economic order.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much, (inaudible).\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0\u00a0Good morning.\u00a0 Tony and I are thrilled to host you this morning.\u00a0 I had the opportunity the other evening to express my condolences to Minister Hagiuda, but I haven\u2019t seen you, so Minister Hayashi, please \u2013 and your delegation, please accept our condolences for Prime Minister Abe.\nIt\u2019s a pleasure to be here, as I said, and I could not agree more with you, Minister Hayashi, that the international rules-based order that the United States and Japan, along with our friends and allies, built is being challenged, which means it\u2019s incumbent upon us to strengthen our tie and step up to ensure that they cannot challenge this rules-based order.\u00a0 And I would suggest convenings of this kind are more important than ever, so thank you for enduring the long flight to be here with us.\nWe have a number of similar initiatives ongoing that all aim at the same goal.\u00a0 Last November, Minister Hagiuda and I launched the JUCIP, the U.S.-Japan Commercial and Industrial Partnership, to ensure that METI and the Department of Commerce work together to promote competitiveness and innovation.\u00a0 Today, of course, we are convening for the first time our economic 2+2 to discuss shared concerns of interest that are central to both foreign and economic policy.\nI would say this format is the first of its kind.\u00a0 It is ambitious, exciting, and timely in light of the threats that we are seeing around the world.\u00a0 And the reality that, as you said, Minister Hayashi, economic security is very much more than ever tied to national security.\nWe have a mandate today to track what we have achieved together thus far and to drive cooperative efforts going forward in a way that can help further strengthen the rules-based economic order in the Indo-Pacific, and indeed, in the world.\nI would take a minute to highlight that we\u2019ve made significant achievements so far.\u00a0 I\u2019m especially proud of Commerce and METI\u2019s joint work already underway in the JUCIP.\u00a0 It\u2019s already leading to concrete outcomes that we\u2019ll discuss later today, including in the session which I am leading around building supply chain resilience.\nToday in the rest of my comments, I also plan to focus on the newly launched Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which we believe is vital to establishing strength in the \u2013 economic strength in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 I want to thank Minister Hagiuda for the leadership you\u2019re providing in the JUCIP, but also in the IPEF, and for your close partnership in ensuring the success of the supply chain ministerial last week and the virtual ministerial for IPEF this week.\u00a0 I commend you for participating in the virtual ministerial for IPEF and then immediately getting on a plane and coming here today.\nOur shared interests make it imperative for us to continue leveraging dialogues like this, like the 2+2, like the JUCIP, like the supply chain, like the IPEF, to figure out concrete joint solutions for promoting economic growth, economic security that will also help us address the threats to the global economic order and enhance economic security and resilience.\u00a0 So I\u2019m excited to have a productive discussion today.\nMINISTER HAGIUDA:\u00a0 (Via interpreter) Commerce Secretary Raimondo, State Secretary Blinken, at the outset allow me to reiterate our heartfelt gratitude to deep condolences expressed to former Prime Minister Abe.\u00a0 Former Prime Minister Abe always said Japan-U.S. alliance is the cornerstone of Japan\u2019s diplomacy.\nToday historic kickoff of Japan-U.S. Economic 2+2 has materialized.\u00a0 Toward further deepening of Japan-U.S. alliance, a new page has been opened.\u00a0 This is how we think.\u00a0 Foreign and security policies and economic policy have become inseparable.\u00a0 Unilateral use of economic force in violation of international rules to fulfill diplomatic demand should never take place.\u00a0 State\u2011of\u2011the-art technology should be developed and utilized to further reinforce basic human rights and democracy.\nFurther, building economic architecture for a new era, including digital, is an urgent challenge that cannot wait.\u00a0 Vis-\u00e0-vis wider-ranging challenges, Japan and the United States \u2013 the world\u2019s number one and number two democratic economic powers sharing universal values \u2013 will have \u2013 work hand in hand.\nThe 2+2 will not only be confined to Japan-U.S. bilateral, but will be a foundation which will bring peace and prosperity widely in the Indo-Pacific region.\u00a0 This is, as it were, compass for realizing free and open Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 This is our belief.\nI\u2019m looking forward to having a very good discussion.\u00a0 Let us send out to the world Japan\u2011United States unified and clear message.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you so much, Mr. Minister and colleagues.\u00a0 And just to add my voice as well to Gina\u2019s and to the minister\u2019s, I had an opportunity to pay respects upon the assassination of Prime Minister Abe, and I think and I hope that the spirit of leadership and vision he brought to our relationship, which was exceptional, will help animate us in the work that we\u2019re doing together.\nIt\u2019s wonderful to have all of you here.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get into our session.\u00a0 I\u2019m remiss in \u2013 for those of you who haven\u2019t been here before, this is the Benjamin Franklin Room.\u00a0 Ben Franklin is gazing at us.\u00a0 He was our first diplomat, he signed our first treaty, he charted the Gulf Stream, he captured electricity, he forced an ethos of self-government \u2013 and virtually none of this did he do while sober.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But we will be serving tea this morning.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo, Mark.\nMODERATOR:\u00a0 And with that, I will be serving as your moderator today and try to keep us on time on this rather ambitious agenda.\u00a0 We have two plenary sessions, each divided into two bits.\u00a0 The first session will be \u201cRealizing Peace and Prosperity Through the Rules-Based Economic Order.\u201d\u00a0 The speaking order will be Minister Hayashi, followed by Secretary Blinken, Minister Hagiuda, followed by Secretary Raimondo, and we\u2019re going to allow about 20 minutes for this session.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0Thank you.\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-launch-of-the-u-s-afghan-consultative-mechanism/", "title":

Blinken At the Launch of the U.S.-Afghan Consultative Mechanism\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "U.S. Institute for Peace", "location": "Washington, DC", "date": "July 28, 2022", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon, everyone.\nFirst, let me say it is always a particular pleasure to visit our neighbors at the U.S. Institute of Peace.\u00a0 Lise, thank you so much for hosting us.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be here.\nAnd Rina, to you, to our special envoy, to the team working with you, to the many others who are involved with today\u2019s launch, I am grateful for all you\u2019ve done to bring all of us together today, but for the work that\u2019s being done every day that I\u2019ll have a chance to talk about over the next few minutes.\u00a0 But to our colleagues across the entire U.S. Government, civil society, thank you as well for supporting equality, supporting opportunity, for women and girls across Afghanistan.\nAnd a special thanks to the extraordinary panelists that we\u2019ve had today.\u00a0 I\u2019m really looking forward to getting a chance to speak with you directly shortly.\u00a0 But as you all know, they\u2019ve served in Afghanistan in different ways, in different roles, but there is one thread that runs throughout their public service.\u00a0 Each has helped strengthen the rights of Afghan women and girls, as well as members of other vulnerable groups, for decades.\nToday, they represent many others across Afghanistan and around the world who have dedicated their lives to this deeply vital and deeply honorable mission.\nAs the panelists made clear, we meet at a difficult time for Afghan women and girls.\nSince the Taliban took over a year ago, they\u2019ve reversed a great deal of the openness and progress that had been made over the previous decades.\u00a0 They\u2019ve silenced civil society and journalists.\u00a0 In March, they banned independent international media like Voice of America and BBC\u00a0from airing in Afghanistan.\u00a0 They continue to intimidate and censor Afghan media outlets.\u00a0 They stifled the free practice of religion for Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\nPerhaps most notably, they failed to respect the human rights of women and girls.\u00a0 Instead, under the Taliban, women and girls have largely been erased from public life.\u00a0 As a report released yesterday by Amnesty International showed, the Taliban have systematically restricted women and girl\u2019s rights to free movement, decimated the system supporting domestic violence victims, and contributed to surging rates of child, early, and forced marriage.\nThe Taliban\u2019s decision to ban girls from attending secondary schools, a decision that happened while some girls were literally walking to school and others were already sitting at their desks, was a reversal of commitments they made to the Afghan people and to the world.\u00a0 For 314 days and counting, the girls of Afghanistan have sat at home while their brothers and cousins have been receiving educations.\u00a0 It\u2019s a terrible, terrible waste.\nIt\u2019s especially difficult to accept because we all remember how different it was not so very long ago.\u00a0 Prior to the Taliban\u2019s takeover, thousands of women across Afghanistan held public office from the village level right up to the national level.\u00a0 Women entered professions previously closed to them.\u00a0 They started businesses.\u00a0 They were doctors, nurses, scientists, artists.\u00a0 And women didn\u2019t just study in schools across Afghanistan; they ran them.\nThese gains weren\u2019t felt only by women and girls.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve seen again and again throughout history from country to country, when equality and opportunity increase for one group of people, they tend to increase for other groups as well.\u00a0 As the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan were strengthened, we saw members of various ethnic and religious communities \u2013 Hazaras, Hindus, Sikhs, Sufis \u2013 take more prominent roles in Afghan public life.\u00a0 Afghans with disabilities did as well.\u00a0 The LGBTQI+ community found ways to build a community.\u00a0 So the changes in Afghanistan during the past year have been painful for so many.\nWe continue to urge the Taliban to reverse their decision on girls\u2019 education, to make good on their commitment to the Afghan people, to allow girls to learn.\u00a0 The evidence is overwhelming.\u00a0 Investing in girls\u2019 education, women\u2019s political inclusion, it leads to stronger economies.\u00a0 It leads to healthier individuals and families.\u00a0 It leads to more stable, more resilient societies.\u00a0 These are the things that people of Afghanistan want for their futures.\u00a0 That\u2019s why so many members of Afghan society \u2013 men and women, rural and urban dwellers, religious scholars, people across religions and cultural backgrounds \u2013 have all, all called for the Taliban to let women and girls go to school again.\nThe United States will continue to amplify these voices and do all that we can to support progress for Afghan women, girls, and other at-risk populations.\nEarlier this year, we joined partners across the international community \u2013 including the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Qatar, Turkey, Pakistan, the European Union, and others \u2013 urging the Taliban to let girls go back to school.\nLast month, we supported a Human Rights Council urgent debate that allowed us to hear directly from Afghan women leaders.\u00a0 We co-sponsored a resolution that will allow us to hear from them again this coming September.\u00a0 And as we help enable their voices to be heard, others will hear them as well.\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve continued our partnerships with Afghan civil society groups working on issues of equality, inclusion, opportunity for women, religious and ethnic communities, and other at-risk populations.\nAnd critically, with today\u2019s launch of the U.S.-Afghan Consultative Mechanism, we are taking these relationships to the next level.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I\u2019m so pleased about today.\nIt\u2019s going to make it easier for Afghan civil society groups to communicate and collaborate with American policymakers across a whole range of shared priorities \u2013 from supporting income-generating activities for Afghan women, to strategizing ways to help Afghan human rights monitors safely document abuses, to devising new methods to promote religious freedom.\nWhat we want to do is to make our partnerships with Afghan civil society more effective, more rigorous, more productive, more purposeful.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what this new initiative is all about.\nSo let me simply share my profound appreciation for our American civil society partners, who do critical work to support women leaders and civil society organizations in Afghanistan, and for our Afghan partners for sharing your perspectives, for sharing your recommendations.\nWhat\u2019s remarkable to me and I think to so many of us is how, even in the face of threats, violence, intimidation, the women and girls of Afghanistan \u2013 and other vulnerable, targeted people \u2013 have simply refused to back down.\u00a0 These groups have never stopped believing in a brighter future for their country.\u00a0 They are determined to do all they can to make that future real.\nThe women who have taken to the streets to protest for their rights are one such group.\nIn December, when members of the Afghan National Security Forces were targeted despite the Taliban\u2019s supposed amnesty, women protested.\u00a0 In January, when female public servants were dismissed from their jobs, women protested.\u00a0 In March, when the Taliban instituted an edict directing women to cover their faces in public and to only leave home when, quote, \u201cnecessary,\u201d women protested.\nMany of them have said they will never, never stop raising their voices.\nThe work we\u2019ve done here today will ensure that we \u2013 and people around the world \u2013 continue to hear them, continue to listen to them, as we work together for a more stable, peaceful, prosperous, and free future for Afghanistan and for every Afghan man and woman.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you all for joining us today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-22/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J. Blinken At a Press Availability\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Press Briefing Room", "location": "Washington, D.C. ", "date": "July 27, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Full house.\u00a0 Good to see.\nThis week, President Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine entered its sixth month.\u00a0 Costs continue to climb \u2013 thousands of civilians killed or wounded; 13 million Ukrainians forced to flee their homes; historic cities literally pounded into rubble; food shortages, skyrocketing food prices around the world \u2013 all this because President Putin was determined to conquer another country.\nHe\u2019s failed in that goal.\u00a0 Ukraine has not and will not be conquered.\u00a0 It will remain sovereign and independent.\u00a0 As this war stretches on, the courage and strength of Ukraine\u2019s military and its people become even more evident and even more extraordinary.\u00a0 They will do whatever it takes to protect their homes, their families, their fellow citizens, their country.\u00a0 The United States and our allies and partners will continue to stand with them and help provide precisely what they need to defend their freedom.\nIn the coming days, I expect to speak with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov for the first time since the war began.\u00a0 I plan to raise an issue that\u2019s a top priority for us: the release of Americans Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, who have been wrongfully detained and must be allowed to come home.\u00a0 We put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago to facilitate their release.\u00a0 Our governments have communicated repeatedly and directly on that proposal.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll use the conversation to follow up personally and, I hope, move us toward a resolution.\nI\u2019ll also raise the matter of the tentative deal on grain exports that Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the United Nations reached last week.\u00a0 We hope this deal will swiftly lead to Ukrainian grain being shipped again through the Black Sea and that Russia will follow through on its pledge to allow those ships to pass.\nThis has been the focus of the world\u2019s attention for months, including a few weeks ago at the meeting of the G20 foreign ministers in Bali, where one foreign minister after another urged Foreign Minister Lavrov and Russia to stop blocking the grain.\u00a0 So this agreement represents a positive step forward.\nThat said, there\u2019s a difference between a deal on paper and a deal in practice.\u00a0 Hundreds of millions of people around the world are waiting for these ships to set forth from Ukraine\u2019s ports and for millions of tons of grain and other crops to reach world markets.\u00a0 If the Kremlin signed this deal to look reasonable to the world, without any intention of following through, we\u2019ll know that soon enough.\nMy call to Foreign Minister Lavrov will not be a negotiation about Ukraine.\u00a0 Any negotiation regarding Ukraine is for its government and people to determine.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve said from the beginning, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\nBeyond these developments, now that we\u2019ve reached the half-year mark, let\u2019s take a step back and consider the state of the war and what we expect to come next.\nIn the Donbas region, where Russia concentrated its forces after failing to take Kyiv this spring, the fighting remains intense.\u00a0 The modest progress that Russian troops have made there has come at huge cost in both lives and materiel.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Ukraine is using all its defensive capabilities to hit back hard, bolstered by the more than $8 billion in security assistance from the United States since the beginning of this administration.\nAs we look ahead, what the world has heard recently from Russia\u2019s leaders is raising new alarms.\nLast week, Foreign Minister Lavrov said that the Kremlin\u2019s goals in Ukraine had expanded.\u00a0 Now they seek to claim more Ukrainian territory, beyond the Donbas.\nThis is the latest in a series of evolving justifications and ever-shifting goals.\nIn the beginning, Russia said that the purpose of the war was to \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine \u2013 a false charge aimed at delegitimizing Ukraine\u2019s democracy.\nThey said the real threat was somehow posed by NATO, a purely defensive alliance that made efforts to engage Russia for years but was rejected, and that helped safeguard peace, stability, and prosperity across Europe for decades, to the benefit of Russia, among many other nations.\nThen they said the war was to protect ethnic Russians living in Donbas from genocide, before relentlessly targeting the largest Russian-speaking city in Ukraine, Kharkiv.\u00a0 The only one responsible for killing ethnic Russians in Ukraine is President Putin.\nWhat this is about and has always been about is President Putin\u2019s conviction that Ukraine is not an independent state and belongs to Russia.\u00a0 He said it flat-out to President Bush in 2008, and I quote:\u00a0 \u201cUkraine isn\u2019t a real country,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 He said it in 2020, and I quote: \u201cUkrainians and Russians are one and the same people,\u201d end quote.\u00a0 Last month, he said that when\u00a0Peter the Great waged war on Sweden, he was simply taking back what belonged to Russia, and now Russia is again looking to take back what\u2019s theirs.\nPresident Putin has been foiled in his efforts to erase Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and independence.\u00a0 But now Moscow is laying the groundwork to annex more Ukrainian territory.\u00a0 From downgraded U.S. intelligence, as well as information available in the public domain, we can see that they\u2019re following the same playbook that they used back in 2014.\nThey\u2019re installing illegitimate proxy officials.\u00a0 They\u2019re working to establish branches of Russian banks in areas they control, set the ruble as the local currency, take over broadcasting towers, force residents to apply for Russian citizenship, sabotage internet access for local residents as well.\nAll of this to consolidate their power over these regions.\nOur intelligence also shows that Russia is using filtration centers in eastern Ukraine and western Russia to detain, to interrogate, and in some cases abuse thousands of Ukrainians.\u00a0 Some are allowed to remain in Russian-occupied Ukraine.\u00a0 Some are forcefully deported to Russia.\u00a0 Some are sent to prisons.\u00a0 Some simply vanish.\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see next:\u00a0 Russia-installed leaders will hold sham referendums to manufacture the fiction that the people in those places want to join Russia.\u00a0 Then they\u2019ll use those false votes to claim that the annexation of these regions is legitimate.\u00a0 We must and we will act quickly to make clear to Russia that these tactics will not work.\nAnnexation by force the territory of a sovereign and independent country is a gross violation of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0 Members of the international community that have committed to uphold the charter and international law have a responsibility to denounce these plans by the Russian Government and to make clear they will never recognize these illegal acts.\u00a0 Otherwise, no one can claim to be surprised when Russia follows through on its plans \u2013 or if other countries follow suit in the future.\nA few days ago, Foreign Minister Lavrov said, and I quote, \u201cWe are determined to help the people of eastern Ukraine to liberate themselves from the burden of this absolutely unacceptable regime,\u201d end quote.\nBy what right can Russia claim this?\u00a0 Ukraine is not their country.\u00a0 The people of Ukraine democratically elect their own leaders.\u00a0 The Government of Russia has no say in that whatsoever.\u00a0 The right belongs to the Ukrainian people, and the Ukrainian people alone.\nDespite these deeply troubling developments, we should not lose sight of the broader picture.\u00a0 NATO is stronger, more united, and poised to grow.\u00a0 Nearly one-third of NATO members have already ratified Sweden and Finland\u2019s accession protocols.\u00a0 We appreciate the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s swift action to advance those protocols; we hope the full Senate will act quickly to do the same.\nMany countries beyond Europe have condemned Russia\u2019s aggression and are holding Moscow to account.\u00a0 The Ukrainian people are more determined than ever to defend their homeland, preserve their culture.\u00a0 All of these developments refute the Kremlin.\nEconomically, the sanctions we\u2019ve imposed on Russia to end its aggression are having a powerful and also growing effect.\nNow, Moscow has been cherry-picking economic data to support President Putin\u2019s insistence that everything is fine and the Russian economy is going strong.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply not true.\nThe Kremlin says that global businesses haven\u2019t really pulled out of Russia.\u00a0 In fact, more than 1,000 foreign companies \u2013 representing assets and revenue equal to more than a third of Russia\u2019s GDP \u2013 have stopped operations in Russia.\u00a0 Many of Russia\u2019s best and brightest have left as well, including highly educated professionals in critical fields, like energy and technology.\nThey say that Russia is replacing lost imports from the West with imports from Asia.\u00a0 In fact, imports into Russia have dropped more than 50 percent this year, and imports from China, for example, aren\u2019t making up the difference in quantity or quality, especially for high-end components.\u00a0 What that also means is that Russia can\u2019t manufacture products for Russian citizens or for export, and will increasingly lose markets overseas.\nThey say that the government is running a budget surplus because of high energy prices.\u00a0 In fact, the budget is in deficit, and Russia can\u2019t spend the oil revenues it has acquired on the imports it wants because of sanctions.\nThey say that the Kremlin has plenty of sovereign wealth.\u00a0 In fact, half of that money \u2013 half of that money \u2013 is frozen overseas.\nThey say that domestic consumption is still strong in Russia.\u00a0 In fact, consumer spending has plummeted.\nThey say that the ruble is the world\u2019s strongest performing currency.\u00a0 In fact, the currency market is controlled by the Kremlin, Russian households are restricted from converting rubles to dollars, the ruble is trading at a much lower volume than before the war.\nSo, though the Kremlin is working hard to paint a picture of economic stability, the facts show otherwise.\u00a0 The powerful impact of sanctions will grow and compound over time.\nThough President Putin will likely claim that this war was a resounding success, the world can see that it has weakened Russia profoundly.\nPresident Zelenskyy has made clear that the war will end through diplomacy.\u00a0 We agree.\u00a0 The United States is ready to support any viable diplomatic effort.\u00a0 Unfortunately, Moscow has given no indication that it\u2019s prepared to engage meaningfully and constructively, and we\u2019re under no illusion that that\u2019s going to change anytime soon.\u00a0 If and when the time comes, we will bring the full weight of American diplomacy to bear.\nIn the meantime, we\u2019ll continue to do all that we can to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s position on the battlefield so it has the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.\nFrom here in Washington and in all of my travels, I\u2019ll continue to discuss all of this with our partners and allies \u2013 supporting a sovereign, independent Ukraine; resolving the food security crisis; and how we can help create the conditions for a diplomatic resolution.\nLast week, as you know, I had the privilege of welcoming Ukraine\u2019s first lady, Olena Zelenska.\u00a0 She came to the State Department.\u00a0 I told her that the United States will not waiver in our support for the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 That was true six months ago; it\u2019s true today; it will be true long after this war, this aggression is over.\nWith that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Andrea.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Secretary, there are reports that the administration has decided that this substantial offer is to trade convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big offer.\u00a0 Just last week, Bill Burns called him a creep in an interview with me.\u00a0 But you want to get Griner and Paul Whelan out, so what is the prospect of getting Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner out by making such a big trade, arguably over the opposition of the Justice Department \u2013 he\u2019s serving a 20 \u2013 or 5-year sentence.\u00a0 And what can you accomplish in a conversation with Lavrov to try to get this grain deal locked in, since they bombed Odessa within 24 hours of agreeing to the deal?\u00a0 How can you trust anything that Lavrov and the Russians agree to?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Andrea.\u00a0 When it comes to our efforts to secure the return home of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, you\u2019ll understand that I can\u2019t and won\u2019t get into any of the details of what we proposed to the Russians over the course of so many weeks now.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Can you talk about why you would make such an important \u2013 why you would put what you call a substantial offer on the table?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0So here\u2019s what I can say about this.\u00a0 First, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve conveyed this on a number of occasions and directly to Russian officials.\u00a0 And my hope would be that, in speaking to Foreign Minister Lavrov, I can advance the efforts to bring them home.\u00a0 We have two imperatives when it comes to arbitrarily, wrongfully detained Americans anywhere in the world, including in Russia, including in the cases of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\u00a0 And I say this because, more than unfortunately \u2013 horrifically \u2013 this is a practice, as you know, that many countries engage in and one that we are resolutely working to end, and I\u2019ll come back to that in a minute.\nBut we have two objectives.\u00a0 We of course want to see those who were wrongfully detained be released and be able to return home.\u00a0 At the same time, it\u2019s important that we work to reinforce the global norm against these arbitrary detentions, against what is truly a horrific practice.\u00a0 So we\u2019re working concertedly on both.\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated with Trevor Reed \u2013 came home a few months ago \u2013 that the President is prepared to make tough decisions if it means the safe return of Americans.\u00a0 At the same time, we are working with partners around the world to use all of the relevant tools at our disposal, including some that were announced just recently in the executive order that the President released to respond to and impose costs on those who engage in this practice.\u00a0 And I believe we can actually fulfill both imperatives.\nAnd let me just say this as well:\u00a0 I think you can expect to hear me in the weeks and months ahead speak more to the efforts that we\u2019re making to reinforce this global norm against arbitrary detention to deter countries from doing this in the first place.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0Matt.\nQUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0Can you speak to the grain \u2014\nMR PRICE:\u00a0\u00a0(Off-mike.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I\u2019m sorry, the grain, I apologize, I didn\u2019t get to, Andrea \u2013 the second part of the question.\u00a0 Look, Andrea, it was incredibly powerful when we were in Bali a few weeks ago at the G20 to see foreign ministers from around the world demand that Russia end its blockade of Odessa and of the grain that has been blocked in Ukraine for six months \u2013 more than 20 million tons.\u00a0 And minster after minster did this from countries around the world geographically to such an extent that Foreign Minister Lavrov decided not to return for the rest of the session that the G20 foreign ministers were holding.\nAnd then I think the steps that we\u2019ve seen Russia take in at least agreeing on paper to allow grain to leave Ukraine is in response to the pressure that Russia is feeling not just from us, not just from G7 countries or even G20 countries, but from countries around the world who are saying \u2013whatever they think about anything else \u2013 end this blockade.\u00a0 Allow the grain to leave.\u00a0 Allow us to feed our people.\u00a0 Allow prices to come down.\nBut the test, of course, now is whether there\u2019s actual implementation of the agreement.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see in the coming days whether what Russia signed it\u2019s serious about and whether the grain gets out.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking toward.\u00a0 The bombings that you saw the other day \u2013 I mean, step back for a second.\u00a0 Irrespective of what they were aiming at, by what right does Russia have to bomb anything in Ukraine, or anything in Odessa, or anything in the port?\u00a0 None.\u00a0 Zero.\u00a0 Anything it\u2019s doing is to further its efforts to conquer Ukraine, which have and will fail.\nBut in the case of grain specifically, what we need to see \u2013 what we\u2019re looking to but what the world is looking to, more important \u2013 is whether those ships begin to sail, whether the grain starts to move.\u00a0 We\u2019ll find out in the next few days.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Happy summer, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Happy Wednesday.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thank you as well.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And perhaps most importantly,\u00a0happy birthday\u00a0to the State Department.\u00a0 Today is \u2013 I believe is the birthday, right?\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Two hundred and thirty-three years.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Where\u2019s the cake?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nQUESTION:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, I was expecting you to bring one out.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 We\u2019ll come back with it.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 So two things, but they\u2019ll be real brief.\u00a0 One, when you talk about this substantial proposal, can you \u2013 I realize you won\u2019t get into the specific details of it, but does it involve a swap?\u00a0 Think along the lines of what was done for Trevor Reed.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Because I want to make sure that the proposal that we put forward has a good chance to advance, I\u2019m just not going to get into it in public.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Secondly, for the last couple of months \u2013 well, last six months now \u2013 you have been talking about how Russia is isolated internationally, and yet we see Foreign Minister Lavrov jetting off around Africa and the Middle East and President Putin going to Tehran, and say what you want about him having \u2013 only going to Iran.\u00a0 They make the case that they\u2019re not isolated, and now you\u2019re about to have this conversation with them.\u00a0 So what does that say about the administration\u2019s efforts to isolate Russia when you are actually now reaching out to them to talk about the issues?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Matt, in terms of some of the travels that the foreign minister, for example, is engaged in, what I see is a desperate game of defense to try somehow to justify to the world the actions that Russia has taken both with its aggression in general against Ukraine as well as, more specifically, its blockade of Ukrainian ports and its denying to the world at a critical time the grain, the wheat, the food that it needs.\u00a0 So they\u2019re doing everything they can to somehow justify what they\u2019re doing at a time when we\u2019re hearing from virtually every corner of the world an insistence that Russia stop this blockade and allow the grain to leave.\nSo no doubt Foreign Minister Lavrov will share some interesting views on the war, Russia\u2019s aggression, as well as on grains.\u00a0 For example, one of the things that Russia has been doing is blaming on sanctions the challenges of getting Russian grain out of Russia when, in fact, as everyone knows and as we make clear repeatedly, the sanctions that we\u2019ve imposed on Russia for its aggression against Ukraine from day one exempted wheat, exempted food products, exempted shipping and insurance necessary to move those out of Russia.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a fabrication.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s one that will be repeated, but it\u2019s one that we will continue to debunk.\nBut what I see in what they\u2019re doing is, again, desperately trying to explain the fact that a food crisis that has gone from making 100 million people food insecure three years ago to about 160 million people food insecure during COVID to now well over 200 million because of Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukraine\u2019s ports \u2013 this is somehow trying to justify what\u2019s unjustifiable.\u00a0 The only way that Russia can fully address the concerns of the world \u2013 look, the ideal way would be for it to stop the war, end the aggression.\u00a0 But short of that, end the blockade.\u00a0 There\u2019s a deal on the table to do that.\u00a0 What\u2019s going to be much more important than what Foreign Minister Lavrov says on his travels is what Russia actually does in implementing the agreement.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the world is looking for.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Felicia.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Going back to your discussions with the Russians on the substantial proposal, any \u2013 what\u2019s been the response from them up until this point?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m not going to characterize it.\u00a0 Again, my interest and my focus is on making sure that to the best of our ability we get to \u2013 get to yes, and we \u2014\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Do you feel that \u2013 sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 And I don\u2019t want to qualify it.\u00a0 Look, one of the things that happens is this, and I mentioned in response to Andrea a minute ago:\u00a0 We\u2019re very focused on getting Brittney and Paul home.\u00a0 At the same time, I\u2019m also focused every single day on arbitrarily detained Americans in more than half a dozen countries around the world.\u00a0 We have a team that works on this 24/7 led by Roger Carstens.\u00a0 This is, for me, an issue of utmost importance.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that I see as fundamental to my own responsibilities in this job: looking out for the men and women of this department, looking out for any American who is arbitrarily detained abroad or otherwise needs our help when they\u2019re overseas.\u00a0 And I say this because this is something we are working every single day, and most of the time we\u2019re working it quietly behind the scenes, for obvious reasons.\u00a0 And I would say just because you don\u2019t see us doing something or you don\u2019t hear us talking about it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\u00a0 On the contrary.\u00a0 This is something that \u2013 bringing people home, bringing Brittney home, bringing Paul home.\u00a0 This is something that we\u2019re focused on 24/7, seven days a week.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Alex.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, let me get a comment on increasing calls to the administration to (inaudible) state sponsor of terrorism.\u00a0 If you ask anybody in Ukraine, they will tell you what Russia is doing every single day \u2013 its scope of its brutality \u2013 if you compare with the countries that already have been designated \u2013 North Korea, Iran and Syria will maybe not (inaudible).\u00a0 So what are we waiting for?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 So on this, a few things.\u00a0 First, I\u2019m obligated, the department is obligated to follow the law.\u00a0 Criteria against which we make this determination are defined by Congress.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 And our task is to try to take these criteria that Congress has established and compare them against the facts to make sure that the facts in a particular situation actually meet the criteria that are established in law.\nMeanwhile, as we look at that, we\u2019re aligned with dozens of countries around the world across four continents on the most powerful sanctions, export controls, that I think have ever been levied.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also curtailed international assistance and foreign aid.\u00a0 And the costs that have been imposed on Russia by us and by other countries are absolutely in line with the consequences that would follow from designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.\u00a0 So the practical effects of what we\u2019re doing are the same.\nMore broadly, I would just say this.\u00a0 We\u2019ve methodically ejected Russia from international \u2013 from the international economic order \u2013 I talked about that a little earlier; most favored nation status and borrowing privileges from international financial institutions gone; we\u2019ve restricted its ability to access its frozen central bank funds, to make debt payments; and what you\u2019ve seen is a powerful impact and a growing impact on Russia\u2019s economy and Russia\u2019s economic prospects going forward.\u00a0 So in terms of the impact we\u2019re having, it is very much in line with anything that the SST designation would enable us to do.\u00a0 We\u2019re basically doing everything that we would need to do and want to do.\nSo again, what we\u2019re focused on is making sure that we are meeting the law and the criteria set out in the law, and making sure we\u2019re having the strongest possible impact.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 We have time for one final question.\u00a0 Kylie.\nQUESTION:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Secretary, I\u2019m wondering \u2013 I know you don\u2019t want to get into the details of this proposed deal that you guys have put on the table.\u00a0 But can you detail President Biden\u2019s role in putting that offer to the Russians?\u00a0 Was he involved?\u00a0 Did he sign off?\nAnd then my second question is: With you expected to speak with the Russian foreign minister in the coming days, aren\u2019t the Russians getting exactly what they wanted here in detaining Americans: getting a phone call from the Secretary of State over these detained Americans while this war wages on in Russia?\u00a0 Why not continue these conversations quietly instead of in this public way, where the Russians get this win of having a conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Kylie, in terms of the President, of course he was not only directly involved, he signs off on any proposal that we make and any \u2013 and certainly when it comes to Americans who are being arbitrarily detained abroad, including in this specific case.\nSecond, there is in my mind utility in conveying clear, direct messages to the Russians on key priorities for us.\u00a0 And as I mentioned, these include securing the return home of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\u00a0 They also include, as I\u2019ve mentioned and I would expect to raise, following through on the grain agreement because what we\u2019re seeing and hearing around the world is a desperate need for food, a desperate need for prices to decrease.\u00a0 And if we can help through our direct diplomacy encourage the Russians to make good on the commitments they\u2019ve made, that will help people around the world, and I\u2019m determined to do it.\nAnd then, as I mentioned earlier, I think it\u2019s very important now that we see what Russia\u2019s next plan is \u2013 that is, the annexation of more Ukrainian territory \u2013 that the Russians, Foreign Minister Lavrov, hear directly from me on behalf of the United States that we see what they\u2019re doing, we know what they\u2019re doing, and we will never accept it.\u00a0 It will never be legitimized.\u00a0 There will always be consequences if that\u2019s what they do and that\u2019s what they try to sustain.\nSo we make a judgment in every instance where we think our diplomacy can hopefully advance our interests and values, including direct engagement.\u00a0 We make judgments about when it makes sense to talk about it in public, and as a general proposition, I believe in as much transparency as we possibly can have, and sometimes we make judgments that we\u2019re going to keep conversations quiet.\nSo in this instance, I thought it was important to make clear that on these issues \u2013 the detention of our American citizens, the food crisis the world is facing because of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, and the plans that Russia now has to pursue the annexation of Ukrainian territory \u2013 that our Russian counterparts hear directly from me.\u00a0 Thanks.\nMR PRICE:\u00a0 Thank you, everyone.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Thanks, everyone.\n\n"}, {"url":

Mr. President, it\u2019s a pleasure to have you here at the State Department in the United States. To our colleagues, I\u2019m especially pleased to be able to meet today with the president of Guyana.\nWe\u2019ve come off a very important and good Summit of the Americas, particularly as well our meetings with the CARICOM countries. Guyana has been a very strong partner for the United States and also in many ways a global leader. We\u2019re working together in our region and beyond to try to find solutions to urgent challenges, to include climate, to include food security, energy security. We\u2019re working on issues together, and I think coming out of the Summit of the Americas in particular there is a lot more energy in those efforts, including some things that we\u2019re working on very actively right now that I know we\u2019ll be sharing in the weeks ahead.\nI would note that, quite remarkably, I think something like 86 percent of Guyana is forest. It\u2019s a remarkable contributor in that way alone to the challenges that we face with climate change, but the United States is very eager to continue to deepen and strengthen the partnership that we have on all of these issues and more. Georgetown is also the seat, of course, of CARICOM, and this for us is a very important and vital institution, one which \u2013 with which President Biden, Vice President Harris had, I think, a very significant and important engagement at the Summit of the Americas.\nSo I look forward to continuing the conversations that we all started there and to deepening the work that we\u2019ve already begun between our countries. Welcome. It\u2019s so good to have you here.\nPRESIDENT ALI: Thank you very much, Secretary Blinken. First of all, allow me to express our gratitude for this meeting. We are very pleased to be here at a very important time in the development of Guyana as we seek to further strengthen our relationship with the United States, who we view as an important strategic partner.\nWe just came out of a very successful Summit of the Americas in which we identified some critical issues for CARICOM as a region \u2013 that is food security, energy security, financing, and the issue of climate change.\nIn all these areas Guyana is already providing leadership and we are committing ourselves to continue to provide that leadership. We are pursuing an energy path that seeks to balance our newfound natural resource of oil and gas, but we are not doing that at the detriment of our credentials on environment and climate change.\nAs you rightfully pointed out, our forests stores 19.5 kilotons of carbon. We are a net zero country. And we look forward to discussing how jointly we can continue to work on the issues of food security, climate, financing, working in the region in terms of debt crisis facing CARICOM, but more importantly, finding a balanced development strategy, and doing so staying true to the value system, principles that both of us believe so strongly in \u2013 that is democratic society where transparency, accountability, and strong governance support for the development of Guyana.\nSo I am very pleased to continue this conversation we started at the Summit of the Americas and to work with you on strengthening our partnership.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-secretary-of-commerce-gina-raimondo-at-a-virtual-supply-chain-ministerial-forum/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "date": "July 20, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Welcome, everyone.\u00a0 Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.\u00a0 Very pleased to have everyone join this ministerial meeting on supply chain resilience.\u00a0 People in virtually all of our countries have experienced the pain caused by supply chain disruptions.\u00a0 We have store owners unable to stock their shelves, people with chronic health conditions, we can\u2019t get lifesaving medicines, factories sending home workers because they can\u2019t get the necessary materials and inputs to keep their lines going.\u00a0 More than ever, I think we\u2019ve all come to an understanding about how supply chains are simply essential to meeting our everyday needs.\nThey\u2019re also vital to tackling virtually every pressing global challenge that we face.\u00a0 To prevent a climate catastrophe and adapt to the growing effects of climate change, we need resilient supply chains to produce clean energy technologies, from wind turbines to batteries.\u00a0 To end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that we are better prepared for \u2013 to respond to future health emergencies, we need resilient supply chains for vaccines and other critical health supplies.\nSo this gathering today is just our latest joint effort to try to address these challenges while minimizing disruptions, keeping workers on the job, bringing down costs for families.\u00a0 And here are a few of the ways that we\u2019ve been doing that over the last year or so.\nBack in October, we set up the Microelectronics Early Alert System to anticipate and reduce disruptions for the supply of semiconductors that are critical to our manufacturing.\u00a0 Here in the United States, that\u2019s helped keep American workers on the job at vehicle assembly plants in Michigan and Ohio, and it\u2019s helped keep factories running in partner economies like Mexico and Canada.\nTogether with many governments at this ministerial, we launched the Mineral Supply Partnership, which will invest in producing, processing, and recycling the minerals needed to make clean energy technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels.\nBack in 2020 when COVID-19 was hitting Americans the hardest, India provided medicine and vital supplies to the United States for our industries under strain.\u00a0 When India was facing a massive surge from the Delta variant the following year, we used those same supply chains to provide medical oxygen, therapeutics, and other aid to save lives.\nSupply chains are how the United States has delivered more than 565 million doses of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines free of charge and with no strings attached to countries around the world.\u00a0 And we\u2019re using supply chains to get food, fertilizer, lifesaving aid to people in response to the growing global food security crisis exacerbated by Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nAs we gather today, there are two main goals, I think, that we\u2019ve agreed that we need to focus on.\u00a0 The first is to identify other immediate steps that we can take to reduce disruptions that are most affecting people\u2019s lives and commit to taking those steps.\nThe second is to build the long-term foundation that makes us less vulnerable to future shocks, whether they come from natural disasters and pandemics, from wars, or some other crisis.\nThat is what resilience is all about.\u00a0 Now, we all throw that word around a lot, so let me just take a moment to suggest what it means to us.\u00a0 A resilient supply chain is a transparent one where partners are constantly sharing information in real time to anticipate, to measure, to respond to changes.\u00a0 A resilient supply chain is diversified so that when we can\u2019t get material or service from one source, we can find it somewhere else, and so no one country can weaponize its control over materials or inputs against any other country.\u00a0 That will require investing in research and development, and new manufacturing capacities.\nA resilient supply chain is secure, so we\u2019re less vulnerable to cyber attacks by governments or other actors.\nA resilient supply chain is sustainable, adhering to labor and environmental standards that we\u2019ve agreed on because it\u2019s consistent with our shared values, because we\u2019ve seen how governments that ignore these benchmarks tend to be less reliable partners, and because in 2022 any supply chain that\u2019s not environmentally sustainable won\u2019t be durable.\nSo whether we\u2019re addressing near\u2011 or long\u2011term challenges, there\u2019s only one way to build supply chains that are resilient in all of these ways, and that\u2019s to do it together, with partners \u2013 together with partners in government, including at the regional, the state, the city level, because no one country can cope with inevitable disruptions alone; together with the private sector, because while governments and multilateral institutions shape the rules of the road and can provide incentives, supply chains are ultimately designed, run, powered by businesses and by workers; and not only with industry, but together with all actors in the private sector, including those who have been historically underrepresented \u2013 women, minorities, native-owned enterprises, small and medium sized enterprises, labor unions.\u00a0 The dynamism, diversity, the ingenuity of our private sectors and of the open markets where they compete make us nimbler and more efficient than closed systems.\u00a0 We need to take advantage of this asset.\nYesterday, we hosted four sessions with partners from these diverse groups and organizations.\u00a0 And what we learned is going to inform today\u2019s discussion.\nSo I\u2019m especially looking forward to hearing participants\u2019 views on the challenges we face and what we can do to tackle them together.\nWith that, let me hand it over to my teammate, my friend, my co-host of this meeting, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\u00a0 Gina, over to you.\nSECRETARY RAIMONDO:\u00a0 Thank you, Tony (audio interruption) more important, and I think there is no one who doesn\u2019t now understand the importance of having resilient supply chains.\u00a0 And in order for that to happen, we have to work across governments and as between the public sector and the private sector.\nWe all know \u2013 we all live it every day \u2013 supply chain congestion is challenging us and continuing to stress U.S. imports and exports and the movement of goods here in our country.\u00a0 And as co-chair of our administration\u2019s supply chain disruptions task force, I hear \u2013 I know about these issues.\u00a0 Frankly, I hear about these issues nearly every day or certainly every week from U.S. businesses and U.S. consumers.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s something that we really have to work together, as I say, across governments, among allies in order to solve our supply chain challenges.\u00a0 And we are working hard every day in order to alleviate this issue.\nAnd here in the States, we\u2019re also working hard to convince our Congress to quickly pass funding for the CHIPS Act, which would invest $52 billion in domestic semiconductor production.\u00a0 I will say last night here in the U.S., the United States Senate took a critical vote by a wide margin in a bipartisan fashion to move forward on that bill, so we\u2019re feeling quite optimistic that it will soon get to President Biden\u2019s desk.\u00a0 Additionally, President Biden\u2019s proposed budget requests millions of dollars to respond to the current supply chain crisis and the existing demand for supply chain work.\nI will say here at the Commerce Department, we currently have over 40 workstreams ongoing related to the supply chain, right.\u00a0 There\u2019s no silver bullet; there\u2019s no quick fix to fix our supply chain challenges.\u00a0 And so we are \u2013 and working very closely with Secretary of State and Secretary of Energy \u2013 we\u2019re going industry by industry, product by product, and trying to figure out how to unsnarl the supply chain in any way that we can.\nWe also know \u2013 and we\u2019ve become very, very aware \u2013 that supply chains are global.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why we need to engage with likeminded partners, such as all of the people on this meeting and call, to work together if we really will \u2013 are going to be able to find sustainable, lasting, long-term solutions to solve our mutual supply chain challenges.\u00a0 And the \u2013 Tony and I are working very hard with the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, because that\u2019s a way for us to work with our allies in the Indo-Pacific to work together to shore up our supply chains.\u00a0 We are also co-chairing the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, which is off to a fantastic start, and we\u2019re making huge progress in both of these dialogues to make \u2013 to ensure that our supply chain is resilient, efficient, and benefits all of our citizens, industry, labor, civil society; makes sure that all of our efforts are inclusive and the benefits are widely shared.\nAnd of course, we know supply chain \u2013 supply chains are run by the private sector, fundamentally run by the private sector.\u00a0 So governments alone cannot solve the challenges.\u00a0 We need to and we\u2019re committed to engaging private sector partners, local communities, to together envision new ways of forming public-private partnerships, innovating.\u00a0 And I join Tony in sharing the excitement to hear from each and every one of you today around how we can work together to solve these problems.\nSo thank you again for joining us, and I\u2019m excited to hear from you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-moldovan-prime-minister-natalia-gavrilita-before-their-meeting-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

and gentlemen, and esteemed guests:\u00a0 Please welcome the Secretary of State of the United States Antony Blinken, accompanied by Dr. Kari Johnstone and the 2022 Trafficking in Person Heroes.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS JOHNSTONE:\u00a0 Good afternoon and welcome.\u00a0 Please, have a seat.\nMy name is Kari Johnstone.\u00a0 I\u2019m the Acting Director of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons here at the State Department, and I am just going to kick off our ceremony today.\nThank you all so much for joining us.\u00a0 It is great to have you with us here today.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful to have Secretary Blinken here to release this year\u2019s report.\nOur program will consist of the following:\u00a0 First, Secretary Blinken will offer key remarks on this year\u2019s report.\u00a0 Next, we will have six amazing TIP Report Heroes whom we will honor for their steadfast dedication to combat human trafficking \u2013 five of whom are with us here in person.\u00a0 We

will find some time to visit state.gov to access this year\u2019s report online.\nWe are so honored to have you join us here today, Secretary Blinken.\u00a0 Thank you for continuing to elevate the issue of human trafficking as a department priority, and for hosting today\u2019s event.\u00a0 We are proud to serve under your leadership as we work together to advance efforts to combat human trafficking.\nLadies and gentlemen, the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 Well, good afternoon.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.\u00a0 And welcome to the State Department, welcome to the Benjamin Franklin Room, and especially to our heroes, welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to be with you here in person at the State Department.\nToday, we\u2019re releasing the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report.\u00a0 It assesses how 188 countries and territories, including the United States, are performing in terms of preventing trafficking, protecting victims, prosecuting traffickers.\u00a0 That makes this one of the most comprehensive sources of information anywhere on anti-trafficking efforts by governments \u2013 what works, what doesn\u2019t, and how we can continue to do better.\nNone of this would be possible without the extraordinary efforts of many people, starting with the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, under Kari\u2019s remarkable leadership.\u00a0 Thank you again for everything that you\u2019re doing, everything your team is doing every single year, but also so many diplomats, journalists, advocates, academics, and especially survivors who contribute to our understanding of this terrible crime.\nThank you to our colleagues across Congress who have joined us today.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for the partnership that we have with Congress on combatting trafficking.\nThank you, too, to members of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking and on the Human Trafficking Expert Consultant Network, colleagues who are here with us today.\u00a0 These are two platforms that make it possible for us to work directly with survivors to shape more effective anti-trafficking policies.\nAnd finally, again, thank you to our six 2022 TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Five are here with us in person, as Kari said, and we\u2019ll honor them later this afternoon.\u00a0 So I\u2019d just like to mention the one hero who\u2019s not actually with us today, for obvious reasons.\u00a0 Let me just say a few words.\nKahtehrynah Chehrehpahkha leads the Ukrainian chapter of the anti-trafficking NGO La Strada.\u00a0 As we all know, since the start of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, millions of Ukrainians have had to flee their homes \u2013 some internally within Ukraine, some leaving the country altogether \u2013 many, most with just what they were able to carry \u2013 and that makes them highly vulnerable to exploitation.\u00a0 La Strada has a hotline.\u00a0 It\u2019s received an unprecedented number of calls over the past five months.\u00a0 The organization has given literally thousands of Ukrainians the information and assistance that they need to try to stay safe as they\u2019re forced from their homes.\nKahtehrynah \u2013 and all of our TIP Heroes \u2013 are making a huge difference in the lives of people around the world.\nI think most of you know this, but it\u2019s worth repeating:\u00a0 The scale of this problem is vast.\u00a0 There are nearly 25 million people currently victims of trafficking. \u00a025 million people.\u00a0 The United States is committed to fighting it because trafficking destabilizes societies, it undermines economies, it harms workers, it enriches those who exploit them, it undercuts legitimate business, and most fundamentally, because it is so profoundly wrong.\nTrafficking in persons violates the rights of all people to be free: free to do what you want, be who you want, make the life that you wish.\nEarlier this year, I had an opportunity to chair the first meeting of President Biden\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.\u00a0 We brought together 20 agencies across our government to talk about how to implement the National Action Plan that the President released last November.\u00a0 This, for those who don\u2019t know, is a three-year strategy that includes strengthening prosecutions of traffickers, enhancing victim protection, preventing the crime from occurring within our borders and abroad.\nThis report is a key part of our strategy.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we do every year, and as I said, a huge amount of work goes into actually bringing it to fruition.\nSo here\u2019s where we are.\u00a0 I think if you look at the report, you\u2019re going to see a mixed picture of progress.\u00a0 Twenty-one countries were upgraded a tier, because those governments made significant, increasing efforts to combat trafficking at home as well as for their citizens abroad.\u00a0 Eighteen countries were downgraded a tier, indicating that they either didn\u2019t make significant, increasing efforts to combat trafficking \u2013 or worse, that their governments have a state-sponsored policy or pattern of trafficking.\nAs the report details, corruption continues to be a top tool of traffickers.\u00a0 Complicit government officials may turn a blind eye to illicit activities, provide false documents for workers, tip off traffickers to impending raids.\u00a0 Corruption allows traffickers to continue to act with impunity.\nMeanwhile, in 11 countries, the government subjects its own people to trafficking \u2013 for example, as retaliation for political expression or through forced labor on projects of national interest.\nThat can look like subjecting people, including children, to forced labor in key sectors \u2013 mining, logging, manufacturing, farming \u2013 or sending members of ethnic minority groups to be \u201cderadicalized\u201d in camps.\nIt can also mean deploying workers around the world without telling them where they\u2019re going or what they\u2019ll be doing, confiscating passports and salaries, forcing them into dangerous work conditions, and constantly monitoring their movements.\nThat\u2019s what happened to Zhang Qiang, a Chinese laborer who signed onto a Belt and Road project in Indonesia last year.\u00a0 He was drawn by the higher pay, which he promised his daughter would be used to buy her a bed.\u00a0 But when he arrived in Indonesia, he was stripped of his passport, instructed to sign a contract for a longer duration and lower pay than he\u2019d been promised.\u00a0 Armed guards patrolled the workers\u2019 camp, making escape virtually impossible.\u00a0 After failing to get help from the Chinese embassy in Jakarta, he managed to board a boat to escape Indonesia via Malaysia, but then was apprehended by Malaysian authorities.\u00a0 By the last reporting, he was on track to be deported back to China.\nAnother challenge that you\u2019ll see laid out in this year\u2019s report is the climate crisis and the instability that it helps accelerate and create.\u00a0 As we\u2019re seeing in our hemisphere, climate is a key driver of mass migration, which can create, alas, ideal conditions for traffickers.\u00a0 And according to the UN Environment Programme, natural disasters \u2013 as well as the loss of livelihoods that they produce \u2013 may increase trafficking by up to 30 percent.\nEven the higher demand for clean energy can have unintended consequences.\nConsider, for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, that\u2019s home to much of the world\u2019s cobalt, which is a critical component for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles \u2013 something very important for our efforts to combat climate change.\u00a0 Some of that cobalt is mined by children, who are then pushed into work through coercion, through fraud, through force.\nI make this point because we need to be aware that as we tackle issues like climate and corruption throughout our \u2013 through our diplomacy, we also have to address how they intersect with trafficking in persons.\u00a0 Traffickers seize every opportunity to exploit victims for profit.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to be just as determined \u2013 in fact, more determined and more creative \u2013 to stop them.\nNow, the report also identifies several interventions that are making anti-trafficking efforts more effective.\u00a0 And one is this year\u2019s theme: more survivor engagement.\nSurvivors of human trafficking know \u2013 through deeply painful experience \u2013 the tactics that traffickers use, the obstacles that survivors face as they get free, the support that can help the most as they work to rebuild their lives.\u00a0 So what the report emphasizes and what I want to emphasize today is that need for us to listen \u2013 listen to them, empower them, partner with them at every level of our work.\nWe\u2019re seeing more organizations around the world ask survivors to serve as advisors \u2013 for example, the Albanian Coalition of Shelters for Victims of Trafficking, which provides victims and survivors with safe housing.\u00a0 They helped create an advisory board of survivors to make sure that their interventions are designed to actually fit the real-world needs of the populations that they\u2019re serving.\nOur own United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking is comprised entirely of survivors who make recommendations on federal anti-trafficking policies to the President\u2019s interagency task force.\nAnother important tool is better data collection, making sure that our practices and bringing this together to help track cases, to help allocate resources, to measure the effectiveness of anti-trafficking policies.\u00a0 And so we\u2019re focusing on that.\nIn the Philippines, to cite one example, the government launched a technology platform so that multiple agencies can work together to manage cases of victims as well as prosecute their traffickers.\nIn Uganda, the government partnered with two NGOs to launch the Trafficking in Persons mobile app platform.\u00a0 That helps investigators share details of cases they\u2019re working on.\u00a0 That helps bring more traffickers to justice.\nThese examples highlight the kind of information-sharing and partnership that we believe will bring us closer to our goal of a world that is free from human trafficking in all of its forms.\u00a0 And that\u2019s precisely the kind of information-sharing and partnership we hope this year\u2019s TIP Report will spur for governments as well as for advocates around the world.\nTraffickers don\u2019t respect borders.\u00a0 The harm caused by this crime is vast; it\u2019s varied.\u00a0 And it will continue to take relentless diplomacy, coordination, advocacy, and commitment, which is in this room and on this stage, if we\u2019re going to stop it.\nSo I simply want to say this:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you to everyone here for the dedication that you\u2019re showing to fighting trafficking and advancing human freedom and dignity, because at the heart of everything is the dignity that every human being deserves.\u00a0 And thank you, again, to everyone whose hard work \u2013 Kari, you and your team \u2013 made this report possible.\nThank you very much, and back to you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS JOHNSTONE:\u00a0 Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, for your poignant and effective words.\nI am now thrilled to turn to celebrating the 2022 TIP Report Heroes.\nPlease join me as we recognize and honor this year\u2019s six heroes.\nMr. Mohammed Tariqul Islam.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of his unyielding determination to provide assistance to victims of human trafficking, improve the investigation and prosecution capacity of the Bangladeshi Government, and increase cross-border collaboration to facilitate repatriation of survivors.\nMajor Mohammad al-Khlaifat.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of his critical role in implementing new ways to cooperate with the Jordanian anti-trafficking community, which led to formalized information sharing within the Public Security Directorate and with prosecutors, as well as a formal agreement with the Civil Aviation Regulatory Authority, to improve anti-trafficking efforts and ensure victims receive vital services.\nJudge Cornelius Wennah.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of his resolute efforts to build capacity in Liberia\u2019s criminal justice sector to successfully prosecute human traffickers and his strong advocacy for the active inclusion of traditional leaders and civil society organizations in Liberia\u2019s National Anti-Trafficking Task Force.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMs. Irena Dawid-Olczyk.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of her extraordinary leadership in directly assisting victims of human trafficking for more than a quarter of a century, lending her expertise in the creation of anti-trafficking training materials and films, and maintaining a strong relationship with the Polish Government to prevent the exploitation of refugees across the Poland-Ukraine border.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMs. Apinya Tajit.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn recognition of her heartfelt and unwavering persistence in advocating for workers exploited in forced labor, particularly in the fishing industry, assisting victims with their reintegration into society, and sharing her expertise with government officials and anti-trafficking authorities.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUnfortunately, our TIP Report Hero from Ukraine was not able to join us for this momentous occasion.\u00a0 However, we still want to honor her accomplishments.\u00a0 And you will see her photo on the screens: Ms. Kateryna Cherepakha.\nIn recognition of her remarkable engagement with the Government of Ukraine and international stakeholders to build the capacity of officials to identify victims of human trafficking, her tireless victim advocacy, and her work developing and conducting training courses for first responders as an OSCE National Expert.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd now, we will hear from one of the 2022 TIP Report Heroes.\u00a0 Please welcome Mr. Mohammed Tariqul Islam.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR ISLAM:\u00a0\u00a0Good afternoon.\u00a0 What a privilege to be here and speak on behalf of the 2022 TIP Report Heroes.\nI know for each of us it\u2019s an honor to be part of small network of individuals who have been recognized in the fight against human trafficking.\u00a0 But of course, I know the survivors are the real heroes each of us is able to serve.\nIn the UK last week, four-time gold medal Olympian Sir Mo Farah told his story as a survivor of human trafficking.\u00a0 His story reminds us that wherever we are in the world, human trafficking has left its mark, and we must do whatever we can to bring freedom, justice, and change.\u00a0 It is critical to ensure that the survivors are kept at the very heart of the story, and that is what I have learned the importance of at the organization I work for, Justice and Care.\nThe TIP Report Heroes give us hope.\u00a0 The network of heroes is a reminder of the power each of us has to respond to the growing issues of the human trafficking.\nAn example of that is Kateryna Cherepakha from Ukraine, who has been named as a TIP Hero this year for her work during the war in Ukraine helping the most vulnerable.\nMs. Tajit, the TIP Report Hero from Thailand, is passionate about doing what is right, not what is easy.\u00a0 She wants to see the maritime industry free from trafficking in her lifetime.\nMs. Dawid-Olczyk, the TIP Report Hero from Poland (inaudible) increase public diplomacy to de-escalate armed conflict and to prevent conflict-affected vulnerable people from being exploited.\nTIP Report Hero Judge Wennah from Liberia believes that this award will serve as an impetus to help his fight against human trafficking.\nAnd the TIP Report Hero Major Mohammad al-Khlaifat from Jordan appreciates all governmental and non-governmental efforts to combat trafficking in Jordan and hopes that Jordan can soon be free of human trafficking.\nThe awards and the TIP Report as a whole remind us of the power of the government to act.\u00a0 I know from my experience in Bangladesh that the TIP Report matters.\u00a0 It shapes government response and providing for the bandwidth organization, nonprofit, like Justice and Care, to work with them on effective solutions.\nThank you for your global leadership on the issue.\u00a0 Please do more of it, so that countries even more focus on the issue.\u00a0 In Bangladesh, that leadership has led many changes, including passing a high standard anti-human-trafficking law, development of national plan of actions, and setting up separate anti-human-trafficking tribunals.\u00a0 And those changes lead to tangible impact in the lives of the survivors.\nIn Bangladesh, we have the privilege of working with hundreds of survivors of human trafficking.\u00a0 We watch them with joy and pride as they rebuild their life, testify and use their experience to help others, and shape change at scale.\u00a0 Their stories demonstrate hope.\u00a0 The award is theirs.\nI\u2019ll close with a story.\u00a0 Ahali (ph) is a child of human trafficking we have the privilege of supporting.\u00a0 She returned home and feel nothing but shame.\u00a0 She wanted to take her life.\u00a0 We worked with her though, and she is now flourishing.\u00a0 She has developed a successful business, has a family, and using her experience to help others through a champion survivor program.\u00a0 She, too, is a hero.\nThanks to the Department of State and Secretary Blinken for sponsoring exchanges like the IVLP to help us connect to people around the globe working with the survivors and to fight eliminating human trafficking, and for recognizing the work that makes Ahali\u2019s and many other stories possible.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS JOHNSTONE:\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mohammed, for sharing that important message on behalf of all of this year\u2019s heroes. \u00a0Let\u2019s give this amazing group of leaders another round of applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It is such an honor to celebrate your important work.\nThe TIP Report continues to be a vital tool to inform the world about human trafficking and encourage governments to enhance and intensify anti-trafficking efforts in their countries.\u00a0 This year we chose to highlight the importance of meaningful engagement with trafficking survivors and the importance of integrating their expertise to improve anti-trafficking policies and strategies.\nIn the 2021 TIP Report, the department cited only seven governments with active efforts to consult and engage survivors.\u00a0 In the 2022 report, we have documented more than four times that number, 34 governments who actively \u2013 (applause) \u2013 absolutely.\u00a0 And these 34 governments actively took steps to incorporate survivor input into their policies and anti-trafficking approaches.\nThe 2022 TIP Report introduction cites governments with advisory councils and boards that include survivor leaders, elevating their participation among key policymakers, as in the United States and Albania.\nIn addition, this introduction also recognizes the governments that consulted experts with lived experience of human trafficking in the development of national action plans like Rwanda, Guyana, and the Netherlands.\nMany governments were added to this list \u2013 newly engaging survivors in national anti-trafficking planning efforts \u2013 during the most recent reporting period, like Bangladesh, as Mr. Islam noted, alongside Botswana, Finland, Iceland, North Macedonia, and Uganda, among others.\nIn addition, in Armenia, the Dominican Republic, India, and Spain, governments sought survivor input on reforming existing or new draft anti-trafficking laws.\nMany governments involved survivor leaders in shaping and delivering targeted awareness and outreach efforts, raising their voices to ensure impactful and clear messaging to facilitate change, as was done in Kosovo, Malta, Pakistan, Slovakia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates.\nAll this demonstrates that recognizing the importance of consulting survivors\u2019 expertise is a growing, global trend, and we are so pleased to be able to document these emerging efforts across the 2022 TIP Report narratives.\nAnd, of course, we know survivor leaders and experts with lived experience of human trafficking have advocated long and hard for a seat at the table and a substantial role in the development of governmental anti-trafficking programs and policies.\u00a0 It is because of their hard work that so many governments have been able to increase their efforts to meaningfully engage survivors and it is because of their commitment and expertise that we have a deeper understanding of how to do this engagement the right way.\nOne example I am proud to point to is the department\u2019s Human Trafficking Expert Consultant Network, comprising individuals with lived experience of trafficking.\u00a0 This year, network consultants worked with us to develop best practices to seek information from foreign governments and other key stakeholders for the 2022 TIP Report, ensuring that it more fully captures the impact of inequity and marginalization.\u00a0 Experts with lived experience in human trafficking have also helped us develop survivor-informed policies, programs, and resources for our government and beyond.\nIt is imperative that we engage survivors early and often.\u00a0 As we begin to see growing interest of our bilateral and multilateral partners to responsibly engage survivors, we are more hopeful than ever that elevated survivor voices will strengthen our anti-trafficking efforts around the globe.\u00a0 When governments and civil society prioritize partnerships with survivors, meaningful engagements can flourish and lead to better outcomes.\nEvery year, my office works in partnership with our colleagues across the State Department to ensure that the report is both comprehensive and accurate.\u00a0 This is the result of robust collaboration and healthy discussions, for which we are thankful.\u00a0 We also appreciate our colleagues across the U.S. Government as well as our dynamic allies around the world, both our foreign government counterparts and our collective partners in NGOs and international organizations, who continuously lend their voice to effect change through policy and law.\u00a0 We are especially grateful to those with lived experience of human trafficking whose expertise and contributions to this report cannot be overstated.\u00a0 Last, but not \u2013 definitely not least, I would like to give a heartfelt thanks to the experts and hard-working team of the Trafficking in Persons Office for your deep expertise and tireless commitment to this issue and this report.\u00a0 The hard work and long hours that you\u2019ve put into the production of this report are important and will effect real change as part of our robust diplomatic strategy, working with governments, community leaders, and civil society to put into action the report\u2019s prioritized recommendations.\nEach of us in this room has a role to play in the fight against human trafficking, whether in federal, state, or local

Blinken At a Virtual COVID-19 Global Action Plan Foreign Ministerial Meeting\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "speaker": "Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State", "location": "Washington, D.C.", "date": "July 19, 2022", "content": "\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 (Inaudible) thank you and Japan for your leadership role today as well as throughout.\u00a0 It is greatly appreciated, and I think I\u2019m in violent agreement with pretty much everything you just said.\u00a0 Japan has played a critical role in our Global Action Plan on COVID, particularly the last-mile support like expanding the cold chain technology so more vaccines can actually be shipped to more places.\u00a0 And let me thank, as well, Director General Tedros of the World Health Organization for joining us today and for his leadership every single day in this global effort.\nBack in February, when we foreign ministers last met on COVID, we launched the Global Action Plan to try to accelerate progress across six key lines of effort that were focused on the areas of the greatest need, where we identified the biggest gaps: getting more shots into arms, strengthening our supply chains, closing information gaps to try to increase confidence in vaccines, providing more support to frontline workers, increasing access to treatments and therapeutics, and finally, building a stronger, more effective global health architecture for the future.\u00a0 And you heard Foreign Minister Hayashi touch on virtually all of those lines.\nAnd what is so inspiring is that countries stepped up to take responsibility for individual lines of effort based on their unique capabilities, with rigorous coordination across all of these lines of efforts.\u00a0 Because ultimately, that\u2019s the only way that we\u2019ll finally succeed in ending the acute phase of this pandemic.\u00a0 So I think it\u2019s fair to say that since then, we\u2019ve achieved real progress on all six lines of effort that we decided on together.\nJust on shots in arms, for example, among the 92 low- and middle-income countries supported by COVAX\u2019s Advance Market Commitment program, vaccination coverage in that time has jumped from 28 percent at the end of January to 48 percent today.\u00a0 That is real, significant \u2013 insufficient, but real significant \u2013 progress.\nWe\u2019re seeing individual countries make major strides.\u00a0 For example, Malawi, which recently focused on vaccinating elderly people with a campaign that reached more people in two days than all previous efforts combined \u2013 targeted campaigns like these are critical to trying to close the vaccination gaps.\u00a0 To that end, the United States began distributing pediatric vaccine doses last month.\u00a0 This is for children ages five to twelve.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already donated more than six million doses to eleven countries and we\u2019re going to do more, because kids everywhere deserve protection from COVID-19.\nOn supply chains, our countries have begun working on an international clearinghouse platform for medical supplies that will make it easier for suppliers to actually connect with buyers, and that will produce much greater efficiency in this effort.\nOn closing the information gaps, we have campaigns underway in a number of countries to combat misinformation and disinformation.\u00a0 To cite a couple of examples, in the Philippines, the United States worked with religious leaders to boost vaccine confidence.\u00a0 These leaders incorporated COVID-19 messages into their prayer services.\u00a0 They reached more than half a million people in two parts of the country.\u00a0 Now 97 percent of eligible people in those places have been vaccinated.\nOn support for health workers, among the 92 low- and middle-income AMC countries, 75 percent of health workers have now been vaccinated.\nOn increasing access to treatments, this is the next challenge that we have to address together, and Foreign Minister, Hayashi also touched on this.\u00a0 And we do that, we think, by accelerating our work on robust test-to-treat programs that can connect a patient with treatment when they test positive.\u00a0 That reduces hospitalization; it saves lives.\nAnd finally, on enhancing global health security more broadly, last month the World Bank helped establish this new financial intermediary fund that Foreign Minister Hayashi mentioned, and we appreciate very much, Yoshi, Japan\u2019s initial contribution.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to help strengthen national, regional, and global capacities to prevent the next pandemic \u2013 or if not to prevent it, to make sure that we have in place what\u2019s necessary to mitigate it and to help people.\nSeveral donors have already stepped forward, including the United States.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made a pledge of $450 million.\u00a0 We hope more will contribute because, as we\u2019ve seen with COVID-19, sustainable financing is necessary to break the cycle that we often see: a panic when something happens and then neglect after a little while.\u00a0 That\u2019s what too often characterizes global health security.\nAll of these efforts will help us tackle other outbreaks happening around the world, like monkeypox and other diseases.\u00a0 The health of our people is simply more secure when we\u2019re doing this, when we\u2019re working together.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019ve already demonstrated that in the months since the Global Action Plan took off.\nLet me just commend everyone and every country that rose to the challenge and showed leadership across all of these different lines of effort.\u00a0 Our list of partner countries has grown.\u00a0 This meeting is actually significantly larger than it was six months ago.\u00a0 That\u2019s also an encouraging sign of the world\u2019s commitment.\nNow, again, to echo my friend the foreign minister, we have to keep going but with even greater urgency.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing a rise in infections in every region, as well as new variants that are more transmissible, even as vaccination remains a strong defense against hospitalization and death. Many of you are battling higher infection rates from BA.4 and BA.5, just as we are in the United States.\u00a0 These variants will continue to threaten us until we\u2019ve vaccinated more people everywhere.\nSo we can\u2019t be complacent.\u00a0 We have to continue to marshal attention.\u00a0 We have to continue to marshal commitment to ensure that ending COVID-19 remains a top focus for our governments and for our citizens.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got to continue to coordinate relentlessly with each other, because this is the definition of a challenge that no country can solve alone.\nWe\u2019ve got two months until we all gather at the UN General Assembly, so I would just urge that we accelerate our work so that when we meet in New York, we have new progress to announce, new ideas to discuss, new innovations to share.\nAgain, to everyone here today, thank you for being part of what really is a worthy enterprise on behalf of all of the people the world.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-to-employees-at-the-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence/", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecretary Antony J.

Blinken, Secretary of State", "audience": "Office of the Director of National Intelligence", "location": "McLean, Virginia", "date": "July 18, 2022", "content": "\n\nMR BARRETT:\u00a0 All right, good afternoon.\u00a0 Thank you for waiting.\u00a0 My name is Tim Barrett, lead the communications office.\u00a0 We\u2019re delighted to welcome the Secretary of State here, and it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce the Honorable Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDIRECTOR HAINES:\u00a0 Clap on demand.\u00a0 I know.\u00a0 So truly it is my great, great pleasure and distinct honor to introduce to you our Secretary of State Tony Blinken along with the wonderful Director of INR Brett Holmgren, who is with us today, and his Chief of Staff Suzy George (inaudible), and so we have quite the group that has come to visit us.\nI\u2019ve known Tony for close to 20 years, and I can tell you he is one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the great fortune to call a boss, a friend, or even a colleague.\u00a0 Tony has perhaps one of the most generous hearts you could hope for.\u00a0 He is empathetic, thoughtful, consistently guided by his values.\u00a0 He is brilliant, but that is not what makes him rare.\u00a0 I know a great many people who are extremely intelligent and capable, but to combine that with an ego that is focused on respect for others, a drive to consistently look for ways to make the world a better place, and a heart that prioritizes human dignity is truly unusual and so critical to have in leadership.\u00a0 And I am so grateful, frankly, that he is our voice to the world.\nWhen I first met Tony he was the staff director for then-Chairman Biden of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and I was a lawyer for the Bush administration, and I was detailed over to serve as a lawyer for the majority staff on the committee.\u00a0 And he immediately treated me with respect, always made me feel part of the team, and taught me more than I can recount here, though I will tell you I still rely on many of those lessons today.\nNot, though, when it comes to his sense of humor.\u00a0 I remember when we were working on the Law of the Sea Treaty, sometimes known by its acronym LOS, Tony threatened to get us t-shirts that said Get LOST in full caps, \u201cGet lost.\u201d\u00a0 He really does have a seriously questionable sense of humor.\nHe is, however, a voracious consumer of our work in the Intelligence Community.\u00a0 Tony often refers to analytic pieces that he has read in Principals Committee meetings and when he looks at our analysis he asks great questions, frequently making us better.\u00a0 But never have I seen him be anything other than respectful of our role to provide honest, high-quality, apolitical information, whether in our analysis, our briefings, or our counsel.\u00a0 And I can tell you that in my experience he does the same when he\u2019s advising the President.\nIn short, I am so grateful that he is with us today and that all of you will have a chance to hear from him yourself.\u00a0 So thank you so much, Tony, (inaudible).\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 Thank you, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you all very much, and wow, Avril, first, could you repeat that verbatim for my wife?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I\u2019d very much appreciate that.\u00a0 And in all seriousness, all I can really say is right back at you.\u00a0 I think everything you so generously said about me I would apply to you by a 10x factor.\u00a0 We go back a long ways.\u00a0 In fact, we worked so closely together on the SFRC staff, Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff, with then-Senator Biden.\u00a0 I am reminded that when I took that job where we worked together, I was staff director, and you all will appreciate this.\u00a0 When I took the job, someone said there are two words in your title of staff director; only one of them counts, and it\u2019s not director.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut thank you not just for the incredibly kind words but thank you for the outstanding leadership of this organization, which is simply absolutely vital to the well-being and security of the country that we share and the country that we love.\u00a0 We have had the great privilege of working together for all too long now.\u00a0 I think we must have started together in some kind of program for junior high school kids, but it\u2019s been a while.\u00a0 And there is also no doubt in my mind that there is no one better suited to be leading this community, particularly given the extraordinary complex challenges we\u2019re facing, than Director Haines.\nAnd though it\u2019s a relatively new office in the overall scheme of things, probably you are the only director, at least in the history of this institution, who can, if necessary, rebuild the electronics of an airplane, spar on a judo mat, talk theoretical physics, maybe sell a few books at the same time.\u00a0 So it\u2019s actually powerful because I think one of the things that makes Avril so extraordinary is the incredible diversity of her experience and the different inputs in her life.\u00a0 So much of what we are doing, so much of what you\u2019re doing, has more interconnections than at any time in our professional experience.\u00a0 Having someone with the breadth and depth of your experience at this particular moment in our history, I think we could not be in a better place.\nAnd I think all of you who have been working with the Director know that when it comes to being kind, when it comes to being decent, when it comes to having an intellect that is only surpassed by your character, we couldn\u2019t be better off.\u00a0 So to you, I am so grateful.\nMorgan?\u00a0 Where is Morgan?\u00a0 Is he here?\u00a0 So my hat\u2019s off to you as well.\u00a0 We go back a long ways, too.\u00a0 I can think of a few \u2013 just a few holidays ruined by some crisis where we were on a SVTC together at all hours in all parts of the world, and it\u2019s wonderful to continue this collaboration, have all of you \u2013 and have you in particular as a colleague.\nTo everyone who is joining across the ODNI enterprise, the broader Intelligence Community, it\u2019s very simple.\u00a0 I really wanted to come both to have a chance for an exchange this afternoon but just to say the two words that don\u2019t get said often enough but that are really, really important, and that\u2019s thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for the incredible dedication that you\u2019re bringing every single day to making sure that this government is informed and that our country is a little bit safer and a little bit more secure.\u00a0 Thank you for the extraordinary professionalism you bring to that and thank you for being wonderful colleagues across the board.\nAs Avril said, throughout my time in government, and it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m now coming on to 30 years, which is hard to believe \u2013 but on the Hill, at the White House during a couple of stints, at the State Department during a couple of stints, I have, and I continue every single day, to rely on the IC.\u00a0 And everyone I\u2019ve worked with, starting with the President of the United States, has relied on the IC every single day.\nWhen the Obama-Biden administration came to an end, and I started working with then-former Vice President Biden helping to set up an institution with the University of Pennsylvania, we spent a fair bit of time together getting that off the ground.\u00a0 And the thing that he told me he missed the most about being vice president was starting the day with the PDB.\u00a0 He felt like there was something so unique, so special about that, and that he\u2019d been a little bit disconnected from this lifeblood of information that you were providing to him as vice president every day.\u00a0 Well, I think one of the things he\u2019s most pleased about being back as President is being able to tap into that again.\nThere are a lot of truisms when it comes to the work you\u2019re in, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re any less true for being truisms.\u00a0 You do make sure that we on the policy-making side of the equation have the information, have the insights, have the analysis that we need to try to make the best decisions possible.\u00a0 No guarantee, alas, that we\u2019ll make the right decisions, but at least it won\u2019t be for lack of information, it won\u2019t be for lack of intelligence, it won\u2019t be for lack of analysis.\nAnd then the thing that is maybe as important as anything is the fact that you give us your unvarnished take on what we are learning, what we\u2019re picking up, including when it isn\u2019t what we would most hope we would hear; it\u2019s what we need to know.\u00a0 And as long as that continues, then I think we\u2019ll really and you really will be doing your jobs.\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s the most important thing of all.\nI said we\u2019re \u2013 state the obvious \u2013 dealing with a world of incredible complexity and a world that\u2019s incredibly fast-moving in ways it never was before.\u00a0 In my own 30 years, I think the thing that\u2019s changed most as I thought back on it is the information environment that we\u2019re operating in.\u00a0 Think about it this way.\u00a0 And again, a lot of this is obvious, but it\u2019s worth occasionally just stepping back and remembering this.\u00a0 When I started in government in 1993, the information set that we were dealing with as policy makers consisted primarily of three networks that everyone tuned into at 6:30 or 7 o\u2019clock at night; a couple of national newspapers \u2013 the\u00a0Times,\u00a0The Washington Post, maybe\u00a0The LA Times\u00a0or\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0\u2013 that everyone got a physical copy of, a hardcopy of, when they woke up in the morning by opening the door to their apartment or their house, and that was pretty much it.\u00a0 That was \u2013 there was a common base of information.\u00a0 Then, of course, there was the work that the Intelligence Community was providing and our embassies were providing.\nNow, of course, we\u2019re living in a world where we\u2019re getting some kind of information feed intravenously every millisecond.\u00a0 The pressure on policy makers to respond, to react, to just do something on the basis of every single input of information we get is intense, and the Director knows this from having been on both sides of the equation.\nI think one of the most important things that we can try to do and that you\u2019re making sure that we can do is to be also a little bit of a circuit breaker in this process, to be able to not only make sure that, yes, we are getting the information in real time and getting it before everyone else, but also helping to put it in perspective, helping to understand what it means, helping to make sure that to the extent we\u2019re being proactive, that\u2019s great and it\u2019s as we should be; to the extent we\u2019re being reactive, we\u2019re doing it in a smart and deliberate way, not simply reacting for the sake of reacting because there\u2019s intense pressure to do that.\nIt\u2019s really hard to get that right.\u00a0 I can just tell you as a policy maker it\u2019s very, very challenging.\u00a0 I know the demands on you to provide the information as quickly as possible \u2013 in a sense, sometimes, to get it first but not necessarily to get it right \u2013 is intense.\u00a0 And I would just say one of the things I think we have to do together is constantly remind ourselves that we need to try to make sure we get it right even as we get it first.\nBut when you\u2019re putting everything together \u2013 whether it\u2019s cyber security or food insecurity that we\u2019re dealing with now; the climate crisis and all of its implications, particularly the security implications that flow from it; the ongoing challenges posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; terrorist threats to the United States, which have not gone away, to our people, to our interests overseas, so much else \u2013 your ability to deliver the most relevant, the most timely, the most objective data, analysis, information is simply indispensable to us doing our jobs and keeping people safe, in collaborating effectively with our allies and partners, and getting results.\nThis collaboration piece to me is also more important than ever.\u00a0 Another truism that I repeat endlessly \u2013 but I think it\u2019s just important for people to step back and think about this \u2013 is that there is virtually not a challenge that we face as a country, as a nation, in terms of the impact of these issues on our people that we can effectively, truly effectively, advance alone.\u00a0 And whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s the impact of emerging technologies, each of these defies unilateral solutions, and at least in my 30 years, there\u2019s a greater premium than there\u2019s ever been before on finding ways to collaborate, to coordinate, to cooperate with others, whether it\u2019s other countries, whether it\u2019s other groupings of countries, whether it\u2019s other institutions.\u00a0 And we know how challenging that is.\u00a0 We know the frustrations that come along with that.\u00a0 But it is absolutely vital.\nAnd there, thanks to this extraordinary community, we have in my 30 years experienced one of the greatest examples of how the Intelligence Community enabled collaboration and cooperation the likes of which we have not seen before when it comes to Ukraine and when it comes to Russia\u2019s aggression.\u00a0 It is really one of the moments that I take the greatest satisfaction in and that I hope you take the greatest pride in, because we spent, as you all know very well, many months as we saw the mounting potential for Russian aggression against Ukraine trying to build the strongest possible collaboration and coalition of countries, both to make sure that support for Ukraine would be there if Russia followed through on the aggression, that pressure on Russia to end the aggression would be there through meaningful coordinated sanctions, and of course, that we would also make sure we were shoring up the defenses of our Alliance in NATO.\u00a0 And we were doing that even as we were pursuing as aggressively as we possibly could diplomacy to try to ward off the aggression at the end of last year.\nThe fact that we were able to bring to our allies and partners the extraordinary information that you were able to find \u2013 to do it in real time and to lay out for them and ultimately to lay out for the world, including at the United Nations \u2013 in the immediate lead-up to the aggression exactly what we saw the Russians as preparing to do and then do was extraordinary.\u00a0 Months of intelligence collection, reporting, analysis.\u00a0 You had confidence long before it happened that President Putin planned to launch this second military assault on Ukraine, and the fact that we were able and you were able to get to a place where we could downgrade and declassify an unprecedented amount of intelligence made all the difference in building that coalition so that we were ready to go on day one and we had the world with us.\nSo one fun \u2013 sort of fun \u2013 anecdote about this that \u2013 appreciate.\u00a0 You\u2019ll all remember that in the immediate run-up to the aggression, we had a pretty good idea that the Russians were likely to press go at a certain time, and then there were arguably a few things that derailed the exact timing.\u00a0 But we had been telling people this is likely to happen in the next 48, 72 hours.\u00a0 Got put off a little bit by some of their own misadventures; I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u00a0 On the day that it actually happened, I was on the phone that morning with a very senior European colleague who I will not identify.\u00a0 And I said to this colleague, \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen next 24 hours.\u201d\u00a0 And the colleague responded, \u201cYou\u2019re still saying that?\u201d\u00a0 This person called me at about 1:30 in the morning saying \u201cI guess you were right.\u201d\nWell, I was right only because you were right.\u00a0 And you were right before anyone, and that empowered our diplomacy in ways that I had never seen in my experience.\u00a0 So thank you, thank you, thank you for that.\u00a0 It\u2019s made all the difference in the world.\nNow, the only problem with the success that you\u2019ve achieved is that you\u2019re only as good as your last success.\u00a0 So we have to keep doing it.\u00a0 And we are.\u00a0 The exchanges that you\u2019re having, everything that we\u2019re doing with our counterparts around the world to continue to share whatever we can share about what we\u2019re seeing, what we\u2019re understanding, what we\u2019re analyzing, that is going to remain critical to the success that we\u2019re having.\nBut here\u2019s the bottom line:\u00a0 I suspect that people are going to be studying for a long time how we deployed the intelligence in this crisis way ahead of schedule, and they\u2019re going to be studying that for a long time.\u00a0 Moving forward, if we continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards of accuracy, credibility, transparency, I think we can leverage intelligence in new ways to support our diplomacy.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from this.\u00a0 There is a profound synergy between our intelligence and our diplomacy that we\u2019ve now discovered in new ways and that I think we really need to continue to make part of our thinking, not just when it comes to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine but across the board, whenever and wherever it\u2019s appropriate.\u00a0 It\u2019s the biggest difference-maker I\u2019ve seen.\nSo we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to use intelligence to try to spotlight dangerous, destabilizing activities by adversaries and competitors, but also I want to make sure that we\u2019re using it to leverage positive opportunities that are also out there and that we can\u2019t lose sight of.\u00a0 And maybe we\u2019ll have a chance to talk about that a little bit more this afternoon.\nSo let me just conclude with a couple of quick thoughts.\u00a0 So many of you have been working more than overtime these last few months, since before the war in Ukraine began.\u00a0 I know that that brings with it a lot of personal sacrifices when it comes to family, when it comes to friends, to make sure you get the job done.\u00a0 And yet this is still \u2013 more than still \u2013 it remains something that is immediately only the front burner, continues to demand tremendous time, tremendous energy, tremendous resources.\nAnd we have to keep digging in.\u00a0 The crucial updates on the Russian aggression; tracking disinformation, including threats to our elections; working with the State Department, with our allies to identify, to assess, to document evidence of atrocities in Ukraine as they happen \u2013 all of this is also part of the commitment we have to hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities.\nLast week we were able to put out to the public a lot of what we\u2019ve learned about one of the many horrific aspects of this aggression, and that is the deportation of hundreds of thousands of people from Ukraine into Russia \u2013 including orphans, some made orphan by the Russian aggression.\u00a0 It\u2019s so vital that the world continue to see and understand the human dimension of what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 So much of this becomes an abstraction, but being able to share with the world what we\u2019ve learned about some of what this means on a human level is, I think, hugely important.\nHaving said all of that and despite this unprecedented declassification strategy, you know this better than I:\u00a0 Much of what you do, most of what you do, remains outside of public view.\u00a0 But what I really wanted to share again today, and I know this not just from me but, even more important, from the President, is that he knows, I know because I see it every morning, how much you\u2019re doing to advance our interests, to defend our security, to keep this country safe.\nSpeaking for the State Department, we\u2019re particularly grateful for the partnership with ODNI and all of the IC agencies.\u00a0 Now, some of you know this, some of you don\u2019t:\u00a0 Our Bureau of Intelligence and Research, INR, actually has its roots in the Office of Strategic Services, which was created during the Second World War to try to coordinate espionage behind enemy lines, which actually makes INR the oldest civilian intelligence element in the U.S. Government, even older than the CIA.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Just thought I\u2019d mention that for the record.\nAnd I\u2019m especially pleased to be joined here today by the leader of INR, Assistant Secretary Brett Holmgren, who\u2019s doing an outstanding job for us.\u00a0 And what I hear from Brett virtually every single day is the strength of the collaboration and the coordination we have across the IC.\u00a0 So much of the work that our team does at INR is possible because of the collection, the analysis, the coordination that happens here at ODNI and across the entire Intelligence Community.\nAnd through the Joint Duty Rotation program we have literally dozens of IC employees with unique skills, technical expertise, perspectives that have been placed in bureaus across the State Department.\u00a0 Your diplomat colleagues basically help us do our jobs better, smarter, more effectively.\u00a0 So thank you for that.\nThe bottom line is this, two words that really stand out: professionalism, patriotism.\u00a0 That sums up the IC for me.\u00a0 That sums up my experience with it.\u00a0 And maybe I\u2019ll just add one other P, and that\u2019s partnership.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful for it every single day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n"}]
