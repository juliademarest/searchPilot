		"content": "ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Good morning. Buenos d\u00edas. I would like to welcome all of you, especially our guests from Colombia. Bienvenidos a todos. This is the 10th year we mark the \u2013 this High-Level Dialogue, and we are honored to host this year. The High-Level Dialogues present remarkable opportunities to engage at a deeper level on our shared interests. The dialogue continues to speak to the strength of the bonds between our two countries. We are especially honored today by the presence of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who will formally open the dialogue.\nMr. Secretary, welcome.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good morning, everyone. Wonderful to see you all here. And to our friends from Colombia, bienvenido. I just am particularly pleased to do this because I also have a little history with this. In fact, I\u2019ve taken part in these dialogues going back to 2015 and 2016 when I was deputy secretary of state. So as Brian said, this has been an ongoing and, I believe, very important process between our two countries.\nA very special welcome, \u00c1lvaro, to you. Wonderful to have you here for what is indeed the 10th dialogue between \u2013 High-Level Dialogue between our countries.\nI had the opportunity to lead our delegation to the last dialogue, in Bogot\u00e1, in 2021, and it\u2019s a testament to the strength of the relationship that this exchange, as I said, has continued, and indeed has expanded, across administrations in both of our nations.\nThe dialogue \u2013 like a two-centuries-old friendship \u2013 is built on a shared foundation of two vibrant democracies committed to ensuring that our people can reach their full potential.\nWe recognize that when it comes to tackling the global challenges that are affecting the lives of Colombians and Americans alike \u2013 from the existential threat posed by climate change to the unprecedented movement of people across our hemisphere \u2013 we\u2019re simply better off when we\u2019re tackling these challenges together. And the ripple effects of our cooperation on these and other issues extend far beyond our two countries. They extend to the hemisphere; indeed they extend to the world.\nAcross the upcoming dialogue, we will focus on concrete steps to strengthen our cooperation and work to deliver tangible results for our people. So let me just take a few minutes to highlight some of the areas where we are going to work to do that.\nWe\u2019ll continue working to help Colombia reach its ambitious climate goals, from providing ongoing technical assistance on wind and solar projects to strengthening protection of the Amazon.\nWe\u2019ll expand pathways for farmers, for textile producers, and other small- and medium-sized businesses in rural areas to get their products to global markets, and reap the benefits of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement.\nOur dialogue will also focus, of course, on improving civilian security. For decades, we have worked to strengthen cooperation on security and law enforcement, and that will continue.\nAt the same time, we recognize that to sustainably reduce violence, we have to tackle the root causes of insecurity \u2013 like corruption, like impunity \u2013 impunity for crimes \u2013 human rights abuses, and the lack of economic opportunity.\nThat\u2019s why we continue to partner on bolstering the rule of law and expanding access to justice. And it\u2019s also why USAID is investing $60 million over five years to expand opportunities for Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities.\nEnsuring equitable development is a central focus of the Ethnic Chapter of the 2016 Peace Accord. It recognizes that there can be no lasting peace without justice and equality for the country\u2019s underserved communities. Back in October, I joined Vice President Marquez at the extraordinary Fragmentos Museum; I had the honor of signing the United States on as the chapter\u2019s first international accompanier.\nAmbassador Murillo \u2013 who is here today \u2013 was with us in Bogot\u00e1 on that historic day. He has dedicated much of his life to giving voice to these communities, including the Ethnic Chapter.\nIn the time since we signed on as an accompanier, the U.S. embassy in Colombia, led by our Charg\u00e9 Michael[1] Palmieri, who is with us here today as well, has dedicated a full team supporting the Ethnic Chapter\u2019s implementation, building on our longstanding partnerships with both Colombia\u2019s Government and with civil society. And let me just give one example of those relationships.\nA few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to join our First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, in honoring International Women of Courage at the White House. The awardees included Josefina Klinger, a remarkable Afro-Colombia leader who rallied her community around transforming the national park where they live into an ecotourism destination, preserving the environment, providing a sustainable livelihood to local families.\nFor years, we have been a proud supporter of her organization, including when she was threatened by drug trafficking organizations for the work that she was doing.\nCountering these illicit groups and the flow of illegal drugs is a key part of our ongoing discussions on security, including here at the High-Level Dialogue. We\u2019re bringing a holistic approach to this challenge.\nThat means looking at ways to further reduce demand by investing in substance abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery for those who are struggling with addiction in our countries \u2013 because this is fundamentally a public health problem.\nAnd it means discussing ways to reduce supply \u2013 from strengthening interdiction by land and sea, to providing vulnerable communities with alternative ways to earn a living.\nThe dialogue also gives us an opportunity to deepen our joint efforts to address unprecedented migration across our hemisphere. Indeed, we are all experiencing unprecedented migration around the world. There are more people on the move, forcibly deplaced from their homes around the world \u2013 more than 100 million \u2013 than at any time since we\u2019ve been recording these numbers. Colombia was a crucial partner in shaping the Los Angeles Declaration, which has put its principles into practice in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. More than 1.5 million Venezuelans have been granted Temporary Protective Status in Colombia, allowing them to work, to send their kids to school, to access public health services.\nHere again, I had a chance to meet last time I was in Bogot\u00e1 with some Venezuelan families \u2013 this is back in October at the integrata centers \u2013 and heard first-hand how TPS has allowed them to become productive members of their new communities. Colombia is showing the way that migration, when it\u2019s managed safely, humanely, and as a region, can actually increase stability and can be an opportunity, not a burden, for communities.\nThe United States has been a steadfast partner in these efforts, providing more than $900 million in humanitarian, economic, development, and health assistance to Colombia, to help Colombia address the consequences of the Venezuela crisis.\nNext month, we will host our first-ever Cities Summit of the Americas in Denver, Colorado. The mayor of Bogot\u00e1, my host at the integrata center, will be there, along with the mayors of Cartagena, Barranquilla, dozens of other cities across the hemisphere, including in the United States. This summit will allow them to share best practices in tackling many of the issues that we discuss here.\nI think one of the things we know is that there needs to be and there is an integrated response across national governments, but these challenges also have answers in work \u2013 at a subnational level, between and among municipalities, between municipalities and the federal government, states, et cetera. Again, it\u2019s a reminder that important as this dialogue between our national governments is, there are U.S.-Colombian dialogues at every level of our societies \u2013 between our governments, businesses, civil society, and directly between our citizens.\nAnd I\u2019m convinced, based on the experience that we\u2019ve had over many years, that these dialogues are one of the most important ways to actually benefit our people, to benefit our communities, to benefit the region that we share.\nSo with that, thank you all for being here, thank you for your participation, for all the hard work that\u2019s gone into today, for all the hard work that will continue today and in the days that follow.\nAnd with that, \u00c1lvaro, the floor is yours. (Applause.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER LEYVA: (Via interpreter) Mr. Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken, it is a great honor for me to be here with you. I\u2019d first like to extend greetings from President Petro, and to, of course, President Biden. We are allies. And this is not new; we\u2019ve been for a long time. We are actually on the tenth High-Level Dialogue, and I have to say it\u2019s impressive. Look at the delegation we\u2019re bringing to you. Behind each and every one of these people there\u2019s a wise person, and I\u2019m not exaggerating. People who have great reputation on the moral and intellectual levels, and they have devoted their careers to the seven points that once again bring us here, which are the social and economic opportunities; public diplomacy; the environment and climate change; energy, mining, and infrastructure; democracy, good governance, and human rights; security, counternarcotics, and rural development; and migration.\nThese are issues that in the eighth and ninth dialogues were there, but they didn\u2019t have the significance that they have today. Today there\u2019s a geopolitical dimension; new things are happening every day; new visions are crystallizing on each one of these topics. And so today\u2019s conference goes beyond expectations. We are allies; we truly are, because we acknowledge that we have a new role in this world. Just to give you an example, we used to be a nation known for cocaine, but now we are one of the biggest sponges when it comes to observing solutions for seeking ways of putting an end to the disappearance of humankind. We\u2019re saving the planet, and so our relationship is thus modified. Because there\u2019s a new head of state, he has a discourse, but it\u2019s not surprising \u2013 there will never be a surprise coming from my administration, in our relationships, and certainly not with \u2013 in our relationships with our longtime allies, such as the United States.\nThis brings me to manifest something that is very important: migration. Migration is a political issue for many countries \u2013 for us, for the United States, for Mexico. That\u2019s why the President has managed to convince Mexico of the importance of celebrating as soon as possible a Latin American conference on migration.\nBangladesh had never been through Colombia. Afghanistan had never gone through Colombia. China had never gone through Colombia. But they\u2019re coming through Colombia too on their way north, and they\u2019re coming back. We not only have the migrants coming from Venezuela, which of course has its own circumstances, but we\u2019re seeing a phenomenon that touches the whole planet. So I wanted to tell you that, just as Mr. Petro said, we are going to celebrate that conference on migration as soon as possible.\nThe conference on drug trafficking \u2013 that stopped being a Colombian topic. There is a multinational organization that is impacting the globe. We saw that in Ecuador. In one single day, 11 attacks that left people dead. Talking to people \u2013 Lula, right after he took charge, he said, \u201cPresident Petro, Brazil \u2013 in Brazil the multinational drug enterprise is creating problems for us. We have to attack them with intelligence.\u201d So how best to do this? By using the knowledge that Colombia has and creating and celebrating a conference on migration that involves the whole continent to discuss drug trafficking, and we will not only comply with what was said in Havana, but also we will analyze demand because we\u2019re all in the same boat here. I think it\u2019s of the utmost importance to highlight the call that President Petro has placed upon all of us.\nIn terms of fighting greenhouse emissions, something completely new, we are going to hold \u2013 and I think Canada has already said yes \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a conference on the power interconnection grid from Patagonia, just so we can bring to the North electricity coming from renewal \u2013 clean energy methods. This is just to say that this High-Level Dialogue goes beyond business as usual, and we are going to need the U.S. to be present, to be by our side in each and every one of these topics, because we are the same people, the same continent, the same security, the same issues \u2013 perhaps a little bigger now up north, of course, given the global responsibility that the U.S. has in its role in the world. But each one of the people that you see here is an ally, and they can bring solutions \u2013 definitive solutions to the problems that are afflicting the world.\nI am very thankful for your presence. Please take into consideration this new vision that President Petro is bringing. He is trying his best to deal with continental circumstances, to deal with the problems afflicting humanity, and of course to deal with problems that are also happening in the U.S. We\u2019re all in the same boat, and we are guided by the same goal.\nThank you for being here today. (Applause.)\nASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Thank you, Foreign Minister Leyva. Thank you, Secretary Blinken. And with that powerful introduction, I have the honor to declare the 10th High-Level Dialogue open. I expect great things, and I am sure that you will deliver for both of our peoples.\nHave a great day. (Applause.)\nFrancisco \u2191",

Chairman Diaz-Balart, Chairwoman Granger, Ranking Member Lee, Ranking Member DeLauro, all the members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity today to speak with you about the FY24 budget for the State Department and USAID.  But also, thank you day-in, day-out for the work that we\u2019re doing together.  This is critical for us.  We appreciate deeply the work of this committee, and I really look forward to the year ahead as we work together to try to make sure, together, that we have the strongest possible tools to advance America\u2019s interests around the world.\nAnd second, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Lee, thank you for \u2013 both of you \u2013 for your strong and positive words about the State Department \u2013 the people of the State Department.  I couldn\u2019t agree with you more.  I am so deeply honored for this period of time to be leading them and serving with them.  And I deeply appreciate the appreciation you\u2019ve expressed for the work that they do, day-in, day-out.  So thank you for that.\nAnd I could not agree more \u2013 we are at an inflection point.  The post-Cold War era is over, and there is an intense competition underway right now to shape what comes next.  The United States has a positive vision for the future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, that is prosperous.\nThis budget will help us advance that vision and deliver on the issues that matter to the American people, by preparing us to take on two major sets of challenges that are distinct but also interconnected and overlapping.\nThe first set is posed by our strategic competitors \u2013 the immediate, acute threat posed by Russia\u2019s autocracy and aggression, most destructively through its brutal aggression against Ukraine, and of course, the long-term challenge that is posed by the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nThe second set of challenges is posed by shared global tests that we have to meet, including the climate crisis, migration, food and energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly affect the lives of our fellow citizens, as well as their livelihoods, and people around the world.\nWith this committee\u2019s leadership and support, including through the FY23 Omnibus, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical position than we were a few years ago to take on these challenges.  We have drawn enormous power from investments that we\u2019ve made here at home in our economic strength and technological edge, including through the Infrastructure Investment Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has never been stronger, and I think that\u2019s in part because we have reinvested in them, working to re-engage them, rejuvenate them, re-energize them.\nWe\u2019re expanding our presence in critical regions, like the Indo-Pacific.  And we\u2019re leading unprecedented coalitions to confront aggression and address humanitarian crises around the world.\nThe FY24 budget request for the State Department and USAID meets this moment.  The budget will sustain our security, our economic and energy and humanitarian support for Ukraine, so that we ensure that President Putin\u2019s war remains a strategic failure.\nThe budget will also strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC.  President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific.  That\u2019s why this proposal asks for an 18 percent increase in our budget for that region for FY \u2013 over FY23.  The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory proposals \u2013 I suspect we\u2019ll come back to those \u2013 for new, innovative investments to outcompete China, including by enhancing our presence in the region, ensuring that what we and our fellow democracies have to offer \u2013 including things like maritime security, disease surveillance, energy infrastructure, digital technology \u2013 is more attractive than the alternative being proposed.\nThe budget will help us push back on advancing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening democracies around the world including through supporting independent media, countering corruption, defending free and fair elections.  And it will allow us to pay our contributions to international organizations because we do need to be at the table wherever and whenever new international rules, standards, norms are being decided that affect the livelihoods of our people.  Wherever they\u2019re being debated and decided, we need to be there.\nThe budget will also allow us to continue leading the world in addressing these global challenges, from food and energy insecurity to climate and health crises.  Just on that last point: we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which I believe is one the greatest achievements in our foreign policy over the last couple of decades.  And to Ranking Member Lee, to you and others, for your strong support and leadership on this, I think it\u2019s been a great tribute and credit to our country.  It\u2019s something I hear, as I travel, for example, throughout Africa.  It saved 25 million lives.  This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/AIDS while advancing health security more broadly through a new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I look forward to working with Congress to establish this year.\nThe budget will advance our efforts to modernize our department, including by expanding our training float, updating our technology, carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, including to make our overseas missions more accessible.  I\u2019m grateful for the progress that we\u2019ve already made together, including Congress\u2019s support in updating the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and the Accountability Review Board, to give us the flexibility to open new missions and to better manage the risks that our people face around the world.\nWe know there\u2019s more to do, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with Congress, working with this committee, to accelerate modernization efforts so that the department can better attract, retain, and support our first-rate workforce that you referred to.  We\u2019re in a competition there, too, for talent, and I want to make sure we have a department that attracts that workforce and keeps them.\nFinally, the budget will further what is a personal priority for me that\u2019s been referenced today already, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan allies.  Keeping our promises to those who stood by us and served with us remains an unwavering priority for me.  The budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.\nWhen I took on this role, one of the things that I was dead serious about was working to restore Congress\u2019s place as an equal partner in our foreign policymaking.  I really am serious and committed to that.  I, Mr. Chairman, deeply appreciate the conversations we\u2019ve had and the work that I hope we can do together.\nSo with that, I welcome questions, comments.  Thank you.",

To you, to Ranking Member Meeks, to all the members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about the administration\u2019s proposed FY24 budget for the State Department and the Agency for International Development.\nLet me say at the outset that I join both of you \u2013 I join every member of this committee \u2013 in saluting all of our veterans of Afghanistan, saluting those who lost their lives, gave their lives, so that their fellow citizens could enjoy a greater measure of security, and particularly the presence of Sergeant Gee\u2019s mother here today; I am humble in your presence.  I think of the 13.  I think of the 2,402 Americans who lost their lives over 20 years in Afghanistan, serving and protecting our country.  I think of the 20,000-plus wounded.  And I think of so many others who served and have injuries of a different kind, including members of my State Department team.  And I join you, Mr. Chairman, I join you, Ranking Member Meeks, I think I join every member of this committee in being determined that we look \u2013 not only look but draw the lessons from 20 years, including the last year in Afghanistan.\nWe do meet at an inflection point.  The post-Cold War world is over.  There is an intense competition underway to determine what comes next.

Very good to be with you today as always, and thanks for the opportunity to speak to the administration\u2019s proposed FY24 budget for the State Department and the Agency for International Development.\nWe meet at an inflection point and I think that\u2019s reflected actually in what both the chairman and ranking member said.

I\u2019m grateful for the progress that we\u2019ve already made together, including Congress\u2019s support in updating the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and Accountability Review Board, which gives us more flexibility to open new missions and to better manage the risks that our people face around the world.  We know there\u2019s more to do, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with Congress to accelerate modernization efforts so that the department can better attract and retain and support our first-rate workforce as they advance our interests in what is a complex and fast-moving landscape.\nFinally, the budget will further a priority for me, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan allies.  Keeping our promises to those who served with us remains an unwavering priority.  This budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.\nMr. Chairman, as you referenced, when I began this role, I committed to restoring a real partnership with Congress as an equal partner in our foreign policymaking.  And I really value tremendously the work that we\u2019ve done together, the engagements that we\u2019ve had, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Risch, and look forward to continuing those, and also to working on this budget together as we move forward in the months ahead.\nSo thank you very much for having me here today.",

		"location": "WASHINGTON, D.C.",
		"date": "MARCH 22, 2023",
		"content": "SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you very, very much.  Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, very good to be with you.  Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, to all the committee members here today, thank you for this opportunity to speak with you about our proposed FY24 budget for the State Department and USAID.\nAnd I think as you\u2019ve both laid out in different ways, we are meeting at an inflection point.  The post-Cold War era is over, and there is an intense competition underway to shape, to determine what comes next.\nWe, the United States, have a positive vision for the future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, that is prosperous.   And it\u2019s our belief that the budget that we put forward will help advance that vision and deliver on issues that actually matter to the American people, particularly by preparing us to effectively meet two broad sets of challenges.\nThe first is the challenge posed by our strategic competitors \u2013 the immediate, acute threat posed by Russia\u2019s autocracy and aggression, most destructively, of course, through its brutal aggression against Ukraine, and the long-term challenge from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nThe second set of challenges is really posed by shared global tests, including the climate crisis, migration, food and energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly impact the lives and livelihoods of Americans and people around the world.\nWith this committee\u2019s leadership and support, including through the FY23 Omnibus, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical position than we were two years ago, hence our ability to deal with these challenges I think has been enhanced.\nWe have drawn enormous power from investments that we\u2019ve made in our own economic strength and technological edge at home, including through the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has never been stronger.  In fact, we\u2019ve been building on it, not only strengthening existing alliances and partnerships, but building new coalitions of countries and other institutions that are fit for purpose.  We\u2019re expanding our presence in critical regions, like the Indo-Pacific.  We\u2019re leading the unprecedented coalitions to confront aggression and address humanitarian challenges around the world.\nThe \u201924 budget request for the State Department and USAID meets this moment head on.\nThis budget will sustain our security, economic, energy, and humanitarian support for Ukraine to ensure that President Putin\u2019s war remains a strategic failure.\nIt will strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC.  President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is why this proposal asks for an 18 percent increase in our budget for that region over FY23.  The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory proposals \u2013 and we\u2019re happy to talk about why we proceeded this way \u2013 for new innovative investments to outcompete China, including by enhancing our presence in the region, and ensuring that what we and our fellow democracies are able to offer, including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean energy infrastructure, digital technology, is more attractive than any alternative.\nThe budget will help us push back on advancing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening democracies around the world, including through supporting independent media, countering corruption, defending free and fair elections.  And it will allow us to pay our contributions to international organizations, because we need to be at the table wherever and whenever new international rules that affect the livelihoods of our people are being debated and being decided.\nThe budget will allow us to continue leading the world to addressing these global challenges, from food and energy insecurity to climate and health crises.  And just on that last point, as you all know, we\u2019re celebrating now the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which I think is one of the greatest achievements in our foreign policy over the last decades.  It\u2019s helped us save 25 million lives around the world.  This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/AIDS, while advancing health security more broadly through a new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I look forward to working with Congress to establish this year.\nThe budget will advance our efforts to modernize the State Department, including by expanding our training float, updating our technology, carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, including to make our overseas missions more accessible.  I\u2019m grateful for the progress we\u2019ve already made together, including Congress\u2019s support in updating the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and Accountability Review Board to give us some of the flexibility that we need to open new missions and better manage the risks that we face.  We know there\u2019s more to do, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with Congress to accelerate these modernization efforts so that the department can better attract, better retain, and support a first-rate workforce as they advance our interests in what is a very complex and fast-moving world.\nFinally, the budget will further a personal priority for me, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan allies.  Keeping our promises to those who served alongside the U.S. remains an unwavering priority.  This budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.\nWhen I took on this role, I committed to doing my part to try to restore Congress\u2019s place as an equal partner in our foreign policymaking.  I\u2019m determined to continue to do that and very much appreciate the work that we\u2019ve been able to do with this committee over the last couple of years and look forward to the work ahead.\nAnd with that, I welcome any questions.  Thank you.",

We have a longstanding, historic, and steadfast partnership with Morocco, which has been such an important force for stability, for peace, for progress and moderation \u2013 something that we deeply value and appreciate.\nWe are working together in so many different areas.

But we have a lot of work that we\u2019ve done together over the last couple of years, and I was eager for this opportunity to \u2013 both to catch up and to move forward on some of the things that we\u2019re working on together.\nSo welcome, it\u2019s very good to have you here.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:  Thank you.

Our friendship is solid and historic, and our partnership I think has never been stronger as it is today.  His Majesty King Mohammed VI values this partnership based on our shared commitments for peace, stability, and prosperity.\nOur discussions are always productive and constructive, and I think today I\u2019m looking forward for the same spirit to serve our people but also peace and stability worldwide.

		"audience": "PRESS BRIEFING ROOM",
		"location": "WASHINGTON, D.C.",
		"date": "MARCH 20, 2023",
		"content": "Play Video\nMR PATEL:  Good morning, everybody.  And welcome back to those of us that were on the road with us last week.\nThe Secretary will make some very brief remarks and take a couple of questions before he has to head back upstairs for some engagements.  Assistant Secretary Barclay and Ambassador Van Schaack, though, will hang back downstairs to answer some more Q&A once the Secretary departs.\nSecretary, the floor is yours.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Vedant, thank you.  Well, good morning, everyone.\nLet me just start with some very good news this morning, and that is the release of Jeffrey Woodke after more than six years in captivity.  I want to thank the Government of Niger, where I was just last week, for its important assistance in bringing him home.  I also want to thank our team, starting with Special Envoy Roger Carstens, all of those who have been working at the department to bring him home, tireless efforts, and I\u2019m very pleased that we are now seeing that come to fruition today.\nAs you know, I have no higher priority or focus than bringing home any unjustly detained American, wherever that is in the world.  We won\u2019t rest until they\u2019re all home and, like Jeffrey, reunited with their families.\nThis morning, I\u2019ll be launching the 2022 Human Rights Report.  But just before I turn to that, I want to speak to what\u2019s happening right now in Moscow.\nToday, and throughout this week, President Xi is meeting with President Putin in Russia.  We expect that China may use this visit to reiterate calls for a ceasefire under its peace proposal.\nThe United States welcomes any initiative that advances a just and durable peace.  China\u2019s proposal includes elements that we have long supported, including ensuring nuclear safety, resolving the humanitarian crisis, protecting civilians.\nAnd indeed, the first element calls for upholding sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all countries.\nThe fundamental element of any plan for ending the war in Ukraine and producing a just and durable peace must be upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nAny plan that does not prioritize this critical principle is a stalling tactic at best or is merely seeking to facilitate an unjust outcome.  That is not constructive diplomacy.\nCalling for a ceasefire that does not include the removal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory would effectively be supporting the ratification of Russian conquest.  It would recognize Russia\u2019s attempts to seize a sovereign neighbor\u2019s territory by force.  It would enable Russia to further entrench positions in Ukraine.  And a ceasefire now, without a durable solution, would allow President Putin to rest and refit his troops and then restart the war at a time more advantageous to Russia.\nThe world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia \u2013 supported by China or any other country \u2013 to freeze the war on its own terms.  Such a move would violate the UN Charter and delay \u2013 defy, excuse me \u2013 the will of the 141 countries who have condemned Russia\u2019s war in the United Nations General Assembly.\nOne party to this conflict \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 has already put forward a just peace formula.  If China is committed to supporting an end to the war based on the principles of the UN Charter as called for in point one of its plan, it can engage with President Zelenskyy and Ukraine on this basis and use its influence to compel Moscow to pull back its forces.\nRussia\u2019s purported annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, including vast areas it doesn\u2019t even control, and its ongoing, brutal attacks on civilians make clear that President Putin currently has no interest in such a peace.\nThat President Xi is traveling to Russia days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Putin suggests that China feels no responsibility to hold the Kremlin accountable for the atrocities committed in Ukraine, and instead of even condemning them, it would rather provide diplomatic cover for Russia to continue to commit those very crimes.\nNow, every year, I come to this podium for the launch of the Human Rights Report.  I do so because the report embodies the importance of human rights for American diplomacy and for our vision of an open, free, prosperous, and secure world.\nHuman rights are universal.  They aren\u2019t defined by any one country, philosophy, or region.  They apply to everyone, everywhere.\nThis report makes a factual, objective, and rigorous accounting of human rights conditions around the world, looking at nearly 200 countries and territories.  And, importantly, it applies the same standards to everyone: our allies and partners, and countries with which we have differences.\nThe goal of this report is not to lecture or to shame.  Rather, it is to provide a resource for those individuals working around the world to safeguard and uphold human dignity when it\u2019s under threat in so many ways.  And while this report looks outward to countries around the world, we know the United States faces its own set of challenges on human rights.\nOur willingness to confront our challenges openly, to acknowledge our own shortcomings \u2013 not to sweep them under the rug or pretend they don\u2019t exist \u2013 that is what distinguishes us and other democracies.\nThe report makes clear that, in 2022, in countries across every region, we continued to see a backsliding in human rights conditions \u2013 the closing of civic space, disrespect for fundamental human dignity.\nThe report details the appalling and ongoing abuses committed by the regime in Iran against its own people.  In the wake of the tragic death of Mahsa Amini, authorities have killed hundreds of peaceful protestors, including dozens of children, and have arbitrarily detained thousands.\nIranian forces are using torture and gender-based violence against arrested protesters.  Journalists and lawyers are harassed and pre-emptively detained.  Sham trials and hasty executions are used to further intimidate the people of Iran.\nThe international community has come together to condemn and confront Iran\u2019s brutal crackdown, and we\u2019ll continue to act in support of the right of the Iranian people to speak out for their fundamental freedoms.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban relentlessly discriminates against and represses women and girls, so far issuing 80 decrees and \u2013 that restrict women\u2019s freedom of movement and their right to education and work.  The Taliban\u2019s December edict barring female employees of non-governmental organizations from the workplace imperils the tens of millions of Afghans who depend on humanitarian assistance for their very survival.\nHuman rights have further eroded in Burma, where the military regime brutalizes the population.  Thousands of activists have been killed by the authorities \u2013 including four pro-democracy leaders executed last summer.\nThe PRC continues its abuses, including genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs, repression of Tibetans, crackdown on basic rights in Hong Kong, and targeting of individuals on the mainland for exercising fundamental freedoms.\nIn Cuba, courts have issued draconian jail sentences to hundreds of people for protesting for their rights.  And in Nicaragua, the authoritarian government continues to detain political prisoners and hold them in appalling prison conditions.\nThe 2022 Human Rights Report is also a reminder of the extraordinary courage of so many \u2013 activists, journalists, lawyers, government officials, regular citizens \u2013 who stand up to these abuses.  Many do so at great personal risk of retaliation, harassment, detention, torture, even death.\nIn February, we celebrated ten Global Human Rights Defender awardees \u2013 individuals from around the world who are promoting and defending fundamental freedoms, from combatting slavery, to advocating for families of those forcibly disappeared, to demanding better wages and working conditions for low-income laborers, to representing political prisoners on death row.  This report honors them.\nI\u2019m also proud of my colleagues here at the State Department \u2013 in Washington and at every post around the world \u2013 for not only reporting and documenting human rights abuses but also drawing on the power and purpose of American diplomacy to advance human dignity.\nNow, as you know, I recently traveled to Ethiopia, where I had a very productive discussion with Prime Minister Abiy and his team.  I also met with Getachew Reda, the TPLF signatory to the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, who was just selected to be the leader of its interim administration.  I commended both sides for reaching that agreement and the significant progress made in its implementation.\nWith this agreement in place, the fighting has stopped, humanitarian assistance is flowing, services are being restored, human rights[i] in northern Ethiopia are significantly down, Eritrean forces are leaving, the Ethiopian Government is taking the first steps toward transitional justice.\nBut, as I discussed with both sides during my visit, to build a durable peace, there must be acknowledgment of the atrocities committed by all parties, as well as accountability together with reconciliation.\nThe conflict in northern Ethiopia was devastating.  Men, women, and children were killed.  Women and girls were subject to horrific forms of sexual violence.  Thousands were forcibly displaced from their homes.  Entire communities were specifically targeted based on their ethnicity.\nMany of these actions were not random or a mere byproduct of war.  They were calculated and deliberate.\nAfter the department\u2019s careful review of the law and the facts, I\u2019ve determined that members of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, Eritrean Defense Forces, Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front forces, and Amhara forces committed war crimes during the conflict in northern Ethiopia.\nMembers of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, the Eritrean Defense Forces, and Amhara forces also committed crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and persecution.\nMembers of the Amhara forces committed the crime against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer and committed ethnic cleansing through their treatment of Tigrayans in western Tigray.\nWe welcome the commitment that the parties to the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement have made to acknowledge the atrocities committed and their devastating consequences.\nThe Government of Ethiopia is taking the first steps by publicly releasing a detailed green paper of transitional justice options based upon best practices and building upon the experiences of other states emerging from periods of mass violence.  It has invited experts from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to join the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to deploy a team of human rights monitors to conflict-affected areas to ensure that such acts have truly ceased.\nThe government is also holding public consultations about transitional justice, which, as I discussed with the prime minister, should be inclusive of all stakeholders and provide victims a voice.  The process is benefiting from the advice of experts in the field, including members of my team who participated in a workshop on transitional justice with other international specialists just last week.\nFinally, and crucially, we urge the Government of Ethiopia and the Government of Eritrea, as well as the TPLF, to hold those responsible for these atrocities accountable.\nThese steps \u2013 acknowledgement, accountability, reconciliation \u2013 are key to breaking the cycle of ethnic and political violence that has gripped Ethiopia and prevented it from reaching its unlimited potential for so long.\nThe United States will partner with Ethiopia as it implements a credible transitional justice process for the benefit of all victims and affected communities.  We will stand with Ethiopia as it honestly faces the abuses in its past, provides accountability for the harms committed against its citizens, and moves toward a future of lasting peace.\nWith that, happy to take a couple of questions before turning it over to my colleagues.\nMR PATEL:  Matt, go ahead.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Matt.\nQUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and welcome back.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.\nQUESTION:  I\u2019ve got about 17 questions, but for the sake of \u2014\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Hold on, let me get my pen out.\nQUESTION:  But \u2013 yeah, but for the sake of both you and my colleagues, I\u2019ll narrow it down to just one.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.\nQUESTION:  And that has to do with the Ethiopia \u2013 and the decision you just made.  As you noted, you were just there.  Why didn\u2019t you make this determination either while you were there or before you went?  Were your conversations while you were there instructive in \u2013 did the \u2013 in making this?\nAnd then the other thing is \u2013 on this \u2013 you seem to suggest that you think that Ethiopian courts can take care \u2013 can deal with this.  That is not so much the case as it relates to Russia and Ukraine.  And I \u2013 so I\u2019m just wondering why it is that you think that.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks, Matt.  Well, look, I\u2019m not \u2013 obviously not going to get into the details of private discussions that I had, but two things.  First, this determination is the product of a lot of very deliberate, detailed work, and we are, when we make these determinations, very focused on doing that work, making sure that we have the facts, that we apply them to the law, and all of that takes time and focus.\nIt seemed appropriate to release the determination that we made as we\u2019re putting out the Human Rights Report.  And beyond that, I\u2019d say that in terms of what happens next in Ethiopia, including what process they establish to provide for justice, for accountability, we\u2019ll see.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been determined.  What has been determined and what I could see from my meetings and conversations last week is a commitment on all sides to engage in this process of transitional justice; an acknowledgement of the atrocities that have been committed \u2013 again, by all sides \u2013 in the course of this conflict in northern Ethiopia; and, I believe, a commitment to genuinely get to a better place that has to include accountability, that has to include, I think, reconciliation if we\u2019re going to have a truly durable peace.\nThat\u2019s what I heard on the trip, and again, I think the situation that we\u2019re seeing now in Ethiopia is vastly different than situations in other parts of the world in that, over the last four months, the steps that all sides have taken to implement the cessation of hostilities agreement has literally saved lives and changed lives for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.  But that doesn\u2019t erase what happened over the last two years, which is why it is so important that we get this transitional justice process moving and that there is accountability as well as reconciliation.\nQUESTION:  Afghanistan?\nMR PATEL:  Let\u2019s go to Missy in the back.\nQUESTION:  Please, Mr. Secretary.  Afghan situation also is very bad.\nMR PATEL:  Please.\nQUESTION:  Any message for our new year?  We celebrated our new year.\nMR PATEL:  Nazira, I\u2019m going to call the questions.  Missy, (inaudible).\nQUESTION:  Please \u2013 you guys don\u2019t give me opportunity.  Any comment about Afghan women?  And what\u2019s your message for our new year?  We celebrated, but Afghan women crying.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, we \u2014\nQUESTION:  I know you don\u2019t give me a chance.  Sorry, I have a lot of pain.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  I\u2019ll say very simply \u2013 no, no, I\u2019m happy to address that.  I\u2019ll say very simply that we deplore the edicts that the Taliban have promulgated repeatedly that fundamentally repress the rights of Afghan women and girls.  And we\u2019ve seen this now time and again: denying them education, denying them the ability to work, denying them the ability to participate in the provision of humanitarian assistance that benefits all Afghans.  And I think it\u2019s safe to say from conversations with countries around the world that to the extent the Taliban is looking for more normal relations with countries around the world, that will not happen in so long as they continue to advance these repressive edicts against women and girls.\nMR PATEL:  Missy, go ahead.\nQUESTION:  Secretary Blinken, thanks so much for coming to talk to us about the report.  What would your response be to those that would say despite the content of the \u2013 contents of the report and despite all of the work that goes into it, that the issues that are flagged don\u2019t \u2013 are not sufficiently influencing policymaking, especially when it comes to countries where it is harder for the United States to have those tough discussions on human rights, like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Israel?  What\u2019s your response to that?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, first, we have those tough discussions across the board with friends, adversaries, competitors alike.  So that \u2013 and the report itself makes that very clear.  But in the day-in, day-out, it\u2019s the same thing.  So we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not pulling our punches with anyone as \u2013 we call things as we see them.  Sometimes we do it more publicly; sometimes we do it more privately.  We\u2019re trying to determine in each instance how we hopefully can be most effective in advancing human rights and advancing human dignity.\nSo I think it\u2019s safe to say, without getting into details, that we raise these concerns with everyone \u2013 again, friends, adversaries, competitors.\nAt the same time, as we\u2019re working in different ways with different countries, we have a multiplicity of interests that we\u2019re working on, and we always try to determine how we can most effectively advance them.  Human rights is a central interest of ours; it\u2019s not the only one.  And my responsibility is to make sure that we\u2019re doing our best to advance all of our interests however we can.  But as this report makes clear \u2013 and it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s a very public report and that it applies the same standards to countries around the world, whatever their relationship with us \u2013 I think demonstrates the seriousness with which we take this issue.\nMR PATEL:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  I\u2019ll leave it in the very capable hands of my colleagues.  Thank you, everyone.\nMR PATEL:  Thank you, everybody.",

		"location": "NIAMEY, NIGER",
		"date": "MARCH 16, 2023",
		"content": "Play Video\nMODERATOR:  (In French.)\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:  (Via Interpreter.)  First of all, I would like to applaud this visit, which is the very first of a U.S. Secretary of State into our country.  This is a great testimony, a show of friendship towards our people, and that also testifies to the quality and of the strength of the relationship between the United States and Niger, so we are deeply honored.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary of State.\nAnd it is an opportunity to salute the leadership of your country in the defense of democracy and freedom throughout the world, especially right now, where these values are sufficiently under threat and we count more than ever on this leadership to deal and to overcome once again these temptations to return back to authoritarianism in the world, especially in our sub-region.\nNiger is a new country.  We came out from the decolonization processes of the 1960s and, given that we are a new country, we do know what we owe to international law and the UN charter.  That is why we condemn without any equivocation the Russian aggression in Ukraine, like all similar aggression throughout the world. Those aggressions violate international law and the United Nations Charter, without which there cannot be an international community.\nThe United States, I would like to say it and recall it, as everybody knows is one of our major partners in terms of cooperation for development as well as in terms of cooperation for security and our security and defense.  We have U.S. interventions in civil cooperation via the USAID efforts, that everybody here knows, as well as multifaceted efforts in priority sectors of our country.  We also have United States action as part of our MCC national compact, which also works in priority sectors such as agriculture, irrigation, rural roads in order to create conditions for growth.\nWe have just signed recently in Washington a regional compact as part of the MCC with B\u00e9nin in order to reduce the cost of the corridor, which is a vital corridor for our country through which transit practically all of our exports and imports.  So this cost reduction, this reduction of these timelines, is the essential goal of this compact that will allow us to have greater competitivity for economy.\nThe overall volume \u2013 of course, we also have military cooperation, which is very important the United States intervene in the training and the generation of the special forces battalion.  The United States is presently equipping these battalions and general equipping of our armed forces, for our army and our air force and intelligence, as you know.  And also this contribution for the United States allows our forces to be more effective and allows our country to be resilient against the aggression it faces.\nAll of these interventions by your country, the total volume today exceeds 1,000 billion CFA francs. It is a lot. This makes your country one of the main partners, both in development and in matters of defense and security. We also want to take this opportunity to thank you. And we know that this important commitment will be even more important in the future, in view of the conclusions of the last U.S.- Africa summit, where commitments were made by your country towards Africa and in line with the Agenda 2063 of the African Union. Therefore aligned with our priorities, once again, and knowing Ambassador Johnnie Carson, whom we have known here, we know very well that these commitments will be kept.\nIn conclusion, we must tell you that we owe a lot to the cooperation between Niger and the United States, to your commitment by our side, that explains the resilience of our country, of this system, of this democratic state in this chaotic environment. We owe it to our partnership, with you, we also owe it to our own commitment and our determination to defend our values and our system, and we also owe it to other partners such as France and other European countries. We want, in conclusion, to demonstrate by our existence, by our resilience, our model, that a stable democratic state is the only lasting response to the terrorist aggression of which our region is the target today. We want to demonstrate this, and the other alternatives -we are convinced- will be a failure compared to the path we have followed. This is the introduction I wanted to give you, in any case welcome to Niger, welcome Mr. Secretary of State. Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Hello.  Greetings.  Assalamu alaikum.  It is wonderful for me to be back in Niger.  As the minister said, as it happens, I\u2019m the first American Secretary of State to be here in that capacity, but I was here in my previous job as deputy of secretary of state in 2015, and I\u2019m so appreciative of the incredibly warm welcome that we\u2019ve had today.\nWe have \u2013 Niger and the United States \u2013 a deep but also growing bond.  We have a genuine and responsive partnership that allows us \u2013 and increasingly \u2013 to deliver for our people on our shared priorities.  I saw already back in 2015 the strength of that partnership, and I\u2019m honored to return today to see it move forward in very significant ways.\nAs President Bazoum has said, Niger is a young democracy in a challenging part of the world, but it remains true to the democratic values that we share.  And Niger has been quick to defend democratic values under threat in neighboring countries.\nNiger\u2019s leaders have distinguished themselves in the face of other pressing challenges, from violent extremism to the climate crisis.  In each case, Niger has prioritized inclusion, community engagement, pragmatic solutions.  The United States is committed to the close partnership we\u2019ve forged together and to make it even closer.\nWe deeply appreciated the very thoughtful, the deeply experienced views that President Bazoum brought on questions of peace, security, and governance at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last December.  And in many ways, that conversation was the starting point for the discussions that we\u2019ve had here today in Niamey.\nToday, I announced nearly $150 million in new humanitarian assistance to help meet needs in West and Central Africa and the Sahel created by regional instability.  That assistance will support the provision of shelter, essential healthcare, emergency food, safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene services, and will also support vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers evacuated to Niger.  And I have to say, the generosity of Niger \u2013 of its people \u2013 to so many refugees, so many displaced persons, is remarkable.\nWe are also supporting investments in the long-term security of Niger, investments that, you\u2019ve heard the minister refer to, help make Niger\u2019s law enforcement more effective in combating terrorism, strengthening border security, enhancing counternarcotics capacity, stemming trafficking, helping to investigate, prosecute, and ultimately reduce terrorism, violent extremism.\nWe\u2019re committed to continuing to invest in the resilience of democracies to a wide range of threats and challenges, from corruption to disinformation.  And we continue to support a free and independent press, as we have done in Niger for decades.  In the coming months, we\u2019re going to actually welcome another cohort of Nigerien media professionals to the United States, an opportunity to meet fellow journalists and practitioners, to exchange lessons learned and participate in training and other professional development opportunities.\nWe\u2019re also supporting President Bazoum\u2019s remarkable disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, and reconciliation program.  I saw this for myself firsthand earlier today.  Over the past couple of decades, what we\u2019ve learned is that to effectively counter violent extremism we have to find ways to pave alternative pathways that give former combatants an opportunity to build a real future for themselves.  When I had a chance to meet earlier today with young people who\u2019ve completed this program, I heard about their experiences, their ideas for preventing the spread of violent extremism.  And again, I think this program can and should be a model for many others.\nToday, the president, foreign minister, and I also talked about another threat to peace and prosperity, and that is the global food crisis.  Now, this has been something that has been long in the making.  A combination of climate change, of COVID, of various conflicts has created an almost perfect storm.\nNow over the past year, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine has just added fuel to an already burning fire, driving up food and fertilizer prices for Nigeriens, for many others, putting millions at risk of going hungry.  We\u2019ve been supporting immediate interventions to help those facing acute food insecurity.  Just since the aggression by Russia against Ukraine a year ago, we\u2019ve contributed an additional $13.5 billion to address food insecurity around the world, but most of that has gone to Africa.  We\u2019re by far the largest donor to the World Food Program as well, and other international mechanisms that are helping to deal with food insecurity.\nWe\u2019re also supporting something called the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has brought Ukrainian grain to countries across Africa and lowered the prices worldwide.  Now keep in mind, this initiative never should have been necessary in the first place, but one of the results of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine was to block Ukrainian ports and prevent Ukraine from exporting grain and other food products to the world, which it\u2019s done for years.  Thanks to very good work done by the United Nations, by T\u00fcrkiye, an agreement was reached to create this corridor to allow Ukraine\u2019s grain to reach world markets.  Over 4 million metric tons of wheat have gone directly to developing countries as a result of this initiative.  That\u2019s the equivalent of 8 billion loaves of bread.  And so millions of people around the world \u2013 and especially here in Africa \u2013 rely on this initiative to help deal with food insecurity.  It\u2019s imperative that it continue and it\u2019s imperative that Russia allow it to continue.\nBeyond emergency aid though \u2013 and this is maybe just as important, if not more important \u2013  we are working together to make long-term investments in African food production capacity and resilience, because ultimately the goal that we all share is for African countries to be able to produce on their own the food that their people need, and for that matter be able to export it not just in the region that they happen to be in on the continent, but even to other places in the world.\nOne way that we\u2019re doing that here in Niger is through the Millennium Challenge Corporation\u2019s compacts that you\u2019ve heard the minister discuss.  They simultaneously address a couple of the really big constraints to economic growth: lack of access to water and institutional barriers to trade.\nOne of the compacts for $442 million is strengthening irrigation infrastructure, climate-resilient production, and market access for agricultural products.  And it\u2019s having a major impact in a country where four out of five people are employed in the agriculture sector.\nBy the end of April, we will have established 300 kilometers of roads, built vast irrigation networks, improved more than 1,000 kilometers of livestock corridors, provided literacy training to more than 5,000 people.  In 2021, just a couple of years ago, a project that was funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation using satellite technology discovered five aquifers containing over 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.  That has the potential to benefit millions of people here in Niger.\nWe\u2019re also supporting Niger\u2019s regional integration and its broader economic development.  At the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last year, I joined President Bazoum and the president of Benin, President Talon, in signing another MCC compact that will bring the two countries together to have a regional transportation program that will facilitate trade between the two of them and facilitate the export beyond those countries of food products.  It will make it faster and safer to transport and export goods from Niger along rehabilitated roads and across borders. Ultimately, it will connect Niger to bigger markets and even greater opportunities.\nIn all of our meetings, President Bazoum raised the importance of education, because he knows that the single most important contributor to the future of any country is its human resources and giving them the ability to reach their full potential.  And that starts with education.\nUnder President Bazoum, Niger has prioritized building and improving girls\u2019 schools to ensure that they can get a good education and acquire the skills they need to participate fully in the economy.  USAID is assisting this mission, including with programs to increase girls\u2019 primary school enrollment, provide career training opportunities, deliver distance education for girls who can\u2019t go to school because they live in a high insecurity area.  We\u2019re a major contributor, the United States, to the Global Partnership for Education, which has identified Niger as a priority country and is providing nearly $200 million to strengthen the formal education system here.\nThere are so many other ways in which we are working together to deepen this partnership.  And we began a discussion, a long discussion with our \u2013 between our teams.  We\u2019re going to continue it shortly over dinner, because there\u2019s so much to talk about.  But in all of this, I come back to the fact that Niger is really an extraordinary model at a time of great challenge \u2013 a model of resilience, a model of democracy, a model of cooperation.  It\u2019s one that we deeply value and deeply respect.\nMODERATOR:  (Via Interpreter.)  Thanks to the Secretary of State for those introductory words. We will now give the floor to the representatives of the media. We have a list, and it is not very long, I assure you. First we have Mr. Michael Crowley, New York Times. Go ahead.\nQUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Minister.  Mr. Secretary, we\u2019ve seen growing activity in the region by the Russian Wagner Group as countries turn to Russia to address their security concerns, given that the U.S. and also French efforts in recent years have not succeeded in quelling terrorist and extremist threats to these countries.  I understand that you believe that working with the Wagner Group is bound to end badly for these countries, but I just wonder if you can talk about what specifically the U.S. and its allies can offer these countries that Russia cannot.\nAnd Mr. Minister, related to that, why do you think so many countries in this region have been turning to the Wagner Group for assistance?  And what lessons do you draw from their experiences so far?\nIf I may just add a brief question for you, Mr. Secretary, on Ukraine.  Poland\u2019s government said today that Poland will be sending fighter jets to Ukraine.  Can we have your reaction to that, please?  And does that change at all the Biden administration\u2019s thinking about potentially providing fighter jets of our own?  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you, Michael.  I\u2019m happy to start.  And actually, I\u2019ll just take the last question first, and then go to the broader question.\nWith regard to the decision by Poland to provide jets to Ukraine \u2013 look, these are sovereign decisions for countries to make, what they will provide to Ukraine to help it defend itself against the Russian aggression.  And we, of course, are working closely with dozens of countries on these questions, but different countries are doing different things in response to what they have and what the perceived needs are.  Our focus has been on doing everything we can to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, what it can use, and what it particularly needs in this moment, dealing both with the offensive that we\u2019re seeing from Russia across the eastern front, but also in preparation for its own actions in the weeks and months to come as it seeks to take back more of the territory that Russia has seized from it.\nSo we\u2019ve done this throughout in close consultation with the Ukrainians and with our partners.  And as I\u2019ve said many times before, I think it\u2019s a mistake to get focused on any particular weapon system at any given time.  We know that there are basic things that Ukraine needs, whether it\u2019s air defenses, whether it\u2019s artillery, whether it\u2019s ammunition, whether it\u2019s armored vehicles and the like.  Secretary Austin, as you know, led a very, very successful process in bringing together dozens of countries to help find and coordinate that assistance.  And at the same time, as I\u2019ve, again, said before, what\u2019s very important to us and our focus is not only making sure that the Ukrainians have the right weapon system, but again, they can use it \u2013 so depending on the system, that might require significant training \u2013 that they have the ability to maintain it \u2013 again, depending on the system, that can be more or less complicated \u2013 and that it fits into a comprehensive plan.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying that\u2019s been our approach all along, it remains our approach, and individual partner countries will, again, make their own decisions about what they can provide, when they can provide it, and how they provide it.\nWhen it comes to Wagner and the security question more broadly, first, what is I think the most effective way \u2013 and this is something where, again, Niger has really been in the lead \u2013 we know that dealing with insecurity, yes, requires taking steps on the security side of the equation, military side of the equation.  That\u2019s necessary, but it\u2019s not sufficient.  And the focus that we\u2019re bringing to bear, that Niger is bringing to bear, that other countries are bringing to bear that care about insecurity here because of the potential that it has to spread even well beyond the region and beyond the continent, is a comprehensive approach \u2013 one that\u2019s focused not just on the security steps that we\u2019re taking, but on good governance, on development, on creating opportunity, on being responsive to the needs of the people.  And I think that is exactly the difference-maker \u2013 not at all what Wagner or any other groups of its like have to offer.\nAnd I think what we\u2019ve seen already, it\u2019s not just we know this is going to end badly; we\u2019ve already seen it end badly in a number of places.  Where Wagner has been present, bad things have inevitably followed.  The \u2013 it has not proven to be an effective response to insecurity, and at the same time we\u2019ve seen countries that find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, less independent as a result of an association with Wagner.  And we\u2019ve also seen Wagner engage in the exploitation of a country\u2019s resources, bring corruption with it, bring violence with it \u2013 overall worsening security, not improving it \u2013 and engaging in human rights abuses at the same time.\nSo this is not a recipe for success that I think anyone should be looking to.  But yes, it is incumbent upon us to demonstrate through this much more comprehensive approach that we\u2019re taking to insecurity that we can actually deliver results.  That was a big part of our conversation with President Bazoum earlier today, which, again, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue over dinner.  But I think you\u2019re going to see very, very concrete results.\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is this:  I mentioned the disarmament and demobilization and reintegration program here.  That, too, should be a model that\u2019s integrated in what we\u2019re doing regionally, because you can see the results.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:  (Via Interpreter.)  Well thank you, so I would like to complete the response of the Secretary of State. For us, the principle is that this war is up to us to wage, it is not up to our partners to wage war in our place. This is the misunderstanding among some. Therefore, it\u2019s up to our countries, it\u2019s up to us to fight, the goal is that our partners should only complement our efforts. That\u2019s our doctrine, that\u2019s what the doctrine should be, that\u2019s the misunderstanding that there was.\nIt\u2019s that others, the reactions that we sometimes see today on social media, is that it is said that our partners have failed in certain countries, to defeat the enemy \u2013 but that is a misunderstanding. The war is ours to fight. Therefore, we never had the illusion in our country of believing or of making the population believe that this war must be waged and carried out by our partners, in our place. That\u2019s the first principle.\nThe second principle is that, as the Secretary of State was saying earlier, we had a discussion about it, that this war is not being waged only with weapons. We do it holistically. We must first have resolved, or resolve at the same time, the problems of governance, the problems of national cohesion which have not been resolved elsewhere. Terrorists take advantage of flaws in terms of cohesion, social cohesion, national cohesion, that\u2019s why we have the tools to carry out this permanent negotiation between the communities, to effectively prevent a collapse at that level, to prevent an inter-community confrontation, and reduce it to the bare minimum. So this political fight we are carrying out at the same time as the war, it is a part of the war. It is one of the aspects of this war.\nThirdly, it goes without saying that we must not give up development while we are at war. This is why we say that the stabilization and recovery actions that we carry out in these areas affected by the war are also part of the conditions for success. So those are the three elements, as we see them, that condition success or failure.\nAs far as Wagner itself is concerned, with ECOWAS, the first press release we issued after the first rumors of Wagner settling in our sub-region, was to condemn that. It\u2019s been a long time since the West African space has known this, since \u201cExecutive Outcomes\u201d in Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was a South African mercenary company at the time, and obviously we consider that these kinds of elements, this type of heterogeneous force, mercenaries, we cannot accept in our AU space. There is an ECOWAS communiqu\u00e9 in this regard\nAnd what is the outcome today? It is that we find that Wagner is only present in failed or soon to be failed states. Let\u2019s take examples, I won\u2019t cite any, just look around you. Second, the outcome is more than catastrophic. I don\u2019t think there has been any progress in the successes of those countries, where Wagner is present. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a challenge for us. We are now fighting to demonstrate first that our vision, the way we wage this war is the right one, secondly that our democratic institutions can defeat terrorism. In fact, that there are no other alternatives, quite simply, in this fight to defeat terrorism, other than this model for a state. So here are some of the issues which we face, and I believe that the immediate future will prove us right. This is the answer I can give to your question. Thank you.\nMODERATOR:  (Via Interpreter.)  Thank you Minister of State.  Moussa Kama, RFI.\nQUESTION:  (Via Interpreter.)  Good evening Your Excellency, my question goes to the two ministers please. An answer in French would really please us, Mr. Secretary of State of the United States. My first question is on security. You have done a lot for Niger, the Nigerien army recognizes this; when will the United States be ready to finance military operations on our borders against the jihadists? My second question is on foreign policy. What will the United States do to bring democracy to our neighbors in Burkina Faso and Mali ?  What are you ready to do? Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  (Via Interpreter.)  First of all, we have, and the Minister mentioned it, a partnership on security issues which requires significant funding insofar as together we train our colleagues in Niger, we bring important equipment precisely so that they can carry out the necessary operations, we coordinate all of that with others, and all that is a financial contribution because\u2026 all of it costs money. So there is genuine support that has lasted for years and we are strengthening it.\nBut I insist on the point that the minister brought up so well, that while doing this, this holistic approach is for us, for both our countries, the key to success. And there too, there is a very, very significant investment as mentioned for example, the Millennium Challenge Corporation projects. The Minister mentioned the total of our investments in these projects which are also very important to prevent people from falling into extremism and terrorism, and those amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.\nWe are talking with President Bazoum and the minister about the issues, the challenges that we see in the region, including the democratic backsliding, the military coups, which so far have not led to a renewal of a democratic constitutional process in these countries. We discuss it together, and I won\u2019t say more this evening, but I think that we must indeed all be very clear about the need of neighboring countries to restore their constitutional and democratic course.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:  (Via Interpreter.)  I think that what the Secretary of State said is enough, and earlier I told you about the volume of funding through USAID, through the MCC and through equipment, the training of our armed forces, through the intelligence they give us. For all of this I gave a figure, I said no less than 1000 billion CFA francs. I think that\u2026and in addition there are other types of interventions in the multilateral framework which we cannot evaluate here but which are enormous. We have seen for example the commitments of the World Bank. Today in Niger we are the second country after Nigeria in Africa, today, when it comes to World Bank commitments. All of this is a form of support from our partners also through this unprecedented multilateral effort, which was unimaginable a few years ago.\nTherefore, it\u2019s not limited to direct investment in terms of financing our operations, I think we\u2019re waging war, it\u2019s up to us to do so, I want to stress this, and that\u2019s important. The support of our partners, we need it on the strict military level as well as on the civil level \u2013 but not that they fight the war instead of us. This is extremely important. So if there is a misunderstanding in this respect we are not going to get out of it. So I think, and we welcome this commitment by the United States at our side and we think that this model, the bet we have made on democracy, on the stability of democratic institutions, to defeat terrorism, this bet will pay off. We are going to win this bet against the authoritarian model and the criminal model, the criminal groups, that we see elsewhere, it is not a model for us. It is a failure from the point of view of the fight against terrorism, in terms of security sensu stricto, and it is also a failure in terms of development prospects quite simply. Because, today, I don\u2019t think those behind Wagner have any other proposals in terms of development aid, in terms of civil aid, they don\u2019t have any other proposals than that. So here it is, time will tell who is right. We are certain that we are right. This is the answer I can give you.\nMODERATOR:  (Via Interpreter.)  Thank you  Minister of State. The penultimate question, William Mauldin from the Wall Street Journal.\nQUESTION:  Thank you very much.  I wanted to follow up first of all on the RFE question, Mr. Foreign Minister, specifically about Burkina Faso, if you could help some of those \u2013 some of us who aren\u2019t from the region understand what\u2019s going on there in terms of that country and the Wagner Group.  And do you think the U.S. should remain active in Burkina Faso despite the military coups?  Maybe Mr. Secretary wants to answer that too.\nBut specifically for you, Secretary Blinken, I wanted to ask a little bit if you could \u2013 I mean, you were here, if I understand, as deputy secretary of state before.  And I\u2019m sure there were efforts for humanitarian aid and other types of assistance back then in the economic and humanitarian space.  What types of programs are working, or paint us a picture?  Some of the programs you mentioned today with the Millennium Corporation, how, specifically, do you see that helping this country avoiding \u2013 falling into some of the pitfalls of extremism, hunger, and migrant crises that we\u2019ve seen before?  Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER MASSOUDOU:  (Via Interpreter.)  As far as Burkina Faso is concerned, I simply note that there have been two successive coups. With ECOWAS we have a mediator who has an agreement at the moment with the military authorities for a way back to a normal constitutional life, for elections, within 24 months. So for the moment we are within the framework of this plan.\nSecondly, we note that the security situation has further deteriorated and we are very concerned about this continued deterioration of the security situation. As for the presence of Wagner in Burkina, we are not yet\u2026 we think, the information that we have does not allow us to say that Wagner is still in Burkina Faso. Our wish is that this country maintains the trajectory with ECOWAS. Secondly, that it does not continue this trajectory towards this organization which we qualify as criminal, mercenary, which ECOWAS has already condemned. We don\u2019t want this trajectory, in which they seem to be going, to come to a conclusion. We believe that, we want them to pull themselves together to reintegrate into the community and that we can, with them, move towards the end of the transition process and cooperate, fight together, against terrorism. This is our view but obviously it does not depend only on us. It depends on them too. But this is our wish.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, just to come back to something I said \u2013 and forgive me for repeating myself, but it does go directly to your question, and I think it\u2019s important.  So we have these big projects, including Millennium Challenge Corporation projects that people hear about, and we talk about the very large sums of money that are involved in these projects.  But what I\u2019ve seen, and the difference that I\u2019ve seen between when I was last here in 2015 and now, is the concrete results that this \u2013 these projects that we\u2019re doing together are actually delivering and concrete results that are having a direct impact on improving people\u2019s lives, creating opportunity, and creating a strong future.\nI mentioned this just a few minutes ago in my opening statement: by the end of April, we will have rehabilitated through the Millennium Challenge Corporation projects and other things that we\u2019re doing 300 kilometers of Nigerien roads.  We will have built a vast irrigation network, which for, again, a country that is 70 or 80 percent in the agricultural sector, may be the most important foundational thing.  We will have improved more than 1,000 kilometers of livestock corridors, just to cite a few things.  But what does that translate into?  It translates into people having much greater opportunity to actually cultivate the land that they enjoy, to bring their products to market in ways that they couldn\u2019t before, and as a \u2013 in the same time, create many new jobs.\nBeyond that, through AID and other partners, we\u2019re doing things like providing literacy training to thousands of people.  That, again, enables them to participate much more effectively in the economy.  I mentioned, too, this remarkable discovery \u2013 again, an MCC-funded project \u2013 of the five aquifers: 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.  The impact that that\u2019s going to have as that water is actually brought to use on the agricultural system here on productivity and on sustainability I think will be dramatic.  And again, that translates into livelihoods for people.  It translates into opportunity.  It translates for everyone into lower food prices, reducing food insecurity, and that\u2019s (inaudible).  The bottom line is this:  Through everything that we\u2019re doing as partners here, it\u2019s less about the program, whatever it\u2019s called; the amount of money, as great as it is.  It\u2019s about the fact that it is actually producing concrete results, concrete opportunities, concrete development which is foundational to Niger\u2019s strength and resilience as a democracy.\nMODERATOR:  (Via Interpreter.)  The last question is for Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Niger, Madam Nadia Maman.\nQUESTION:  (Via Interpreter.)  Good evening, my question is for Mr. Blinken. At present, given the evolution of the war in Ukraine, and the impact of this war on the world, does the United States intend to keep going as is or play the card of diplomacy? Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  So with regard to Ukraine and to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, let me just say a couple of things.  First of all, no one wanted this war.  No one wanted this aggression.  Maybe the only person who wanted it was Vladimir Putin.  We worked very hard when we saw the storm clouds rising.  We had information about what the Russians were planning to do.  We tried to prevent it with diplomacy.  And I spent months, as did my colleagues, engaging with Russia to see if we could head off its aggression.\nI think what we learned in the process is that the reason for this aggression is because Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine shouldn\u2019t exist as an independent country.  In his mind, it\u2019s part of Russia, and so he tried to seize it back.  I know that there are dozens of countries in Africa in particular who, having been on the receiving end of imperialism, can appreciate why it was so important to stand against it and to make sure that a country, a big country like Russia, couldn\u2019t simply try to erase another country by force \u2013 change its borders, eliminate its independence.\nThe minister said it very eloquently at the very start of this press conference.  This is bigger than Ukraine.  It really is about the principles that are at the heart of the international system that, after two world wars, countries came together and said we need, if we\u2019re not going to have another world war, territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty.  And if we allow those principles to be violated anywhere, they\u2019re in danger everywhere, because the message to a would-be aggressor \u2013 if Russia can get away with what it did, what it\u2019s doing in Ukraine, the message to another would-be aggressor, maybe in Africa, maybe in the Middle East, maybe somewhere else is if they can get away with it, so can I.  And that leads to a world of conflict.  It leads to a world of violence.  It leads to a world where countries that have imperial designs on others will carry the day.\nSo that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so important, I think, why so many countries around the world have stood against the Russian aggression.  Just a few weeks ago, 143 countries at the United Nations \u2013 three-quarters of the countries in the world \u2013 stood up and voted in opposition to Russia\u2019s aggression.  At the same time, as we\u2019ve already talked about, we\u2019ve seen the terrible consequences that this aggression has had not just for people in Ukraine, but for people around the world because of the impact it\u2019s had, for example, on food insecurity.  And we talked about this earlier.  Ukraine was one of the biggest exporters of wheat and grain to the world, including to Africa.  Russia\u2019s invasion stopped that and was blocking Ukraine from exporting its wheat and grain, including to Africa.  Fortunately, we were able to get an agreement to allow Ukrainian grain and wheat to get out of Ukraine.  And when I was in Ethiopia just yesterday, I saw the large bags of wheat and grain from Ukraine in Ethiopia.\nNow, the people who, more than anyone else, want this war to be over as soon as possible, are the Ukrainian people who are on the receiving end every day of bombs, of violence, of destruction.  And like many other countries around the world, we would like to see the same thing, but there has to be a just and durable peace \u2013 just in the sense that it reflects the principles of the United Nations Charter, because if it\u2019s a peace that allows Russia to keep all the territory it seized by force, that\u2019s not justice; and durable in the sense that no one wants to see Russia repeat this a year or two or three years later.\nSo with those principles in mind, every day we are looking for ways to see if we can bring the war to an end.  I see no evidence that right now Russia is interested in a diplomatic resolution, a negotiation that would end this war.  And so the quickest way to end it is to continue to support Ukraine so that it is strong on the battlefield \u2013 and the battlefield is its own country \u2013 so that hopefully, at some point, Mr. Putin recognizes the reality that this has to stop, that he\u2019s not going to succeed, and he\u2019s prepared for diplomacy and for negotiation.  When that day comes, we\u2019ll be the first to engage to try to end things.  But as I said, in this moment, at least, I don\u2019t see any evidence of that.\nMODERATOR:   (Via Interpreter.)  We are at the end of this exercise, so your Excellencies, Mr. Minister of State, Mr. Secretary of State, thank you for answering questions from journalists. Thank you so much.",

But what\u2019s truly remarkable is the approach that Niger has taken to countering violent extremism and doing it through this very impressive program of demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration.\nBut I think what you\u2019ve seen and what you\u2019ve heard today is that there\u2019s an approach that I think is incredibly wise in, again, bringing people back into society, doing it with the support and the participation of the communities in question, helping to give people livelihoods, and in effect giving them a better choice than falling into violent extremism.\nIt\u2019s especially impressive when you see that, as we saw at the very outset, if you look at where Niger is located, you can see the challenges that it faces coming literally from all sides, many of which have been, in effect, imported in.  This approach is very \u2013 I think, from our perspective \u2013 very much a model that others can look to.\nSo it was very powerful to hear about it directly, including from people who participated in the program, community leaders, and something that we\u2019re very proud to support in a variety of ways as well.\nSo good first stop.  I know we\u2019ll have a chance to talk later.  Enjoy.  Thanks.",

		"audience": "U.S. LOGISTICS CENTER WAREHOUSE",
		"location": "ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA",
		"date": "MARCH 15, 2023",
		"content": "SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  We\u2019ve had an enduring partnership when it comes to humanitarian assistance with Ethiopia, going back decades.  And it\u2019s enduring because we\u2019ve had periods of famine, conflict, displacement, and yet throughout we have found ways, working with extraordinary partners like World Vision, like Catholic Relief Services, to make sure we were working with our partners to provide assistance.\nJust in the last couple of years, even with the conflict in Tigray in Ethiopia, we have provided about $3 billion worth of humanitarian assistance.  And it\u2019s been very important to us that we do everything we can to make sure the people who are caught up in any of these human tragedies get the assistance that they need.  And indeed, today I can share that we\u2019re going to be providing an addition $331 million in assistance through this joint emergency operations program to try to reach more people in Ethiopia who are in need of food security, and we think we\u2019ll reach another 13 million or so people being affected by drought in particular.\nBesides being enduring, what\u2019s so important is that it\u2019s intended for everyone in Ethiopia \u2013 not any particular group, region.  We\u2019re active through our partners with the government in nine of the 11 regions in Ethiopia, trying to make sure that whoever\u2019s in need is getting assistance.\nAnd finally, as you\u2019ve seen a little bit of today, of course it starts with food, the most basic necessity, but it\u2019s broader than that.  It includes everything from hygiene kits to sanitation to medicine to water.  And we\u2019re going to continue to do that day-in, day-out.\nBut a few other things that are so important.  One is, as I said, we can\u2019t do this without a strong partnership with the government; we can\u2019t do it without strong partnerships with, as I said, remarkable implementing partners like Catholic Relief Services, like World Vision.  And I\u2019m especially proud of the work that USAID \u2013 the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2013 is doing in country after country, including here in Ethiopia.  As I like to say, USAID is where the rubber meets the road, where we\u2019re making a tangible difference in people\u2019s lives.\nAs a result of the cessation of hostilities agreement in Tigray, we now have humanitarian assistance flowing in very important ways.  And that\u2019s reaching people who were not being reached before, and making a big difference.\nFinally, one footnote.  You noticed that some of the food products here are from the Ukrainian people.  And I would simply note that that just underscores the importance of making sure that the arrangements that have been put into place \u2013 necessitated, unfortunately, by the Russian aggression against Ukraine \u2013 the Black Sea corridor, making sure that grain could get out of Ukraine and able to reach faraway places in the world, that that continues.  It\u2019s vital that that continues, it\u2019s vital that as it comes up for renewal that it be renewed.  And we can see the impact if that doesn\u2019t happen, because it literally means that what you\u2019re seeing right here won\u2019t get here, won\u2019t get to many other places.  It\u2019ll also have an impact on prices for people around the world.\nBut the most important thing is day-in, day-out, we\u2019re committed to this partnership with Ethiopia, doing our part in making sure that people have what they need.  I\u2019m also very proud that the United States is the largest contributor by far to the World Food Program.  Grateful for the work that WFP does every day.  We provide about 50 percent of the World Food Program\u2019s budget.\nThe very last thing is this:  As vital, as necessary, as urgent as this assistance is, we\u2019re equally committed to working closely with our partners in Ethiopia to help them develop and strengthen their own productive capacity.  That ultimately is the most important thing that we can do.  Because I\u2019m convinced, we\u2019re convinced, that in Ethiopia and many other partner countries in Africa, it\u2019s that long-term productive capacity that can be resilient to things like droughts, like climate change, like disease, that can take advantage of the extraordinary natural resources and expertise that already resides in these countries, that that is fundamentally the most important answer, so that we don\u2019t have to deal on an emergency basis with a lack of food or the impact of some kind of crisis.\nSo as we\u2019re working in this partnership to provide emergency support, we\u2019re equally focused on making sure that we\u2019re working together to provide the kinds of investments that will allow Ethiopia to fully realize the potential of its own productive capacity.\nMr. Minister.\nFINANCE MINISTER SHIDE:  Thank you.  Your Excellency Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Your Excellency Ambassador Tracey Jacobson, Mr. Sean Jones, USAID mission director for Ethiopia, dignitaries from Ethiopian Government (inaudible), on behalf of the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, it is an honor for me to warmly welcome Secretary Blinken and his team to Ethiopia.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to further consult on our bilateral missions and particularly the economic cooperation between our two countries.\nToday there has been extensive discussion between the prime minister and with you, and a consensus has been reached to further enhance our strategic partnerships.\nAs you are well aware, the diplomatic relationship between Ethiopia and the U.S. dates back to over a century, and over the past several decades we have made considerable progress in elevating that partnership, which has become more strategic and vital for the goals and development of Ethiopia, and more broadly for the Horn of Africa, and particularly Ethiopia and United States partnerships is very strategic and important for our two-way mutually beneficial relationship, and also for the regional stability.\nThe United States is Ethiopia\u2019s largest humanitarian and development donor.  I fully agree what you have said.  Ethiopia has been receiving U.S. support in wide-ranging areas such as agriculture, trade, investment, climate and food security and health to state a few, Your Excellency.\nToday on the occasion of the launch of this USAID\u2019s new five-year Joint Emergency Operation Program, in the presence of Your Excellency, we\u2019d like to share our deep gratitude to the United States Government and the American people for their continued commitment in supporting our country\u2019s address urgent humanitarian challenges which have affected the most vulnerable.  I acknowledge and sincerely appreciate that in 2022 alone, the U.S. provided more than 1.7 billion to respond to humanitarian needs driven by the crisis in northern Ethiopia and the civil drought in pastural areas in southern and southeast Ethiopia.  Recently we have also received an additional 271 million to scale up the humanitarian assistance to drought and the country\u2019s affected communities.\nI fully welcome your initiative today to support it further.  Excellency, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly highlight our recent achievement and key challenges.  As most of you know very well, the last two years have been a challenging period for our country due to internal as well as global factors.  Ethiopia, like the rest of the Horn of Africa, is confronted by multiple challenges.  Our rains have failed for the five consecutive seasons in pastoral areas \u2013 the current drought being the most extreme in 40 years.\nMoreover, first, we had the problem with desert locusts, then COVID, and now the global food shortage has affected the lives \u2013 livelihoods and the economy.  There are presently over 20 million people in need of humanitarian assistance while the conflict reconstruction needs are significant.  This is on top of sustaining and deepening our economic reform agenda.  This \u2013 all of the challenging environment has been exacerbated by the significant drop in external development assistance.  With your visit, we do fully believe that the development potential will be fully unlocked.\nAs Ethiopia emerges from the divisive conflict of the last two years, we are getting up efforts for recovery and for communities and the economy from (inaudible) effect of the conflict and other successive shocks.  The signing of the peace agreement on November 2, 2022 paved the way for a critical and inclusive recovery as well as for strengthening social cooperation among all Ethiopians.  Since its signing, we have expedited the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict and the fully implemented restoration of basic services, utilities, banking, and other essential government services.  We have progressed well on the resettlement and demobilization of ex-combatants and have established the National Rehabilitation Commission to implement the integration program for the nearly 250,000 ex-combatants.  Here, I want to stress the criticality of timely reintegration of ex-combatants, which in turn we contribute to the peace consolidation.  We are also working on establishing of the interim regional government in Tigray until elections have been held.\nWe have begun implementing immediate recovery interventions primarily using our own resources and by support of the World Bank.  But we cannot do this alone as the financing need for the post-conflict reconstruction is substantial.  Conservatively estimated close to $20 billion is needed over the coming five years.  We need the support of our partners to meet this significant need to ensure that (inaudible) any development (inaudible) are passed, decades are not reversed, and the well-being of our cooperation is important.\nLet me underscore Ethiopia\u2019s determination to address underlying causes and drivers of fragilities through an inclusive national dialogue for which is essential to adequately address the grievances and the aspirations in our society and attain sustainable peace and democracy.  The recently established National Dialogue Commission is working towards that objective.  Mechanisms for transitional justice are also being set up to ensure justice and accountability to end perpetual acts of violence and advert impunity.\nWith regard to our reform agenda, Ethiopia remains committed to pursuing transformative economy reform to correct prevailing macro-economic imbalances, to remove obstacles to private sector development, and enhance productivity and job creation.  Despite the headwinds of historic proportions, we preserve it with implementation of our key reforms, including financial market revitalization, telecom sector revitalization, subsidy for enhancing agricultural productivity, and debt management.  We know that much more needs to be done, and we are ready to take bold actions on the most transformative reforms.\nWe are also working to address greening our economy.  We are applying various strategies, including expanding renewable energy generation through diverse sources, as well as green legacy initiatives led by the prime minister, to cite a few examples.  And we are already producing a lot of food in the country which is going to be vital for the future and currently.\nExcellency, wide humanitarian assistance is essential to save lives and address the short-term needs.  Broader and long-term development, as you have mentioned, focuses critical for building our resilience and advancing our development aspirations and fostering inclusive and sustainable growth, and overall tackling the root cause of Ethiopia\u2019s vulnerabilities.  Those conditions are key to sustain and consolidate development gains of recent years and to sustain peace and stability in the country.\nAs I conclude my remarks, let me reiterate my appreciation to the U.S. Government for their commitment to support Ethiopia during this challenging time, and I look forward to discussing and exchanging views on resuming and strengthening our longstanding partnership in trade, investment, full-fledge development assistance, and the cooperation (inaudible) shared goals, understanding, and mutual interest.  U.S. Secretary, we count on U.S. to leverage broader support to Ethiopia from all our bilateral (inaudible) development partners as we forge ahead with recovery, development, and sustaining and deepening our reform agenda.  I thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you very much.\nMR PATEL:  Thanks, everyone.",

		"date": "MARCH 15, 2023",
		"content": "SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, good evening, everyone.  It is great to be back in Africa, but also to make my first appearance to Ethiopia as Secretary of State.\nI\u2019m here in Ethiopia \u2013 and then on to Niger \u2013 to reaffirm the pledge that President Biden made at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit late last year.  As he put it, the United States is \u201call in on Africa, and all in with Africa.\u201d  That means the United States is committed to deep, responsive, and genuine partnerships on the continent, because we believe we can only solve shared challenges \u2013 and deliver on the fundamental aspirations of our people \u2013 if we work together.\nOne way we\u2019re doing that is making good on the commitment that we\u2019ve made to help partners in Africa deal with the huge challenge of food insecurity.  Last year, 140 million people in Africa suffered from acute food insecurity \u2013 a crisis exacerbated by COVID-19, by climate change, by conflict.  This led to shortfalls in commodities, fertilizer, and fuel, all of which spiked prices and created supply chain disruptions.  To meet that challenge, the United States has invested $13.5 billion last year to reduce acute and chronic hunger worldwide, largely in Africa.\nAt the same time, together with African countries, we\u2019re supporting immediate interventions like the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has brought Ukrainian grain to countries across Africa as well as lowering prices around the world.\nOver 4 million metric tons of wheat have gone directly to developing countries as a result of that initiative \u2013 that is the equivalent of 8 billion loaves of bread.  Millions rely on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.  It cannot be allowed to lapse.\nBut we\u2019ve also heard loudly and clearly from African partners that emergency aid cannot be the only solution.  So we\u2019re investing in sustainable, long-term African food production \u2013 working with our African partners on innovative solutions that will ensure that Africa not only meets needs on the continent but can become a supplier for the rest of the world.\nToday, American and African scientists are collaborating to devise climate-resilient, nutritious crops.  We\u2019re working on international efforts to significantly increase yields in Africa, including by mapping and improving the quality of topsoil.  We\u2019re employing satellite photography technology to discover new water resources \u2013 as we recently did in Niger, where five new aquifers have been found, containing over 600 billion cubic meters of accessible water.  And we\u2019re harnessing public sector financing tools to unlock private sector investment that will expand infrastructure, agribusiness, and trade.\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to meet with AU Chairman Faki to discuss the partnership between the United States and the African Union.  We\u2019ll talk about how the United States can help the AU realize its Agenda 2063 to build an integrated, prosperous, and peaceful Africa.  And how the United States can best support the AU\u2019s regional economic integration goals as the African Continental Free Trade Area gets up and running.  And this is something that\u2019s going to make a huge difference as African economies become increasingly integrated, that will increase trade and investment among them, but it will also attract even more investment and trade outside of Africa.  We have had to date in Africa the abnormal situation where African countries are doing more trade and investment with countries outside of the continent than they do among themselves.  When the free trade area gets up and running, that will change and I think it will be a very powerful tool for economic growth.  I\u2019ll also convey our continued support for African representation in multilateral institutions, to include the United Nations Security Council and the G20.\nAfrican-led solutions are increasingly making the difference on the challenges of the 21st century.  One of the most powerful testaments to the importance of African leadership has been the November 2nd Cessation of Hostilities Agreement to end the conflict and suffering in northern Ethiopia.\nThe conflict was absolutely devastating.  Hundreds of thousands killed.  Widespread sexual violence against women.  Millions forced to flee their homes.  Many left in need of food and shelter, medicine.  Hospitals, schools, and businesses were shelled and destroyed.\nThe Cessation of Hostilities Agreement is a major achievement and step forward, saving lives and changing lives.  The guns are silent.\nAs the fighting has stopped, human rights violations declined.  Humanitarian assistance is flowing, finally reaching nearly all communities in need, services are being restored in the Tigray Region, the TPLF is disarming, Eritrean and other non-federal forces are departing.  The dedicated diplomacy of the mediators from the African Union, from Kenya, from South Africa, supported by the United States, was essential to securing this agreement.  And the AU monitoring mechanism is a key to its full implementation.\nPrime Minister Abiy and the Ethiopian federal government and Tigrayan regional leaders should be commended for reaching this agreement and the significant progress in delivering on their commitments.  These efforts have created the foundation to rebuild the communities that have suffered so in Tigray, Amhara, and the Afar regions.  They need the help and support.\nI strongly urged the inclusion as well of women in decision-making roles as the agreement is implemented \u2013 especially in light of gender-based violence that was perpetrated during the conflict.\nToday, I first met with Prime Minister Abiy, and then with the signatories to the agreement \u2013 the heads of delegation of the Government of Ethiopia and the TPLF \u2013 to underscore our support for peace as well as the dividends it can yield.  And those dividends are important.  People need to see that peace brings concrete dividends in their lives.  That starts, of course, with the cessation of violence, but we want to build positive things on top of that.\nWe welcome the commitments that the parties have made to acknowledging the atrocities committed and their devastating consequences.  For our part, the United States acknowledges the human rights violations and repression committed during the past three decades \u2013 actions which sowed the seeds of future conflict.  We and others were insufficiently vocal about those abuses in the past.\nRecognizing the atrocities committed by all parties is an essential step to achieving a sustainable peace.  We urge Ethiopians to follow through on their commitments to each other to implement an inclusive and comprehensive transitional justice process that includes both reconciliation and accountability.  Overcoming poisonous grievances and ethnic divisions is the only way to break the cycle of political and ethnic violence in the north, in Oromia, or anywhere else.  As a partner in that effort, the United States is providing both technical and financial support.\nBuilding lasting peace is being made more complicated by the acute economic challenges that Ethiopia faces resulting from the conflict, resulting from drought, resulting from food insecurity.\nAs I conveyed to Prime Minister Abiy, the United States \u2013 as Ethiopia\u2019s largest bilateral donor, providing over $3 billion in humanitarian assistance since 2020 \u2013 we will continue to be there for Ethiopians.\nWe\u2019ll keep partnering on food security.  Today I announced an additional $331 million in emergency food and humanitarian assistance that will reach millions of people, millions of Ethiopians affected by conflict, affected by drought.\nWe\u2019ll keep working together on public health, building on our many years of partnership to combat HIV/AIDS, and continue to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that we\u2019re all prepared for future pandemics.\nWe\u2019ll continue to support Ethiopia\u2019s economic development, investing hundreds of millions in health, economic growth, education, democracy, and food security every year.\nAnd we\u2019ll continue to support migrants and refugees, and victims of human rights abuse.\nIn all (inaudible), our mission is to build a strong partnership between the United States and Ethiopia that ensures we can meet the aspirations of (inaudible).\nSo I look forward to an important week of engagement with our partners on the continent, including the engagements that we had today, building on a stretch of high-level visits from the administration since the Africa Leaders Summit: Treasury Secretary Yellen, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, First Lady Dr. Biden, and soon Vice President Harris, as she visits Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia later this month.\nSo with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:  We\u2019ll first go to Daphne Psaledakis with Reuters.\nQUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  There\u2019s been reports of continued atrocities since the November ceasefire.  Eritrean troops still remain in border areas, and Fano Amhara militia still remain in western Tigray.  Are you concerned that (inaudible)?  It\u2019s not working.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  I got you.\nQUESTION:  Okay.  Are you concerned that reported continued rapes and the presence of these troops could impede an effective implementation of the deal?  And what do you need to see from Ethiopia in terms of addressing accusations of atrocities during the conflict to reinstate AGOA trade benefits?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you very much.  As I said, what we\u2019ve seen since the agreement was reached (inaudible) has been very significant progress on all the necessary lines of effort and necessary commitments, and by and large the guns are silent, humanitarian assistance is flowing, services are being restored.  We\u2019ve seen the TPLF disarm its heavy weapons.  And we are seeing external forces moving out of Tigray, to include the Eritreans.  It\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s not complete.  It\u2019s a process.  But we continue to see significant movement in the right direction to fulfilling the commitments that were made in the agreement.\nAs to human rights concerns and abuses, I just had an opportunity to meet with human rights advocates and experts a short while ago here in Addis, and these are people who are themselves present or their organizations are present in Tigray, and this includes the United Nations.  And what they reported to me is a very significant drop in human rights violations and abuses in Tigray.  We\u2019ve also heard that from other sources.  That doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve been eliminated, and indeed, we are \u2013 we strongly urge all parties to the conflict to do everything possible to ensure that they cease entirely.  But again, we\u2019ve seen what was described to me by independent experts as a very significant diminution in human rights violations.\nWith regard to our own engagement and assistance as the work continues, as this process of implementing the agreement continues, to include making sure that there are no ongoing, proceeding violations of human rights, to include making sure that the transitional justice process is stood up and moving forward in an inclusive and credible way, then our own ability to continue to move forward on our engagement with Ethiopia \u2013 to include economic engagement \u2013 will also move forward.\nMR PATEL:  Let\u2019s next go to Million Beyene with The Addis Standard.\nQUESTION:  Thank you very much.  Recently (inaudible) and that is the State Department has shelved a (inaudible) designating violent human rights violations in Tigray as genocide, and why is that shelved?  And is there any (inaudible)?  Thank you very much.\nAnd (inaudible) campaign to (inaudible)?  And will they discuss (inaudible) principles?  I mean for the human rights and protect the UN investigation, the UN investigator\u2019s office (inaudible).  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Let me make sure I got your question correct (inaudible).  I think I did.\nFirst, let me be clear that the United States, first of all, has regularly spoken out about human rights violations and abuses committed against civilians and has called for accountability for those responsible.  A year ago I addressed this myself when I said that all parties to the conflict had committed atrocities.  Significantly, the signatories to the cessation of hostilities agreement acknowledged the atrocities committed and the devastating impact that they\u2019ve had.  And as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re very focused on making sure that that\u2019s stopped and ceases.\nThe reports that we have including just today from experts in the field show a very significant drop in human rights violations in Tigray.  That\u2019s significant and important, but obviously we want to see it get to \u2013 as in anyplace else \u2013 get to zero and that all parties remain committed to not engaging in any kind of abuse.\nGoing forward, what\u2019s very important is something else I mentioned: the commitment that exists to a process of transitional justice, and that includes both reconciliation and accountability.  And what I heard today from everyone I spoke to was a commitment to that process.  So we will be watching that as it moves forward, and this is something, again, that\u2019s vital not just for us or for any other country.  It\u2019s first and foremost vital to all Ethiopians, because having that kind of transitional justice, building reconciliation, though, and building accountability, is the only way, in our judgment, to make sure that the peace that\u2019s been achieved in Tigray is sustained.  Getting at grievances, getting to justice, bringing people together \u2013 that is the way to make sure that peace lasts and that people can move on with their lives and the country can really move forward.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.  Thank you.\nMR PATEL:  Let\u2019s next go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  I\u2019m wondering if I can get your reaction \u2013 these are sort of two broader questions \u2013 wondering if I can get your reaction to the U.S.-Russia drone collision.  I\u2019m just wondering what you make of Russia\u2019s motives here, their statements about the U.S. being directly involved in combat operations and the Russians potentially wanting to retrieve the debris.  I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a risk here that this widens the war further.\nAnd second, just on the recent Iran-Saudi agreement that was brokered in part by China, do you view this as a sign of China sort of striding more confidently onto the diplomatic world stage sort of post-COVID isolation?  Is that \u2013 especially combined with their Ukraine peace proposal and the foreign minister\u2019s recent comments about U.S. containment, is this a worry?  Is this sort of new posture a worry for the U.S.?  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  First, with regard to the drone, the incident is being investigated and we\u2019ll look to that investigation to draw any conclusions about what the intent might be \u2013 might have been, what the actions were.  Of course, we\u2019ll be in close coordination with allies and partners at the conclusion of the investigation.  I can\u2019t speak at this point to the motive or to intent.  But what I can say very clearly is this was a reckless and unsafe action.  But we\u2019ll let the investigation proceed.\nWith regard to the agreement reached between Saudi Arabia and Iran with China\u2019s involvement, from our perspective, anything that can help reduce tensions, avoid conflict, and curb in any way dangerous or destabilizing actions by Iran is a good thing.  And as you know, in this particular case, the Saudis and the Iranians have been talking for some time going back a couple of years, including in Baghdad and in Oman.  And to the extent that China facilitated conclusion of this agreement to restore diplomatic relations, that\u2019s a good thing.  And I think it\u2019s valuable that countries, where they can, take action, take responsibility for advancing security, for advancing peaceful relations.  And if this agreement actually bears out, and particularly if Iran follows through on the commitments that it\u2019s apparently made, again, that would be positive.\nMR PATEL:  Final question, Bilal Abdulmalik, Ethiopian Press Agency.\nQUESTION:  Thank you.  Many Ethiopians believe that U.S. decision to revoke Ethiopia\u2019s privilege for AGOA is a politically motivated one.  And after such progress, the U.S. still hasn\u2019t shown an interest to reverse the decision (inaudible).\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  So as you know, the United States suspended Ethiopia from the AGOA trade preference program effective January last year, 2022, due to gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.  And we did this as required by law.  It\u2019s in law and we follow the law.  Ethiopia has clear benchmarks for a pathway toward reinstatement.  The administration will continue to work closely with the government to achieve that objective, which we share.  And as I noted earlier, with the cessation of hostilities agreement, and particularly with its implementation, that\u2019s extremely important in moving down that path, and my hope and expectation is that will continue.\nJust for your information, the AGOA program itself is actually administered by the U.S. Trade Representative, and what they do is they have an annual review that brings together other parts of our government, looking at the eligibility requirements.  But there will be that process.  We\u2019ll participate.  We actually hosted a ministerial meeting of AGOA during the Africa Leaders Summit in December, and we\u2019re very much looking forward to planning AGOA (inaudible) next year.\nBut the bottom line is certainly we share the aspiration of Ethiopia returning to AGOA.  And as it continues to implement the cessation of hostilities agreement, it will \u2013 it\u2019s clearly moving in the right direction.\nMR PATEL:  Thank you, everyone.  Thanks, everybody.",

		"audience": "EAST ROOM",
		"location": "THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON, D.C.",
		"date": "MARCH 8, 2023",
		"content": "Play Video\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Please take a seat.  And it is a special honor for me to be able to say, welcome to the White House.  (Applause.)  And welcome especially to the 2023 International Women of Courage Awards Ceremony to all of you participating here in person and tuning in from around the world.\nFor 17 years now, U.S. secretaries of state have recognized International Women of Courage who are leading the charge for progress around the world.  This year, for the first time, we honor the awardees here at the White House \u2013 and that really is a reflection of just how highly President Biden, the First Lady, and this administration prioritize gender equality and human rights.\nDr. Biden, thank you for bringing us here today.  But thank you more than that for everything that you\u2019re doing every single day to be such a remarkable role model to so many women around the world, and for your incredibly tireless efforts to lift up the voices of brave women everywhere around the world.\nMRS BIDEN:  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  So we\u2019re joined today by ambassadors from across the globe, who are essential partners in all of our efforts to make sure that women and girls can reach their full potential.\nWe have senior leaders from across the United States Government here: Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, our champion, our voice, at the United Nations.  Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks.  Under Secretary of State Uzra Zeya, our advocate for human rights.  Jen Klein, Kat Fotovat, who are leaders of our global gender policy.  And of course White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, also such a powerful voice for our country and for this administration around the world.  And I also want to point out our team from the Bureau for Educational and Cultural Affairs.  We\u2019re working with so many of you every single day in the work that you\u2019re doing.\nWe\u2019re also joined by members of the State Department\u2019s Locally Employed Staff.  They\u2019re literally the lifeblood of our missions in every country in the world.  To be here today, some of them have traveled from more than a dozen countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, and the Middle East.  It\u2019s wonderful to be with you today as well.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nAnd in the audience we have several previous winners of the International Women of Courage Award, who are continuing their inspiring work.  And the First Lady and I had an opportunity to greet them, to be able to say in person what we were not able to do the last couple of years, which is:  Congratulations and thank you for the incredible work that you\u2019re doing.  (Applause.)\nAnd, of course, last but not least, our guests of honor, this year\u2019s International Women of Courage.  Welcome to all of you.  (Applause.)\nWhen Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice launched this initiative in 2007, she did so to honor women creating brighter futures \u2013 for themselves, for their communities, and for generations to come.\nSince then, this award has recognized more than 180 women from over 80 countries around the world.\nAnd that includes this year\u2019s honorees: 11 truly extraordinary people.\nAs you\u2019ll hear, these women are reporting on Russian atrocities in Ukraine.  They\u2019re fighting for equal opportunities for women and girls in Mongolia.  They\u2019re defending democracy in the Central African Republic.  They\u2019re protecting indigenous land in Costa Rica.  They\u2019re advocating for the rights of refugees, people with disabilities, the LGBTQI+ community.\nBecause of their work, and even as they do it every single day, they are faced with extraordinary challenges that, as you learn about them, read about them, are humbling.  They, their loved ones in many cases, have endured harassment.  They\u2019ve endured violence.  Some have been imprisoned.  Others have been subject of misinformation and online attacks day in, day out.  And yet each and every one has refused to be intimidated.\nIn every region, there are other women doing this work who we can\u2019t name individually \u2013 in some cases because the attention would put them at even greater risk.  So we\u2019ve found a new way to honor them.\nThis year, we\u2019re launching a group award, named after a pioneer and champion of equality, the great Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.  We have \u2013 (applause) \u2013 we have several members of the Albright family here today to help us celebrate.  I like to think I\u2019m an extended member of that family.  (Laughter.)  For me, as I\u2019ve told our friends, I hear Madeleine Albright\u2019s voice in my head on a regular basis; the clarity with which she spoke and what she said continues to resonate and continues to inspire me in the work that I and my team are doing.  But you honor us with your presence today.  Thank you for being here.\nAround the world, women \u2013 in all of their diversity \u2013 are often the ones on the front lines of change.  And yet, at the same time, they face still greater obstacles to their political participation; they experience gender-based violence and human rights abuses; they hold less economic and social power.  We are committed to changing that.\nDefending the rights of women and girls is rooted in our democratic values of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.  And when we advance equality and defend the rights of women, we improve life for everyone.  When peace is forged with the participation and the leadership of women, it\u2019s more likely to last.  We know this from experience.  Closing the gender gap in the global workforce would add $28 trillion to the global economy.  And as Secretary Albright once said, we simply cannot build the future that we want without the contribution of women.\nThat\u2019s why President Biden has made gender equality and women\u2019s rights a priority of our foreign policy.  Some of you know we recently launched the first-ever, cross-government Strategy on Women\u2019s Global Economic Security, to try to help reduce the enduring wage gap, to improve access to well-paying jobs, to dismantle barriers to women\u2019s economic participation.  In December, the United States also updated our strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based violence globally, including new efforts to expand access to programs for historically marginalized communities.\nWe\u2019re also learning from \u2013 and teaming up with \u2013 governments, civil society, the private sector in other countries to work toward gender equality together, including, of course, the women that we\u2019re honoring today.  One of those women \u2013 Hadeel Abdel Aziz \u2013 noted that, when it comes to advancing this struggle, success is \u201cnot about one big act\u201d \u2013 \u201cnot about one big act of heroism, but \u2026 one hundred small battles.\u201d\nTo our honorees, the United States is proud to be by your side, as you and others wage those hundred small battles, day in, day out.  And we will be there and be there with you for the long haul.\nThat includes, of course, the First Lady of the United States, Dr. Jill Biden.  The First Lady.  (Applause.)\n(The First Lady delivered remarks.)\nMODERATOR:  Please welcome Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights at the U.S. Department of State Uzra Zeya.  (Applause.)\nUNDER SECRETARY ZEYA:  It takes courage to seek justice when the powerful stand against you.\nLaws can protect the innocent or persecute the oppressed.  And when the rule of law becomes a tool of tyranny, or when the structures in place simply fail to live up to the promise of equality, fairness, and humanity, we appeal to a higher ideal: justice.\nThe women we honor today have worked tirelessly to ensure that their nations\u2019 legal systems protect all people, no matter their gender, beliefs, or background.  And when those systems cannot \u2013 or will not \u2013 protect every citizen, they have fought to transform them.  They have broken barriers, risen to new heights, and inspired other young women to follow their lead.\nBecause without women\u2019s rights, perspectives, and participation, there can be no justice.  But when we all have the opportunity to shape our laws, we create systems that truly serve us all.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nAnd now, Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken will present the awards.  (Applause.)\nAs the first woman to lead the Central African Republic\u2019s Constitutional Court, Dani\u00e8le Darlan became known as the \u201cwoman of iron\u201d for her refusal to be intimidated.  She\u2019s spent her career working to ensure the law delivers justice to all, no matter their background.  And in the face of enormous pressure to allow the president to rewrite the constitution to give himself an illegal third term, she refused, sacrificing her career to safeguard the rule of law.  (Applause.)\nAs founder and executive director of Jordan\u2019s Justice Center for Legal Aid, Hadeel Abdel Aziz provides legal services to thousands of people every year who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to a lawyer.  She works to educate people about their rights so that they know how to protect themselves and are empowered to do so.  (Applause.)\nDuring political unrest in Kazakhstan, which resulted in deaths and credible reports of torture, longtime civil rights advocate Bakhytzhan Toregozhina used phone calls to expose human rights violations during an internet blackout.  She then founded a coalition to document violations and provide legal and mental health support to victims of torture and abuse.  (Applause.)\nPlease join me once more in congratulating these incredible women.  (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:  Please welcome Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks.  (Applause.)\nDEPUTY SECRETARY HICKS:  It takes courage to seek peace when you are the target of violence.\nWhen wars are waged, when authoritarians seek to consolidate power, when conflict uproots and displaces families, women and girls shoulder many of the costs and consequences.\nThose who wish to harm and turn their violence on women and girls often do so because women and girls serve as a society\u2019s source of strength and a beacon of hope.\nIt\u2019s because when women use their voices to speak out against authoritarianism, their leadership can create lasting democratic change.\nWhen women use their voices to stand up for what\u2019s right against overwhelming odds, their voices can reverberate around the world.\nAnd when women have a seat at the table, they hold the power to lead their communities toward peace and prosperity.\nAnd that\u2019s the truth.\nStudies show that when women participate in peace negotiations, these talks are more likely to come to a just settlement and result in lasting stability.\nPeace is possible when we support the women working to make it a reality \u2013 by stopping conflicts before they begin, by addressing the root causes of discrimination and violence, and by working to end wars that have already begun and mitigating their harm.\nSo today, we salute several women leaders who are exhibiting extraordinary courage to seek peace when they themselves are the targets of violence; women who are using their strength to pursue gender equity and equality in the face of extreme cruelty and hate; women who are fighting for dignity and freedom for not just themselves but for others.\nIn our awardees, we see that our capacity for understanding and healing is stronger than the forces that try to tear us apart \u2013 and we are reminded that women belong everywhere the decisions are made.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nOn behalf of Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken, I\u2019m honored to present awards to the following women.\nIn Mongolia, Brigadier General Bolor Ganbold is the first female staff officer in her country to be assigned to a United Nations peacekeeping operation \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and the first female general to serve in the Mongolian armed forces.  Brigadier Ganbold has served in peacekeeping missions around the world, and she has advocated for gender equality in peacekeeping forces and her country\u2019s military, so that women and girls can be properly protected during and after conflicts.  (Applause.)\nIn Costa Rica, Doris R\u00edos has dedicated her life to fighting for indigenous women\u2019s rights to life and dignity and for the reclamation of indigenous lands.  (Applause.)  In the face of threats of violence and attacks against her and her family, she has created a seat at the table for indigenous women to make the world more peaceful and just.  (Applause.)\nIn Argentina, Alba Rueda is a transgender woman who was kicked out of classrooms, barred for sitting for exams, refused job opportunities, subjected to violence, and rejected by her family.  But in the face of these challenges, she worked to end violence and discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community in Argentina.  (Applause.)\nAfter women were barred from schools in Afghanistan, Zakira Hekmat secretly finished high school and won a scholarship to study in T\u00fcrkiye, eventually becoming a doctor.  After seeing the difficulty refugees faced, she founded the Afghan Refugee Solidarity Association to advocate for the rights of all refugees and women.  (Applause.)\nIt is my privilege and honor \u2013 to honor each of you for your important contributions to human rights and for making the world a more peaceful place.\nCongratulations, and thank you for your courage.  (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:  Please welcome White House Press Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.  (Applause.)\nMS JEAN-PIERRE:  It takes courage to speak when those in power want to stay \u2013 want you to stay silent.\nIn a world where lies and distortion are easy to sell, one of the most powerful weapons that we have is the truth.\nBecause corruption thrives in darkness, dictators and authoritarians seek to control criticism and define the stories that we tell.  They threaten journalists and those who speak out, so they can control knowledge and hide their crimes \u2013 selling their people false stories of peace and success.\nBut when we illuminate the shadows, we can expose the damage they create \u2013 lighting a path forward for those trapped in the dark with the knowledge and the strength to rise and demand change.\nThis group of journalists, broadcasters, and war correspondents spread truth, courage, and empower other women and girls to use their voices for democracy, freedom, and justice.\n(A video was played.)\nAnd once again, Dr. Biden and Secretary Blinken will present the awards.\nThrough her independent YouTube news channel, Roha TV, veteran Ethiopian journalist Meaza Mohammed shares stories of those who are often silenced.  Despite three arrests in under one year, she continued to raise her voice, advocating for survivors of gender-based violence and urging accountability for crimes committed against them.  (Applause.)\nWhile helping evacuate women and children from areas affected by war, Ukrainian military veteran Yuliia Paievska secretly documented Russian forces-committed atrocities during the 2022 siege of Mariupol.  (Applause.)  She smuggled a memory card to the Associated Press in a tampon, and was forced to destroy another with her teeth before being captured by Russian forces and tortured for information.  (Applause.)  Since her release, she has continued to raise her voice for her people, pushing for peace and independence for Ukraine.  (Applause.)\nAs a broadcaster journalist, Ras Adiba Radzi became a household name.  After a car accident and brutal assault permanently paralyzed her from the waist down, she used her platform to advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities \u2013 (applause) \u2013 first as a reporter, and now as a senator in Malaysia\u2019s parliament and the first female chair of the national Malaysian news agency, Bernama.  (Applause.)\nWhile Polish journalist Bianka Zalewska was combating Russian misinformation in 2014, her car was shot, causing accident that broke her spine.  Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, and in the face of intimidation and death threats, she continues her work documenting war crimes, lifting up stories of refugees, and training other journalists to effectively counter misinformation.  (Applause.)\nPlease join me in a round of applause for all of our awardees.  (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:  Please welcome U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield.  (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD:  Hello, everyone.  It really is a privilege to present this new award \u2013 one that honors our first female Secretary of State, the late Madeleine Albright.\nSecretary Albright showed so many women, including myself, how to lead with moral clarity and with courage.\nHer legacy lives on in those still fighting for gender equality and universal human rights.\nIt is fitting that this award recognizes not just one woman, but the bravery, the fortitude, and collaboration of a whole movement.\nIt speaks to the outsized impact of Secretary Albright\u2019s example and life of service.\nWhen the Albright family \u2013 who is here with us today \u2013 learned about this award, they asked that another trailblazing leader \u2013 one who knew Secretary Albright well \u2013 be part of this ceremony: Secretary Condoleezza Rice.\nSecretary Rice created the International Women of Courage award in 2007, and though she couldn\u2019t join us today, she wanted to take part in this very special ceremony.\n(A video was played.)\n(Applause.)\nAnd I wish they could be here to hear your applause.\nI\u2019m proud to present the Madeleine K. Albright Honorary Group International Women of Courage Award.\nThis inaugural award goes to women and girls in Iran, who \u2013 in the wake of the brutal killing of Mahsa Amini \u2013 have inspired us all.\nAll Mahsa wanted was to live a normal and happy life.  She dreamed of starting a family after finishing her studies.\nBut these hopes and dreams were crushed.  They were crushed by the tyranny of Iran\u2019s so-called \u201cmorality police.\u201d\nThe Iranian Government probably thought this would just be another footnote in a long record of violence and discrimination against women.\nBut this time \u2013 this time it was different.\nThe Iranian people \u2013 led by women \u2013 took to the streets in peaceful protest.\nThey followed in the footsteps of brave women before them, who sacrificed so much in the name of freedom.  Through neighborhoods and classrooms, out of apartment buildings and car windows, the protesters chanted throughout Iran and around the world, creating a global chorus demanding gender equality and human rights.\nBut for all the hope this movement represents, we must never forget how the Iranian regime has responded.\nThey have tortured peaceful protesters.  They have arrested tens of thousands of people.  They have badly injured and killed Iranians in bloody crackdowns.\nThe international community must continue to condemn the regime\u2019s repression and violence.\nAnd we must back up our words with action.\nThat\u2019s why the United States led a successful effort to remove Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women.\nAnd it\u2019s why we are working to hold those complicit in these abuses accountable.\nTo all the women and girls across Iran \u2013 know this:  We will continue to stand with you in your fight for women, for life, and for freedom.\nSo everyone, please join me in recognizing the courageous women and girls in Iran.  (Applause.)\nThank you.\nI now have the honor of introducing another courageous woman who has been an unwavering champion for vulnerable populations in Malaysia.\nWhen a car accident and a brutal assault paralyzed Senator Ras Adiba Radzi from the waist down, she dedicated her life to advocacy.\nTo raise awareness, Malaysians across the country saw her on TV, in parliament, and at the Paralympics.  They heard her commentary.  They heard her poetry.  They heard her fierce call for justice.\nIn May 2020, she became Malaysia\u2019s representative for people with disabilities \u2013 and later that year, she was appointed the first female chair of the Malaysian National News Agency.\nSenator Ras Adiba Radzi embodies \u2013 she embodies what it means to live a life in service to others.  Please join me in welcoming her to the podium.  (Applause.)\nMS RADZI:  Assalamu alaikum, or peace be upon you.\nI\u2019m Senator Ras Adiba Radzi, a representative of the 2023 International Women of Courage Award.  Before I begin, I would like to thank the First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, the Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, and the U.S. Department of State for giving me the opportunity to speak today.\nI\u2019d have to say that I\u2019m thoroughly impressed by the amazing work done by my fellow finalists in their respective countries.  Let\u2019s give them a big hand.  (Applause.)  Among others, I am joined by women who are fighting against gender-based violence, for the rights of indigenous persons, and for the rule of law.\nHonorable guests, I was born able-bodied and became permanently paralyzed from the waist down after several incidents.  I became a spinal-cord-injured person following a car accident in 1995, a brutal assault a year later, and finally in 2002 when I fell after climbing a ladder.\nSince then, I have committed my life to fighting for the rights of persons with disabilities in my country, Malaysia.  I witnessed discrimination and stigma as persons with disabilities and then on my team and I fought and fought and fought.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been working tirelessly to create awareness on the importance of accessibility in infrastructure, disability inclusion, job opportunities, inclusive education, housing, and upholding our rights, among others.\nI and my team then founded an association to empower persons with disabilities called OKU Sentral.  In May 2020, the Malaysian king, His Majesty the King Al-Sultan Abdullah, appointed me as a senator in the upper house parliament of Malaysia to represent persons with disabilities.  In November 2020, I was appointed the first female chair of the Malaysian National News Agency, BERNAMA, after 53 years of its establishment.\nDistinguished guests, in the area of sustainable development, all of us here aim to create a world which is inclusive, equitable, and sustainable, a world in which no one is left behind and opportunities be made available for all, for a secure, stable, and successful nation.  Without the role and contribution of women, a nation will not be able to progress as it is today.  It is vital for all parties to respect the contribution of women in all areas: economy, social, politics and culture.  Women\u2019s involvement is crucial, as they are an important asset to a country.\nSo let\u2019s, again, give a big round of applause \u2013 and actually I feel like hugging them all \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 especially to the women here and to women across the world who have excelled in their roles and contributed towards a prosperous nation worldwide. We are at a pivotal moment for women\u2019s rights.  For us, receiving this International Women of Courage Award is very, very much significant for our people in each of our countries.  This will be an integral part of spreading awareness and will celebrate the activism and transformative power of women and girls.\nHonorable guests, this opportunity is indeed an honor for me to share my views and experience, especially concerning the protection and social participation of persons with disabilities in Malaysia with everyone here today. Despite the increasing awareness around persons with disabilities, there is no denial that there\u2019s discrimination in this polarized world, exists to the detriment of our disabled friends.  It exists because of a prevailing mindset, a stereotypical way of looking at the disabled.  What the community needs to understand and to accept is that persons with disabilities are entitled to the full range of civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights, as stated in various human rights instruments, the same as everyone else.\nOn that note, and as we speak, the Malaysian Government is in the midst of amending the Persons with Disabilities Act 2008 to have an Anti-Discrimination Act for Persons with Disabilities like the United Kingdom\u2019s and the Americans with Disability Act 1990 or ADA.\nEsteemed guests, raising awareness of basic human rights and the right to be free of discrimination among women, children, and persons with disabilities is the fundamental aspect in which we must continue to work on.  Without such awareness, it is extremely difficult to bring about justice and change.  The increasing number of hate crimes, racist remarks, and instances of ableist behavior shows that we must act quickly to protect the most vulnerable communities.\nHence, I would like to take this opportunity to call on the 195 governments of the day in the world to ensure that the marginalized and vulnerable groups \u2013 women, children, including persons with disabilities \u2013 are not left out and rise to the clarion call of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda: leave no one behind.\nBefore I end my speech, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the late Judith Heumann, a leader in the disability community, advocating for persons with disabilities and has been the mother of the disability rights movement since the \u201970s.  We will miss her terribly.  But myself and the rest of us, I promise you, will continue to be her voice.  As she puts it, we are leaders of inclusiveness and community, of love, equity, and justice.\nHonorable guests, me standing here today \u2013 in my standing wheelchair \u2013 means a whole lot, especially for my countrymen, Malaysia.  So I\u2019d like to say in Malay sejuta doa mencapai bintang, which means a million prayers has now reached the skies.\nTerima kasih or thank you for this honor, and from the bottom of my heart, assalamu alaikum.  (Applause.)\nMODERATOR:  Please welcome Acting Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women\u2019s Issues at the U.S. Department of State Kat Fotovat.  (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR FOTOVAT:  What an honor it is to close out such a historic day, such a historic event.  Happy International Women\u2019s Day to all those around the world and to our amazing Women of Courage we honor today.  What an incredible ceremony.\nI must say, I am rendered nearly speechless by the senator\u2019s remarks.  Your resilience, determination, and grit in the fact of extreme adversity and your resolve to continue to fight for women\u2019s rights as human rights, to achieve a better future for us, is both humbling and energizing.\nI couldn\u2019t also help but think of my dear friend and personal hero Judy Heumann, whose funeral I attended just this morning.  Judy was a leader of the international disability rights movement who said, \u201cI simply refused to accept what I was told about who I could be.  And I was willing to make a fuss about it.\u201d  Through your work, senator, and the work of all of our awardees, Judy\u2019s legacy of defending the rights and communities facing discrimination will live on.  You and all of our International Women of Courage awardees are truly inspirational for your courage and, as Judy noted, to make a fuss about it.\nI\u2019m so honored to be here at the White House today to join First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Secretary Blinken, and the other distinguished speakers who joined us to pay tribute to the recipients of the Secretary of State 2023 International Women of Courage Awards.  The IWOC Award is truly a centerpiece and guiding force behind my office\u2019s work to lead the Department of State\u2019s efforts to promote the rights and empowerment of women and girls worldwide, and it is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and assistance.\nToday, our awardees join a truly incredible group of more than 180 women from more than 80 countries who have received the International Women of Courage Award since 2007 in recognition of the exceptional courage, strength, and leadership all of you have shown, advocating for peace, justice, human rights, and gender equity and equality, often at great personal risk and sacrifice.  I hope this award will elevate your advocacy work and bring greater international attention to the issues that you are fighting for.\nEvery day, as my colleagues and I carry out our mission, working with our partners to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, advance women\u2019s economic security, and promote the women, peace, and security agenda across the globe, we draw inspiration from fearless women\u2019s rights champions like the courageous women who are \u2013 we are gathered here to honor today, and also from their advocates, defenders, their family members, government allies, civil society leaders, and journalists who are also in this room today championing gender equity and equality, not just in words but in action.\nToday, on International Women\u2019s Day, the U.S. Government reaffirms our commitment to the safety and full participation of women and girls in decision-making at all levels and as foundational to peace, stability, and economic growth of all nations.\nI\u2019d also like to quote Secretary Albright, who said, \u201cIt took me a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent.\u201d  (Laughter and applause.)\nTo our 2023 Courage Awards, thank you again for using your voices and being the voice for those who can\u2019t use theirs.  Let us all commit to using our voices to amplify those facing oppression, crisis, and in conflict in places like Iran, Ukraine, and Afghanistan, and all over the world.\nCongratulations to our awardees, and thank you for all you have done to give women and girls everywhere a fighting chance.  We stand with you and for you.  And thank you, everyone here today, joining us to celebrate these truly amazing and courageous women.  Happy International Women\u2019s Day.  Thank you.  (Applause.)",

Good to have you at the State Department and very glad especially for this opportunity to continue to deepen the already strong bilateral relationship between Trinidad and Tobago and the United States.\nWe are working together in so many ways every day in our own hemisphere, working to continue to strengthen democracy, to forge ahead on building even greater economic prosperity, working on challenges of regional security.  Of course, we have deep connections between our people.  There are more than 10,000 Americans visiting Trinidad and Tobago every year for tourism, for business, and we want to see that increase.  We have a very vibrant diaspora here in the United States which we very much welcome.\nBut we\u2019ve also done a lot of work together particularly building off of the President and Vice President\u2019s, I think, very important and in some ways even historic meeting with the CARICOM countries during the \u2013 during our summit in Los Angeles.  And what we were really instructed to do by the President and Vice President following that meeting was to actually follow up and to make good on the important discussion but also on the important initiatives that came out of that meeting, and this is a good opportunity to do that.\nSo Amery, welcome.  Very good to have you here.\nFOREIGN MINISTER BROWNE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary of State, Tony, for your warm welcome.  It\u2019s a pleasure to meet with you here at the Jefferson Room and to meet with your team.  As you know, Ambassador Bond has settled magnificently in Port of Spain, and I am pleased to be joined by our ambassador to Washington, D.C., a very distinguished member of our foreign service.\nIt\u2019s great to be here and I\u2019m looking forward to our discussions and to working with you to further cement a well-established and productive, fruitful relationship between Trinidad and Tobago and the United States of America.  You\u2019re right; we\u2019ve been working closely on a number of critical issues.  Some of the priorities for the Caribbean community are shared with the United States of America \u2013 energy security, food security, improving our access to financing for development, and recognizing that the United States and Trinidad and Tobago go back hundreds of years.  And we share a significant diaspora, but we also share principles in common \u2013 respect for democracy, a desire for peace in our region, and to see countries working more closely together.\nSo I\u2019m looking forward to our discussions and to putting the commitment established at the recent Summit of the Americas further to action and to ensure that our countries can be \u2013 continue to be very close collaborators.  So thank you very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks, everyone.  Appreciate it.",

		"content": "SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Good afternoon, everyone.  It\u2019s a great pleasure to welcome my friend, the foreign minister of Lithuania, here today.  Gabrielius, welcome back to the State Department, to Washington.  I think we \u2013 we met almost exactly a year ago today in Vilnius, but it\u2019s really great to have you here.\nAnd this is a momentous period in a number of ways.  We, of course, have the work that we are doing together with the great leadership of Lithuania in helping Ukraine continue to defend itself against the aggression from Russia; work that is now being done to prepare for what will be a very important NATO summit in Vilnius in just a few months\u2019 time, so I look forward to comparing notes on that as we head to the summit, as well as the ongoing support for Ukraine.\nAnd I must say as well that Lithuania has done an extraordinary job standing up to and resisting economic coercion coming from China because of its relationship with Taiwan.  We strongly supported Lithuania in those efforts.  I think your leadership in effectively resisting that economic coercion is a model for other countries, and we continue to stand with you in dealing with that.\nSo it\u2019s very good to have you here today, and look forward to a good conversation.\nFOREIGN MINISTER LANDSBERGIS:  Well, thank you.  And it is a great pleasure, an honor, to be back here and to have a chance to thank you and your country for the support that you provided to Ukraine throughout the last year.  And I wish we had been meeting in calmer, more boring times; unfortunately, we\u2019re living in historic times, and therefore it shows that we are having in three \u2013 in two years what is our third meeting, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\nAnd I will use this chance also to thank for standing up with Lithuania when it comes to China\u2019s coercion.  I think truly we developed a success story.  And unfortunately, most likely it won\u2019t be the last time when countries are coerced, and I\u2019m happy to provide all the information from Lithuania how did we manage that.\nBut I will also use this opportunity to thank in a bit historic matter for U.S. being not afraid, 30 years ago, to see the Soviet Union losing a standoff of decades-long.  And out of that standoff, out of that victory, and out of that loss, came Lithuanian independence.  And me sitting here is the evidence of that victory 30 years ago.  You were not afraid then, and I think we need to reassure ourselves and our partners in Ukraine that we won\u2019t be afraid of their victory again today.  Because out of their victory a independent, sovereign, democratic, free Ukraine will be reborn out of this unjust war that is happening in Ukraine.\nSo once again, I\u2019m very grateful for the chance to meet and talk, and hopefully we\u2019re preparing for better times to come.  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks, everyone.",

		"speaker": "ANTONY J. BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE",
		"audience": "TAJ PALACE HOTEL",
		"location": "NEW DELHI, INDIA",
		"date": "MARCH 3, 2023",
		"content": "MR SARAN:  So good morning.  Let me also welcome you to the business end of the Raisina Dialogue after yesterday\u2019s inauguration.  For us at ORF and at the Raisina Dialogue, this is a very special day.  Many years ago, 2017 if I recall, we toyed with the idea of bringing the admirals from Quad together.  I can see the Pacific Command table here, and the Pacific Command was instrumental partner in trying to cajole others to join in to having and discussing the possibilities of Quad being an actor, being a player, being a contributor to the world at whole.  Let me tell you, all capitals are very shy, and everyone was asking us at that time should we probably involve another country, someone else, so that it doesn\u2019t look like Quad, that doesn\u2019t feel like Quad, we can try and dilute it a little.  So from that time many years ago to today when we have the Quad Squad sitting here, we have come a long way.   \n  So we are thrilled and thank you all of you very \u2013 for joining us, and it\u2019s a fantastic day for Raisina.  So let me start with Minister Wong.  Minister Wong, you\u2019ve just stepped out of a meeting.  You had a formal meeting this morning of \u2013 with your colleagues.  Let me ask you: How does this group add to your agenda?  You are now writing Australian foreign policy future.  How does this meeting help in your individual agenda in Australia?  And certainly since you are focused on the Pacific and ASEAN, how can Quad be a complementary actor, a supportive actor, perhaps even a contributor to your own assessment and ambitions in that region?  \n  FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:  Well, can I start with a complementarity point because I think that answers the first part of your question?  I mean, the complementarity of this configuration with the architecture of the region, some of which you referenced, I think is demonstrated from Australia\u2019s perspective by our geography and by our interests. \n   So in terms of our geography, we are the smallest economy here.  We\u2019re the most \u2013 southern most economy here.  We are bounded on one side by the Indian Ocean and the other side by the Pacific, as it, Asia \u2013 ASEAN in particular, to our north the countries of ASEAN.  So for us, our interests lie in a world which is being reshaped and a region which is being reshaped in working through this and the architecture of the region to ensure a region which I describe as stable, peaceful, secure, and respectful of sovereignty.  So our geography and our interests lead to complementarity.   \n  So I also believe that there is a tangible complementarity in the sense that there are things that we engage with Pacific Island nations on, things with which we engage with the ASEAN \u2013 countries of the ASEAN region on, issues on which we engage in this grouping, and they are all aligned with our interests in economic development, in prosperity, in stability, and in the protection of sovereignty.   \n  MR SARAN:  Since you\u2019re also in the very first year of your \u2013 of the new role that you\u2019ve assumed, and to the Indian audience that\u2019s hearing you, what is Australia\u2019s assessment of India\u2019s role in the region, in your life?  And by inference, perhaps also where are we headed in the bilateral?  \n  FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:  I mean, India is \u2014    \n  MR SARAN:  And can I request you to bring the mike closer to you?  Thank you.  Yeah.  \n  FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:  Right.  I could answer the question in power terms and in influence terms.  I could talk about the extent to which India is a critical power, a great power in the region, that there is no reshaping of the Indo-Pacific with the attributes that Australia would seek without India.  I\u2019d also make the point \u2013 and I think we\u2019ve seen that in not only in how Jai engages with the world and his narrative around it, but also Prime Minister Modi.  India is a civilizational power \u2013 brings a different perspective to some of the challenges of these times. \n   MR SARAN:  I\u2019m going to come back to you, Minister Wong, but let me now turn to Secretary Blinken.  One of the big conversations in India and other parts of the Indo-Pacific certainly is around how distracted is America with the conflict in Europe and how committed is it to continuing to engage in this region.  Is Quad an interim consultative group even as the real action unfolds with your old allies and in the old world?   \n  SECRETARY BLINKEN:  I think the very fact not only of our presence here today but our presence and engagement day-in, day-out, including through the Quad and the work that we\u2019re doing not only during the meetings that we have but in between, is powerful evidence of the fact that, as you might say, we can run and chew gum at the same time.  And for us the future is so much in the Indo-Pacific.  Our engagement throughout the region, both through the Quad and in other ways, is as comprehensive and as deep as any time I can remember.   \n  And I think what we talked about yesterday in the course of the G20 was also illustrative of this, because even as we\u2019re rightly focused on what is happening in Ukraine as a result of the Russian aggression, not just because it matters to Ukrainians and to Ukraine and to Europe, but because it matters to the entire world.  The principles that underlie the entire international system that are necessary for trying to keep peace, the stability that grew out of two world wars are being challenged, being aggressed along with Ukraine.  And part of the reason that countries way beyond Europe are also so focused on this and are working to support Ukraine and deal with the challenge is because they know it could have an effect here.  If we allow with impunity Russia to do what it\u2019s doing in Ukraine, then that\u2019s a message to wouldbe aggressors everywhere that they may be able to get away with it too.   \n  But having said that, you saw yesterday and you see today in this meeting of the Quad an equally intense focus on the issues that are having an impact on the lives of all of our fellow citizens where the Quad is a force, I believe, for good, positive, affirmative action.  What\u2019s in so many ways important about it is this: first, we start with the proposition that virtually none of the challenges that our people are facing and that people around the world are facing can be effectively dealt with by any one country acting alone, whether it\u2019s the United States, whether it\u2019s India, whether it\u2019s Japan, whether it\u2019s Australia.   \n  And given that basic premise, it makes sense for us to start by finding likeminded groups of countries with which to tackle these challenges.  And the great power of the Quad is you have four likeminded countries united in their basic values, united in their basic interests, bringing different strengths, different experiences, different comparative weights to tackling these problems.  And not only tackling for ourselves, but actually creating a global commons good, particularly for other countries in the Indo-Pacific.   \n  And what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years in particular is translated that into very practical projects, very practical \u2013 in a sense \u2013 offerings, so that we\u2019re creating for other countries in the region a positive choice and a positive partner.   We\u2019re doing that \u2013 obviously we did this on vaccines under \u2013 during COVID.  We\u2019ve been doing it on infrastructure for some time.  We are now engaged very much in working together to help countries deal with humanitarian situations, disasters.   \n  And of course, we\u2019re working on things that are really critical in ways that may not be so obvious to countries throughout the region, which is what\u2019s called maritime domain awareness: giving countries the capacity, the tools, to have a full picture of everything that\u2019s happening in their maritime space, which is affecting the lives of many of their citizens; for example, illegal fishing.  So I think not only are we not distracted; on the contrary, we\u2019re more deeply engaged than ever, and the Quad is one of the most critical vehicles for that engagement.   \n  MR SARAN:  Secretary, our bilateral relationships, India-U.S. bilateral relationships, have taken a step forward with this latest critical and emerging technologies agreement, a lot of excitement, a lot of coverage.  Can the Quad elevate itself to collaborate on critical defense technologies, or is that going to be the \u2013 preserved for AUKUS and for the old partners?  Does Quad have a vision for also working together on building the defense for future? \n  SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, I\u2019d say two things.  First, of course this is not a military grouping.  It\u2019s not that kind of alliance.  But one of the things that we are doing through the Quad is trying to bring together not only governments but academia and other experts to look at where we might collaborate together on new technology, on innovation, and whether that has benefits in other areas remains to be seen. \n  But clearly, our four countries in particular are very well-placed to increase in a variety of ways our collaboration on emerging technology and on innovation, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll also do through the Quad.  \n  MR SARAN:  Minister Hayashi, is Quad relevant for Japan\u2019s maritime security concerns?  How is it important for what\u2019s unfolding in East China Sea?  Do you think it is a feel-good talk shop consultative group, or do you think it has the potential to be able to put together something that will be of use to you when things get rough?   \n  FOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:  Thank you, thank you.  Like Tony said, this Quad is not for security issues nor military issues, but practical cooperation like everybody said.  So since your question is about might and security, this is not directly for the security, but through those cooperation and including four of us, and then the (inaudible) Blue Pacific areas like Pacific Island countries and ASEAN and also South Asia.  This understanding and mutual understanding and cooperation, then the \u2013 there will make some combined will to cherish the same value like democracy, freedom, and that will eventually help to have more security assurance environment for all of us.  \n  MR SARAN:  Okay, it\u2019s not a security actor.  The other important area that Japan is focused on is connectivity, and it is investing in infrastructure across the region.  Do you think Quad can have an agenda for connectivity and infrastructure?  Do you think it could be an actor and contribute to that?   \n  FOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:  Yes, through our bilateral ODAs and also through some international institutions, we\u2019ve been already in many decades doing some infrastructure and also economic cooperation in these areas.  But on the top of that this Quad is not only bilateral like Japan and some countries, but this is a Quad as a whole will be coordinating all those efforts of four countries so that we can do much better than just one plus one plus one is four.  One plus one plus one plus one is four, but the one plus one plus one plus one could be six, seven or eight by coordinating and listening.  We have now eight ears to listen to all those needs of the countries, and communicate and coordinating in the Quad like we did in this morning.  We can listen more and we can do more.  \n  MR SARAN:  Eight ears, but you also have four tongues, and we have to be watchful there. \n  But let me ask you the last final question for this round to you, Minister Hayashi.  The China factor.  Many of us have a very strong economic relationship \u2013 Japan certainly does \u2013 with China.  China disapproves of the Quad, and in some sense, you have to navigate that as well.  How does Japan do that?   \n  FOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:  So like we said, like I said, this not a military but this is just practical cooperation and we don\u2019t trying to exclude anybody.  This is an open architecture.  So one thing we would like to say is to just abide by the law, of international law, international institutions.  And as long as even China abide by the rule of the international norm and also act like \u2013 act under the international institutions, standards, and laws, then this is not conflicting issues between China and the Quad.   \n  MR SARAN:  Let me turn to you, Minister Jaishankar, and perhaps you can enlighten us.  Why was Quad in some ways dead on arrival 10 to 15 years ago when the first avatar was being discussed, debated, even considered, to today India hosting the Quad panel discussion at Raisina Dialogue?  What changed, why did it change, and how does this really reflect how you assess the importance of the region and the group in the region?   \n  EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:  Well, Samir, I don\u2019t think it was dead on arrival.  It was dead a few months after arrival, and there\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s important to understand why, because by some coincidence I happen to be associated with different phases of the Quad.  I take the Quad back to Boxing Day 2004 when the Indian Ocean tsunami happened.  It so happened at that time I was the country coordinator for our external coordination and response.  Then in 2006 when Prime Minister Abe came to India, he before coming had this idea that the Quad could be an effective way of dealing with the challenges.  There was actually a Quad meeting \u2013 if my memory serves me right \u2013 in Manila in 2007, and then, as you say, it didn\u2019t work out.  If you ask me why didn\u2019t it work out as opposed to what happened 10 years later \u2013 because it was revived 10 years later, 2017, at the level of under secretaries, vice ministers; I was foreign secretary then \u2013 \u201917 it was revived, then \u201919 it became a foreign ministers level.  And when the Biden administration came in in \u201921, it became a summit level. \n  So what\u2019s the difference between \u201917, \u201919, \u201921, as opposed to 2007?  One, I think there was greater strategic clarity on the part of all the countries concerned.  Two, our own inter-state relations changed during this period.  If I were to look at India\u2019s ties with the U.S., it became much deeper; with Japan also it grew; and I think the real big change has been in the last decade with Australia.  So in a way, Quad is working in 2023 partly, as I said, because we have greater strategic clarity.   \n  I also think we have leaderships with a greater sense of purpose who are less encumbered by baggage.  But to me, a big difference is actually our inter-state relationship, which has today become so much more confident and so much deeper.  So, in fact, the one point I would differ with Minister Hayashi \u2013 actually, I hope one day it will be 1,111, the one-one-one-one.  (Laughter.) \n  MR SARAN:  When you walked in, all of you seemed quite at ease, and there was a bit of a relaxed feel, vibe to it. \n  EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:  There\u2019s always a relaxed feel when we meet. \n  MR SARAN:  So what did you discuss inside the room?  (Laughter.) \n  EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:  A lot of things, but if my colleagues would indulge me, we actually today captured some of our discussions in the form of a statement.  I think that statement would have been put out or will be put out.  So if you ask me what were the new things which came out today, we agreed on a counterterrorism working group; we agreed on cooperating more closely with the Indian Ocean Rim Association; we agreed that there would be a \u2013 we had earlier worked out a HADR Quad initiative, so the standard operating procedures for that, which I think the military people would obviously see as a prerequisite for their cooperation. \n  I think we coordinated on the UN to make sure that the processes of the UN are respected and the workings of the UN sort of stay true to its spirit.  I was personally happy that there was a stronger expression of support from all of us collectively to the reform of the UN, to the fact that there would be intergovernmental negotiations on the reform.  I also see that on \u2013 when it comes to sustainable development goals, which all of us are committed to, we believe that they should be pursued comprehensively, not cherrypicked for political convenience.   \n  We will be doing our maritime security working group very shortly in Washington, and we discussed \u2013 among other things, one of the outcomes we agreed on was that the listings of terrorists \u2013 the counterterrorism side listings \u2013 should not be politicized. \n  So these were some of the outcomes.  So, I mean, there were a lot of things which I can\u2019t tell you, so \u2013 but this is the public side of what we can tell you.  So I thought collectively I should be putting it out. \n  MR SARAN:  And how do you respond to this common refrain that most politicians seem to indulge in from the Quad countries that this is not against anyone, we are not a security grouping, we are not a military grouping.  Why are we apologetic? \n  EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:  No, I don\u2019t think \u2013 look, we are not apologetic.  I do believe \u2013 because I keep reminding people of 2004, because to me, if your origins are in common good, there\u2019s a lot \u2013 there\u2019s a innate virtue in your existence, okay?  So we do stand for something.  What I would not like to be defined as is standing against something or somebody, because that diminishes me.  That makes it out as though some other people are the center of the world and I\u2019m only there to be for them or against them.  I don\u2019t think \u2013 actually, I think I\u2019m the center of the world, but that\u2019s a different matter.  (Laughter.) \n  MR SARAN:  Okay, so I\u2019m going to turn to \u2013 as is custom here, I\u2019m going to turn to our young fellows.  We have 48 young fellows from 33 countries who are spending two weeks with us, and typically we go to a couple of them for every session to hear their thoughts, their questions for all of you.  So I\u2019ll turn to \u2013 first to Teesta and then to Kirtbir.  Teesta, introduce yourself very briefly. \n  QUESTION:  Good morning, ministers.  My name is Teesta Prakash and I\u2019m from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra, and my question to you is:  How do we build a regional consensus in the Indo-Pacific given the four Quad countries sit on the periphery of the Indo-Pacific?  How do we then include Southeast Asia?  How do we bring the Pacific Islands with us to really sort of create a regional narrative for what is a second \u2013 not a security, perhaps, but an economic architecture?  How do we bring the region along with the four Quad countries?  Thank you. \n  MR SARAN:  And can I just add to that \u2013 because all of you have also invoked the term \u2013 look, all of you have started speaking like each other, and that worries me.  All of you say \u201cASEAN centrality.\u201d \n  EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:  It actually makes me happy. \n  MR SARAN:  Okay.  You say \u201cASEAN centrality,\u201d and we keep thinking what does that really mean.  Does it mean that beautiful flower arrangement in the middle of the room when four of you are sitting?  What does it really mean?  So \u2013 sorry, the second question, Kirtbir. \n  QUESTION:  Thank you. \n  MR SARAN:  Let me go to the second question and then I\u2019ll come to you.  Can we take a second question? \n  QUESTION:  Thanks, Samir and panelists.  I\u2019m Kirtbir Chahal.  I work for the British Government.  Similar question to narrative, but how do you think the Quad can reconcile their strategic interests in and their competing visions for the Indo-Pacific?   \n  And given the Quad are already discussing supply chain resilience and economic resilience more broadly, are Quad members likely to increase market access for each other to further strengthen that economic cooperation and truly move in the same direction? \n  MR SARAN:  Good.  So now we will turn to the panelists.  First one was to you, ma\u2019am, so over to you, Minister Wong. \n  FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:  Well, I might \u2013 I think the nub of the first question goes really to complementarity.  I\u2019m trying to not be provoked by the flower arrangement analogy just for the moment.  (Laughter.)  But it goes to complementarity, and I think if we can start where \u2013 perhaps where Jai started, which is think about what we are for, not what we are against.  What are we for? \n  I think where we are very likeminded is we have a view about the attributes of the region we inhabit, and that region \u2013 and people will use different words; some say open and inclusive; some might say stable, secure, free of \u2013 where sovereignty is respected \u2013 but the point is we do have a view about that. \n  We see the Quad, I would say, as a bit of a lighthouse. \n  MR SARAN:  Thank you. \n  FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:  That was for you. \n  MR SARAN:  Thank you.  (Laughter.)  Thank you.  (Applause.) \n  FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:  But we conceive it as enabling choices, and I think it enables choices in two ways.  It enables choices by these countries working for a region with the attributes that enable choices, and it also enables choices by virtue of the practical work that we seek to do together; sometimes through all four in the work streams that Jai described; sometimes collaboration, whether it\u2019s in the Pacific, where Australia and Japan or Australia and India might work together in a particular country \u2013 this project is a good one for you to do, this is a project we\u2019ll do, this is what we\u2019ve done, but that sort of practical cooperation. \n  So I don\u2019t feel the dissonance that I know some commentators feel and that is underpinning a couple of the questions as between the different architectures, because as an Australian, the region in which we live demands the engagement at multiple levels in multiple contexts.  We have \u2013 we are the first dialogue partner of ASEAN, so our commitment to ASEAN centrality is historic and real, but it is also geographic.  And we do not see our engagement with our friends and partners up here on the stage as doing anything other than enhancing that. \n  MR SARAN:  Thank you.  Secretary Blinken, ASEAN centrality.  India also has its own neighbors who it has to take into account \u2013 their views, their conditions.  Is there a time to \u2013 just taking this question forward, are we creating enough mechanisms to engage with these countries?  We are four big countries in the region, in the periphery, as Teesta mentioned, so what is the mechanism to reach out, to take them along, to sometimes respond to anxieties?  You are going to create ripples.  And perhaps also the second question of Kirtbir on connectivity and congruence within the Quad. \n  SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, let me start with coming back to the first question and just adding to what Penny said I think very eloquently.  Our proposition is not to say to countries in the region, \u201cYou have to choose.\u201d  Our proposition is to offer a choice, to offer an affirmative alternative.  And the more we\u2019re able to do that \u2013 and do that in practical ways \u2013 I think the more cohesion you\u2019re going to see throughout the region.  And as we\u2019ve already discussed in a number of very practical areas that actually answer the needs of countries in different parts of the region, that\u2019s exactly what the Quad is doing. \n  Second, to Penny\u2019s point \u2013 and I think this is very important \u2013 we really look at this as variable geometry, which is to say there are different collections of countries \u2013 some in formal alliances, some in looser partnerships, some working together on a bilateral basis, some in slightly larger groupings \u2013 and the idea really is to make sure that we\u2019re fit for purpose for any particular challenge.  And so it may be that the Quad can focus on certain things where the particular attributes of our countries brought together make sense.  There are other places where different groupings of countries, whether in existing alliances or new partnerships that we form, make the most sense because it addresses the particular interests or particular attributes that those countries can bring to the table. \n  So I think you have to think of it that way.  This is not a rigid thing, and that\u2019s I think the mindset that the four of us have, although now maybe it\u2019s the five of us.  I think, Samir, you\u2019re now an honorary member.  Maybe \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 sort of the fifth Beatle, as it were.  (Laughter.)  So that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re taking. \n  And the other thing I think it\u2019s important to understand is this is an ongoing conversation, and one of the strengths that we have is \u2013 and we just had a meeting over breakfast, but it\u2019s just picking up the conversation that\u2019s happening virtually all the time in some fashion among the four of us or among some subset of the four of us.  And that also gives it great power because there\u2019s tremendous continuity, and what we\u2019re working on most now is translating the vision that we brought to this into very concrete, practical things that address very concrete, practical needs of countries throughout the region. \n  MR SARAN:  Would you guys have a WhatsApp group?  (Laughter.)  Okay, I\u2019m sorry, that was not a question.  Minister Hayashi, your responses to ASEAN and \u2014 \n  FOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:  It all has been said.  I don\u2019t want to add anything on those comments already made, but is this a group or what?  This is a kind of \u2013 not a band like the Beatles, the member is fixed and they always play together in 10 years, but this is more like a, more kind of soft group, so that even within the Beatles, Paul McCartney can release the album by solo.  (Laughter.)  And \u2013 so yeah.   \n  So those are the things that could be a band, but everybody is really one harmonization with (inaudible) 50th anniversary for ASEAN.  So that information we can share with four of us here so that any idea relating to that could be \u2013 I can absorb from those three friends here.  So those are the situation we are facing, and it\u2019s very nice to talk over these issues surrounding the area, because we have a trust between four of us and a trust for \u2013 like I said at the beginning \u2013 the same values and same values such as democracy, freedom, and everything.  So without worrying about those big conditions, we can really freely talk within this and communicate.  So that\u2019s the only things that I would like to add. \n  MR SARAN:  Dr. Jaishankar? \n  EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:  Which part, the Beatles part, or the \u2013 (laughter). \n  MR SARAN:  Go ahead.  I mean, you always come up with interesting inputs, but the two questions that were posed: ASEAN in our context, perhaps India\u2019s own neighbors; and, of course, the whole challenge of offering choices, as Secretary Blinken mentioned.  Are we in \u2013 are we able to give countries more agency by offering more choices?  Or are we still sending them to the same shop? \n  EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:  No, I think we do offer more choices.  We do collectively offer something different.  My own sense over this last \u2013 especially after 2017, when I look at individual countries in Southeast Asia, or I\u2019ve just come back from actually the Pacific Islands \u2013 that countries are interested.  Many of them by the way are themselves looking at Indo-Pacific as a changing theater, what \u2013 how should they define their interests, advance their interests.  So my sense is that the interest in the Quad, the enthusiasm for it, the willingness to work with it are growing.  But at the end of the day, the Quad is the Quad.  The Beatles didn\u2019t take \u2013 they did keep Pete Best out.   \n  So the serious point is that when we look at what can we do \u2013 and I\u2019m, again, using maritime security as the easiest example \u2013 that there was a time after 2004 when we all worked together.  We understood the value of what today we call the LEMOA, that \u2013 the moment we get logistics access to each other that somewhere our ability to operate actually multiplies.  And in the initial years, it was difficult.   \n  So when we talk about the changing world, among the changes is we ourselves have changed.  Our attitude towards the world has changed.  Our understanding and comfort levels with each other has also changed.  I do remember a period when, even in our own system \u2013 and I would say frankly in each one of our systems \u2013 because it was something we hadn\u2019t done before, there was that hesitation.  And what we are discovering, I mean, really with almost every Quad meeting \u2013 we have this kind of rolling conversation, and it\u2019s not a WhatsApp group.  We have this rolling conversation, and people keep throwing up ideas.  Some work; some don\u2019t; some are realized more practically, more quickly.  So that\u2019s a kind of \u2013 I would say a very easy, practical arrangement that this has come about.   \n  So I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m very uncomfortable with sharp definitions: you do this, you don\u2019t do this, you are for this, you are against this.  I think it\u2019s four countries who have decided that by working together that they would naturally advance each other \u2013 our own national interests but also do much good for the world.  \n  MR SARAN:  So my final question to the panelists as we conclude, you started off responding to the tsunami, a major humanitarian actor at that time.  Today, we are facing two or three big crises at this particular moment: food, debt, climate.  Is Quad doing enough?  What should it be doing better?  Let me start with Secretary Blinken and then come down the panel and close with you, Dr. Jaishankar.   \n  SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say on one level we\u2019re never doing enough because the demand is extraordinary.  I think we\u2019re living in a time where there is a greater multiplicity of challenges than at any time at least that I\u2019ve been engaged in these issues over 30 years \u2013 more complicated, more interconnected.  So the demand is huge and maybe the demand exceeds even the supply that we can bring.  But precisely to the point that Jai was just making, one of the things that we\u2019re, I think, getting pretty good at is adapting quickly and looking quickly at what are the challenges that we really have to engage and seeing how we can make the Quad a useful vehicle for doing that.   \n  In each of the areas you described, we are actually working together, taking action, certainly exchanging ideas; and as I said, in many cases trying to turn to those into concrete initiatives.  But the demand is great and we have to respond to it.   \n  What\u2019s interesting right now in this very moment, you have Quad countries that are also chairing in this moment the G7, the G20, APEC; and that too gives us an ability to amplify \u2014    \n  MR SARAN:  To coordinate.  \n  SECRETARY BLINKEN:  \u2014 and as we\u2019re working and coordinating among each other, that also has the benefit of strengthening and making more cohesive the agendas of these other groups.   \n  MR SARAN:  Minister Hayashi.   \n  FOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:  Yeah, like Tony said, demand is always more than we can supply, I think, as a Quad.  But like in case of Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, right after \u2013 that was 24th of February, but in March, we had a summit video conference on Ukraine issues and concurred that we cannot accept this to destroy the international norm such as never change the status quo by force.  So like those case shows that we can always communicate and confirm that we \u2013 from \u2013 we are on the same page for those issues, and then that makes more smooth carrying out of the \u2013 every measures we can take.  So that\u2019s still working in that way too.  Yeah.  \n  MR SARAN:  Minister Wong.  \n  FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:  I think one of the greatest strengths of this grouping is by virtue of what we do together, it enhances our capacity for collaboration.  So you \u2013 we could \u2013 obviously there are existing work streams; they are practical and they are real.  As both Tony and Yogi have said, we could always do more in that the need in a world that is increasingly disordered, as your conference explicates, is always greater.  But this group does have a capacity to collaborate quite flexibly in addition to what we might have announced and what we\u2019ll try and deliver on.  And I think for me as a foreign minister in the smallest of the Quad members, that is extremely useful.  It \u2013 and it is a real strength in this collaboration.  \n  MR SARAN:  Dr. Jaishankar, final words.  \n  EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR:  Look, I obviously concur with my colleagues, and I think the more we do with each other, then more possibilities open up.  To me right now, there are three big issues that the world needs to address and the Quad needs to address \u2013 and Quad can address, can make a difference: one, more reliable and resilient supply chains; two, the whole \u2013 the digital challenge \u2013 trust and transparency when it comes to technologies, how do we deliver more secure digital existence; and third, connectivity.  And I do see these as three big issues which in different ways the Quad needs to do together and also do with other countries, and I do expect that to be a greater part of our agenda.  \n  MR SARAN:  So thank you very much for this very frank, friendly conversation this morning.  I think that might be the good attribute for Quad: frank, friendly, and flexible.  I think that\u2019s what Minister Wong said \u2013 flexible.  So frank, friendly, flexible, and fun could be the takeaways from this wonderful conversation.  Please join me in applauding the esteemed guests for their contributions.  (Applause.) ",

		"title": "Secretary Antony J. Blinken at a Press Availability",
		"speaker": "ANTONY J. BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE",
		"audience": "LEELA PALACE",
		"location": "NEW DELHI, INDIA",
		"date": "MARCH 2, 2023",
		"content": "SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Good evening, everyone, and apologies for doing this so late.  I hope I\u2019m not disrupting people\u2019s dinner plans.\nWe just finished a marathon day at the G20.  We came together to focus on solving some of the most consequential problems affecting people of our nations and the world.  And let me begin by thanking our host, India, for setting out an ambitious agenda for this meeting, and for its presidency of the G20.\nWe met here in Delhi roughly one year after President Putin launched his war of aggression on Ukraine, and one week after 141 countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly for a resolution that expressed the support for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, in accordance with the United Nations charter and its principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and deplores the human rights and humanitarian consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression.  Not a single G20 member voted with Russia to oppose that resolution.\nThe chair\u2019s statement by India today reaffirmed the declaration issued by the G20 leaders last year in Bali, which \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cstrongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy,\u201d end quote.  Russia and China were the only two countries that made clear that they would not sign on to that text.  Eighteen members of the G20 also reaffirmed that it is \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cessential to uphold international law and the multilateral system.  This includes defending all of the purposes and principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nations and adhering to international humanitarian law,\u201d end quote.\nEvery G20 member \u2013 and virtually every country, period \u2013 continues to bear the cost of Russia\u2019s war of aggression, a war that President Putin could end tomorrow, if he chose to do so.  The United States didn\u2019t want this war.  We worked hard to prevent it.  Like most countries, we want to focus on the fundamental challenges affecting the daily lives of our people. So even as we stand with Ukraine while it defends itself, as any nation would do in that position, we\u2019re also determined to keep working with other countries to deliver solutions to these shared challenges.\nAnd that is exactly what we did today at the G20.  These challenges include the unprecedented food security crisis around the world.  We\u2019ve got to do two things at once \u2013 get food to the hungry now, but also help countries build up their agricultural productivity and resilience so that they\u2019re less vulnerable to future shocks.  The United States is leading on both fronts.  In addition to funding more than half of the World Food Program\u2019s entire budget, we\u2019ve contributed $13.5 billion to fight hunger over the last year alone, and we\u2019ve committed more than $11 billion over the next five years to boost countries\u2019 resilience and nutrition.\nAfrican countries in particular have told us time and again that, more than aid, what they want is help building the sustainable capacity to feed their own people, and we\u2019re teaming up to do just that.  Now the unprecedented levels of food insecurity have been driven primarily by climate, by COVID, and by conflicts, but the crisis has been worsened intentionally by President Putin, who\u2019s weaponized the hunger of people across the globe.\nThanks in large part to UN Secretary-General Guterres and T\u00fcrkiye, the Black Sea Grain Initiative loosened Russia\u2019s stranglehold on Ukraine\u2019s ports, allowing more than 22 million metric tons of grain and other food \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of eight billion loaves of bread \u2013 to leave Ukraine\u2019s ports through global markets.  And that\u2019s lowered the price of food for people everywhere.\nToday, Russia is again slow walking the export of food from Ukraine.  And with the Black Sea Initiative set to expire on March 18th, Russia has refused to commit to renewing it.  The message that countries sent at today\u2019s meeting is clear \u2013 extend the Black Sea Grain Initiative and strengthen it and do that without delay.\nWe also discussed ways to counter the proliferation and trafficking of illicit synthetic drugs, like fentanyl and methamphetamine.  In the United States alone, fentanyl killed more than 70,000 people last year.  It\u2019s the number-one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49.  No country can tackle this problem alone.  Disrupting supply chains of precursors, preventing the diversion of legal chemicals to illegal uses, dismantling the transnational criminal groups that foster corruption and profit off of others\u2019 suffering, these are challenges that demand a coordinated global effort.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that, for the first time, G20 ministers called for a strong, international cooperation to counter illicit synthetic drugs, and it\u2019s why I proposed to my fellow ministers today at the G20 that we create a focused line of effort to bring together governments, international and regional organizations, private sectors, and others to tackle this problem.  This is a law enforcement and security issue, but it\u2019s fundamentally a public health issue and an increasingly global one.\nToday, we also discussed other challenges, where people around the globe expect our countries to work together, like addressing the climate crisis, helping communities adapt to the inevitable changes it\u2019s causing, strengthening global health security, so that we\u2019re better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future health emergencies.\nI also had the opportunity to speak on the margins of today\u2019s meetings with counterparts from Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and, of course, India.  And let me first commend the Indian presidency and Foreign Minister Jaishankar for securing G20 consensus on a broad set of agreements, reflected in the Chair Summary and Outcome Document.  That\u2019s a first for G20 foreign ministers.\nNow Minister Jaishankar and I speak so frequently that we just pick up right where we left off, working to elevate our Strategic Partnership in concrete ways, supporting India\u2019s very ambitious G20 agenda, advancing the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, which President Biden and Prime Minister Modi launched at the G20 Summit in Bali last May, engaging our shared commitment to human rights and democratic values.\nTomorrow the foreign minister and I will join our counterparts from Japan and Australia for a meeting of the Quad, where key areas of focus will include protecting the free and unrestricted movement of goods and people across our seas, and boosting cooperation against \u2013 around humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the importance of which has been brought once again into sharp relief by the devastating earthquakes in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria.\nOur engagement with the Quad and the G20 are just a few of the examples of how the United States is weaving together alliances and partnerships to enhance our capacity to deliver for our citizens.  That\u2019s why I began this trip in Central Asia, where I joined my counterparts for the C5+1 ministerial.  The more of these partnerships that we build, strengthen, and stitch together, the more we\u2019re able to effectively tackle transnational challenges that affect our people, broaden opportunities for Americans, bolster our security, and advance our interests.\nAnd what we\u2019re seeing in Delhi, in Astana, in Tashkent, and beyond is that countries want to partner with the United States, because they see us showing up to solve shared problems, fostering inclusive economic growth, investing in our own competitiveness, and standing up for the international rules of the road that benefit all countries, including the right of every country to choose its own path, free from violence, coercion, and threats.\nLastly, I spoke briefly with Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Lavrov on the margins of our G20 meeting today.  I urged Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision, and return to implementing the New START Treaty, which places verifiable limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation.  Mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries.  It\u2019s also what people around the world expect from us, as nuclear powers.  I told the foreign minister that, no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship, the United States will always be ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did, even at the height of the Cold War.\nI also raised the wrongful detention of Paul Whelan, as I have on many previous occasions.  The United States has put forward a serious proposal.  Moscow should accept it.  We\u2019re determined to bring Paul and every other American citizen who is unjustly detained around the world home.  We won\u2019t rest until we do.\nFinally, I told the foreign minister what I and so many others said last week at the United Nations, and what so many G20 foreign ministers said today: end this war of aggression; engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace.  President Zelenskyy has put forward a 10-point plan for a just and durable peace.  The United States stand ready to support Ukraine through diplomacy to end the war on this basis.  President Putin, however, has demonstrated zero interest in engaging, saying there\u2019s nothing to even talk about unless and until Ukraine accepts \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d while doubling down on his brutalization of Ukraine.\nIndependent of what Russia does, we showed here in Delhi what we will do: deliver results on the problems most affecting our peoples\u2019 lives.  Our hosts are committed to doing this over the course of their G20 presidency.  For that, and for their leadership and hospitality, I\u2019d like to close by expressing my gratitude to India.\nAnd with that, happy to take some questions.\nMR PATEL:  We\u2019ll first go to Iain Marlow with Bloomberg.\nQUESTION:  Thank you, Secretary.  There\u2019s been rising concerns in recent years about democratic backsliding and human rights issues in India, including the rights of religious minorities, and recently with a move against the news organization the BBC.  Did you raise U.S. concerns about these issues with your Indian counterpart today, and are you concerned at all that the situation might worsen heading into next year\u2019s federal election in India?\nAnd secondly, Reuters has reported that the U.S. is speaking with allies about potential sanctions for China if it sends lethal aid to Russia for use in Ukraine, as you\u2019ve warned about in the past.  Can you comment at all on those discussions and more broadly about your conversations with counterparts today relating to China\u2019s relationship with Moscow?  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  First, on India, we\u2019re the world\u2019s two biggest democracies.  We\u2019re committed to an enduring project, both of us \u2013 in our case, as our founders put it, striving to form a more perfect union.  That\u2019s part of our national ethos.  It\u2019s a project for both of us, India and the United States, in different but also complementary ways.\nSo we have to work together to show that our democracies can actually deliver on our peoples\u2019 needs, and we have to continue to hold ourselves to our core values, including respect for universal human rights, like freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, which makes our democracy stronger.  So we regularly engage with our Indian counterparts to encourage the Indian Government to uphold its own commitments to protect human rights, just as we look to ourselves to do the same thing.  And in most conversations that I have with my counterpart, Foreign Minister Jaishankar, this is an issue that we discussed, again, as we did today.\nWith regard to China and its support for Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, as we\u2019ve said from the start \u2013 and as President Biden made very clear to President Xi going back to the very beginning of the Russian aggression \u2013 were China to engage in material, lethal support for Russia\u2019s aggression or were to engage in the systematic evasion of sanctions to help Russia, that would be a serious problem for our countries.\nWhen I saw Senior Foreign Policy Official Wang Yi in the margins of the Munich meetings just a week or so ago, I raised with him our very real concern that based on information we have, China is considering supplying lethal military assistance to Russia.  We\u2019ve not seen it do that yet, but we\u2019ve seen it considering that proposition.  And what I shared with him again was that this would be a serious problem for us in our relationship with China, and I made clear that there would be consequences for engaging in those actions.\nSo I\u2019m not going to detail what they would be, but of course we have sanctions authorities of various kinds that would certainly be one of the things that we and others would look at.  And I say others because this concern that China is considering providing lethal military assistance to Russia, this is a shared concern.  And many other partners have raised this, and not just raised this with us, but \u2013 it\u2019s my understanding \u2013 have raised it directly with China, including here today in Delhi.\nMR PATEL:  Let\u2019s next go to Maha Siddiqui with NDTV.\nQUESTION:  Secretary Blinken, even though there\u2019s been an outcome statement and the chair summary, in two successive ministerial meetings we\u2019ve not seen consensus in the form of a joint communique.  Do you see that as a set back in the run up to the summit in September, and were you perhaps able to communicate this to your Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov when you met him on the sidelines today?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  So I think what we\u2019ve seen here, as I mentioned, is actually a first, which is an outcomes document which reflects shared agreements on a number of issues by all of the foreign ministers represented here today.  And in the particular case of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, you have virtually everyone in the G20 signing onto what had already been stated in Bali \u2013 and the two holdouts of course were Russia and China.  So I think we see broad consensus across the G20 to work together, to act together, and to make commitments together.\nPrime Minister Modi said today that we should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those that we can.  And I think what we saw today is a very good reflection of what the prime minister said \u2013 that is work and agreement on a whole series of lines of effort that the G20 will take to address the issues of greatest concern to people around the world.  And that\u2019s been the focus of the United States.\nWe want to make sure that, even as we and dozens of countries around the world are standing up for the basic principles at the heart of the UN Charter that are being trampled on by Russia and its aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re at the same time also working every single day to address the concerns of people around the world on the issues that are really affecting their lives \u2013 whether it is food insecurity, whether it\u2019s climate change, whether it\u2019s creating economic opportunity, building global health resilience, et cetera.  All of those things we\u2019ve advanced on yet again here at the G20, and my full expectation is that, when the leaders get together, you\u2019ll see further very concrete outcomes that reflect that consensus.\nMR PATEL:  Simon Lewis, Reuters.\nQUESTION:  Thank you.  Just to follow up a little bit on what you just discussed on the G20 today, Prime Minister Modi also mentioned in his comments today that multilateralism is in crisis and talked about the architecture of global governance having failed.  I wonder if you agreed with that assessment.  And since the G20 failed once again to reach a consensus, putting a slightly finer point on it, can this forum still function with Russia as a member?  And just to add on your conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I wondered why was it that you felt that this was the moment to raise those issues with the foreign minister.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks, [Simon].  First, I\u2019d say that of course Prime Minister Modi is right that there are real challenges to the multilateral system, and those challenges in many ways are coming directly from Russia, which has been violating the very principles that lie at the heart of that system and that the system was designed to uphold.  And so that is a challenge.  And we see that playing out as well, for example, with the United Nations Security Council, where we have two countries in particular that tend to block the attempted actions of the council to address some of the most urgent global concerns.\nOn the other hand, what we\u2019ve seen, I think, speaking very powerfully and eloquently, is the multilateral system in a variety of ways.  Three quarters of it coming together at the UN General Assembly to condemn Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine and to insist on a just and durable peace \u2013 that\u2019s the multilateral system.  And we see it here today at the G20 thanks to India\u2019s leadership.  As I said just a moment ago, even as we\u2019re focused on making sure that Russia can\u2019t succeed in its aggression against Ukraine, we\u2019re equally focused on engaging and solving problems that affect people around the world and that they expect us to be focused on, and we\u2019re doing that through the G20.  We\u2019re doing that through other multilateral organizations, everything from the G7 and numerous other organizations, including other organizations that are within the UN system.  And we\u2019re working together on food security, on energy security, on climate, on global health.  And I think we\u2019re delivering results.\nSo all of this is to say that, yes, of course, there are real challenges.  The prime minister\u2019s right.  But I think we\u2019ve demonstrated, including here today in Delhi, that we can find workarounds.  And those workarounds, when we have an outlier, can be found in the outcomes document that hopefully has been distributed to everyone.  And again, it demonstrates real consensus and real commitment to work together to tackle issues that are affecting people in their daily lives.  And as I said a moment ago, I\u2019m also convinced that when the leaders get together to finalize some of these commitments, you\u2019ll see very strong results.  And again, from the perspective of the United States, this is exactly what our people expect of us and what the world expects of us.\nMR PATEL:  Suhasini Haidar, The Hindu.\nQUESTION:  Secretary Blinken, I want you to just follow up on two of your answers already.  You just said that you expect strong results when the leader summit happens at the G20.  Just how do you see that happening?  How do you see the road ahead for the G20 process given that now the document actually names Russia and China as holding up the consensus as well as not agreeing to the previous G20 statement that they had signed on to?  They say, of course, that they have their reasons for doing that, but do you really think a joint statement can be forged in the next few months?  Do you think the G20 process itself is in peril?\nAnd if I could do a follow-up on Iain\u2019s question about the restrictions on a number of agencies, including NGOs, I wanted to ask specifically about restrictions on American agencies, apart from climate change NGOs as well as human rights NGOs \u2013 specifically about funding restrictions placed on American agencies earlier like the Ford Foundation but now like the National Endowment for Democracy, the Center for Disease Control, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and others.  Is that something that you raised with your Indian counterparts?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  So two things.  First, you\u2019re \u2013 just to make sure that I understand, you\u2019re referring to restrictions that India would place \u2013 would have placed on these organizations.  We\u2019ve taken up these questions in the past and we have discussed the importance of NGOs and civil society being able to function effectively and freely wherever they are in our own country and here in India.  So to the extent that issues have come up related to NGOs, we\u2019ve discussed them directly with our Indian counterparts.\nAs to projecting to the leaders\u2019 summit, first of all, I don\u2019t want to spoil the show.  We\u2019ll let the leaders do their work and show the results.  But whether that\u2019s reflected in a joint statement, whether it\u2019s reflected in a chair statement that shows that the overwhelming majority of the G20 countries agreed to work together on a course of action, honestly I don\u2019t think that makes a big difference.  If there are going to be an outlier country or two, when you have 18 of the 20 agreed on what needs to be done and committed to working together to do it, again, that is effective multilateralism in action \u2013 effective in actually addressing the world\u2019s concerns.  I think that\u2019s what you saw today, and I am absolutely convinced that you\u2019ll see that when the leaders get together one way or another\u2026\nMR PATEL:  Thank you, everybody.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.\nMR PATEL:  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Have a good evening, everyone.

		"speaker": "ANTONY J. BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE",
		"audience": "HYATT REGENCY HOTEL",
		"location": "TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN",
		"date": "MARCH 1, 2023",
		"content": "Play Video\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  Good to see you all.  So this is my first visit to Uzbekistan, and let me express first of all my gratitude to the president, to the acting foreign minister, and to all the people I\u2019ve had an opportunity to meet with over the course of this day for what\u2019s been an extraordinarily warm welcome.\nThe partnership between our countries dates back to Uzbekistan\u2019s independence.  It\u2019s grown much closer in recent years.  Across all of my engagements here, what I come away with is a mutual and enthusiastic commitment to strengthening that partnership even further.\nThat starts with deepening our ties with Uzbekistan\u2019s young people.  Over the past five years, the United States has invested $25 million in English-language education, teaming up with the government to train 15,000 Uzbekistani English teachers, providing English-language textbooks to some 10,000 schools.  And I had an opportunity to witness some of the work that we\u2019re doing today sitting in on a class with some really extraordinary young people who are only three or four months into English-language education and already sounded incredibly fluent.\nThis is about more than just learning a language.  It\u2019s about empowering rising generations of Uzbeks to use their new skills to compete for jobs in markets that demand English proficiency, enabling connections with English speakers across the region and the world, opening doors to exchange programs in the United States, which can create new opportunities for people in both of our countries.\nAnother way that we\u2019re expanding opportunity is by supporting the full implementation of President Mirziyoyev\u2019s reform agenda.  The progress that Uzbekistan has made on labor rights shows just how transformative that agenda can be.  For 11 years, more than 300 companies banned Uzbek cotton from their products due to the use of child and forced labor.  In partnership with national and international labor groups and human rights organizations, the government worked to eradicate this pervasive practice, not only passing a new labor code, but ensuring that it was enforced.  Last year, the International Labor Organization determined that Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton sector was free of child and forced labor.  This is a historic achievement and it\u2019s a model for countries around the world facing similar challenges.\nIt\u2019s already making a tangible difference in the lives of Uzbek workers, farmers, businesses.  Wages are up.  Private investment is increasing.  People of all ages, including children, are no longer being forced to pick cotton in abusive conditions.  We look forward to working with the government to promote similar efforts in other sectors, as well as to fully implement the president\u2019s reform agenda.  That includes delivering on commitments to defend religious freedom and press freedom and strengthen protections for vulnerable populations \u2013 issues that I discussed today with the president.\nI also underscored the importance of Uzbekistan fully and transparently investigating allegations of human rights violations committed by law enforcement officers during the July 2020 \u2013 2022 unrest and holding accountable those responsible.\nIn addition to strengthening the U.S.-Uzbekistan relationship, we\u2019re also working together to deepen regional integration.  Foreign Minister Saidov and I just came, as you know, from the C5+1 meeting in Astana, where I announced a new commitment to work with Congress to provide an additional $25 million to catalyze economic growth in Central Asia.  That brings our total investment in the region since our meeting on the margins of the UN General Assembly last September to more than $66 million.  We\u2019re focused on diversifying trade routes, fostering greater private investment, providing job training.\nAnd let me emphasize that so much of the work that we\u2019re doing in these \u2013 in these programs and with the investments we\u2019re making from our government really serve as a catalyst for increasing private sector investment.  I think the opportunities that the private sector is already engaged in are significant and everything I\u2019m seeing suggests that there is growing enthusiasm, interest, focus on investing here and investing in other countries in Central Asia.\nIt\u2019s also how we provide the support that matters.  The United States is making these and other investments in Central Asia openly, transparently, in a way that empowers people across the region to shape their own future, and that meets high labor, human rights, environmental standards.  That\u2019s how investment should work.\nWe\u2019ll have a chance to build on these efforts next month in Samarkand when the United States sends a high-level delegation from across our government to a meeting of the U.S.-Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework.\nSo the bottom line is this.  A more connected, a more cooperative Central Asia will be better able to determine its own future and deliver for its people\u2019s needs.  The United States is committed to supporting that vision.  One of the things that we\u2019ve learned over many, many years is that the investments that we make in these partnerships benefit our partners, but they also benefit us, creating potentially new markets for our own products, our own investments, creating new opportunities to partner with countries in meeting global challenges where Central Asia can make a real difference, and just developing new friendships that benefit our country across so many different aspects of our society in many different ways.\nAnd that\u2019s fundamentally why I\u2019ve come here, and I want to emphasize that this is not just a matter of one visit; it\u2019s the work that we\u2019re doing day in, day out, including through our embassies, through our engagement with the private sector, through engagements with civil society and other groups.  And we\u2019re in it for the long haul.\nIn our meetings today, I also had a chance to thank the government for its generous aid to the people of Afghanistan, from electricity to emergency humanitarian assistance, especially to women and girls.  And we applaud Uzbekistan for repatriating more than 400 family members of terrorist foreign fighters from Syria and Iraq whose reintegration the United States will continue to support.\nFinally, this visit to the region comes against the backdrop of the one-year anniversary of Putin\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.  This continues to be a cause for hardship for people around the world, including here in Central Asia.  The second- and third-order consequences of this aggression continue to be felt.  Indeed, few regions have been more acutely affected than Central Asia, including Uzbekistan, where people continue to shoulder increased food and energy prices.  As always, this is hitting the most vulnerable the hardest.  That\u2019s why the United States has provided more than $16 million in emergency food aid to this region since President Putin launched his aggression against Ukraine.\nThis hardship makes Uzbekistan\u2019s generosity even more remarkable.  The government, the people of Uzbekistan have stepped up to provide food and medical assistance to Ukraine.  They continue to host tens of thousands of Russian citizens who fled their country after President Putin launched his war.\nRussia\u2019s invasion has also fostered deep concern across the region.  After all, if a powerful country is willing to try to erase the borders of a sovereign neighbor by force, what\u2019s to stop it from doing the same to others?  Countries across Central Asia understand this.  So does the United States, and so do partners and allies around the world.  And that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve been committed and remain committed to standing for the sovereignty, the territorial integrity, the independence not only of Ukraine, but for countries across Central Asia and, indeed, around the world.\nThank you.\nMR PATEL:  We\u2019ll go to our first question from Ed Wong of The New York Times.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Hey, Ed.\nQUESTION:  Hi.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Yeah.  He\u2019ll survive without the microphone.   \nQUESTION:  Thanks.  I\u2019d like to follow up on your comments on the Ukraine war.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Mm-hmm.\nQUESTION:  First, you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re somewhat skeptical of Moscow\u2019s talk of possible negotiations, and you say that the main aim of the U.S. Government right now and European allies is to help Ukraine on the battlefield, yet many of the non-aligned or neutral countries that you\u2019re meeting with this week here and also at the G20 say that they would like to see peace talks open sometime soon, and I expect that pressure will increase.  How do you address that?  And some have even favorably looked at China\u2019s talking points on that, and I know you\u2019re skeptical of that.\nSecond, at the G20, Russia and China will both be sending their foreign ministers.  Do you plan to talk to them one on one or talk to them in a group setting, and what do you plan to say to them about the Ukraine war?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Yeah.  Second \u2013 second part of the question first.  No plans to see either at the G20, although I suspect that we\u2019ll certainly be in group sessions of one kind or another together.\nSo the first thing to say is this:  No one wants peace more urgently than the people of Ukraine.  They\u2019re the victims every single day of Russia\u2019s aggression, and if they could have peace yesterday, they\u2019d take it and so would we and so would countries around the world who are suffering, as I said, from the second- and third-order effects of Putin\u2019s aggression.\nNow, we all know the simple truth that the war could end tomorrow \u2013 it could end today \u2013 if President Putin so decided.  He started it; he can stop it.  It\u2019s, on one level, as simple as that.  And we should never lose sight of that fact.  No one should lose sight of the fact that we have an aggressor and we have a victim, and to have any kind of equivalence between the two, including suggesting who is more committed to peace, I think, is profoundly wrong.\nSecond, if Russia, President Putin, were genuinely prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy necessary to end the aggression, of course we\u2019d be the first to work on that and to engage.  But there is zero evidence of that.  To the contrary, the evidence is all in the other direction.  Just listen to President Putin\u2019s own words.  To cite just one example, he said recently, and publicly, that unless and until Ukraine recognizes what he called \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d there\u2019s nothing to even talk about.  In other words, unless and until Ukraine accepts the fact that Russia has seized their territory and gets to keep it, they won\u2019t even talk.  That\u2019s obviously a nonstarter and it should be a nonstarter not just for Ukraine or for us, but for countries around the world.  And I think that certainly resonates here in this region, where every single Central Asian country feels very strongly about their territorial integrity, their sovereignty, their independence \u2013 all of which, of course, were very, very hard-won.\nSo the real \u2013 the real question is whether Russia will get to a point where it is genuinely prepared to end its aggression and to do so in a way that is consistent with the United Nations Charter and these very principles.  That\u2019s why I think what you \u2013 what you hear around the world, and you saw reflected in the resolution that was passed at the UN General Assembly by 141 countries, is the strong desire for peace, but for a just and durable peace, just in that it\u2019s consistent with the principles of the UN Charter in terms of territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence, and durable, as I\u2019ve said before, so that we don\u2019t leave things in a place where Russia gets to simply repeat this exercise a year or two years or three years later \u2013 it rests, it rearms, and it reattacks.  So I think that\u2019s what we need to be focused on.\nIn terms of the proposal that China put forth, as I\u2019ve said and as others in the government have said, look, there are some positive elements there, including things that China itself has said several times in the past \u2013 very similar to elements that are in Ukraine\u2019s own proposal that President Zelenskyy put out some time ago.  But if China was genuinely serious about this, the very first principle it put out \u2013 sovereignty \u2013 it would have been spending all of the last year working in support of the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s full sovereignty.  And of course it\u2019s been doing the opposite in terms of its own efforts to advance Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war, blocking and tackling for Russia in international organizations, and, as we\u2019ve made clear recently, now contemplating the provision of lethal military assistance to Russia for its aggression against Ukraine.\nSo China can\u2019t have it both ways.  It can\u2019t be putting itself out as a force for peace in public while it, one way or another, continues to fuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.\nMR PATEL:  We\u2019ll next go to Davlat Umarov from Gazeta.\nQUESTION:  Thank you.  Gazeta\u2019s website.  Mr. Secretary, during your visit in \u2013 oh, I\u2019m really sorry.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.\nQUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, during your visit in Kazakhstan you mentioned that U.S. is trying to demonstrate its commitments to Central Asian countries as a steadfast partner.  You announced even today about additional $25 million to the initiative and also as well as licensing the companies that are working with sanctioned Russian companies.  In that regard, I\u2019d like to ask:  What are the expectations of the United States from countries of the region, and in particular from Uzbekistan, to be ensured in their commitment as reliable partners, keeping in mind the ongoing war in Ukraine and close ties of the region with Russia and China?  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you very much.  Well, first, what we have been trying to demonstrate throughout this visit, but again, more than that, every single day in our engagement with countries throughout the region \u2013 and by the way, the meeting that we had in Kazakhstan of the C5+1, I think that\u2019s the fourth meeting that I\u2019ve participated in with my colleagues \u2013 but every single day we\u2019re engaged to build the strongest possible partnerships with all of the Central Asian countries.  And it starts with our enduring support for their sovereignty, for their independence, for their territorial integrity, and our determination that each be able to determine their own futures consistent with those principles.\nWhat I think we also know very well is that Central Asia is in a complicated part of the world with longstanding relationships with different countries based on history, based on geography, and that\u2019s something that we well understand.  But I think we also see each of these countries looking to multiply and deepen their relationships and partnerships with other countries around the world.  And in that, the United States wants to be a steadfast partner and a partner that works with them to create new opportunities for people in this region and new opportunities for us to work together.\nNow, as I said earlier, we\u2019re also very well aware of the consequences that the Russian aggression against Ukraine has had for people in Central Asia, and I\u2019d say two things about that.  First, the immediate consequences have been, in one way or another, a rise in energy and in food prices, and then, more generally, inflation.\nNow, there\u2019s a simple reason for that.  Putin has tried to weaponize energy in his effort to subjugate Ukraine, and in weaponizing energy and trying to hold it back, deny it from different places \u2013 that has contributed to rising prices.  We\u2019ve worked very hard to make sure that there was enough energy on world markets to keep prices down.  We\u2019ve come directly to the assistance of the \u2013 of countries that were directly targeted by Putin using the energy weapon, but these effects, again, have been felt here in Central Asia as well, and we\u2019re working to mitigate them.\nFood \u2013 Putin also weaponized food.  He blocked the breadbasket of the world, Ukraine, from exporting a lot of its grain and food products.  And it was only because of the very good work by the United Nations and T\u00fcrkiye that we were able to establish this Black Sea grain corridor that allowed food once again to \u2013 grain and other products to come out of Ukraine and to reach world markets.  The majority of that is going to countries in the developing world and in the Global South, but even countries that aren\u2019t directly receiving it are benefiting from the fact that with more Ukrainian food products on the market, the more prices are held in check and are lower.\nSecond part of the equation is this: sanctions, export controls that are being imposed by dozens of countries \u2013 not just the United States \u2013 on Russia.  And again, to step back \u2013 it\u2019s not as if we woke up one day and said, oh, let\u2019s impose sanctions and export controls on Russia.  The reason for those sanctions and export controls is because of the Russian aggression against Ukraine.  And countries came together both to support Ukraine in defending itself from the Russian aggression, but also to try to impose costs and pressure on Russia to get it to change its conduct, to stop the aggression, and to make it more difficult for Russia to continue that aggression.  So that\u2019s what this is all about.\nBut we\u2019re looking at this very closely.  We appreciate the work that countries have done to help prevent the evasion of sanctions, because Russia is looking for ways to nonetheless acquire products and otherwise engage in sanctioned activity.  So we\u2019re working closely with governments throughout the region, helping them understand exactly what the sanctions require and, as necessary, looking to see what we can do to mitigate the negative effects that they\u2019re feeling.  And this includes, in some cases, issuing licenses for trade where that makes sense, and we\u2019ve been engaged in that \u2013 in that process as well.\nFinally \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry for going on so long, but it\u2019s important \u2013 a big part of the work that we\u2019re doing here is to help the region diversify trade relationships, to build new partnerships and relationships with other countries, including with the United States, so they\u2019re not dependent on any one country or any one source for trade and investment, and at the same time to increase trade and investment within Central Asia itself.  There\u2019s a very strong potential market here, and the more connectivity we have among the countries of Central Asia, the more collaboration we have, the stronger that market\u2019s going to be, the more investment it\u2019s going to attract from outside of Central Asia.\nSo we\u2019re working on all of that.  And as I noted yesterday and again today, we\u2019ve made some significant new investments to try to do that \u2013 to increase and strengthen the climate, the environment for private sector investment, to strengthen connectivity among these countries, and to help them diversify their trade and investment relationships.\nMR PATEL:  Next we\u2019ll go to Barbara Usher with the BBC.\nQUESTION:  Thank you.  Secretary Blinken, I wanted to follow up on that, what you\u2019ve just been talking about, with a different angle.  You say that you\u2019re not asking Central Asian countries to choose between the U.S. and Russia or between the U.S. and China, but you are asking them to divert trade routes away from Russia and China.  So isn\u2019t this a new version of the Great Game, which has historical resonance here, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware?\nAnd if I might add briefly, you spoke quite positively about the reforms of the president.  Did you also perhaps advise him against trying to change the constitution so that he can extend his term?  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks, Barbara.  I think what many countries have recognized, both in Central Asia and beyond, for a variety of reasons in recent years, is that there is tremendous benefit in having a multiplicity of partners when it comes to \u2013 when it comes to trade, when it comes to investment, when it comes to supply chains of one kind or another.  We\u2019ve seen what disruptions in any one partnership and connection can do, and those disruptions might come from anything from conflict to COVID to climate change.\nSo this experience, I think, is causing countries to look very hard at where they may have dependencies, and it\u2019s in their interest, I think, to find ways to diversify, multiply, expand their relationships, their partnerships, including when it comes to trade and investment.  And of course that doesn\u2019t \u2013 that doesn\u2019t need to be something that\u2019s zero-sum.  These things can be additive, and countries will benefit tremendously from the increased investment that they\u2019re getting, the increased opportunity that that\u2019s creating.\nSo that\u2019s the recognition that we\u2019re seeing and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to support, to help, and to be a strong partner in helping to achieve.  And it really runs the spectrum of things that we\u2019re engaged in with countries here.  I mentioned a little while ago the work we\u2019re doing here in Uzbekistan on English-language training.  It so happens that at this moment in history \u2013 it was different before; I\u2019m sure at some point in the future it\u2019ll be different \u2013 but right now English happens to be the primary currency for international engagement, whether that\u2019s for businesses, whether that\u2019s for governments and diplomacy, whether that\u2019s for people-to-people connections, whether that\u2019s for the internet.\nAnd so it\u2019s a profound advantage for countries and in some ways even a necessity to build up the proficiency, especially among young people, in the English language, and that\u2019s going to make people much more able to be competitive in a global economic environment, a global world in which, as I said, English is right now the main connective tissue.  So that\u2019s just one way in which we\u2019re helping to put countries in a position where they can very effectively diversify their contacts, their connections, their work with other countries.\nWhen it comes to the reform agenda that the president has put forward here, we talked about that at some length today during our meeting.  We applauded the steps that had been taken.  I noted as well the importance not only of having the strong vision but of fully implementing it, and of course that remains an important work in progress.  We talked about the importance of media freedom, having a strong space for civil society, and we did discuss briefly as well the constitutional reform process.\nMODERATOR:  Final question, Nikita Makarenko.\nQUESTION:  Mr. Blinken, we feel an enormous pressure from Russian propaganda here, and it really shapes minds of our people, so we, our local media, try to struggle with it.  Is there any plans the United States going to help us in this struggle?  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Yeah, thank you.  Well, I think it only underscores the importance of having a strong, vibrant, and well-resourced local media.  And one of the things that we discussed today, including with the president, was the importance of that, the need for that in part to be able to deal with misinformation coming from Russia or from any other source.  So we have programs, as you know, to support independent media but also in our own engagements with other governments urging them to do what\u2019s necessary to create the right environment in which media can grow, can flourish, and can bring a diversity of voices and a diversity of views to the public.\nAnd with that information, let people make up their minds about what\u2019s right and wrong, what\u2019s good policy and what\u2019s bad policy, what\u2019s an appropriate direction or not.  But it\u2019s certainly true that Russia has built up a very strong and long-enduring propaganda and misinformation system that is felt here and is felt in other parts of the world.  And the best answer to that, of course, is the strongest possible environment for genuinely free, independent, open media to bring the facts to people and let them make up their minds.\nQUESTION:  Thank you.\nMODERATOR:  Thank you, everyone.  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.\nQUESTION:  One more question.\nMODERATOR:  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks, everyone.",

		"content": "SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, first, thank you for letting me join your class today.  Now, I was listening very carefully to the first question, about what would you do if you were president; what are the hard parts, what are the easy parts.  I have a chance to sit with the president of Uzbekistan later today.  I took very good notes in my head, so I\u2019m going to be able to share with him some of your ideas.  But not just with him; also, when I go back to Washington and I see President Biden, I\u2019m going to share your ideas with him too.  Because I heard some very, very good ideas \u2013 and thank you.\nAnd I\u2019ll also tell both of them that you understand that it\u2019s not always easy being president, because you have to make hard decisions, and sometimes you have to balance what one person wants against what another person wants.  So it\u2019s not always easy.  But thank you for sharing those ideas.\nAnd to all of you, it\u2019s just wonderful to be \u2013 to be here with you.  When I was about \u2013 probably about your age, maybe a little bit younger, and in my case I moved to another country \u2013 I moved from the United States to France and I had to learn French, so I remember well what it\u2019s like to learn another language.  But it\u2019s a wonderful thing because it just opens your mind to different \u2013 to different things.  We were talking about some of the different books that you like to read in English.  And I\u2019m really happy that we\u2019re able to help share English with you, because one of the realities now in this moment in history \u2013 and it was different before and it will probably be different in the future \u2013 but at least right now, English is probably the international language.  When people do business together, they usually speak in English.  If you\u2019re on the internet, which is maybe not such a good idea, it\u2019s often in English.  A lot of the music, the movies \u2013 in English. \nAnd so it\u2019s a wonderful ability to have to speak English, to understand English, and it\u2019s something that we are very, very happy to share.  We\u2019re working here in Uzbekistan not only to help instruct English, but also, especially, to help train teachers in English.  And I think to date we\u2019ve trained almost 10,000, and now there are English-language school books in about 10,000 schools here in Uzbekistan.  In many ways, English is the most important export from the United States to other countries. \nBut I\u2019m so glad that each of you \u2013 and boy, my \u2013 I don\u2019t think \u2013 I don\u2019t think I would be able to say what you\u2019ve said in English, never mind in a \u2013 for you, in a second language when I was your age.  It\u2019s wonderful, and I\u2019m just very thankful to each of you for sharing with me today.  And I wish you very good luck in your studies. \nThank you for letting us drop into your classroom.",

		"speaker": "ANTONY J. BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE",
		"audience": "MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS",
		"location": "ASTANA, KAZAKHSTAN",
		"date": "FEBRUARY 28, 2023",
		"content": "MODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) We are about to start the press conference.  I\u2019d like to give the floor to the Secretary of State of the United States, Antony Blinken, and the minister of foreign affairs of Kazakhstan, Mukhtar Tileuberdi.  You can pose your questions after we give the floor to our speakers.  The floor goes to Mukhtar Tileuberdi, the foreign minister of Kazakhstan.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:  (Via interpreter) Distinguished Secretary of State, Mr. Antony Blinken, distinguished members of the American delegation, and media representatives, today I am pleased to receive my friend, the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan on his first official visit to Astana.  So far we have met at various international events in Washington, D.C., and today we are here hosting him at his official visit. Welcome to Kazakhstan.\nBefore noon, during the first half of the day, we had a very productive series of meetings with the U.S. delegation, and the State Secretary also held a meeting with the president of our country, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in the course of friendly and constructive talks.  They discussed salient issues of bilateral and multilateral agenda, as well as prospects of the Kazakhstan-American cooperation.  I am glad to note that cooperation with the United States is developing in the spirit of an enhanced strategic partnership.  This is confirmed by the revival of political dialogue, trade, economic, and investment cooperation.\nMutual trade turnover between Kazakhstan and the United States exceeded 3 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, and this figure is 37.2 percent higher compared to the results of the previous year.  Export is growing because the U.S. is one of the largest investors in Kazakhstan\u2019s economy since 1993.  The total inflow of foreign direct investments from the U.S. to Kazakhstan exceeded 62 billion U.S. dollars, and in the first three quarters of 2022 the volume of American investments increased by 58.8 percent compared to the corresponding period of 2021.  About 590 enterprises with the participation of the American capital function are present in Kazakhstan, and more U.S. companies are showing they\u2019re interested in the Kazakh market.\nWe have just finished the C5+1 ministerial meeting of the foreign ministers of the Central Asian countries and the U.S., and the participation of my colleagues from the Central Asian states clearly shows our joint political efforts to strengthen regional ties in a complex international situation.  Kazakhstan highly appreciates the commitment of the United States to strengthen cooperation with the Central Asian region.  Our country continues a balanced multilateral foreign policy, in accordance with its diplomatic priorities and Central Asia, and the United States remain our major partners.\nFor us, as the host country, this makes the C5+1 format a \u2013 relevant to mechanism of regional cooperation.  The C5+1 mechanism has established itself as an effective regional diplomatic platform for promoting economic cooperation, security, as well as sustainable development in Central Asia.  During the event, a wide range of issues were discussed, including cooperation on food security, combating terrorism, energy, environment, as well as other pressing issues.\nReturning to the topic of bilateral cooperation, I would like to note that the Secretary of State firmly supports the political and economic reforms initiated by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev aimed at ensuring the democratization and the rule of law.  I would like to thank the American side for its intent to further consolidate our bilateral relations.\nThank you for your attention.\nMODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) Thank you very much.  We\u2019d like to give the floor to the State Secretary of the U.S., Antony Blinken.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you very much.  Mukhtar, thank you.  Thank you for today.  Thank you for \u2013 as you very aptly described today, a very good day both bilaterally as well as with our C5+1 colleagues.  And it\u2019s always good to be with you, and it\u2019s particularly good to be here in Kazakhstan.  When we hosted your delegation in Washington last May, well, the weather was just a little bit milder than it is today.  But I think it\u2019s fair to say that the temperature outside is more than made up for by the warmth that you and President Tokayev have shown us on this trip.  And I especially want to thank the president for his terrific hospitality, for the generosity of his time, and for the very good conversation that we had.\nI\u2019m here to underscore that the strong partnership, and in particular the enhanced strategic partnership between the United States and Kazakhstan, is moving forward strongly.  Ever since being the first nation to recognize Kazakhstan in December of 1991, the United States has been firmly committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of Kazakhstan \u2013 and countries across the region.  In our discussions today, I reaffirmed the United States\u2019 unwavering support for Kazakhstan, like all nations, to freely determine its future, especially as we mark one year since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a failed attempt to deny its people that very freedom.\nWe applaud Kazakhstan for continuing to host more than 200,000 Russian citizens who fled their country after President Putin launched his war.  And I want to thank the people of Kazakhstan for generously providing food, clothing, medicine, other humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, including setting up those yurts of invincibility in Kyiv and Bucha, where Ukrainians can find warmth and respite from the war.\nI also reiterated that the United States strongly endorses the reform agenda that President Tokayev announced last March.  We look forward to seeing the additional concrete steps Kazakhstan will take to realize that agenda, expanding public participation in the political process, increasing government accountability, curbing corruption, introducing presidential term limits, protecting human rights.  Those reforms are an important reason why foreign investors, including from the United States, are increasingly turning to Kazakhstan.  American businesses were among the first to invest here, injecting more than $50 billion into the Kazakh economy going back to 1991.\nWe are eager to bolster our economic cooperation, not only to strengthen the development and opportunity within Kazakhstan but also to strengthen linkages across Central Asia, promoting the diversification of energy and export, among other investments that will benefit Kazakhstan\u2019s people in very tangible ways.  Kazakhstan also continues to be a valued partner on key global issues: reducing the spread of nuclear weapons by dismantling Soviet-era missiles; contributing to vital peacekeeping operations from Lebanon to Mali; exploring the galaxy through space cooperation; repatriating and rehabilitating more than 600 foreign terrorist fighters and their families.\nWe\u2019re grateful to Kazakhstan for its leadership in Central Asia and for hosting the C5+1 Ministerial today \u2013 this is the fourth one that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to participate in as Secretary \u2013 demonstrating our commitment to be a reliable partner to all countries in the region.  We discussed with our fellow ministers from Kazakhstan, from Kyrgyzstan, from Tajikistan, from Turkmenistan, from Uzbekistan concrete ways to continue to advance our shared economic, energy, environmental, and security goals.  The C5+1 is an increasingly important platform.  Central Asian governments are strongest when they work together to address common challenges and to shape their own future.  The United States aspires to be steadfast partners in those efforts.\nWe\u2019re working to do our part to try deliver solutions to the shared challenges that are affecting our people, from developing clean energy to contributing \u2013 excuse me \u2013 to combatting diseases like COVID, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis.  Back in September, with food and gas prices surging due to Russia\u2019s war of aggression in Ukraine, the U.S. committed $16.5 billion toward food and security here in this region.  We also set up the Economic Resilience Initiative for Central Asia \u2013 $25 million to expand regional trade routes, establish new export markets, attract and leverage greater private sector investment, providing people with practical skills for the modern job market.\nToday, I\u2019m announcing an additional $25 million for that initiative, a total of $50 million to build up the regional economy, and especially to make sure that people have the skills they need to succeed in this global economy.  To further empower and connect the people of Central Asia, we\u2019re launching an effort to increase English language proficiency for more than 1,000 young professionals in government and across civil society.\nSo we\u2019ve had a very productive day of conversations and new initiatives that we hope will build on those discussions to the benefit of our partners in Central Asia.  We sat around the table behind you with our colleagues from the C5+1, and I have a notebook filled with very good, concrete ideas about how we can further deepen our collaboration and address, in practical ways, the challenges that we\u2019re facing.\nI mentioned space exploration a few moments ago, so let me just close by noting that seven astronauts are currently orbiting above us in the International Space Station.  They hail from different countries, they speak different languages, but many of these astronauts journeyed to the stars together from Kazakhstan, and they will land here in Kazakhstan when they return to earth.  To me, that\u2019s a wonderful symbol of how this country can be a launching pad for our collective progress on earth, through the partnership between the United States and Kazakhstan, across Central Asia, around the globe.  Thank you.\nMODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) Thank you very much, dear colleagues.  Now it\u2019s high time for you to pose your questions.  Please raise your hands, introduce yourselves, and name a person that you would like to address your question to.  Please.\nQUESTION:  (Via interpreter) Good evening.  My name is Zhanna Alpysbayeva.  I am from Atameken Business Channel.  I have the following question:  The West declared about the need related to bypassing the sanctions.  In your opinion, what\u2019s the importance of secondary sovereign sanctions for Kazakhstan, and in which case those sanctions can be imposed here as well?   Because \u2013 because of these sanctions imposed on Russia, the economies of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan are suffering as well.  What are the compensations for our countries?\nMODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) Whom you are addressing your question to?\nQUESTION:  (Via interpreter) To the Secretary of State.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you very much.  First, let me start by saying this:  The sanctions that dozens of countries around the world are imposing on Russia, as well as the export controls, didn\u2019t just materialize out of thin air.  Countries came together to impose them because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, its aggression against not only Ukraine but against the very principles at the heart of the international system and the United Nations Charter: territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty \u2013 principles that matter deeply to countries in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan.\nAnd so in response to what Russia did, countries around the world, including the United States have been supporting Ukraine in its efforts to defend itself against the Russian aggression, but also to try to put what pressure we can on Russia, to impose costs on Russia so that it stops the aggression, pulls its troops out, and restores Ukraine\u2019s full sovereignty.  That\u2019s what this is about.  So it\u2019s important to put it in that context.\nWe are watching compliance with sanctions very closely, and we\u2019re having an ongoing discussion with a number of countries, including our C5 partners, on the economic spillover effect, because we\u2019re very conscious that this Russian aggression has had real consequences \u2013 not just for Ukraine and not only for the principles I mentioned, but in very concrete ways for countries around the world, including here in Central Asia.  We\u2019re issuing licenses that make sense, we\u2019re sharing information with our partners, and we\u2019re supporting the C5 countries in their efforts to diversify their own trade relationships.\nSo for example, licenses have been granted for companies or entities in countries that are engaged with sanctioned Russian companies so that they have time to wind down those activities and cut their ties with Russia.  It\u2019s not like flipping a light switch.  We understand that sometimes you need time to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t harm your business.  We\u2019ll do our part to strengthen the region and improve the lives of people living in Central Asia, ourselves in concrete ways \u2013 I mentioned a few of them with some of the initiatives that we\u2019ve engaged in.  As I said, I announced $25 million through the Economic Resilience Initiative for Central Asia, expanding regional trade routes, so that gives new opportunities, new places for countries to engage and to trade, new export markets so that they\u2019re not reliant just on one country, and then attracting private sector investment.  And today, as I mentioned, I\u2019m announcing an additional $25 million to that effort, bringing the total to $50 million.\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying we\u2019re very conscious of the spillover consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression.  We\u2019re doing everything we can to minimize them, to mitigate them, and create new opportunities, different opportunities for partners here in Central Asia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:  (Via interpreter) If you don\u2019t mind, I would like to add and say that the Government of Kazakhstan and the leadership of the United States established the mechanism of regular consultations on this matter in order to avoid the negative consequences for the economy of Kazakhstan and in order to prevent a possible secondary sanctions.  We have national coordinators appointed on both sides, and they are in touch with each other, and we are really thankful to the American side for informing us about possible cases of the imposition of secondary sanctions as early as possible.\nTherefore, I would like to say that for the time being, there is no single Kazakh company or there is not a single Kazakh sector that has been imposed secondary sanctions.  Thank you.\nMODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) Thank you very much.  Who wants to pose our next question?\nQUESTION:  Thank you so much.  Vivian Salama from The Wall Street Journal.  Thank you so much, Foreign Minister, for having us.  You actually just answered my first question, so I\u2019m going to mix it up a little bit.  Are you concerned at all about how deeply entrenched your economy is with Russia, that it would take too long for, say, new allies, new partners like the U.S. and Europe to be able to sort of fill that void moving forward?\nAnd Mr. Secretary, you also just answered my first question, but I do have a second one for you regarding the potential Chinese lethal aid assistance to Russia.  There have been a number of public statements from you and your \u2013 a number of members of President Biden\u2019s cabinet expressing concern about China\u2019s deliberations.  Can you elaborate a bit on what the U.S. and its allies are doing to persuade Beijing away from such a move, and what consequences it could face if it delivers on any such aid?  Thank you.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:  Yes.  I\u2019d like to say that indeed Kazakhstan has very historic ties with both \u2013 with Russia and Ukraine.  Our economies interconnected for long, long time, and that\u2019s why definitely all this situation is quite heavy for us, for our economy, and we trying to avoid any negative effects from the sanctions.  You can understand that Kazakhstan is a member of Eurasian Economic Union, and we don\u2019t have any custom borders between Kazakhstan, Russia, and other members of this union.  So that\u2019s why definitely it\u2019s sometimes very difficult to manage how we can provide this free trade by products and services between our borders.  But at the same time, we trying to evade any possibilities \u2013 to avoid any possibilities for evasion of sanctions by Russian or even by any foreign companies.  Thank you.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Vivian, as you know, this is something that I raised directly with China\u2019s senior foreign policy official, Wang Yi, when I saw him on the margins of the Munich Security Conference last week.  And the backdrop here, of course, goes back to even before Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.  Just a few weeks before that, you\u2019ll remember that President Xi and President Putin had a summit meeting in which they talked about a partnership with no limits.  And that, of course, in the context of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was a real concern, including the concern that such a partnership might lead China to materially support Russia in its aggression, including with lethal military support and/or with efforts to systematically evade the sanctions that were being imposed on Russia for the aggression against Ukraine.\nAnd as I\u2019ve mentioned going back to, I think, the first conversation between President Biden and President Xi after the Russian aggression, President Biden raised this concern and made very clear to President Xi that were Russia to engage in lethal material support for Russia in the aggression against Ukraine or the systematic evasion of sanctions, this would be a serious problem in our relationship.\nSo we\u2019ve been watching it very carefully from day one.  And the reason that I raised this not only with Wang Yi last week but also publicly, along with other colleagues in the administration, is because of concern we have based on information that we have that China is considering moving beyond the nonlethal support that some of its companies have been providing to actually lethal material support for Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine.\nAnd what I can share with you is that we did very clearly warn China about the implications and consequences of going through with providing such support.  We will not hesitate, for example, to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions or otherwise engage in supporting the Russian war effort.\nBeyond that, what I heard very clearly from countries around the world that I\u2019ve been engaged with over the past 10 days, since these concerns have first been raised and shared with many countries, is that this is not only something that would be a serious problem for China and its relationship with us, but a serious problem with its relationship with countries around the world.\nAnd let me just add this:  China can\u2019t have it both ways when it comes to the Russian aggression in Ukraine.  It can\u2019t be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand while actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has started with the other hand.\nSo I hope that China will take what we said very seriously \u2013 but not only what we said, what many other countries around the world are saying \u2013 and refrain from any further consideration of materially supporting Russia in the war effort.\nMODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) Thank you very much.  Next question.\nQUESTION:  (Via interpreter) My name is Yerbolatov.  I have a question to be posed to the Secretary of State.  So you said \u2013 you know that we are celebrating the one year anniversary of the war of Russia against Ukraine.  And if we take into account the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation, is there a threat to peace and security in Central Asia in this regard, taking into account the aggression of Russia against Ukraine?\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  The concern that we have is not simply the aggression against Ukraine itself and the horrific things that are being done to its people, but, as I said before, the assault on the very principles that are at the heart of the international system, the heart of the United Nations Charter, that we believe are necessary to keep peace, security, stability around the world, including here \u2013 the principles of territorial integrity, of sovereignty, of independence.\nAnd a big part of the reason why it was so important for countries to stand up against the Russian aggression is not only to help Ukraine defend itself but also to defend those principles.  Because if we allow them to be violated with impunity, then that does open up the prospect that Russia itself will continue \u2013 will consider further aggression against other countries if it sets its sight on them, or other countries will learn the wrong lesson and would-be aggressors in every part of the world will say, \u201cWell, if Russia can get away with this, then we can too.\u201d  And that\u2019s a recipe for a world of conflict, a world of instability, a world that I don\u2019t think any of us want to live in.\nSo that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so important for so many countries to stand up and say, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t accept this.\u201d  I can\u2019t speak to any specific ideas, plans that Russia may have anywhere else.  I think its focus is very much on Ukraine.  But I can say that had we failed to stand up in support of the principles that Russia was violating by invading Ukraine, that would have created I think a greater prospect that Russian aggression would point in other directions.\nMODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) Thank you very much.  Due to the lack of time, we have one final question.\nQUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  I was going to ask a question that was quite similar to my colleague\u2019s, if I \u2013 Mr. Secretary, if I could ask little bit more, the idea that you had of \u2013 you said repeatedly here that territorial integrity, independent sovereignty of all the Central Asian nations.  Do you see that being at risk at all?  I know you just mentioned that you don\u2019t see anything specific from Russia, but what are the types of the things that the U.S. could provide, or the security guarantees, if you want to put it that way, diplomatic support?  What can the U.S. do to ensure that those values are held?\nAnd if I could ask the foreign minister a bit of the same thing.  You mentioned historic ties both with Russia and Ukraine.  To what extent do you feel any threat, any risk from what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, not just on the economic front but also the security front?  Thanks very much.\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Shaun, thank you very much.  One of the things that we\u2019re working on in very practical ways is to demonstrate that the United States is a steadfast partner for countries in Central Asia.  Our support for their independence, for their sovereignty, for their territorial integrity is real, but it\u2019s particularly manifested in two ways.  One, it\u2019s manifested in helping them in different ways develop the strongest possible capacities for their own security, their growing economic prosperity, and the strength and resilience of their societies.  That\u2019s the best way to make sure that going forward these countries can determine their own futures consistent with those principles.  And we\u2019re doing that on a bilateral basis, and we\u2019re doing that, as you mentioned, in the C5+1.\nOne of the things that we\u2019ve seen in Ukraine is that its own resilience to the Russian aggression of course starts with the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people, the extraordinary efforts of its military.  But I think it goes beyond that.  I think what we\u2019re seeing as well is a resilient society that\u2019s resilient also because it has stronger and stronger institutions, not only within government \u2013 those are usually important \u2013 but also beyond it, including a vibrant free press, including a strong civil society.  Each of those things is part of Ukraine\u2019s success story in dealing with Russia\u2019s aggression and in creating a country that\u2019s resilient to the aggression, that can deal with it, and that will bounce back from it.\nAnd so it\u2019s a long way of saying that our partnerships here, the work we\u2019re doing here is also to help our friends in Central Asia build these kinds of strong, resilient societies with strong institutions, with ever greater capacity for their people, with more and more investment coming in from the United States and from other countries, with greater connections among them because these governments ultimately are going to be even stronger when they\u2019re working together to meet common challenges.  And I think that creates the kind of region where their ability to uphold their own territorial integrity, their own sovereignty, their own independence will be that much stronger.\nFOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:  Yes.  I just mention that definitely Kazakhstan doesn\u2019t allow to use its territory for evasion sanctions, but it doesn\u2019t mean that for today we have or feel any threats or risks from Russian Federation.\nAs I answered to the first question, Kazakhstan is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, Collective Security Treaty Organization, Commonwealth of Independent States, with other states and countries surrounding Russia.  So our relationship we consider as an alliance in the framework of all these multilateral structures.\nAnd for bilateral cooperation, relationship, we have solid legal base that \u2013 which is more important that we have the completed delimitation process, the state border between Kazakhstan and Russia, and as you know is the longest land border in the world.  It\u2019s over \u2013 more than 7,500 kilometers.  Now we are in the process of demarcation.  It\u2019s almost 70 percent of this border completed.  We have regular consultations between the government and federal states on the different issues.  And as you know, Kazakhstan will continue its multi-vector foreign policy.  It means that we are trying to keep the system of the check and balances and to develop the mutually beneficial cooperation, relationship with all the countries of the world.   Thank you.\nMODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) Dear colleagues, our press conference is over. Thank you for your attention.",

		"audience": "UNITED NATIONS",
		"location": "NEW YORK, N.Y.",
		"date": "FEBRUARY 24, 2023",
		"content": "Play Video\nSECRETARY BLINKEN:  Mr.  President, Mr.  Secretary-General, fellow council members:\nOne year and one week ago \u2013 on February 17th, 2022 \u2013 I warned this council that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine.\nI said that Russia would manufacture a pretext, and then use missiles, tanks, soldiers, cyber attacks to strike pre-identified targets, including Kyiv, with the aim of toppling Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government.\nRussia\u2019s representative \u2013 the same representative who will speak today \u2013 called these, and I quote, \u201cgroundless accusations.\u201d\nSeven days later, on February 24th, 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\nDue to fierce resistance by Ukraine\u2019s defenders, President Putin failed in his primary objective to conquer Ukraine, end its existence as an independent country, and absorb it into Russia.\nThen, he dusted off his Crimea playbook from 2014: He called snap referenda in four occupied parts of Ukraine, deported Ukrainians, bussed in Russians, held sham votes at gunpoint, and then manipulated the results to claim near unanimous support for joining the Russian Federation.\nWhen President Putin couldn\u2019t break the Ukrainian military, he intensified efforts to break Ukrainians\u2019 spirit.  Over the last year, Russia has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian men, women, and children; uprooted more than 13 million people from their homes; destroyed more than half of the country\u2019s energy grid; bombed more than 700 hospitals, 2,600 schools; and abducted at least 6,000 Ukrainian children \u2013 some as young as four months old \u2013 and relocated them to Russia.\nAnd yet, the spirit of the Ukrainians remains unbroken; if anything, it\u2019s stronger than ever.\nWhen Ukraine launched a counteroffensive that retook large swaths of its territory, President Putin conscripted an additional 300,000 men \u2013 throwing more and more of Russia\u2019s young people into a meat grinder of his own making.  And he unleashed the Wagner Group \u2013 mercenaries who have committed atrocities from Africa to the Middle East, and now, in Ukraine.\nOf course, that\u2019s not the whole story of the last year.\nThere is also the story of Ukraine\u2019s people.  Vastly outnumbered, they have fought bravely to defend their nation, their freedom, the right to determine their own future.  And they\u2019ve demonstrated inspiring unity in helping one another endure Moscow\u2019s relentless assault.\nTeachers and community members give classes in bunkers to children.  City workers improvise patches to restore heat and power and water to residents.  Neighbors set up soup kitchens to feed the hungry.\nThere\u2019s also the story of how the international community has come together.\nThe vast majority of member-states have voted multiple times to condemn Russia\u2019s violations of the UN Charter and reject its illegal attempt to seize Ukrainian territory.  Yesterday, 141 countries voted in the General Assembly for a resolution that reaffirms the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, denounces Russia\u2019s atrocities, expresses support for a just and comprehensive peace, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nWhen President Putin tried to weaponize hunger \u2013 exploiting the worst global food crisis since the creation of the UN \u2013 the international community responded swiftly.\nSince the United States chaired a Food Security meeting last May, more than 100 countries have signed onto a set of concrete commitments to alleviate hunger.  Thanks in large part to the Secretary-General Guterres and T\u00fcrkiye, the Black Sea Grain Initiative loosened Russia\u2019s stranglehold on Ukraine\u2019s ports and brought down the cost of grain for the world.  Now, as Moscow again tries to throttle its output, we have to ensure that that initiative is extended and expanded.\nWhen President Putin tried to weaponize energy, we redirected natural gas supplies from across the world, so that countries Russia targeted could keep their people warm in the winter.  And Europe took extraordinary steps to end its dependence on Russian energy.\nNo country has endured greater hardship from Russia\u2019s war than Ukraine, but almost every country has felt the pain.  And yet, nations around the world continue to stand with Ukraine.  Because we all recognize that if we abandon Ukraine, we abandon the UN Charter itself, and the principles and rules that make all countries safer and more secure.\nNo seizing land by force.\nNo erasing another country\u2019s borders.\nNo targeting civilians in war.\nNo wars of aggression.\nIf we do not defend these basic principles, we invite a world in which might makes right, the strong dominate the weak.  That\u2019s the world this body was created to end.  And members of this council have a unique responsibility to make sure that we do not return to it.  We can do that in three ways.\nFirst, we must push for a just and durable peace.\nNow I expect that many countries will call for peace today.\nNo one wants peace more than the Ukrainian people.  And the United States has long made clear \u2013 even before this war \u2013 that we\u2019re prepared to engage in any meaningful diplomatic effort to stop Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nBut history teaches us that it\u2019s the nature of peace that matters.\nFor peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence.\nFor peace to be durable, it must ensure that Russia can\u2019t simply rest, rearm, and relaunch the war in a few months or a few years.\nAny peace that legitimizes Russia\u2019s seizure of land by force will weaken the charter and send a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they can invade countries and get away with it.\nPresident Zelenskyy has put forward a ten-point plan for a just and durable peace.  President Putin, by contrast, has made clear that there is nothing to talk about until Ukraine accepts, and I quote, \u201cthe new territorial realities,\u201d while doubling down on his brutal tactics.\nMembers of this council have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that any peace is just and durable.\nCouncil members should not be fooled by calls for a temporary or unconditional ceasefire.  Russia will use any pause in fighting to consolidate control over the territory it\u2019s illegally seized and replenish its forces for further attacks.  That\u2019s what happened when Russia\u2019s first assault on Ukraine froze in 2015.  Look at what followed.\nAnd members of this council should not fall into the false equivalency of calling on both sides to stop fighting, or calling on other nations to stop supporting Ukraine in the name of peace.\nNo member of this council should call for peace while supporting Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and on the UN Charter.\nIn this war, there is an aggressor and there is a victim.\nRussia fights for conquest.  Ukraine fights for its freedom.\nIf Russia stops fighting and leaves Ukraine, the war ends.  If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.\nThe fact remains:  One man \u2013 Vladimir Putin \u2013 started this war; one man can end it.\nSecond, even as we work to end Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, members of this council must continue to address other challenges to international peace and security.\nWe hear the concerns of countries who worry that standing with Ukraine and holding Russia accountable is diverting focus and resources from others in need.\nTo those countries, I would say, simply, look at our actions.\nAnd when you hear Russia and its defenders accuse the countries who support Ukraine of ignoring the rest of the world \u2013 I say look at Moscow\u2019s actions.\nCompare the numbers.  In addition to the $13.5 billion in food aid that the United States contributed to fight hunger over the last year, we also fund more than 40 percent of the World Food Program\u2019s budget.  Russia contributes less than 1 percent of that budget.\nThat\u2019s not an outlier.  Based on the latest UN figures, the United States donates over nine times as much as Russia to UN peacekeeping.  We donate 390 times as much as Russia to UNICEF.  We give nearly a thousand times as much as Russia to the UN Refugee Agency.\nThird, we must reaffirm our commitment to upholding what the UN Charter calls, and I quote, \u201cthe dignity and worth of the human person.\u201d\nWe must continue to compile evidence of Russia\u2019s ongoing and widespread atrocities, including executions; torture; rape and sexual violence; the deportation of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to Russia.\nWe must continue to document Russia\u2019s war crimes and crimes against humanity, and share this evidence with investigators and prosecutors, so that one day, the perpetrators can be held accountable.\nDay after day of Russia\u2019s atrocities, it\u2019s easy to become numb to the horror, to lose our ability to feel shock and outrage.  But we can never let the crimes Russia is committing become our new normal.\nBucha is not normal.  Mariupol is not normal.  Irpin is not normal.  Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal.  Stealing Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to people in Russia is not normal.\nWe must not let President Putin\u2019s callous indifference to human life become our own.\nWe must force ourselves to remember that behind every atrocity in this wretched war, in conflicts around the world, is a human being.\nI recently visited an exhibit of artwork made by Ukrainian children affected by the war.\nOne painting I saw was made by a ten-year-old girl named Veronika.  Last April, Russian forces shelled her home in Vuhledar, killing her whole family.  When first responders dug her from the rubble, a piece of shrapnel was lodged in her skull.  Her left thumb had been ripped off.  Doctors saved her life, but the attack left her right hand mostly paralyzed, and she can\u2019t see out of her left eye.\nIn her painting, Veronika drew herself in a bright pink and orange dress, holding a bouquet of flowers.  A building stands next to her.  When asked who lived there, she said it was a place where all the people she knew who had been killed in the war could be safe.\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u2026\u201d That\u2019s how the UN Charter begins.\nFellow members of this council:  Now is the time to meet that promise.  There are so many people in Ukraine who want the same thing as that little girl, Veronika: a world where they can live in peace, in their own country, and keep the people they love safe.\nWe have the power, we have the responsibility to create that world, today and for generations to come.  We cannot \u2013 we will not \u2013 let one country destroy it.\nThank you.",
